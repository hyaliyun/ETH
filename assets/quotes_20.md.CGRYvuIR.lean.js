Certain expediencies were taken within the existing structure of the Federal government, such as conscription and other violations of civil liberties, and the internment and later dispersal of Japanese- Americans. Still, elections were held as scheduled in 1944. Overview The United States entered World War II with the Administration that had been at the helm of the nation since 1932, that of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This administration had been preparing for war for a while by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. President of the United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace won the election of 1940, and were at the helm of the nation as it prepared for and entered World War II. Roosevelt sought and won an unprecedented fourth term in office in 1944, but this time with Harry S. Truman as his Vice President. Roosevelt, who had been a victim of polio early in life, died in April 1945, and Truman assumed the Presidency through the end of the war.

He was educated in Iceland, Denmark and England before studying commercial art in Copenhagen. In 1947, while living in Copenhagen, Albertson listened by chance to a Bessie Smith recording on radio; it led to an abiding interest in jazz and blues music. \\"We found magic in such names as Kid Ory, King Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey\\", he wrote on his Stomp Off blog in 2010. On his home tape machine, Albertson recorded visiting British New Orleans revivalists Ken Colyer, Chris Barber and Lonnie Donegan in 1953.

Macquarie Fields is located 38 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. Macquarie Fields is surrounded by bushland. Nearby Macquarie Links, is a high-security housing estate beside an international standard golf course. The suburb has multiple high schools including Macquarie Fields High School and James Meehan High School. History The original inhabitants of the Macquarie Fields area were the Darug people of western Sydney.Kohen, J: The Darug and their neighbors, page 9-22. The rich soil of the area was home to an abundance of plants which in turn attracted animals such as kangaroos and emus, both of which along with yams and other native vegetables and fruit were part of the diet of the Darug.Kohen, J: The Darug and their neighbors, page 23-30. They lived in small huts called gunyahs, made spears, tomahawks and boomerangs for hunting and had an elaborate system of tribal law and rituals with its origins in the Dreamtime.Kohen, J: The Darug and their neighbors, page 23-46. However, following the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, they were pushed off their land by the British settlers.Kohen, J: The Darug and their neighbors, page 47-67. Macquarie Fields was named by early landholder James Meehan in honour of the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie. The area was surveyed by Meehan in the early 19th century. Although transported to Australia as a convict for his role in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Meehan had trained as a surveyor in Ireland and in 1803 was appointed an assistant to NSW Surveyor- General Charles Grimes. In 1806 he was granted a full pardon and in 1810 became Surveyor-General. For his work, he was granted a number of parcels of land including in what is now Macquarie Fields and neighboring suburbs. He used the rich soil to grow cereal crops, fruit trees and to graze livestock. The property changed hands a couple of times after Meehan's death and in the 1840s, Samuel Terry built a Regency mansion, Macquarie Fields House, which still stands to this day. It is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/21 In 1883, then owner William Phillips subdivided the land to create a new town he called Glenwood Estate with grand boulevards and fine buildings. A railway station was added to the line in 1888 but the depression of the 1890s meant the grand town failed to materialize with only a few small houses built on the lots. In the next Great Depression of the 1930s, the area became popular with the homeless who made makeshift huts, not unlike those of the earlier Darug people. After World War II, the village grew steadily. A public school was opened in 1958 and by 1971, the population reached 3700. In the mid-1970s, a large Housing Commission development was built on the east side of town and given the suburb names of Bunbury (later Guise) and Curran after the local creek. Residents of the privately owned areas of Macquarie Fields were strongly opposed to the new developments being included in their suburb and this continued well into the 1980s. Since that time, local authorities have tried to blend the area into a single suburb. Private housing developments sprung up further around and the weight of population contributed to a larger town centre.  Heritage listings  Macquarie Fields has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Quarter Sessions Road: Macquarie Field House Population According to the 2016 census of Population, 13,714 people live in Macquarie Fields . * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.1% of the population. * 53.6% of people were born in Australia.

This album is the first without cofounding member Peter Cetera. This is also the first album to feature Jason Scheff on bass guitar and vocals. With Cetera having quit the band in 1985 in favor of a solo career, Chicago eventually hired Jason Scheff to fill Cetera's position as vocalist and bassist. The most used voices in Chicago now belonged to its two newest recruits, Scheff and Bill Champlin, who had joined the band in 1981. Chicago again hired producer David Foster to create a soft rock followup to Chicago 17. The band recorded an updated high-tech remake of their hit classic \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" (#48). Scheff recalled how when he asked Foster how he should sing the song, Foster responded \\"just like Cetera.\\" Then, \\"Will You Still Love Me?\\" (#3) and \\"If She Would Have Been Faithful...\\" (#17) became hits. Scheff is lead vocalist on all three releases. The album features a brief instrumental horn riff, Pankow's \\"Free Flight.\\" Chicago 18 ultimately went gold, peaking at #35.

Produced by Pratt & Whitney, it is a two- row, 14-cylinder, air-cooled radial design with seven cylinders on a row. It displaces and its bore and stroke are both 5.5 in (140 mm). A total of 173,618 R-1830 engines were built, and from their use in two of the most-produced aircraft ever built, the four-engined B-24 heavy bomber and twin-engined DC-3 transport, more Twin Wasps may have been built than any other aviation piston engine in history. A \\"bored-out\\" version (to a 5.75 inch/146 mm cylinder bore) with a slightly higher power rating and other slight changes in detail design was produced as the R-2000. Mostly retired today, it is still used on Douglas DC-3 and various museum aircraft and warbirds seen at airshows.

The show was hosted by Jimmy O'Neill, a disc jockey in Los Angeles at the timeShindig!, Rod Barken from tvparty.com who also created the show along with his wife Sharon Sheeley, British producer Jack Good, and production executive Art Stolnitz. The original pilot was rejected by ABC and David Sontag, then Executive Producer of ABC, redeveloped and completely redesigned the show. A new pilot with a new cast of artists was shot starring Sam Cooke. That pilot aired as the premiere episode. Synopsis Shindig! was conceived as a short-notice replacement for Hootenanny, a series that had specialized in folk revival music. The folk revival had fizzled in 1964 as the result of the British Invasion, which damaged the ratings for Hootenanny and prompted that show's cancellation. Shindig! focused on a broader variety of popular music than its predecessor and first aired for a half-hour every Wednesday evening, but was expanded to an hour in January 1965. In the fall of 1965, the show split into two half- hour telecasts, on Thursday and Saturday nights. Shindig!'s premiere episode was actually the second pilot, and featured Sam Cooke, The Everly Brothers and The Righteous Brothers. Later shows were taped in Britain with The Beatles as the guests. The series featured other \\"British invasion\\" bands and performers including The Who, The Rolling Stones and Cilla Black. Shindig! continued to broadcast episodes from London throughout its run. Many popular performers of the day played on Shindig! including Tina Turner, Lesley Gore, Bo Diddley,Pioneer of a Beat Is Still Riffing for His Due, a February 2003 article from The New York Times and Sonny and Cher, The Beach Boys, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, The Supremes and The Ronettes. Shindig!'s success prompted NBC to air the similar series Hullabaloo starting in January 1965 and other producers to launch syndicated rock music shows like Shivaree and Hollywood A Go-Go. In March 1965, Little Eva performed a live but short version of her hit song \\"The Loco-Motion\\". This is the only known video clip of her singing it. Toward the end of the program's run, The Mamas and the Papas appeared in an episode featuring Barry McGuire. Although serving as his backup singers, the group introduced \\"California Dreamin'\\" on that program, which launched the group's career. Shindig! is one of the few rock music shows of the era to still have all of the episodes available to watch. Final season In September 1965, the show was moved out of its Wednesday-night time slot (where it gave The Beverly Hillbillies its first serious competition in its time period among younger viewers), and split into two half-hours on new days and times (Thursdays and Saturdays at 7:30 P.M. Eastern time). The show faced tough competition from Daniel Boone and The Munsters on Thursdays along with Flipper and The Jackie Gleason Show on Saturdays. Additionally, the Saturday edition aired in a time period when many of its potential viewers were going out and, thus, not at home to watch television. By October 1965, the show was having ratings problems (Time magazine said \\"early-season tide [was] running against the teen scene\\"), and in January 1966, Shindig! was cancelled and replaced in its Thursday time slots by Batman. Series regulars Shindig! also featured a dance troupe choreographed by David Winters and Andr√© Tayir, who accompanied the music acts of the week (Winters later worked on the competing NBC show Hullabaloo). One of the regular dancers was Teri Garr, who went on to find success as an actress. Others included Maria Gahva, Lorene Yarnell (later of the mime team Shields and Yarnell) Diane Stuart, Pam Freeman, Gina Trikinis, Marianna Picora, Virginia Justus, Rini Jarmon and Carol Shelyne, who always wore glasses while she danced. Occasionally, a small group of dancers who sang would get a featured spot; this rotating group was billed as The Shindig Girls. The assistant choreographer was Antonia Basilotta, better known as Toni Basil, who later gained fame with her 1980s hit song \\"Mickey.\\" Both Garr and Basil were dance students of David Winters at the time and worked with him on most of his choreography projects. The series house band was supposedly known as \\"The Shin-diggers\\", but that was actually the name host Jimmy O'Neill used to refer to fans of the show. At first, TV credits identified the musicians simply as the Shindig Band. By early 1965, they'd been renamed Sir Rufus Marion Banks and his Band of Men, but the generic name had returned by the time \\"Shindig\\" went off the air. The rhythm section was spun off into a featured group and named the Shindogs. It included Joey Cooper on bass, Chuck Blackwell on drums, James Burton on lead guitar, Delaney Bramlett on rhythm guitar and Glen D. Hardin on keyboards. Cooper and Bramlett traded off lead vocal duties. The larger band featured Jerry Cole on lead guitar, Russ Titelman on rhythm guitar, Larry Knechtel on bass, Leon Russell on piano, Julius Wechter on percussion and Ritchie Frost on drums. Later, Billy Preston took over keyboards and performed as a singing regular. Glen Campbell was not a regular member of this band but a frequent guest performer. Ray Pohlman was the musical director, and he was also one - as was Campbell, Knechtel, Wechter and Russell - of the collection of first-call pop studio musicians that would later be known as \\"The Wrecking Crew.\\" In some instances when one of the guitarists was unable to work, Pohlman would bring in Bill Aken to fill in. The Righteous Brothers, Dick and Dee Dee, Jackie and Gayle, Donna Loren, Willy Nelson (not the famous Country singer) and Bobby Sherman were regular vocalists on the series. Up until July 1965 when he quit the show, producer Jack Good was also a regular, wearing a bowler hat and improvising comedy routines with Jimmy O'Neill at the close of each episode. The Blossoms, an all-female vocal group featuring Darlene Love, backed up many of the performers and were occasionally featured in spotlight performances. The Wellingtons were a trio of male singers who performed on their own, and as backup singers. Another male group, The Eligibles, sometimes alternated with The Wellingtons on backup.

Pazhassi Raja (3 January 1753 ‚Äì 30 November 1805) was born as Kerala Varma and was also known as Cotiote Rajah and Pychy Rajah. He was a warrior Hindu prince and de facto head of the kingdom of Kottayam, otherwise known as Cotiote, in Malabar, India, between 1774 and 1805. His struggles with the British East India Company is known as the Cotiote War. He is popularly known as Kerala Simham (Lion of Kerala) on account of his martial exploits. Pazhassi Raja was a member of the western branch of the Kottayam royal clan. When Hyder Ali of the Kingdom of Mysore occupied Malabar in 1773, the Raja of Kottayam found political asylum in Travancore. Pazhassi Raja, the fourth prince in line for succession to the throne during this period, became one of the de facto heads of state, surpassing several older royal contenders. He fought a war of resistance against the Mysorean army from 1774 to 1793. On account of his refusal to flee and due to his effective resistance to Mysoreans, he gained firm support of his subjects. In 1792, after the Third Anglo-Mysore War, the East India Company imposed control in Kottayam in violation of an earlier agreement of 1790 which had recognised its independence. Vira Varma, to whom Raja was a nephew, was appointed by the East India Company authorities as the Raja of Kottayam. To meet revenue targets fixed by Company authorities, Vira Varma ordered an exorbitant tax to be collected from the peasantry and this move was met in 1793 by a mass resistance led by Pazhassi Raja, who had always been opposed to the Company's rule. In 1796, the Company made an attempt to arrest Pazhassi Raja, but he evaded capture and instead fought back using guerilla warfare. After a string of serious setbacks, the Company sued for peace in 1797. The conflict was renewed in 1800 over a dispute on Wayanad and after a five-year-long war of insurgency, Pazhassi Raja was killed on 30 November 1805 in a gun-fight at Mavila Thodu (small body of water), in the present day Kerala-Karnataka border. Kingdom Pazhassi Raja was born in the Padinjare Kovilakam (Western Branch) of Purannattu Swarupam, Peralam Village, the royal clan of the kingdom of Kottayam in North Malabar not Kottayam District in south Kerala. This branch was located at Pazhassi which lay south west of Mattannur. Kerala Varma got the name Pazhassi Raja as he was a native of Pazhassi. The early British documents wrote Pazhassi Raja as Pychy Rajah, while the name Cotiote Raja comes from the anglicizing of Kottayam to Cotiote. Kottayam covers what is today the Thalassery taluk of the Kannur District and Wayanad district, along with the Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district. As a royal clan, Purannattu Swarupam had three branches: a western branch (Padinjare Kovilakam) at Pazhassi, near Mattannur, an eastern branch (Kizhakke Kovilakam) at Manatana, near Peravoor, and a southern branch (Tekke Kovilakam) at Kottayampoil, near Koothuparamba.Wayanad ‚Äì Its People and Traditions by C. Gopalan Nair Resistance to Mysore occupation (1773‚Äì1793) Pazhassi Raja's warfare with Mysore troops can be divided into two phases based on the rulers of the kingdom of Mysore. First phase lasted from 1773 to 1782 during which time, the Mysore ruler was Hyder Ali. The second phase extended from 1784 to 1793 and during this phase he fought the troops of Tipu Sultan, son and successor of Hyder Ali. Resistance to Hyder Ali (1773‚Äì1782) In 1773, Hyder Ali marched into Malabar for the second time, for non-payment of tributes from the Rajas (kings) of Malabar as agreed after war in 1768. Most of the Rajas of Malabar, along with many Naduvazhis or vassals fled to seek political asylum in Travancore. Princes and younger noblemen who refused to flee the invasion organised resistances. The Malabari partisans made excellent use of the wooded hills that covered most of Malabar during this rebellion. In 1774, at the age of 21, Pazhassi Raja took over the throne to replace his uncle who had fled to Travancore. He vowed to resist Hyder Ali's troops, and stayed in Kottayam , where he gathered a force and began guerrilla battles against the troops of Mysore as he had neither guns nor troops enough to face them in an open battle. He set up a large number of bases in the nearly impenetrable forested mountains of Puralimala and Wynad and repeatedly inflicted severe minor losses on the Mysore army in Kottayam as well as in Wynad. Once the true Raja of Kottayam had fled, three royals rose to power in Kottayam. The nephew of the escaped Raja named Vira Varma and his nephews, Ravi Varma and Pazhassi Raja now took over the reins of government. Vira Varma was skilled in political intrigue and manipulation whereas Ravi Varma was too incompetent to play any serious political role and hence his role only was nominal. Pazhassi Raja become the most powerful figure in Kottayam, much to the chagrin of his uncle Vira Varma. Hence Vira Varma played a series of power games aiming to check the growing clout of his nephew. So the relation between Vira Varma and Pazhassi Raja was one of enmity right from the onset. The military situation was grim for Pazhassi Raja and his troops ‚Äì in 1774, Coorgs had joined hands with Hyder Ali on the promise of being gifted Wynad and a large Coorg army camped in Wynad to help Mysore troops. In 1776, Hyder Ali re- installed the Hindu Raja in Chirakkal and the latter joined Mysore war effort to crush Pazhassi Raja. This triple alliance which lasted till 1780 reached nowhere near defeating the Kottayam army. During his long war with the Mysore and then the English East India Company, Pazhassi Raja increased his sphere of influence significantly eastwards as far as the outskirts of Mysore. His men regularly looted enemy treasuries and sandalwood from southern Karnataka and his enemies could do little to check these raids. This enabled him to lay claim on a great chunk of the Mysore district ‚Äì as far as Nanjangod in the east. Also, Pazhassi Raja and his men frequently raided the domains of neighbouring Rajas in northern Malabar and Coorg to harass the enemy regiments posted there and he was often supported by local population of those territories. Along with this, he had close ties with Ravi Varma and Krishna Varma, who were princes of Calicut and popular rebel leaders of southern Malabar. Siege of Thalasseri Thalasseri or Tellicherry in the late 18th century was a harbour-fort which was held by the British East India Company as a factory. The value of Tellicherry as a naval base meant that her capture could seriously impact the British naval situation on the west coast. Also rebels in North Malabar bought arms and ammunition from the British in Tellicherry. So if Hyder could capture this fort, he could, at a stroke, cripple both the rebels in North Malabar as well as the British military power at a regional basis. So in 1778, Hyder's vassal, the Raja of Chirakkal, besieged Thalasseri and enforced an economic blockade under order from Hyder himself. The British factories at Talassery armed Pazhassi Raja's men to enable them to recover Kottayam from the Mysorean occupation army. This move by the British ensured that the Chirakkal army was now at risk of being struck in the rear by Pazhassi Raja's force. The Chirakkal troops began to retreat, but Pazhassi chased and devastated the Chirakkal army, and then marched to Kottayam where he obliterated the Mysorean occupation and overran all of western Kottayam. But at this critical moment when the Mysorean army in Malabar could have been destroyed by a joint action on the part of the British and the Rajas, the British factories at Talassery were instructed by the Governor not to upset the nominal peace with Hyder. Thus the British decision not to exploit the victory at Thalasseri was exploited by Mysore. The Chirakkal army reinforced by a Mysorean contingent under Balwant Rao marched into Kottayam. Pazhassi's men, though secretly supplied with arms and ammunition by the British, could not hold or defeat this huge host and soon the Kottayam army was forced to disperse after a fight. Then the Mysore- Chirakkal army captured Kadathanad and installed a puppet Raja who joined hands with Mysore. In 1779, a huge Mysore-Chirakkal-Kadathanad army besieged Thalasseri. Pazhassi Raja sent a force of 2000 Nairs to aid the British defence of Thalassery, and this enabled the factories to hold on successfully. By the end of 1779, Sardar Khan, the Mysorean general was sent to Thalasseri to bring the siege speedily to a successful conclusion. Sardar Khan came with a force of 10,000 troops and 30 heavy guns. Sardar Khan knew that it was Pazhassi Raja's help that enabled the British to resist him and so he opened negotiations with Pazhassi ‚Äì his offer was the restoration of Mysore occupied territories of Kottayam if Pazhassi would ally himself with Mysore and pay an immediate tribute of 500,000 rupees. It was well beyond the capacity of Kottayam to raise so huge a sum in so short a time. But Pazhassi did his best to pay Sardar Khan [probably in the hope that the latter would make concessions] and 60,000 rupees was paid to the latter. But Khan was not satisfied and rejected Pazhassi's request that his possessions in Malabar be restored. This greedy and tactless approach of Sardar Khan's made sure that there was little chance for Mysore to capture Thalasseri. The Kottayam army became far stronger with their major victory in 1779 at Kalpetta (Wynad) where the whole Coorg army of 2,000 was surrounded and decimated by Pazhassi Raja's troops. The destruction of the Coorg army in Wynad enabled Raja to throw a whole new army into the contest at Thalasseri. In 1780, Pazhassi Raja proposed a plan to the British to break the Mysorean siege of Thalassery: he and his men would strike the enemy in the rear from the east as the British came out of the fort and struck the Mysorean line in front. Both armies would effect a junction that would split the enemy into two. The Mysorean and allied troops could then be routed easily. But it was only in 1781 that the British understood the value of this plan and their Bombay authorities agreed to it. An operation was carried out as per Pazhassi's plan; it ended with the destruction of the Mysorean forces. Sardar Khan himself was killed. What followed was a rebellion in Kottayam by the Nayar militia led by Pazhassi Raja. Soon, the Mysoreans were ousted. Rebellion to remove Tipu Sultan (1784‚Äì1793) By 1782, Kottayam was once more a free land. But by the Treaty of Mangalore (1784) after the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the British recognised Tipu Sultan's sphere of authority in Malabar. Thus with its only valuable ally lost, Kottayam was ready to become a vassal state of Mysore. Once more, as Sardar Khan did in 1779, Mysore exacted an exorbitant rate of tribute. Although Ravi Varma, the elder brother of Pazhassi Raja agreed to pay 65,000 rupees per year, Mysore demanded 81,000 rupees. The hiked rate of tribute meant greater hardship for the peasantry (largely Tiyar/Izhava) who had suffered from years of foreign occupation. So Pazhassi Raja took up this issue and decided to launch a mass resistance struggle once more.Calicut University Text for paper Kerala History and Culture Distance Education MA History 2007 by Prof. SS Warrier What angered Pazhassi Raja even more was that his brother Ravi Varma who paid a visit to Tipu Sultan in 1786 for peace talks was forced to sign a treaty which ceded Wayanad to Tipu Sultan. Pazhassi Raja decided not to let Tipu enjoy Wayanad in peace and kept up a guerrilla warfare that constantly harassed Mysore troops in Wayanad and its neighbourhood. War in Wayanad lasted for seven years ‚Äì till 1793 ‚Äì when the last of the Mysorean garrisons were expelled from the soil of Wayanad. By the end of 1788, Pazhassi Raja's hatred of Tipu had shot up on account of the latter's policy of forcible conversion. So he strengthened his ties with the British on one hand and with fellow rebel chiefs and princes in Malabar on the other. Tipu sent an army under a French general named Lally with a genocidal mission‚Äîthe extermination of the Nair caste from Kottayam to Palakkad ‚Äì as Tipu was determined to end the menace of Nair rebels in Malabar who had foiled all attempts of him and his late father Hyder Ali to subjugate and exploit Malabar. The senior Rajah of Kottayam fled to Travancore fearing the Sultan. But before that, he handed over charge of government to Pazhassi Raja and asked him to save the country from Mysore's onslaught. Given below is the observation made by historian Rajayyan about Pazhassi Raja's resistance to Tipu Sultan after the exodus of Rajas from Malabar in 1788: But in 1790, Tipu abandoned the war in Malabar as the war in Deccan drew his attention. Pazhassi Raja joined the British with a force of 1500 Nairs to capture the Mysorean stronghold in Katirur (near Talassery). After Katirur, Pazhassi Raja and his troops moved south-east and captured the Kuttiyadi fort from Tipu's men. Thus once more, the whole of Kottayam was under the control of Pazhassi Raja. In 1790, the British recognised Pazhassi Raja as the head of Kottayam instead of the original Raja who was in refuge at Travancore. Raja agreed to pay 25,000 rupees as tribute to the British. But his struggle with the Mysore troops continued in Wayanad till 1793 when he freed that land also. But by the Treaty of Seringapatam (1792) signed between the British and Tipu after the latter failed in Third Anglo-Mysore War, Malabar was ceded to the British. The British then began to work for the establishment of their supremacy in Malabar. This was where the British and Pazhassi Raja had opposite opinions ‚Äì Pazhassi Raja helped the British not because he was ready to accept British sovereignty but because he wanted his country Kottayam to be a free land.Evolution of Kerala History and Culture, Prof. T. K. Gangadharan, 2004, Calicut University Central Cooperative Stores Ltd, No.4347, Calicut University 673,635 Pazhassi Raja was disturbed when he heard about the terms which the British put forward to the Rajas of Malabar in 1792, because the British had signed a cowl with him in 1790 which promised to respect the independence of Kottayam. The summary of the British terms in 1792 were as follows: * The Raja to be able to rule as before, but the British to control him ‚Äúin case of oppressing inhabitants‚Äù. * A resident to be appointed to enquire about ‚Äúcomplaints of oppression‚Äù. * Two persons on the part of the British and two persons on the part of the Raja to make valuation of the land revenue of Kottayam. * The tax to be paid by each subject to be ascertained. * The Raja's tribute to be settled in October 1792 according to the appearance of crop. * The British share of the pepper to be delivered at a price fixed by the British in December 1792. * The remainder of the pepper to be bought only by merchants appointed by the British. These terms converted monarchs to mere agents of the British. Rajas were now stripped of their right to rule as they willed; they also lost control over their economies. Kottayam was represented by Vira Varma, uncle of Pazhassi Raja during talks with the British in 1792. Vira Varma concluded a treaty with British by which he accepted all terms and conditions put forward by them. Resistance to British rule ‚Äî the Cotiote War Wayanad, Kerala, designed by Architect Eugene Pandala Pazhassi Raja resisted British imperialism from 1793 onwards till his death in 1805. He fought two wars to resist British intervention in the domestic affairs of his kingdom. From 1793‚Äì1797 he fought over the question of the management of Kottayam and from 1800‚Äì1805 over the issue of who was to be master of Wynad. British called their wars with Pazhassi Rajah as Cotiote War First revolt (1793‚Äì1797) Pazhassi Raja was not on good terms with his uncle Vira Varma, Raja of Kurumbranad. In 1793, foxy Vira Varma who had surrendered Kottayam to British back in 1792, convinced British Commissioners to let him collect tax in Kottayam. He calculated that a good collection might please the British and that that would let him seize all of Kottayam. British had by this time adopted a hostile approach to Pazhassi Raja who had consistently refused to accept British suzerainty and hence they made obedient Vira Varma as head of Kottayam Pazhassi Raja was angry at this British move. He felt betrayed. After all, he was the only Raja in Northern Malabar to have helped the British consistently in the war with Mysore. Vira Varma Raja, on the one hand, undertook to collect tax in Kottayam directly, but on the other hand, he instigated Pazhassi Raja to oppose the British. Moreover, the British assessment was harsh and beyond the peasants' capacity to pay. They resisted its forcible collection by the agents of the British, and Pazhassi Raja took up their cause. As seen before, Raja was deadly opposed to extortion of the peasantry. In 1793, Pazhassi Raja made sure that no tax was collected in Kottayam by the British ‚Äì as a mark of his protest. He also threatened that if British officials did not give up their enumeration of pepper vines, he would have the vines destroyed. Local British authorities, however, debated with Raja and soon both discovered Vira Varma's dirty games. So the British put forward a solution acceptable to the Raja by which 20 percent of gross revenue would go to Raja and another 20 percent would go for the temples' expense. No tax would be imposed on temple property in the immediate future. In 1793, Tipu's Vakils protested to the British that Pazhassi Raja, who was a British tributary, had overrun most of Wayanad, still under Mysore. Soon the Raja was supreme in the Wayanad Plateau. But the Governor General unwisely revoked the agreement in 1794 and gave Kottayam to Kurumbranad Raja on a five-year lease. The Raja was truly angry at this decision and decided to retaliate by ruling his country as per customary law. The year before the lease was concluded the Raja had provided asylum to a Nayar noble, Narangoli Nambiar belongs to the Iruvazinad royal clan, who had been declared an outlaw by British for the murder of three men who had killed his kinsman. The Raja's kind treatment of Nambiar irritated the British. The British also became angry that the Raja impaled two robbers as per customary law. British planned to arrest Raja for 'murder', but gave up the idea as the Raja had a bodyguard of 500 well armed Wayanad Nayars. In 1795, even after a year, Vira Varma Raja got Kottayam on lease, he was not able to collect tax in Kottayam-thanks to his nephew Raja's determination. So British troops arrived in Kottayam to help Vira Varma's tax collectors, but Pazhassi Raja's men resisted them with success. In 1796, orders were issued from Bombay to collect tax arrears for 2 years in Kottayam. For British no more pretexts were needed to arrest Raja. 300 men under Lieutenant James Gordon marched from Talassery and seized Raja's fortified house at Pazhassi-but Raja fled four days earlier to Manattana (near Kottiyur). Gordon plundered the palace where traditional treasure of Raja was kept. Raja was angry at this loot and sent a letter to Supervisor at Thalassery. Raja was also angry that one of his former general named Pazhayamviden Chandu had become an agent of Kurumbranad Raja and what angered him even more than that was that this turn-coat had the audacity to boss him with Vira Varma's and British blessings. Raja shifted his HQ to Purali Range and then into Wayanad. Raja then blocked all British communications between Wayanad and Low Malabar through Kuttiyadi Pass. The British retaliated by cutting all communications between Raja and Low Malabar. But as they did not have enough troops to chase him they waited for reinforcements. The British commandant was Colonel Dow, whom Raja knew well during Siege of Thalassery. So Raja thought that this old friend might help him mediate with the British government. Raja offered to give up the struggle provided he was pardoned and his treasure and house restored. The Colonel and Raja being old soldiers hated needless bloodshed and so he forwarded Raja's request to Commissioners, who thought they were bitterly opposed to Raja's independent style, agreed to the Colonel's suggestion as there was a risk that Raja might ally with Tipu. So Northern Superintendent ordered the restoration of the Raja's house [but not treasure], and the Raja's pardon was confirmed by the Bombay and Supreme Governments. But the orders of government were communicated to the Raja via Vira Varma ‚Äì which meant that uncle Raja took care not to report to his nephew that the British had agreed to his requests. Uncle Raja had a vested interest in the war between the Company and his nephew Pazhassi Raja. Vira Varma also removed Kaitheri Ambu, a favourite noble and general of Raja, from home administration of Kottayam. Ambu along with followers went to Kannavam [also spelled Kannavath and Kannoth], where he planned and executed a mass resistance with people's support, which made sure that Vira Varma could make no tax collection in Kottayam. But Ambu acted clearly on guidance of Raja, who felt expulsion of Ambu was another of his uncle's conspiracies to undermine him. Raja feared that British planned to seize him [not knowing that their truce terms were kept blocked from him by his uncle] and retreated into depths of Wayanad. British troop build up in Wayanad also accelerated his doubts. However, Raja was still eager to avoid a war and came to meet Northern Superintendent with a bodyguard of 1500 armed Nayars. Vira Varma Raja was also ordered to be present. Pazhassi Raja's main demand was that Kottayam must be under his rule-a demand his uncle was not ready to accede. British Commissioners' attitude also was arrogant-they were already prejudiced towards Raja and so were blind towards Raja's logical argument that Vira Varma had no business in Kottayam. As talks broke down, Commissioners' issued a threat proclamation in Kottayam that if those Kottayam men in service of Raja does not desert him and come home, they would be declared enemies and their properties would be confiscated. But this proclamation had little effect in Kottayam where resistance to British-Kurumbranad rule became stronger. British, to their horror, found out that a large number of Vira Varma's troops had deserted to join ranks of resisters and Vira Varma himself was not much interested to help British-after all his aim was to create a flare-up between his nephew and British for sake of pure self-interest. Raja then visited Mysorean commandant at Karkankotta in 1796 and in 1797 held an audience with old enemy Tipu in Mysore who posted 6000 men at Karkankotta to aid Raja in case of war and also to supply ammunition to rebels. He also began to collect troops and armament. War was imminent. 1200 troops and artillery under Major General was sent by Bombay Government to deal with Pazhassi. British also began to set up outposts in Kottayam and sent more troops to Wayanad. In early 1797, Nayar militia rose all over Kottayam and British outposts were trapped in a true state of siege. Partisan bands became active all over Kottayam and harassed reinforcements and supply convoys. Same was the case in Wayanad where British troops that moved out of the safety of block-houses risked being way- laid by Kurichia bowmen. British suffered good loss in terms of men, ammunition and stores in these ambuscades. Victory at Periya Pass This event was the most important in the whole war. In 1797, Colonel Dow & force marches into Wayanad. His plan was to block Periya Pass and then crush a large rebel force in Kannoth once their retreat is blocked. Reinforcements under Lieutenant Mealy were to reach Dow at Periya, but on way they were severely harassed by a force of Nayars and Kurichias and suffered a casualty of 105 men. So instead of Periya they retreated to their original base. Dow's troops suffered chronic shortage of supplies and so Dow applied for reinforcements and re-supplies to be sent under Major Anderson of Bowles' regiment. But as Mappila guides of Anderson deserted at last moment. That caused a delay in journey of Anderson-a delay that had fatal consequence for British. Dow then received news that Tipu had sent sepoys to aid Raja as Tipu considered British entry into Wayanad a violation of Seringapatam Pact. Dow decided that he will go to Talassery to consult authorities there and to plan a greater operation to deal with troops of Raja and Tipu simultaneously in Wayanad. He left with a small band of men but was ambushed on way by Raja's men aided by Mysorean sepoys but Dow escaped unhurt. The day after he left, British force of 1100 under Major Cameroon in Periya decided to descend into Kottayam via Periya Pass as their supplies have exhausted. But what they did not know was that Raja who learned of the true state of British army laid a trap for them-he ordered troops lay concealed in camouflaged stockades built on both sides of the pass. Once the whole British force entered the narrow pass, hidden troops were to pounce on their enemy who must be caught unawares. Plan worked well and what followed was great slaughter of British. Had it not been for the arrival of Major Anderson's force the following day, hardly any would have survived due to lack of medical care. Most of the enemy were killed and all their guns, ammunition, baggage and cattle were plundered along with Union colours. Senior British officers like Major Cameroon, Lieutenant Nugent, Lieutenant Madge, and Lieutenant Rudderman were killed in action. Around this time, Commissioners took a decision on the advice of Swaminatha Pattar, a Tamil Brahmin who was the minister of Zamorin that sowed the eventual downfall of Pazhassi Raja. They decided to raise an irregular force of local traitors to harass Pazhassi Raja. This force was a forerunner of the Kolkar, who became infamous for their sycophancy to British and cruelty to resisters and people. But for time being, Raja was in a strong position. On account of British disasters, Bombay Government sent a Committee of Government composed of men of highest ranks-Commander-In-Chief Lieutenant-General Stuart and Governor Jonathan Duncan. They decided to make peace as they were anxious that guerrilla warfare in a mountainous and forested terrain could last long and that Raja might join forces with Tipu or French. They also decided that Kurumbranad Raja Vira Varma should be ousted from administration of Kottayam. Rajas of Chirakkal and Parappanad acted as mediators in negotiation between Raja and British and a peace pact was signed between Pazhassi and British in 1797. The Treaty of 1797 agreed on following points: * Pazhassi Raja was to be 'pardoned'. * He will be returned his treasure. * He will be provided an annual allowance of 8000 rupees. * He will be given back his confiscated house at Pazhassi. * Ravi Varma, elder brother of Pazhassi Raja will be head of Kottayam. A pardon and restoration of property was also extended to Narangoli Nambiar of Iruvazinad. Thus Raja's efforts of four years ended in a political victory. Peace dawned after four years of antagonism and war. Tipu Sultan in his letter to French government notes with glee that British had lost 1,000 European soldiers and 3,000 native sepoys in four years of war between British troops and Kottayam army. Undeclared hostilities (1797-1800) Despite the peace treaty of 1797, real peace did not emerge between Pazhassi Raja and English East India Company. Skirmishes continued across Kottayam. The main reason for this was that the Company did not attempt to end its efforts to subjugate Kottayam and collect tax. But this was successfully foiled by partisans of Pazhassi Raja headed by Kaitheri Ambu. Pazhassi Raja also went ahead with his policy of defiance of English directions, continued with his military enlargement program and even shifted his seat of power to Mananthavadi in Wayanad - all of which were deemed as \\"injurious to interests of Company in Kottayam\\" by Colonel Dow, English representative in Kottayam. But since Raja clearly had the upper hand since the victory of 1797, English was powerless to put an end to his activities. Second revolt and death (1800‚Äì1805) After the fall of Tipu, Wayanad fell to the British. They sent a Mysore Commission to seize Wayanad and planned to annex it to either Canara or Coimbatore. But as Wayanad was a traditional possession of Kottayam Raja and that Pazhassi is in control of this region since 1793, Pazhassi correctly saw move was an encroachment on his country's ancient provinces. Raja retaliated by collecting a large force of Nayars which was now supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans, latter being ex-soldiers of Tipu who became unemployed after Tipu's death. British Government at Madras appointed Major General Arthur Wellesley as British army commandant of Mysore, Canara & Malabar. He planned a double-pronged move from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad and began preparations for that end. Raja observed Major General-latter had brought reinforcements and building roads in Wayanad and outposts across rebel country. In response, Raja also recruited numerous men which so alarmed Wellesley that latter even wanted to kidnap kith and kin of rebels so as to check Raja's recruitment. Raja learned that Wellesley had left to Deccan on a military mission-Raja who understood that Major General's absence is a great chance swiftly made his move. He marched across Kuttiyadi Pass and below he made a junction with Unni Mootha Mooppan, a Walluvanad Mappila leader & his men and soon several great nobles like Kampuratt Nambiar of Iruvazhinad, Peruvayal Nambiar and Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar also joined Raja with their men. By monsoon of 1800, rebels who controlled all of country-side of Kottayam threatened to overwhelm British outposts in Kottayam. Wellesley sent a large force under Colonel Sartorius to recapture rebel-held Kottayam. But the plan could not be carried out as there were not enough troops in Malabar. Wellesley advised Commissioners to stop all communications with Wayanad so as to starve Raja of supplies. But the shortage of troops also meant this plan too remained on paper. By the time, Wellesley decided to smash Raja by a double drive from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad, Manjeri Athan Gurikkal an Ernad Mappila leader along with his followers agreed to support of Raja. By 1801, a large British force of over 10,000 men swarmed all over Kottayam and Wayanad and they blocked all passes that linked Wayanad with Malabar. Before so large numbers, rebels thought wise to go under-ground for time being. Raja also found that he could no longer contact his supporters in Southern Wayanad and Southern Malabar. Raja became a wanderer in forests but even then, to surprise of British, he ruled out compromise it seems he understood that there was no alternative to full freedom. Raja had six close aides and 25 musketeers in his wanderings. First, he went north via Payyavur along montane forests of eastern Chirakkal to rally support. But the British were on his trail but failed to catch him. Raja then visited his secret bases in Kottayam and then moved into Kadathanad and into jungles of Kurumbranad. British were angered that where ever he went, nobles supported him in secret and decided to punish them for their help to rebel Raja. As a part of terrorisation, Peruvayal Nambiar who was arrested was hanged. British also threatened brutal penalty and confiscation of property for all those rebels who failed to surrender in six weeks time. But a pardon was also issued for surrendered rebels. But none of these threats and temptations worked and Raja was still at large. But some of his chief supporters were arrested of whom Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar was most famous. Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar and his son were hanged too and their property was confiscated. Following murder of Kannavath Nambiar, a deceptive calm descended on North Malabar-calm before the storm. Collector Major MacLeod believed that war was over and went ahead with exploitation program. He immediately declared total disarmament of Malabar and threatened those who kept arms with the death penalty. He also doubled the rate of tax and ordered a reassessment of tax of whole Malabar in a mere forty days. All these 'reforms' paid back in 1803 when Malabar was on verge of revolt as people were pushed to wall. MacLeod tried to calm this with corrective measure-He cancelled all his 'reforms' and old system was reinstated. But it was too late for Wayanad where Raja's men were prepared for a rebellion. Capture of Panamaram Fort Wayanad, Kerala. Wayanad, Kerala. The first major event was the capture of Panamaram Fort. Edachena Kungan Nair planned the operation and was helped by 150 Kurichia bowmen under Talakkal Chandu. Fort had 70 men under Captain Dickenson and there was a large force of 360 men under Major Drummond only a few miles away in Pulinjali. So if Major came to help Captain in time Kurichia force would be overwhelmed by gun-fire and numbers. But Kungan and Chandu decided to take risk. The whole garrison was slaughtered in the surprise attack led by the two generals and they lost only 5 dead and 10 wounded. Dickenson himself was killed. Rebels got 112 muskets, six boxes of ammunition and 6000 rupees. They also destroyed the whole fort.(The remains of the fort can be seen now near Panamaram High School). Wellesley was enraged at this rebel audacity and dispatched 500 men to retaliate. But by then rebel victory had roused all of Wayanad and Kottayam. Edachena Kungan, the hero of Panamaram success, went to Pulpally shrine and issued a proclamation to people to join Raja's war. 3000 men volunteered. They were posted at Valliyurkav at Mananthavadi, Motimjarra [?], and Edappally and 100 of them under the brother of Kungan posted themselves at Periya Pass and 25 men were posted at Kottiyur Pass. Rebel outposts were set up en route from Dindimal to Valliyurkav. The rebel army was mostly composed of archers and swordmen, but some had muskets. Edachena Kungan Nair led an attack on a British detachment headed from Mysore to Mananthavadi. The harassment began once this force entered Wayanad till it reached a stream between Manathavadi and Bhavully river. There they were blocked by a rebel force entrenched on the opposite side of the stream. But to ill luck of rebels, a reinforcement which had caught up with blocked British army outflanked the rebel entrenchment and took a large number of prisoners. All these prisoners were disarmed and marched to a road where they were murdered. Besides, British reinforcements arrived in Wayanad from all directions. But British could find rebels nowhere. The rebels now concentrated in Kottayam. In 1802, they raided a supplies convoy near Kottiyur. British were frustrated by Kottayam people's total lack of co-operation. To add to their trouble, in 1803, a rebel force took to field in Kurumbranad* & Payyormala* and people were sympathetic to rebels. Kungan marched towards Pazhassi to wipe out the British outpost there but had to retreat, though British suffered serious losses. Soon rebellion spread into Chirakkal where armed bands of partisans launched operations and often fought British openly. Raja's army by end of 1803 was ranging as far as Kannur and Thalasseri. An estimated 3350 partisans of Pazhassi Raja took part in this operation that extended south as far as Ernad. In March 1803, a rebel force marched as far as Calicut and captured Sub-Jail where they killed all guards and seized their firearms and ammunition. They also released prisoners, many of whom joined ranks of the rebel army. This was too much for MacLeod and he resigned immediately after this event. In 1803, Wellesley left for Europe, after three years of inconclusive war with Pazhassi Raja, later destined to become Duke of Wellington, vanquisher of Napoleon at Waterloo.Historical preface of Kerala Simham, Sardar KM Panikker, [1941], DC Books, 2008 Edition, Kottayam 686,001 In 1803, British had 8,147 soldiers to fight Pazhassi Raja. But as the situation was slipping out of control, British military command in Malabar requested for another 5,000 men. This reinforcement arrived in early 1804 and thus increasing British force to 13,000 men. In 1804, a large British army arrived and 1200 Kolkar were also ready for action. Most importantly Thomas Hervey Baber, a civil servant was appointed as Sub-Collector. It was he who crushed Pazhassi's Revolt forever. It is indeed ironic that what a military genius like Wellesley could not attain, was achieved by Baber ‚Äì said to be just a 'civil servant.' Baber had both a personal motive ‚Äì to avenge the death of his friend Major Cameron, the first husband of his wife Helen Somerville Fearon at the hand of Pazhassi Raja on 9 January 1797 at Periya Pass. Baber became a civil servant to protect the interests of a small but influential group of merchants that included his in-laws ‚Äì the Inglis and Money families of Bombay. It is noteworthy that Baber's son Henry Fearon Baber married the Granddaughter of George Harris, 1st Baron Srirangapattam and the nemesis of Tipu Sultan. In 1804, a huge rising led by Kalyat Nambiar [a powerful Chirakkal noble but Raja's sympathiser] and Raja's men in largely forested eastern Chirakkal was crushed by British. If there was large and long revolt warfare in Chirakkal, it would have immensely profited Raja. Though there was a lot of supporters of Raja in Chirakkal, as revolt collapsed fast as rebels opted for open confrontation instead of time-honoured guerrilla warfare. Another cause for the failure of revolt was treacherous Kolkar also served their White pay-masters well. So once more rebel force had retreated to Wayanad. They were hotly chased by British who had 2000 Sepoys and 1000 Kolkar. A reward of 3000 pagodas was offered for Raja along with 1000 Pagodas for Edachena Kungan and bounties were put on heads of 10 other associates of Raja. But rebels, mostly Kurumbas, struck at Churikunji [?] in Wayanad. Though they had to withdraw, they had devastated their enemy. That year, a party of Kolkar nearly caught Raja but he escaped thanks to timely warning of a Kurumba guard. But monsoon and brutal climate of Wayanad soon aided Raja. Of 1300 Kolkar only 170 were not sick by October. Raja and Edachena Kungan organised a large force of Kurichias and Kurumbas at Pulpally shrine and positioned them to as far as Kurichiyat. Also, the effort of Kungan to rally Nayar nobles of Wayanad to support Raja's war-effort had also succeeded. British for past couple of years did not have to suffer the loss on a scale of Periya in 1797, but matters were not easy for British at all. Even in Kottayam which had become quiet might explode once more and a large rebel force with Raja as the head was still at large. But one must remember that the whole revolt is a one- man show as Wellesley himself remarked once-‚ÄúWe are not fighting 1000 men [Raja‚Äôs army] ... but one man ... Kerala Varma.‚Äù-Raja's end would mean end of revolt. Betrayal and death T.H. Baber went to Mysore to direct operations himself and began a large search for informants and traitors. True, British themselves admit that they did not get a lot of informants as locals were devoted to Raja, but some of those few informants proved devastating to revolt-one of them a Chetti, found out where Raja had camped and informed Baber who took to field with 100 Kolkar and 50 Sepoys. There is one school of thought that blames Pazhayamviden Chandu as solely responsible for fall of Raja and end of his revolt. Pazhayamviden worked with British military authority as an \\"adviser\\" like Pallore Eman, but in reality, spied for Raja. But in autumn of 1805 Pazhayamviden decided to betray all military secrets of his master for a large sum of money. In light of the above points, it will not be far-fetched to believe that Chetti who guided British troops to Raja's hideout mentioned by Baber in his letter could be a servant or agent of Pazhayamviden Chandu. On 1805, 30 November, Raja and retainers were camped close to Karnataka on the shore of a stream named Mavila or Mavila Tod [not far from Pulpally]. Raja and party were caught by surprise and an intense but short fight followed. Six rebels were killed. One of the earliest rebels to be killed was Pazhassi Raja. But evidently, wounded Raja did live long enough for a few more minutes to raise his loaded gun and then tell Canara Menon, an East India Company minor official, not to come too close to his dying body and pollute it. Raja's contempt and sarcasm for a man who chose to serve unclean foreigner are evident. But it also showed his uncompromising stand towards collaborators and foreign invaders. The precise nature of Raja's death is controversial. Folklore insists that he committed suicide by swallowing a diamond ring to avoid capture after he was wounded but Baber says he was killed by a clerk named Canara Menon. W. J. Wilson, who wrote on the history of the Madras Regiment, credits Captain Clafam and his six sepoys for killing. This third version is more likely as Baber was not on good terms with military authority throughout the war. He is alleged to have credited Menon so as to deny credit to Clafam and his superior Colonel Hill. Kunjani, the wife of Raja who was taken the prisoner, committed suicide in captivity at Kappanaveedu, near Thalassery. As reprisal on his family, property was confiscated and the palace at Pazhassi was demolished and replaced with a highway. The sorry state of his family aroused sympathy in local Thiyyas, who were loyal followers and built a new house for his family. Assessment * Descriptive account of Pazhassi Raja as early as 1775 confirm his later day image as a courageous warrior committed to the freedom of his country. * Walter Ivor, a member of Court of Directors, who had taken part in negotiations with Pazhassi Raja in 1797 notes that British losses that year in Cotiote War exceeded British losses in Third Anglo-Mysore War. * War waged by Pazhassi Raja was the longest anti-British resistance struggle in India and forest warfare waged by Raja had no parallel in the history of India in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century India. * British military command always wondered at the logistics of Raja's army. How he organized supplies for his several thousand strong armies remained a puzzle for them * To fight overwhelmingly superior enemies, Raja imparted military training to his peasantry wholesale and recruited them into his military force. This military policy of wholesale militarization was novel in the history of pre-modern Kerala. His war-effort was marked by the participation of members of all creeds, classes, and castes who took up arms due to his inspiration. Nobles, headmen, peasants, shopkeepers, merchants, artisans, and forest tribes rallied to fight the foreign invaders ‚Äî first Mysore and later English East India Company. * British losses were severe in terms of men and ran into several thousand. Death toll was particularly high with officers of commissioned ranks. So high were the losses suffered by Bombay army regiments that operated in North Malabar that they had to be withdrawn in 1803 fearing that further losses would cripple Bombay Army as a respectable body of troops. * Raja shared all the privations of his ordinary soldiers during the war and took part in all major military action exposing himself to personal danger. On account of these attributes, he commanded great respect of his troops. * Royal regiments from Britain also took part in Cotiote War along with Company troops. * Anti-British rebels in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also were allied to Pazhassi Raja. * Arthur Wellesely, Duke of Wellington adopted methods of guerrilla warfare used by Pazhassi Raja to defeat Napoleon's armies in Spain. * Memory of Pazhassi Raja and his struggle inspired freedom struggle in 20th century Kerala. Pazhassi Raja had no selfish motive of personal power. Kurup (1988) describes him as an altruistic personality who upheld interests of his subjects and country over his personal interest. He believed that he was duty-bound to protect his subjects from exploitation and oppression. Frenz (2008) also supports this view and opines that Raja was committed to the welfare of his people and freedom of his country. She notes that Pazhassi Raja opted for fight British when it became clear to him that English East India Company would not respect freedom of his country and welfare of his subjects. She noted that Raja considered it a personal failure as a leader if he failed to uphold sovereignty of his kingdom. Criticism leveled against Raja for allying with English East India Company during his wars with Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan is not rational in light of an analysis of contemporary South Indian history. Raja allied with Company initially not because he was a vassal of British, but because Mysore was enemy of both. Before 1792, Malabar suffered from rapacity of Mysore rule and British were only a merchant power who had not yet harmed people of Malabar. So it was understandable that many leaders of Malabar ‚Äì Pazhassi Raja included ‚Äì allied with British to fight Mysore rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. Swaminatha Iyer, a British agent had noted as early as 1797 that extreme popularity of Raja was on account of the fact that he remained in his country with his subjects during Mysore invasions and shared with them the trials and tribulations and also due to his extreme generosity to this peasantry. It was on account of love and support from his subjects that Raja could evade and fight British for a decade even when he had a bounty on his head. After his fellow Rajas in Malabar submitted to British after 1798, Raja himself knew well that he will be defeated and killed in the long run if he chose to fight English East India Company. But yet he refused to compromise. In a letter to Kalyat Kuttieman, he reveals his intent to resist English power to the end. He took initiative to rebuild his country which was devastated by Mysore invasions. As part of this, he borrowed money from Tellicherry Factory and gave financial help to his peasants to resume agriculture along with distribution of seeds and cattle. This was in contrast to rest of Rajas of Malabar who squeezed peasants. This was one reason why his popularity with masses remained high. Raja is also credited with the spread of agriculture in Wynad. He started a program that encouraged tribesmen in Wynad to adopt settled agriculture. As part of this program, he instructed his vassals in Wynad to distribute cattle and seeds to tribesmen in Wynad. Supporters Pazhassi Raja was assisted by eighty chieftains during his wars and some were entrusted with administrative responsibilities also. Most prominent of them are Chengoteri Chathu, Pallur Eman, Kaitheri Ambu, Kannavath Nambiar, Thalakkal Chandu and Edachena Kunkan. Forest forts In his decades-long war to oust invaders, Rajah developed an elaborate system of cantonments and forts in the jungly and mountainous part of his country. Four of them are most important ‚Äì granite fort on Purali range [modern Muzhakunnu] which was built by his ancestor Harischandra Perumal over a thousand years ago. He had another granite fort at Manatana. In Wynad, he had a great fort in Mananthavady which was reported to have ability to house his whole army of 6000 men. He also had a stronghold in Todikulam near Kannavam which belonged to his supporter Kannavath Sankaran. Of all his strongholds, none survive today. Only ruins of Purali fort survive today. It is today a heap of granite boulders. Only a tank still survives today. A nearby black-stone cave where Raja once lived can still be found.\\"Mathrubhoomi\\" Daily, 5 October 2009, Kannur Edition Legacy *Pazhassi Raja College, Pulpally, Bathery *Pazhassi Raja N.S.S.

UNOSOM II carried on from the United States-controlled (UN-sanctioned) Unified Task Force (UNITAF). It had been active for a transition period when United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM I) mission proved to be ineffectual. All three of these interventions were intended to establish a secure enough environment for humanitarian operations to be carried out, because there was effectively no central government and the country was increasingly subject to factional violence and was suffering from famine, in part due to the warfare and social disruption. The UNOSOM II intervention was associated with the Battle of Mogadishu and related events in which eighteen American soldiers were killed. These events were later served as the basis for Mark Bowden's book Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War in 1999. Background Following the failure of the monitoring mission created as UNOSOM by the United Nations, the United States offered to lead a substantial intervention force, made up chiefly of American personnel. This was accepted by the UN and made possible through United Nations Security Council Resolution 794, authorizing the use of \\"all necessary means to establish as soon as possible a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia\\".Thomas G. Weiss and Don Hubert, The Responsibility to Protect: Research, Bibliography, Background: Supplementary Volume to the Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, Vol. 2. (Canada: International Development Research Centre, 2001). The Security Council urged the Secretary-General and member states to make arrangements for \\"the unified command and control\\" of the military forces that would be involved.United Nations, Security Council resolution 794 (1992), 24/4/92, para. 3. On the evening of 4 December 1992, U.S. President George H. W. Bush addressed the nation, informing them that U.S. troops would be sent to Somalia. The U.S. contribution would be known as Operation Restore Hope, which joined a multinational force and became known as the United Task Force (UNITAF).ARMED HUMANITARIANS by Robert C. DiPrizio p.46 The operations of UNOSOM I were suspended. UNITAF was authorized under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The United States intended UNITAF and U.S control as a transitional action. The mission consisted of four phases. The first phase was the initial deployment of troops to provide secure harbor and airport sites in Mogadishu, from where the entire operation would be managed. Second was the expansion of the security zone to the surrounding regions of southern Somalia. Due to a more lenient environment than expected and the encouragement from NGOs (Non-governmental Organizations), UNITAF forces accomplished phase two a couple of weeks ahead of schedule. Third, the forces would expand the security zone into Kismayo and Bardera and maintain secure land routes for humanitarian operations throughout the security zone. The fourth and final phase consisted of the US handing over operations to the United Nations and withdrawing most of the UNITAF forces. On 3 March 1993, the Secretary-General submitted to the Security Council his recommendations for effecting the transition from UNITAF to UNOSOM II. He noted that despite the size of the UNITAF mission, a secure environment was not yet established. There was still no effective functioning government or local security/police force.UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA I, UN Dept of Peacekeeping. The Secretary-General concluded that, should the Security Council determine that the time had come for the transition from UNITAF to UNOSOM II, the latter should be endowed with enforcement powers under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to establish a secure environment throughout Somalia. UNOSOM II would therefore seek to complete the task begun by UNITAF. The new mandate would also empower UNOSOM II to assist in rebuilding their economic, political and social life, so as to recreate a Somali State. The new UN-controlled mission, to be called UNOSOM II, was established by the Security Council in Resolution 814 (1993) on 26 March 1993. It did not formally take over operations in Somalia until UNITAF was dissolved on 4 May 1993.

It was the objective of UNOSOM II to support this new system and initiate nation-building in Somalia. This included disarming the various factions, helping the people to set up a representative government, and restoring infrastructure.

The US also provided 1,167 troops for a Quick Reaction Force under US operational control that would be stationed on US Navy ships off the coast of Somalia (see Carrier Strike Group 6). This force would respond to emergency threats to UNOSOM II but only if US Central Command in Florida approved.THE UNITED STATES AND POST-COLD WAR INTERVENTIONS 1998 by Lester H. Brune p.28 On 5 June, a Pakistani force was sent to investigate an arms depot belonging to a Somali warlord vying for the Presidency, Mohamed Farrah Aidid. When the Pakistani force arrived, they encountered angry Somali protesters. Twenty-four Pakistani soldiers inspecting weapons as part of the expanded UN mandate were killed when \\"forces believed to be associated with Aidid allegedly launched a fatal attack on peacekeeping forces.\\"Dorcas McCoy, \\"American Post-Cold War Images and Foreign Policy Preferences Toward 'Dependent' States: A Case Study of Somalia,\\" World Affairs 163, no. 1 (Summer 2000): 43. The UN responded the next day with Resolution 837, reaffirming that the secretary-general was authorized to \\"take all necessary measures against those responsible for the armed attacks and to establish the effective authority of UNOSOM II throughout Somalia.\\"James Mayall, The New Interventionism 1991-1994: United Nations Experience in Cambodia, Former Yugoslavia and Somalia (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 110. This was essentially equivalent to declaring war on Aidid and his army, a declaration that would lead to numerous confrontations between UNOSOM II personnel and Aidid's militia. UNOSOM II had much fewer war-fighting resources than UNITAF, but it was much more ambitious and aggressive. On 12 June 1993 U.S. troops started attacking targets in Mogadishu in hopes of finding Aidid, a campaign which lasted until 16 June. On 17 June, a $25,000 warrant was issued by Admiral Jonathan Howe for information leading to the arrest of Aidid, but he was never captured. Howe also requested a counter-terrorist rescue force after the killings of the Pakistani troops. The hunt for Aidid characterised much of the UNOSOM II intervention. The increasing tempo of military operations carried out in Mogadishu began to cause civilian casualties and affected the relationship between the foreign troops and the Somali people. The UN troops were portrayed as foreign interlopers, particularly after incidents of civilian casualties caused by wholesale firing into crowds.Reuters News Agency, 1993, \\"Somalian targets hit by new air strikes Warlord accuses UN of genocide, refuses to negotiate until attacks end\\", published 15/6/93 in The Globe and Mail.Lorch, Donatella, \\"20 Somalis Die When Peacekeepers Fire at Crowd\\", The New York Times, 14/6/93. On July 12, a house where clan leaders were meeting was attacked by US AH-1 Cobra helicopters. Several buildings were destroyed and many Somalis died. When four western journalists went to investigate the scene, they were beaten to death by a Somali mob. The journalists were Hansi Krauss of Associated Press and Dan Eldon, Hos Maina and Anthony Macharia, all of Reuters.THE UNITED STATES AND POST-COLD WAR INTERVENTIONS 1998 by Lester H. Brune p.31 Somalis that had been disappointed by the failure of the UN to disarm the warlords in Mogadishu actually began to support those same warlords with an \\"us versus them\\" rationale. Islamism also began to rise, as militia leaders sought to use religion as a rallying point for anti-UN sentiment. As the Americans became more insular, the warlords began to reassert control of many Mogadishu districts. With each failure to apprehend Aidid, the militias grew more bold. Serious rifts between nations contributing to UNOSOM II also began to develop, with Italy in particular being a major critic of the American methods.Cowell, Alan, 1993, \\"Italy, In U.N. Rift, Threatens Recall Of Somalia Troops\\", The New York Times, 16/7/93. Somali militias began targeting peacekeepers, causing further casualties. On 8 August, Aidid's militia detonated a remote controlled bomb against a U.S. military vehicle, first killed four American soldiers and then, two weeks later, injured seven more. In response, President Bill Clinton approved the proposal to deploy a special task force composed of 400 US Army Rangers and Delta-force Commandos. This unit, named Task Force Ranger, consisted of 160 elite US troops. They flew to Mogadishu and began a manhunt for Aidid in what became known as Operation Gothic Serpent. On October 3, 1993, Task Force Ranger raided a hotel in Mogadishu in which Aidid was thought to be hiding. What ensued was the longest, bloodiest and deadliest battle for US troops in Somalia. In what later became known as the Battle of Mogadishu, eighteen US soldiers were killed. Images of their dead bodies being dragged through the streets were broadcast on television stations all over the world, horrifying and infuriating the American public. End On October 7 in a nationwide television address, President Clinton \\"effectively ended the US proactive policy in Somalia\\" and \\"called for the withdrawal of all US forces no later than March 31, 1994.\\" Resolution 954, passed on November 4, extended the UNOSOM mandate for a final period until March 31, 1995. U.S. soldiers completely withdrew on March 3, 1994, 28 days earlier than expected.THE UNITED STATES AND POST-COLD WAR INTERVENTIONS 1998 by Lester H. Brune p.33 Other western nations, such as Italy, Belgium, France and Sweden, also decided to withdraw at this time. On November 4, 1994, after \\"peacemaking\\" efforts by the 1,900 UNOSOM II troops failed, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) voted unanimously to withdraw all forces in Resolution 954. On November 16, the UNSC authorized Resolution 897, placing new emphasis on peacemaking and reconstruction and returning to a less reactive role. UNOSOM II's mandate ended in March 1995 when US ships off the coast of Somalia assisted in the safe departure of the remaining UNOSOM troops. In early 1994 the Security Council set a deadline for the mission of March 1995. The withdrawal of UN troops from Somalia was completed on March 28, 1995. Various reconciliation talks were carried out over the next few months providing for a ceasefire, the disarmament of militias and a conference to appoint a new Government. However, preparations for the conference were repeatedly postponed and many faction leaders simply ignored the agreements at will.United Nations Operations in Somalia II, Background (Summary) . Aidid's son Hussein Mohamed Farrah took over after his father's death in a battle in August 1996. He was a former US Marine who served during Operation Restore Hope in 1992. Somalia participated in talks in December 1997 held in Cairo, Egypt, where Aidid and Mahdi, another Somali warlord, signed a \\"Declaration of Principles\\". The declaration promised to launch reconciliation conferences in February, 1998 and to prepare a transitional government charter.THE UNITED STATES AND POST-COLD WAR INTERVENTIONS 1998 by Lester H. Brune p.33-34 Walter Clarke, who was Deputy Chief of Mission for the U.S. Embassy in Somalia during Operation Restore Hope, and Jeffrey Herbst, Associate Professor, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, conclude that \\"The intervention in Somalia was not an abject failure; an estimated 100,000 lives were saved. But its mismanagement should be an object lesson for peacekeepers ... on other such missions.\\"Somalia and the Future of Humanitarian Intervention By Walter Clarke and Jeffrey Herbst.

It is served by an active United States post office of the same name. It is situated on the eastern shore of Greenwood Lake, at the New Jersey state line. Part of the hamlet extends into West Milford Township, Passaic County, New Jersey. The hamlet grew up around the terminal station of the Montclair and Greenwood Lake Railway, later called the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, and later the Greenwood Lake division of the Erie Railroad. The railroad reached this point around 1875, with the station located at the state line in New Jersey. The depot complex originally contained the Sterling Forest, New Jersey post office. The post office was moved to the New York side of the line in 1926, where it continues to operate. Rail service ceased in 1935. The coming of the railroad was preceded by the construction of a large commercial ice house by the Ringwood Company around 1864. The Sterling Forest ice house was later operated by the Mountain Ice Company of Hoboken, New Jersey. It ceased operation and was eventually torn down in 1945. At one time, the hamlet also boasted two hotels (one in New Jersey), a general store, lumber yard, two bars (in addition to those in the hotels) and a Roman Catholic church (in New Jersey). Today, the only businesses that remain are one bar/restaurant, and a marina (on the site of the depot). In the 1930s and 1940s, Yankee great Babe Ruth often rented a cabin in the hamlet for the summer, and was known to play baseball with the local neighborhood children at a small ballfield located there. It was the site of the first American rocket airplane flight that carried mail from the New York side of the state line to the New Jersey side on February 23, 1936. Often confused with Sterling Forest, New York is the old Sterling Forest Gardens property and the adjacent Sterling Forest State Park, both located several miles away in the Town of Tuxedo, New York. The property is now the site of the New York Renaissance Faire, an annual Renaissance fair.

After the British took over the territory, the village was renamed in English. The federally recognized Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians have their headquarters here. They have land here, and additional land and a gaming casino in Petoskey. The Little Traverse Light marks the entrance at Harbor Springs to the smaller harbor within the bay. After the Odawa bands in northern Michigan were persuaded to cede considerable lands to the United States, the Little Traverse Bay region was developed by Illinois land developers and resort founders, such as lawyers Henry Stryker, III and Henry Brigham McClure, and the Capps family of Jacksonville, Illinois and woolen mills fame. The Stryker, Capps, and McClure families were interconnected with the Jacob Bunn industrial dynasty of Chicago and Springfield, Illinois.

PrasƒÅda (, Sanskrit: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶), variantly spelled as PrasƒÅdam, PrasƒÅd and PrasƒÅda, is a material substance of vegetarian food that is a religious offering in both Hinduism and Sikhism. It is normally consumed by worshippers after worship. MahaprasƒÅda (also called BhandƒÅrƒÅ) in Hinduism, similar to the langar in Sikhism,Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech, 2014, The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies is the consecrated food offered to the deity in the temple which is then shared and eaten by the masses without discrimination.Chitrita Banerji, 2010, Eating India: Exploring the Food and Culture of the Land of Spices.Subhakanta Behera, 2002, Construction of an identity discourse: Oriya literature and the Jagannath cult (1866-1936), p140-177.Susan Pattinson, 2011, The Final Journey: Complete Hospice Care for the Departing Vaishnavas, pp.220. Sometimes this vegetarian offering will exclude the prohibited items such as garlic, onion, roots, etc. Etymology Puja ceremony at a home in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India PrasƒÅda is derived from the verb prasƒÅd which consists of the verb ‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç (sad - to sit, dwell) which is prefixed with ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞ (pra - before, afore, in front) and used as finite verb ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡•Ä‡§¶‡§§‡§ø (prasƒ´dati - dwells, presides, pleases or favours etc). 'PrasƒÅda' literally means a gracious gift. It denotes anything, typically an edible food, that is first offered to a deity, saint, Perfect Master or an avatƒÅr, and then distributed in His or Her name to their followers or others as a good sign.Natu, Bal, Glimpses of the God-Man, Meher Baba, Sheriar Press, 1987 Various meanings Thaal offered to Nar Narayan at a Swaminarayan temple in Ahmedabad As a spiritual state prasƒÅda has a rich history of meanings in the Sanskrit tradition from Vedic literature onwards. In this textual tradition, prasƒÅda is a mental state experienced by gods, sages, and other powerful beings and is marked by spontaneous generosity and the bestowing of boons. In the earliest literature (Rig Veda) onwards PrasƒÅda is understood in this sense of a mental state, not as an aspect of ritual practice. In later texts such as the Shiva PurƒÅna, references to prasƒÅda as a material substance begins to appear alongside this older meaning.. PrasƒÅda is also the companion emotion to samvega (the emotion Siddartha felt on his first encounter with aging, illness, and death). PrasƒÅda is the emotion Siddartha felt on encountering the forest sramana: \\"a clear sense of serene confidence that one has found the way out\\" (Robinson, p. 7, 2005). Samvega stirs up the mind whereas prasƒÅda makes it calm. The two emotions provide a proper balance of each other: \\"samvega keeps prasƒÅda grounded in reality; prasƒÅda keeps samvega from turning into hopelessness\\" (ibid.) In its material sense, prasƒÅda is created by a process of giving and receiving between a human devotee and the divine god. For example, a devotee makes an offering of a material substance such as flowers, fruits, or sweets -- which is called naivedya. The deity then 'enjoys' or tastes a bit of the offering, which is then temporarily known as bhogya. This now-divinely invested substance is called prasƒÅda and is received by the devotee to be ingested, worn, etc. It may be the same material that was originally offered or material offered by others and then re- distributed to other devotees. In many temples, several kinds of PrasƒÅda (e.g., nuts, sweets) are distributed to the devotees. Practices Some strict Gaudiya Vaishnavas, most commonly initiated ISKCON devotees, will eat only prasƒÅdam, i.e., everything they eat is first offered to Krishna, not simply a few items as with most other Hindus. In addition, the cooking of prasƒÅdam is done without tasting, because it is not for the believer's own consumption, but to offer to Krishna -- they will receive the remnants of Krishna's food, which they consider to be non-different to Krishna. ISKCON temples are known for providing free prasƒÅda meals to all who come, as they believe that this is not only feeding the poor but providing them with Krishna's mercy as well.Bhagavad-Gita 3:13Bhagavad-Gita 9:27 One way that prasƒÅdam is commonly prepared is to place the food in offering before an image or deity of the spiritual figure to be honored, sometimes on a plate or serving vessel reserved only for spiritual purposes; and only then, after some time is allowed to pass, does the food become holy prasƒÅdam for further distribution. In Sikhism, parshad is served to the congregation after prayer without worship of a polytheistic deity. Parshad represents the same values as langar in that it is served indiscriminatorily.

It was used throughout the 19th century to protect approaches to the harbor of Portsmouth, New Hampshire and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery. The property and its surviving structures are now owned and operated by the State of Maine as Fort McClary State Historic Site, including a blockhouse dating from 1844. History Fort McClary blockhouse in 1997 Colonial period Coastal defenses on the site date to the late 17th century when shipbuilder William Pepperell (father of William Pepperrell) acquired the property and erected crude defense works in 1689. Prior to that, the village was protected by Fort William and Mary at Portsmouth. The Province of Massachusetts Bay voted in 1715 to erect a permanent breastwork of six guns for the defense of the Piscataqua River, during the lead-up to Father Rale's War. Some sources state that it was intended to protect Maine (then part of Massachusetts) from \\"unreasonable duties\\" (taxes) that the governor of New Hampshire was attempting to impose on nearby citizens of other colonies.Roberts, p. 367 The fort was also used to collect duties from Massachusetts citizens for its own upkeep.Fort McClary at American Forts Network This fortification was transferred to the United States government in 1803, known as Fort William, but none of its features are known to survive. The Pepperrells remained loyal to the British in 1775, so their property was confiscated by local Patriot forces, including the fort. In 1776, ammunition was provided for the fort's 9-pounder and 12-pounder cannon, and the New Hampshire militia manned the fort until 1779. Second system period Fort McClary was officially established in 1808 as part of the second system of US fortifications. It was named for New Hampshire native Major Andrew McClary, an American officer killed in the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill.Fort McClary at FortWiki.com It consisted of a semi-elliptical lower battery of 9 or 10 guns and a shot furnace, and an upper battery near the present blockhouse whose armament does not appear in references.Wade, p. 139 The fort was used throughout the 19th century, most notably during the War of 1812, but it saw no action. Third system and Civil War The fort was further expanded in the 1840s, probably a consequence of tensions with Great Britain over the disputed border between Maine and New Brunswick which culminated in the bloodless Aroostook War and the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty. The blockhouse was built in 1844 near the former upper battery; this was the last blockhouse built at a fort in Maine, and probably one of the last in a US coastal fort. The fort saw active use during the American Civil War, at which time it achieved much of its present structure due to a rebuilding under the third system that was never completed. The fort was manned near the start of the war by the Maine Coast Guard and the Kittery Artillery company, and in 1864 was also manned by the Maine State Guard. Its Civil War garrison notably included Vice President Hannibal Hamlin, who enlisted in Company A of the Maine State Guard as a private and served as a cook in the fort.New York Times, 8 July 1864, \\"Fort McClary Garrisoned, Vice-President Hamlin Among the Privates\\".Maine State Guard Companies mustered in 1864 Some subsequent citations erroneously confuse his unit with the Maine Coast Guard ‚Äî including a plaque at the fort.Maine State Archives, Civil War regimental correspondence The fort saw little action during the Civil War. A major rebuilding and expansion began in 1863 as part of the third system of fortifications, and the intent was to create a large five-sided fort with one or two tiers of cannon all around. However, only the seawalls were completed on the two seaward fronts, along with one of the landward cannon bastions with a granite magazine. The seawall was defended by a small caponier with rifle ports.Weaver, pp. 99‚Äì101 Based on war experience, masonry forts were assessed as vulnerable to rifled cannon, and funding was withdrawn from all masonry fort projects in 1867, leaving Fort McClary with few cannon positions. A large number of granite blocks remain at the fort to this day. Post Civil War to present Carronade in the Fort McClary blockhouse In the 1870s, the lower battery was rebuilt with three temporary gun positions for 10-inch Parrott rifles, but funding was again cut off with few other improvements. In the 1890s, nine 15-inch Rodman smoothbore guns and seven carriages were stored at the fort, to be mounted in case of war. Three of the Rodmans were mounted as an emergency measure in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. The fort was superseded by the construction of Fort Foster (Kittery, Maine) and new batteries at Fort Constitution under the Endicott Program by 1901. By the 1910s, most of the fort had fallen into disrepair and it was officially decommissioned in 1918. The State of Maine acquired most the property from the federal government in 1924, after which it was managed as a park. Several of the dilapidated structures were demolished in the following decades. Parts of the fort were used by civilian defense forces during World War II. In 1969, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The blockhouse and other structures were renovated in 1987, and the blockhouse serves as a museum.

The seminary opened in 1842 and received its official charter in 1847. The institution is independent and generally regarded as one of the more theologically conservative seminaries in the Episcopal Church (United States). It is also officially recognized by the Anglican Church in North America.https://anglicanchurch.net/seminaries/ Its campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. The oldest buildings on campus: Red Chapel and Blue House History Nashotah House was founded by three young deacons of the Episcopal Church; James Lloyd Breck, William Adams, and John Henry Hobart, Jr., who were all recent graduates of the General Theological Seminary in New York City, at the bidding of Bishop Jackson Kemper. Gustaf Unonius was the first graduate. Nashotah House was, from the beginning, a center for High Church thought and discipline. Breck, the first dean, was highly committed to the principles of the Oxford Movement. Later, noted professors such as James DeKoven would bring Anglo-Catholic worship and practice to the seminary. This began with the daily celebration of the Eucharist as well as the use of vestments, candles, and incense. Nashotah House considers itself to be within the orthodox Anglo- Catholic tradition. Overall, the faculty support traditional theology and conceptions of Christian doctrine in opposition to liberal theologies. Graduates themselves come from a variety of jurisdictions both inside and outside of the Episcopal Church. Nashotah House sees its mission to form priests and church leaders from all over the Anglican Communion. In February 2014, Bishop Edward L. Salmon, Jr. invited Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, to preach at the school. The decision was condemned by the seminary's largely conservative supporters who cited Schori's tactics of suing parishes that left the ECUSA over doctrinal matters, as well as what they considered her heretical views. In response, two bishops who were members of the Nashotah House Board of Trustees resigned or distanced themselves from the school.Mary Ann Mueller, \\"Katherine Jefferts Schori's Invitation to Nashotah House Stirs Hornet's Nest\\", VirtueOnline, February 22, 2014.

Academics Nashotah House offers a variety of degree and certificate programs aimed at training clergy and lay leaders for ministries in the Anglican Communion: *Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) *Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.) *Master of Divinity (M.Div.) *Master of Theological Studies (M.T.S.) *Master of Arts in Ministry (M.A. in Ministry) It also offers a one-year certificate program in Anglican studies, geared toward students who have received an M.Div. from a non-Anglican institution and wish to be ordained within the Anglican tradition. The M.A. in Ministry degree may be earned through a combination of residential and online study. The M.Div., M.T.S., S.T.M., D.Min. and M.A. in Ministry degrees are accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS). Campus The Chapel of St. Mary the Virgin The property of the Nashotah House Theological Seminary covers 365 acres (148 ha) of land. The main buildings of the seminary include, from oldest: *Chapel of St. Mary the Virgin, designed by James Douglas in Gothic Revival style and built in 1862. *Webb Hall (faculty and guest housing, the Chapel of Saints Peter and Paul), Gothic Revival style, built 1865 and added to in 1926 and 1950. *Shelton Hall (student housing), Gothic Revival style, built in 1869. Photo in box above. *Sabine Hall (faculty offices, student housing), designed by Alexander Eschweiler in Gothic Revival style, built in 1892, and expanded in 1910. *Lewis Hall (administration and faculty offices, the Saint Francis Oratory), designed by Eschweiler in Gothic Revival style and built in 1892. *Frances Donaldson Memorial Library, designed by John B. Sutcliffe in Collegiate Gothic style, built in 1911, and expanded in 1982. *Kemper Hall (classrooms, student housing, gymnasium), designed by Eschweiler & Eschweiler in Neogothic Revival style and built in 1956. *James Lloyd Breck Refectory, designed by Eschweiler & Eschweiler and built in 1965. There are also apartments for both single and married students, and several houses for the dean and other faculty, as well as maintenance facilities. Construction has been completed on a substantial addition to the refectory. The newly dubbed Adams Hall includes a large meeting hall and additional classrooms. Student life Interior of the Red Chapel Nashotah began as a community inspired by traditional monastic life of prayer, work, and study. James Lloyd Breck's vision was to create a center for Christian formation in the (then) wilderness that would also be movement to propagate other communities for the purpose of evangelizing the frontier. Today, much of this vision remains intact and students still live a Benedictine cycle of prayer, work, and study. The life of the Seminary seeks to form the character of priests and leaders into the image of Christ. Various students have been involved in mission work around the Anglican Communion as well. \\"Seminarians are invited to participate in an ascetic, disciplined, prayerful season of spiritual growth in Christ\\" in which they \\"practice the Benedictine Rule of daily prayer, labor, and study.\\"A Holy Renaissance All students have work crew assignments - cleaning bathrooms, mowing lawns, sweeping floors and taking other chores. Daily routine includes Morning Prayer, Mass, breakfast, classes, lunch, and Solemn Evensong. Always anticipated on the campus is the annual St. Laurence Cup, a flag football game played against students from Sacred Heart School of Theology and St. Francis Seminary (Wisconsin).The Missioner, Advent 2009 \\"Sacred Heartbreaker: Anglicans Fall to Romans 14-6\\", p. 7.

During a Finance Committee the MPs pressed ICT minister John Nasasira to explain how a private company, i3c, formerly, known as Computer Frontiers, came to own the country's domain name, a glitch that could endanger national security. The MPs resolved to contact the registrar of companies to furnish them with the details of the proprietors of i3c and asked the minister to explain the circumstances under which the company took over the domain.

This includes the making of both free and open- source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware. The process is generally facilitated by the Internet and often performed without monetary compensation. The goals and philosophy of the movement are identical to that of the open-source movement, but are implemented for the development of physical products rather than software. Open design is a form of co-creation, where the final product is designed by the users, rather than an external stakeholder such as a private company.

In late 1998, Dr. Sepehr Kiani (a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT) realized that designers could benefit from open source policies, and in early 1999 he convinced Dr. Ryan Vallance and Dr. Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications.R. Ryan Vallance, Bazaar Design of Nano and Micro Manufacturing Equipment, 2000 Together they established the Open Design Foundation (ODF) as a non-profit corporation, and set out to develop an Open Design Definition. The idea of open design was taken up, either simultaneously or subsequently, by several other groups and individuals. The principles of open design are closely similar to those of open-source hardware design, which emerged in March 1998 when Reinoud Lamberts of the Delft University of Technology proposed on his ‚ÄúOpen Design Circuits‚Äù website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software. Ronen Kadushin coined the title \\"Open Design\\" in his 2004 Master‚Äôs thesis, and the term was later formalized in the 2010 Open Design Manifesto.Alexander Vittouris, Mark Richardson. \\"Designing for Velomobile Diversity: Alternative opportunities for sustainable personal mobility\\" . 2012.  Current directions  Open Source Ecology, open source farming and industrial machinery The open-design movement currently unites two trends. On one hand, people apply their skills and time on projects for the common good, perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking, for developing countries or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies. On the other hand, open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who, without the copyleft mechanism, might not collaborate otherwise. There is now also a third trend, where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source (e.g. 3D printing) but customized local solutions for sustainable development.J. M Pearce, C. Morris Blair, K. J. Laciak, R. Andrews, A. Nosrat and I. Zelenika-Zovko, ‚Äú3-D Printing of Open Source Appropriate Technologies for Self-Directed Sustainable Development‚Äù, Journal of Sustainable Development 3(4), pp. 17-29 (2010). Open Design holds great potential in driving future innovation as recent research has proven that stakeholder users working together produce more innovative designs than designers consulting users through more traditional means. Open machine design as compared to open-source software The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future. In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects, because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually. It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate. However, there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing. Creating, testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort, time and cost required to create the physical artefact; although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced (see tools mentioned in the fab lab article).  Organizations  VIA OpenBook reference design CAD visualisation Open design is currently a fledgling movement consisting of several unrelated or loosely related initiatives.Thomas J.

The exposed geology of the Canyonlands area is complex and diverse; 12 formations are exposed in Canyonlands National Park that range in age from Pennsylvanian to Cretaceous. The oldest and perhaps most interesting was created from evaporites deposited from evaporating seawater. Various fossil-rich limestones, sandstones, and shales were deposited by advancing and retreating warm shallow seas through much of the remaining Paleozoic. Eroded sediment from a nearby mountain range later mixed with coastal dune and sand bar deposits. The end of the Paleozoic and the start of the Mesozoic saw the last seas start to leave the region for good. A subdued topography was dominated by flood plains and tidal flats. Now much further inland, the Triassic climate in the region was dry. Vast deserts covered much of that part of North America, except for one period when streams for a time fought the sand dunes. Wetter times returned. The uplifting of the Rocky Mountains starting in late Cretaceous - greatly affected the Canyonlands region. Erosion rates increased and further quickened the onset of the ice ages in the Pleistocene. Modern-day erosion occurs at a slower rate. Deposition of sediments Stratigraphy of Canyonlands area - USGS Hermosa Group A vast sea covered the region in early Pennsylvanian time. A basin in the area called Paradox Basin subsided and a mountain range called the Uncompahgre Mountains was uplifted to the east. Great quantities of seawater were trapped in the subsiding basin and water became increasingly saline in the hot and dry climate. Thousands of feet of evaporites (anhydrite and gypsum then halite) started to build up in the Mid Pennsylvanian and storms occasionally washed sediment from the nearby mountains. Fresh seawater periodically refilled the basin but was never able to flush out the very salty water there (the new water in fact floated on top of the brine). These beds were later lithified to become the Paradox Formation, which in turn is part of the Hermosa Group. Compressed salt beds from the Paradox started to flow plastically later in the Pennsylvanian and probably continued to move from then until the end of the Jurassic. Satellite-based measurements indicate that flow of salt and gypsum continues today to cause flexing and faulting of overlying osedimentary layers. The Paradox is up to 5000 feet (1520 m) thick in places and in the park is exposed at the bottom of Cataract Canyon as rock gypsum inter-bedded with black shale. Upward movement of the Paradox is also a possible theory for the creation of Upheaval Dome, although none of the Paradox is exposed on the dome, the predominant theory being a meteor crater. A warm shallow sea again flooded the region near the end of the Pennsylvanian. Limey oozes, sand, and mud were deposited on top of the salt-filled basin. These sediments became the fossil-rich limestones, sandstones, and shales of the gray-colored Honaker Trail Formation. Outcrops of the Honaker Trail can be seen near the bottom of deep canyons in the park, most notably along the Colorado River. A period of erosion then ensued, creating a break in the geologic record called an unconformity. Cutler Group Early in the Permian a transgressing (advancing) sea laid down the Halgaito Shale. Coastal lowlands returned to the area after the sea regressed (retreated), forming the Elephant Canyon Formation. These formations can now be seen in Cataract and Elephant Canyons. White Rim Sandstone overlaying Organ Rock Shale, Canyonlands, Utah.The Uncompahgre Mountains (Uncompahgre Plateau) were undergoing extensive erosion during this time. Large alluvial fans filled the basin where it met the range. The resulting Cutler red beds are made of iron- rich arkose sandstone. Underwater sand bars and sand dunes on the coast inter- fingered with the red beds and later became the white-colored cliff-forming Cedar Mesa Sandstone. Today these two competing rock units are exposed in a 4 to 5 mile (6.4 to 8 km) wide belt across the park, stretching from south of the Needles through the Maze and to the Elaterite Basin. Brightly colored oxidized muds were deposited on top of the Cedar Mesa and ranged in color from red to brown. These sediments eventually became the slope-forming Organ Rock Shale formation and can be seen in the Land of Standing Rocks part of the park. Coastal sand dunes and marine sand bars once again became dominant, creating the cross-bedded cliff-forming White Rim Sandstone. It is exposed as a topographic bench 1200 feet (365 m) below the top of Island in the Sky (thus earning its name) and along the White Rim Road. A fossilized offshore sand bar made of the White Cliff Sandstone is also exposed in the Elaterite Basin. A tarry dark-brown oil called elaterite seeps out of the structure, giving the basin its name. The Permian sea retreated, which exposed the land to a long period of erosion and thus created a second unconformity. Moenkopi and Chinle formations  The Permian through Jurassic stratigraphy of the Colorado Plateau area of southeastern Utah that makes up much of the famous prominent rock formations in protected areas such as Capitol Reef National Park and Canyonlands National Park. From top to bottom: Rounded tan domes of the Navajo Sandstone, layered red Kayenta Formation, cliff-forming, vertically jointed, red Wingate Sandstone, slope-forming, purplish Chinle Formation, layered, lighter-red Moenkopi Formation, and white, layered Cutler Formation sandstone. Picture from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Utah. Clastic red beds were laid down in shallow-water on top of the eroded Paleozoic surface early in the Triassic. These sediments were deposited on flood plains by streams on an expansive lowland that was slightly sloped in the direction of an ocean to the west. Mud built up in tidal flats to become the mudstone of Moenkopi Formation. Examples of this formation, some that still show fossilized ripple marks and mudcracks, can be seen in the northern and western parts of the park. Another period of erosion returned, creating a third unconformity. The brightly colored shales of the slope-forming Chinle Formation were laid down on top of this eroded surface. Petrified wood from the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle is sometimes found at the base of Chinle slopes. Glen Canyon Group Parting lineation, from lower right to upper left; Kayenta Formation, Canyonlands National Park. The Glen Canyon Group of formations includes (from oldest - lowest - to youngest) the *Wingate Sandstone, *Kayenta Formation, and the *Navajo Sandstone These formations are most prominently exposed in the western and northern sections of the park. Triassic climates progressively became dryer, prompting the formation of sand dunes that buried dry stream beds and their flood plain. This sand became the cliff-forming several hundred feet (many tens of meters) high and red-colored Windgate Sandstone. Outcrops tend to run for hundreds of miles (hundreds of kilometers) with few breaks, creating an impediment to human travel. For a time climatic conditions became wetter and streams cut channels through the sand dunes. Reddish-brown to lavender-colored sandstones interbedded with siltstones and shales constitute the resulting ledgy slope-forming Kayenta Formation. The youngest and therefore topmost formation in the Glen Canyon Group was formed after arid conditions returned to the region. A vast and very dry desert, not unlike the modern Sahara, covered 150,000 square miles (388,000 km¬≤) of western North America. Cross bedded sand dunes accumulated to great thickness, especially in the nearby Zion and Kolob canyons area (see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area), forming the buff to pale orange Navajo Sandstone. Navajo outcrops form cliffs, temples, and under certain conditions natural arches (such as Millard Canyon Arch) in the area. A fourth unconformity was created by a period of erosion. San Rafael Group Mud flats developed on top of the eroded surface of the Glen Canyon Group, forming the Carmel Formation. The massive cliff-forming Entrada Sandstone in turn was created on top of the Carmel. A long period of erosion stripped away most of the San Rafael Group in the area along with any formations that may have been laid down in the Cretaceous period. Uplift Starting 70 million years ago and extending well into the Cenozoic, a mountain-building event called the Laramide orogeny uplifted the Rocky Mountains and with it the Canyonlands region. Even though the strata were uplifted thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) they were left at more-or-less the same horizontally. Uplift- associated-jointing did occur and has since influenced erosional patterns. When ground water seeped into the salt beds of the Paradox Formation it carried away the topmost and more soluble salts, leaving gypsum. This process was so pronounced in ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Grabens‚Äô‚Äô that the overlying rock collapsed into voids left by escaping salt. Increased precipitation during the ice ages of the Pleistocene quickened the rate of canyon excavation. Canyon widening and deepening was especially rapid for the gorges of the Green and Colorado Rivers, which were in part fed by glacier-melt from the Rocky Mountains. Alluvial-fan-creation-landslides and sand dune-migration were also accelerated in the Pleistocene. These processes continue to shape the Canyonlands landscape in the Holocene (the current epoch), but at a slower rate due to a significant increase in aridity.

Jimmy was the 2009 Inductee for the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame Veterans category. Amateur career Carruthers's boxing career started as an Australian representative at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. In his first- round match of the bantamweight competition, he fought Fred Daigle of Canada and won on points. He defeated Arnoldo Par√©s of Argentina in his second match. However, he had sustained an eye injury during his bout with Par√©s, and had to withdraw from the quarter-final match with the eventual gold medalist Tibor Cs√≠k of Hungary.Jimmy Carruthers . sports-reference.com Professional career Carruthers joined the professional ranks in 1950, and was an immediate success. By then, he was being managed by Dr. Jim McGirr, and trained by \\"Silent\\" Bill McConnell. He won the Australian Bantamweight title in 1951 and then the British Commonwealth and Bantamweight Championship of the World the following year. Carruthers became Australia's first universally recognised boxing World Champion. Great Australians of the past‚Äîincluding Young Griffo, Mick King, and Les Darcy‚Äîhad all won world titles, but they had not received international acceptance at the time of winning their respective crowns. After defending his newly-won World bantamweight title against Vic Toweel in Johannesburg, and then against the American Henry \\"Pappy\\" Gault in Sydney, it was found that Carruthers was carrying a 30-foot-long tapeworm. He was matched for a world title bout against the New Zealand Bantamweight Champion Lyn Philp. For unclear reasons the fight never went ahead. After a non-title bout in Sydney, and a further title defence against Chamroen Songkitrat in Bangkok, Carruthers retired on 16 May 1954. Among the fighters he defeated were South African Vic Toweel (twice); Pappy Gault; Bobby Sinn and Chamroen Songkitrat. He made a brief comeback in Melbourne and Sydney in the early sixties in non-title fights, with his last fight in Wellington New Zealand in 1962 where he lost to Jimmy Cassidy. Personal He worked on the Sydney docks as a wharf labourer in the 1950s. Carruthers was married to Myra (n√©e Hamilton) until his death and is survived by four children - Boyd, Ginna, Dimiette and Lukas. During the 1950s he owned the colourful Bells Hotel in Sydney's Woolloomooloo. After that he had a number of businesses, including several vegetarian takeaway and juice bars in Sydney. In his last years Carruthers suffered from lung cancer and Parkinson's disease. He died on 15 August 1990. In 1995 he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame.

They are also widely known as setter methods. Often a setter is accompanied by a getter (also known as an accessor), which returns the value of the private member variable. The mutator method is most often used in object-oriented programming, in keeping with the principle of encapsulation. According to this principle, member variables of a class are made private to hide and protect them from other code, and can only be modified by a public member function (the mutator method), which takes the desired new value as a parameter, optionally validates it, and modifies the private member variable. Mutator methods can be compared to assignment operator overloading but they typically appear at different levels of the object hierarchy. Mutator methods may also be used in non-object-oriented environments. In this case, a reference to the variable to be modified is passed to the mutator, along with the new value. In this scenario, the compiler cannot restrict code from bypassing the mutator method and changing the variable directly. The responsibility falls to the developers to ensure the variable is only modified through the mutator method and not modified directly. In programming languages that support them, properties offer a convenient alternative without giving up the utility of encapsulation. In the examples below, a fully implemented mutator method can also validate the input data or take further action such as triggering an event. Implications The alternative to defining mutator and accessor methods, or property blocks, is to give the instance variable some visibility other than private and access it directly from outside the objects. Much finer control of access rights can be defined using mutators and accessors. For example, a parameter may be made read-only simply by defining an accessor but not a mutator. The visibility of the two methods may be different; it is often useful for the accessor to be public while the mutator remains protected, package-private or internal. The block where the mutator is defined provides an opportunity for validation or preprocessing of incoming data. If all external access is guaranteed to come through the mutator, then these steps cannot be bypassed. For example, if a date is represented by separate private \`year\`, \`month\` and \`day\` variables, then incoming dates can be split by the \`setDate\` mutator while for consistency the same private instance variables are accessed by \`setYear\` and \`setMonth\`. In all cases month values outside of 1 - 12 can be rejected by the same code. Accessors conversely allow for synthesis of useful data representations from internal variables while keeping their structure encapsulated and hidden from outside modules. A monetary \`getAmount\` accessor may build a string from a numeric variable with the number of decimal places defined by a hidden \`currency\` parameter. Modern programming languages often offer the ability to generate the boilerplate for mutators and accessors in a single line--as for example C#'s \`public string Name { get; set; }\` and Ruby's \`attr_accessor :name\`. In these cases, no code blocks are created for validation, preprocessing or synthesis. These simplified accessors still retain the advantage of encapsulation over simple public instance variables, but it is common that, as system designs progress, the software is maintained and requirements change, the demands on the data become more sophisticated. Many automatic mutators and accessors eventually get replaced by separate blocks of code. The benefit of automatically creating them in the early days of the implementation is that the public interface of the class remains identical whether or not greater sophistication is added, requiring no extensive refactoring if it is. Manipulation of parameters that have mutators and accessors from inside the class where they are defined often requires some additional thought. In the early days of an implementation, when there is little or no additional code in these blocks, it makes no difference if the private instance variable is accessed directly or not. As validation, cross-validation, data integrity checks, preprocessing or other sophistication is added, subtle bugs may appear where some internal access makes use of the newer code while in other places it is bypassed. Accessor functions can be less efficient than directly fetching or storing data fields due to the extra steps involved, however such functions are often inlined which eliminates the overhead of a function call.

Unlike Java, no explicit methods are defined; a public 'property' contains the logic to handle the actions. Note use of the built-in (undeclared) variable \`value\`. public class Student { private string name; /// /// Gets or sets student's name /// public string Name { get { return name; } set { name = value; } } } In later C# versions (.NET Framework 3.5 and above), this example may be abbreviated as follows, without declaring the private variable \`name\`. public class Student { public string Name { get; set; } } Using the abbreviated syntax means that the underlying variable is no longer available from inside the class. As a result, the \`set\` portion of the property must be present for assignment. Access can be restricted with a \`set\`-specific access modifier. public class Student { public string Name { get; private set; } } Common Lisp In Common Lisp Object System, slot specifications within class definitions may specify any of the \`:reader\`, \`:writer\` and \`:accessor\` options (even multiple times) to define reader methods, setter methods and accessor methods (a reader method and the respective \`setf\` method). Slots are always directly accessible through their names with the use of \`with-slots\` and \`slot-value\`, and the slot accessor options define specialized methods that use \`slot-value\`. CLOS itself has no notion of properties, although the MetaObject Protocol extension specifies means to access a slot's reader and writer function names, including the ones generated with the \`:accessor\` option. The following example shows a definition of a student class using these slot options and direct slot access: (defclass student () ((name :initarg :name :initform \\"\\" :accessor student- name) ; student-name is setf'able (birthdate :initarg :birthdate :initform 0 :reader student-birthdate) (number :initarg :number :initform 0 :reader student-number :writer set-student-number))) ;; Example of a calculated property getter (this is simply a method) (defmethod student-age ((self student)) (- (get-universal-time) (student-birthdate self))) ;; Example of direct slot access within a calculated property setter (defmethod (setf student-age) (new-age (self student)) (with-slots (birthdate) self (setf birthdate (- (get-universal-time) new-age)) new-age)) ;; The slot accessing options generate methods, thus allowing further method definitions (defmethod set-student-number :before (new-number (self student)) ;; You could also check if a student with the new-number already exists. (check-type new-number (integer 1 *))) D D supports a getter and setter function syntax. In version 2 of the language getter and setter class/struct methods should have the \`@property\` attribute. class Student { private char[] name_; // Getter @property char[] name() { return this.name_; } // Setter @property char[] name(char[] name_in) { return this.name_ = name_in; } } A \`Student\` instance can be used like this: auto student = new Student; student.name = \\"David\\"; // same effect as student.name(\\"David\\") auto student_name = student.name; // same effect as student.name() Delphi This is a simple class in Delphi language which illustrates the concept of public property for accessing a private field. interface type TStudent = class strict private FName: string; procedure SetName(const Value: string); public /// /// Get or set the name of the student. /// property Name: string read FName write SetName; end; // ... implementation procedure TStudent.SetName(const Value: string); begin FName := Value; end; end. Java In this example of a simple class representing a student with only the name stored, one can see the variable name is private, i.e. only visible from the Student class, and the \\"setter\\" and \\"getter\\" are public, namely the \\"\`getName()\`\\" and \\"\`setName(name)\`\\" methods. public class Student { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String newName) { name = newName; } } JavaScript In this example constructor-function \`Student\` is used to create objects representing a student with only the name stored. function Student(name) { var _name = name; this.getName = function() { return _name; }; this.setName = function(value) { _name = value; }; } Or (non-standard): function Student(name){ var _name = name; this.__defineGetter__('name', function() { return _name; }); this.__defineSetter__('name', function(value) { _name = value; }); } Or (if use prototypes for inheritance; ECMA-6!): function Student(name){ this._name = name; } Student.prototype = { get name() { return this._name; }, set name(value) { this._name = value; } }; Or (without using prototypes; ECMA-6): var Student = { get name() { return this._name; }, set name(value) { this._name = value; } }; Or (if using defineProperty): function Student(name){ this._name = name; } Object.defineProperty(Student.prototype, 'name', { get: function() { return this._name; }, set: function(value) { this._name = value; } }); Actionscript 3.0 package { public class Student { private var _name : String; public function get name() : String { return _name; } public function set name(value : String) : void { _name = value; } } } Objective-C Using traditional Objective-C 1.0 syntax, with manual reference counting as the one working on GNUstep on Ubuntu 12.04: @interface Student : NSObject { NSString *_name; } \\\\- (NSString *)name; \\\\- (void)setName:(NSString *)name; @end @implementation Student \\\\- (NSString *)name { return _name; } \\\\- (void)setName:(NSString *)name { [_name release]; _name = [name retain]; } @end Using newer Objective-C 2.0 syntax as used in Mac OS X 10.6, iOS 4 and Xcode 3.2, generating the same code as described above: @interface Student : NSObject @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *name; @end @implementation Student @synthesize name = _name; @end And starting with OS X 10.8 and iOS 6, while using Xcode 4.4 and up, syntax can be even simplified: @interface Student : NSObject @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name; @end @implementation Student //Nothing goes here and it's OK. @end Perl package Student; sub new { bless {}, shift; } sub set_name { my $self = shift; $self->{name} = $_[0]; } sub get_name { my $self = shift; return $self->{name}; } 1; Or, using Class::Accessor package Student; use base qw(Class::Accessor); __PACKAGE__->follow_best_practice; Student->mk_accessors(qw(name)); 1; Or, using the Moose Object System: package Student; use Moose; # Moose uses the attribute name as the setter and getter, the reader and writer properties # allow us to override that and provide our own names, in this case get_name and set_name has 'name' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str', reader => 'get_name', writer => 'set_name'); 1; PHP In this example of a simple class representing a student with only the name stored, one can see the variable name is private, i.e. only visible from the Student class, and the \\"setter\\" and \\"getter\\" is public, namely the \`getName()\` and \`setName('name')\` methods. class Student { private string $name; /* @return string The name. */ public function getName(): string { return $this->name; } /* @param string $newName The name to set. */ public function setName(string $newName): void { $this->name = $newName; } } Python This example uses a Python class with one variable, a getter, and a setter. class Student(object): # Initializer def __init__(self, name: str) -> None: # An instance variable to hold the student's name self._name = name # Getter method @property def name(self): return self._name # Setter method @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name >>> bob = Student(\\"Bob\\") >>> bob.name Bob >>> bob.name = \\"Alice\\" >>> bob.name Alice >>> bob._name = \\"Charlie\\" # bypass the setter >>> bob._name # bypass the getter Charlie Racket In Racket, the object system is a way to organize code that comes in addition to modules and units. As in the rest of the language, the object system has first-class values and lexical scope is used to control access to objects and methods. #lang racket (define student% (class object% (init-field name) (define/public (get-name) name) (define/public (set-name! new-name) (set! name new-name)) (super-new))) (define s (new student% [name \\"Alice\\"])) (send s get-name) ; => \\"Alice\\" (send s set-name! \\"Bob\\") (send s get-name) ; => \\"Bob\\" Struct definitions are an alternative way to define new types of values, with mutators being present when explicitly required: #lang racket (struct student (name) #:mutable) (define s (student \\"Alice\\")) (set- student-name! s \\"Bob\\") (student-name s) ; => \\"Bob\\" Ruby In Ruby, individual accessor and mutator methods may be defined, or the metaprogramming constructs \`attr_reader\` or \`attr_accessor\` may be used both to declare a private variable in a class and to provide either read-only or read-write public access to it respectively. Defining individual accessor and mutator methods creates space for pre-processing or validation of the data class Student def name @name end def name=(value) @name=value end end Read-only simple public access to implied \`@name\` variable class Student attr_reader :name end Read-write simple public access to implied \`@name\` variable class Student attr_accessor :name end Smalltalk age: aNumber \\" Set the receiver age to be aNumber if is greater than 0 and less than 150 \\" (aNumber between: 0 and: 150) ifTrue: [ age := aNumber ] Swift class Student { private var _name: String = \\"\\" var name: String { get { return self._name } set { self._name = newValue } } } Visual Basic .NET This example illustrates the VB.NET idea of properties, which are used in classes. Similar to C#, there is an explicit use of the \`Get\` and \`Set\` methods. Public Class Student Private _name As String Public Property Name() Get Return _name End Get Set(ByVal value) _name = value End Set End Property End Class In VB.NET 2010, Auto Implemented properties can be utilized to create a property without having to use the Get and Set syntax. Note that a hidden variable is created by the compiler, called \`_name\`, to correspond with the Property \`name\`. Using another variable within the class named \`_name\` would result in an error. Privileged access to the underlying variable is available from within the class.

As American industry converted from traditional units to SI in the late 20th century, the automotive industry responded by transitioning its auto and engine designs to be \\"metric\\" rather than \\"English\\". Characteristics A metric engine has one or more of the following characteristics: Tools * A metric engine may require metric tools for repair, such as wrench and socket sets designed to fit metric fasteners. Units * Displacement of the engine's cylinders measured in liters or cubic centimeters (cm¬≥). Previously, American engine displacement was most typically measured in cubic inches (in¬≥). Many classic American automobiles had engines popularly known by the displacement of their engine, such as the \\"350\\" Chevrolet Small-block, the Ford 302 and 427, or the Chrysler \\"426 Hemi\\". Beginning around the 1970s, most of the U.S. automakers began converting their engine designations from cubic inches to liters. Thus, in 1970, the V-8 engine in the Cadillac Eldorado grew to 500 cubic inches, but was badged \\"8.2 Liters\\" for the first time. Once this conversion was complete, engines worldwide were most commonly referred to by their displacement in liters. This conversion must have caused some marketing dilemmas: Ford's \\"302 Windsor\\" engine, which displaced approximately 4942 cc, became badged \\"5.0\\" after metric conversion. Some usage of cubic inches continues in the 21st century, such as in traditional American-style motorcycles; and the occasional new-era muscle car, such as the 2004 Dodge Viper, which boasted a 500 cubic inch (8,193 cc), 500 horsepower (373 kW) engine, or the Ford \\"427\\" concept car. In the case of such cars, the use of cubic inches, rather than the metric cubic centimeters, can be considered vestigial. Footnotes * The terms SI and metric system are not strictly interchangeable; the common \\"metric system\\" refers to a system of units based on powers of 10, for example the cgs system; while SI was originally based on the MKS system of units. However, such distinctions are not relevant in the typical engine repair facility.

In recent years, the .re TLD has been increasingly used for real estate‚Äìrelated domains (RE = Real Estate), including place names (neighborhoods, cities, countries, etc.), real estate companies, developers/projects, property-related websites, and individual realtors and estate agents around the world. The .re domain has also been applied to insurance and reinsurance companies (e.g. swiss.re), and words ending in .re (for example, adventu.re or nearfutu.re), similar to contractions used with other TLDs (for example, websites such as bit.ly and delicio.us), as well as use by those involved with reverse engineering, commonly shortened to the acronym \\"RE\\". Domains with the .re TLD can be registered with some of the largest online registrars such as Name.com, as well as most European domain registrars. Since 6 December 2011, the rules for registering French domains have changed. The owner of a domain does not need to be based in France anymore. All European individuals, companies and organizations can register French domains. This change affects not only fr- domains, but also .re domains. Two-character domains .re allows two- character domains with at least one number. So, m7.re or 42.re are acceptable, while fi.re is not.

The Russian alphabet internationalized country code is .—Ä—Ñ. Control of .ru is assigned to the Coordination Center for TLD RU (CC for TLD RU), the current official registry. On 1 January 2005, the former registry, the Russian Institute for Public Networks (RIPN), stopped new registrations directly under .ru, but still carried out registry operations for domain names under the second-level domains .com.ru, .net.ru, .org.ru and .pp.ru. The company RELCOM also proposes third-level registrations beneath various second-level domains such as .msk.ru (Moscow), while Macomnet Telcomint.ru proposes third-level registrations beneath .int.ru simultaneously.  Background  The creation of .ru in April 1994 was preceded by a historical agreement in 1993 known as \\"The order of RU top-level domain administration\\". According to the agreement, administrative and technical support responsibilities for the .ru domain were to be handed over to RIPN. In 2002, the administrative functions were handed over to CC for TLD RU.  Development of .ru  The ccTLD is developing rapidly under self- regulation. In 1993, an informal union was formed, known as the RU Top-Level Domain Coordination Group (RU TLD CG). The union includes the leading Russian ISPs as well as scientific and educational networks entrusted by RIPN with RU domain administration. In 1998, RIPN and RU TLD CG established a domain registration association. Subsequently, in 2000, a new system of domain name registration for .ru was introduced. It was a distributed system of second- level domain name registrations in .ru, through accredited registrars. The accredited registrars provide domain name registration and support services on a \\"first come, first served\\" basis to end-users. RIPN became one of four co- founders of CC for TLD RU, but continued to support centralized technical aspects of the operation of .ru. All organizational and administrative functions were handed over to CC for TLD RU. To preserve historical continuity, one of CC for TLD RU's committees was established on the basis of RU TLD CG. CC for TLD RU maintains domain name registration rules for .ru, the registrar accreditation procedure, and promotes perspective projects that involve the growth of .ru, whereas RIPN secures .ru technical base functions and supports DNS for the .ru DNS zone. The current distributed registration system was first tested in 2001 and subsequently implemented in 2005.  Second-level domains  Although direct registration of second-level domains is widespread, there are a number of second-level domains designated for third-level domain name registrations depending on organizational type and geographic location. The full list is published on the CC for TLD RU website.

The .io domain is administered by the Internet Computer Bureau, a domain name registry company based in the United Kingdom. Google's ad targeting treats .io as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because \\"users and webmasters frequently see [the domain] more generic than country- targeted.\\" History The top-level domain io has existed since 1997. The first subdomain was registered in 1998, when Levi Strauss & Co. registered the domain levi.io. Specifications Labels for .io domains may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens, and must be between 3 and 63 characters long. Domain names cannot begin or end with a hyphen symbol, and may not contain two consecutive hyphens. The entire domain name may not contain more than 253 characters., Domain names--Implementation and specification, P. Mockapetris (Nov 1987) Administration The right to administer domain names is given to approved organisations by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The Internet Computer Bureau (ICB) administers .io domains. This domain name registry is a British company, and operates for this purpose under the name NIC.IO. The company also holds the rights to sell the .sh and .ac domains, the top-level domains for the Islands of Saint Helena and Ascension, respectively. Registration and restrictions Individuals and organisations are allowed to register .io domains. Applicants for the registration of .io domains do not need to be registered or established in the British Indian Ocean Territory. Third-level domains, such as \\"xyz.com.io\\", can only be registered by an inhabitant of the area. (Since there are no legal, permanent inhabitants of the British Indian Ocean Territory, theoretically no third-level domains will be registered.) Any second-level domains used by NIC.IO and top-level domains cannot be used as a third-level domain. For example, the domains \\"com.com.io\\", \\"org.com.io\\", and \\"biz.com.io\\" are all restricted. Domain names in .io may not be used, \\"for any purpose that is sexual or pornographic or that is against the statutory laws of any nation.\\" If this requirement is breached, \\"NIC.IO reserves the right to immediately deactivate the offending registration.\\" .io domains may be registered for a minimum of one year, and a maximum of 5 years. Domain names in .io are priced higher than those in other TLDs. Registering an available .io-domain currently (at 3 September 2020) costs US$90 per annum. Usage The .io domain has considerable usage unrelated to the British Indian Ocean Territory. In computer science, \\"IO\\" or \\"I/O\\" is commonly used as an abbreviation for input/output, which makes the .io domain desirable for services that want to be associated with technology. .io domains are often used for open source projects, application programming interfaces (\\"APIs\\"), startup companies, video games, and other online services. The TLD is also used for domain hacks, as the letters \\"io\\" are an ending of many English terms. For example, Rub.io is a shortened URL that was used for the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign of Marco Rubio. One reason given for the TLD's popularity is that it stands out by being shorter than other TLDs. Also, the .io TLD is less occupied than other TLDs, so it is more likely that a given term is available there. In Italian, io is the first-person singular pronoun (English \\"I\\"), which makes the domain appealing for personal websites. In Esperanto io as an independent word is the assertive existential indefinite pronoun (English \\"something\\"). As a suffix, -io is used to terminate official names of countries or other kind of lands under which a community of people are grouped. The Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto include almost 500 terms like that, from Abisenio (former name of Ethiopia, Etiopio) to Zambio (Zambia). Derived from that, the suffix is also used to designate a community of people whose common interest is indicated by the suffixed root, especially in the term Esperantio, the community of speakers of the language and their culture as a whole, as well as the places and institutions where the language is used. As of May 2020, the esperant.io domain name itself redirect to Libera Folio, an independent generalist online bulletin written in Esperanto. A viral MMO game, Agar.io, spawned many similar MMO games like it that drew from its success, notably Diep.io, paper.io (although paper-io.com is now its home), wormax.io and wormax2.io, Surviv.io, Hole.io, Slither.io, and krunker.io. This trend of using \\".io\\" for these online video games has continued and can be considered an indicator for its category. Controversy According to a Gigaom interview with Paul Kane, chairman of the Internet Computer Bureau, the domain name registry is required to give some of its profits to the British government, for administration of the British Indian Ocean Territory.

Serangoon is bordered by these planning areas ‚Äì Sengkang to the north, Hougang to the east, Ang Mo Kio and Bishan to the west, as well as Toa Payoh to the south. Serangoon planning area has a total of seven subzones: Serangoon Central, Lorong Chuan, Upper Paya Lebar, Serangoon Garden, Serangoon North, Seletar Hills and Serangoon North Industrial Estate. Etymology Tamil Muslim traders from India pioneered the settlement of Serangoon in the early 19th century.Tamil Muslim traders pioneer settlement of Serangoon in early 19th century Serangoon Road was first identified as a bridle path in 1821, and by 1822 it had reached the present Woodsville Corner. A road was proposed in 1822 and by 1827, the road reached Sungei Serangoon (Malay for Serangoon River). It is difficult to say what the word Serangoon actually means. The most plausible view holds that it was derived from a small marsh bird, the burong ranggong in Malay, which was common in the swamps of Sungei Serangoon (formerly the Rangon River). It had a black back, white breast, long, sharp bill, grey crest, long neck and unwebbed feet. Indeed, in early maps of Singapore, the name of the area is called Seranggong, with Se being short for satu, or \\"one\\", in Malay. An alternative derivation is offered by Haji Sidek, an amateur etymologist interested in Malay place names, who speculates that the name Serangoon is derived from the Malay words diserang dengan gong, which means \\"to be attacked by gongs and drums\\". According to Haji Sidek, people used to go to Benut in Johore through the Serangoon area and had to use gongs to frighten off wild animals and snakes which used to roam the jungle covered area. Serang dengan gong gradually became Serangoon over the years. Siddique and Puru Shotam, however, argue that such as derivation meant that the name developed after the road, which is inconsistent with the fact that the term ranggong predates the development of the road. In the 1828 Franklin and Jackson's Plan of Singapore, there are three references to Rangung: Tanjong \\"Rangung\\", the River \\"Rangung\\" and the Island \\"Rangung\\". In Coleman's 1836 Map of Singapore, the names Tanjong Rangon and Rangon River can already be found. Rangong in Malay means \\"warped or shrunken\\", as of the plane of a wall, roof or decking. It is evident that the road cut from Selegi was named by the early references to \\"Rangung\\" in the north-east of the island ‚Äì one road linking the swamp bird area of ranggong ‚Äì hence \\"Serangoon\\". History Little India The northern tip of Serangoon Road is known as, in pinyin, nan sheng hua yuen pien (ÂçóÁîüËä±ÂúíÈÇä), or \\"fringe of garden in the south\\", which referred to the Chinese vegetable gardens in the Bendemeer area. This general area was also termed mang chai chiao (feet of the jackfruit) because of the many jackfruit trees which grew there. The Hokkien Chinese name for Serangoon Road was au kang in, meaning \\"back creek\\". The Chinese refer to Serangoon Garden as ang sali. The main occupants of the area were, however, the Indian community. Indians congregated here from 1826 to work in the brick kilns (‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æö‡ØÇ‡Æ≥‡Øà) and cattle industries situated here. The kilns were discontinued in 1860 and the cattle sheds were removed by the municipality in 1936. The area, however, remains predominantly Indian and today is known as \\"Little India\\", (‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æá‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Ææ) the locus of Singapore Indian retailing, everyday culture and festivities.

Consecration ceremony of the new temple took place on 8 February 1987. Development of Serangoon New Town began in 1982, with the first few HDB flats being built as Neighbourhood 3 and as a portion of Neighbourhood 2. Subsequently, Serangoon Central started development in 1984 and was completed in 1989. Transportation The original Serangoon bus interchange was opened on 13 March 1988 along Serangoon Central. It later relocated to nex on 3 September 2011. A large part of the North East MRT line runs in parallel with this arterial road. Stations that are located along this road are from Little India to Kovan. Education , this area has a total of 5 primary schools, 4 secondary schools and Nanyang Junior College.School Information Service Politics Serangoon Neighbourhood 1, some parts of Neighbourhood 2 and Serangoon Garden fall under the Aljunied GRC (Serangoon division), served by the Workers' Party, while the area surrounding Upper Paya Lebar Road lies within the Aljunied GRC Paya Lebar division. Prior to 2006, the Serangoon division belonged to the Marine Parade GRC, which administers Serangoon Neighbourhoods 2, 3 and 4 in the Braddell Heights division till this day. Neighbourhood 5 in Serangoon North falls under the Ang Mo Kio GRC (Jalan Kayu division).

Most of it became a part of Death Valley National Park when the park expanded in 1994. This area had previously been administered by the BLM. It is located northwest of Death Valley proper, south of Eureka Valley, and east of the Owens Valley. The valley's lowest elevations are about and it lies in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada Range, plus the Inyo Mountains bordering the valley on the west. Natural features Saline Valley A large dry lake occupies the center of the valley. The west end of the lake supports a salt marsh, which contains a variety of plant and animal life. The marsh is fed by a perennial stream from Hunter Canyon. North of the lake is a large area of low and sweeping sand dunes. There are a number of hot springs in the northeast corner of the valley. The water temperature at the source of these springs averages at 107 ¬∞F (42 ¬∞C). Saline Valley's three main warm springs are reached by a primary road known as the Warm Springs Road or Painted Rock Road. Lower Warm Springs is the largest, most developed, and most popular campground. Palm Spring is smaller and less crowded with great views of Saline Valley and the source feeds two tubs known as Wizard Pool and Volcano Pool. Upper Warm Spring, the smallest and least disturbed of the main springs, is a deep pool of lukewarm azure water surrounded by cattail, arrow- weed, and grasses, in full view of the Saline Range. Saline Valley is a closed or endorheic basin. If filled with water it would be over 4000 feet (1200 m) deep, form a lake with a surface area of roughly 500 square miles (1,300 km¬≤), and hold approximately of water. Saline Valley Road The drive through the Inyo National Forest (note marker on the left of the road) in the north heading south to Waucoba Wash (washboard roads) Saline Valley Road is a sporadically maintained dirt road running north‚Äìsouth through the length of the valley, and is the most commonly used access route. From SR 168 in the north to SR 190 in the south, it is 95 miles (153 km) long, and ranges in elevation from 1094 to 7593 feet (333 to 2314 m). It goes through two mountain passes: the Inyo Mountains in the north, and the Nelson Range in the south. The northern pass is higher, but is better maintained and is about 20 miles (30 km) closer to the hot springs. One or both passes may be closed during the winter due to snow, ice, or washouts. The \\"Road Closed\\" signs are often left in place year-round in an attempt to deter motorists who may not realize how treacherous the road is. It is not a Park Service Road, and Inyo County is responsible for its maintenance. The entire length of the road is passable by non-4WD vehicles under favorable conditions, but areas can be icy and impassable, and long stretches of road are extremely rough and surfaced by sharp-edged primitive rock gravel. High ground clearance, off-road tires, and mounted full-size spare tires are strongly recommended. History Salt tram in Saline Valley looking towards White Mountains in 1952 Salt Tram Summit Station in 1989 \\"The Dunes\\" of Saline Valley, California Palm Spring Saline Valley was inhabited in late prehistoric times by the Ko'ongkat√ºn Band of Timbisha Shoshone (also known as Panamint or Koso). One of their principal villages was known as Ko'on and located in Saline Valley, therefore the valley was named after the village and known as Ko'ongkat√ºn (Ko'on + kant√ºn - \\"possessing, characterized by\\" the village Ko'on) or simply Ko'on. The Timbisha Shoshone living at Ko'on were called Ko'ontsi (‚Ä≥People of the village Ko'on\\"). The village was abandoned in the early 20th century and the inhabitants moved to Darwin, California.The University of Utah - Shoshoni Language Project - Shoshoni Dictionary Saline Valley was a significant mineral source in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Conn and Trudo Borax Company mined borax from the salt marsh from 1874 to 1895. The remains of this site can be seen today as a few shallow pits near Saline Valley Road. Salt mining began in 1903 at the south end of the lake, and continued into the 1930s. An electric aerial tram was constructed in 1911 to carry the salt 14 miles (22 km) over the Inyo Mountains to a terminus northeast of Keeler, California in the Owens Valley. It operated sporadically from 1913 to 1936, but ultimately proved to be too expensive to run. The tram, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, was the steepest ever constructed in the United States. It rose from an elevation of 1100 feet (340 m) in Saline Valley to 8500 feet (2600 m) over the mountains, and then down to 3600 feet (1100 m). Route was south from Salt Lake to Daisy Canyon then southwest and terminated at the Southern Pacific RR between Dolomite and Swansea. In recent years it has been badly damaged by vandals. In the 1960s, the hot springs in the valley became popular among nudists, and were eventually improved by volunteer labor, to include concrete tubs, a shower, a sink, and three outhouses (which the Park Service later replaced with concrete-lined latrines). For improved access, two airstrips were built, the \\"Chicken Strip\\" and \\"Tail-Dragger Strip\\" (the latter is now closed). The Saline Valley Warm Springs, as they are called, have become controversial in recent years. The improvements would have violated Park Service policy if they had taken place today, and nudity is against park regulations. There has been compromise so far; a park host is always on duty, visitors are limited to 30 days per year, and the springs do not appear on any official NPS map. A \\"clothing optional\\" policy is still permitted at the springs, but nudity is frowned upon elsewhere at the site. The Timbisha Shoshone Indian tribe, which was displaced from the area in 1933, says it objects to the nudity at the springs, and will shut them down if it ever regains ownership of the valley. There are 3 sections of springs, the upper, middle and lower springs. The middle and lower springs have been developed with concrete soaking tubs and showers are present. The upper spring is in an undeveloped natural state. In late 2005, seismic activity disturbed the flow of water to the lower springs. The only functional section remaining after that was the middle springs. However, the flow appears to be returning to the lower springs. As of early 2007, flow is estimated to be about 50% of what it was before the earthquake, and is increasing, making both springs functional. In 2011, G. Gotham Smith's feature film 3.14... was shot in Saline Valley at both the warm springs and Willow Creek Camp. Saline Valley, looking west from a point near the Racetrack Playa in Death Valley National Park Military use Jets flying at high speeds and low altitudes are prevalent above the valley Low-flying jet aircraft have long been common in the valley. The airspace over the valley is part of the US military's vast R-2508 Special Use Airspace complex. The Saline Military Operating Area (MOA) covers the entire valley south to Hunter Mountain from 200' AGL up to FL180 with an ATCAA located over the same area extending from FL180 up to FL600. The airspace is used by military aircraft primarily from Nellis AFB, Edwards AFB, NAWS China Lake, and NAS Lemoore for high and low altitude mission training. Military aircraft utilize radio communications on either 256.8 MHz or 123.95 MHz while operating in the Saline MOA; however, military aircraft throughout the R-2508 complex often use 315.9 MHz when conducting low altitude operations below 1500' AGL. In December 2003, Edwards Air Force Base completed an environmental assessment for proposed construction and operation of a radar system and microwave repeater facility in the valley.

Written by David P. Harmon and directed by Joseph Pevney, it was first broadcast December 8, 1967. In the episode, strange radiation causes members of the crew of the Enterprise to age rapidly. Plot The USS Enterprise is ferrying a senior officer, Commodore Stocker, to Starbase 10 where he is due to assume command. On the way, the ship makes a stop at planet Gamma Hydra IV to resupply the research station there. A landing party consisting of Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, Chief Engineer Scott, navigator Ensign Chekov, and Lieutenant Arlene Galway beam down to the facility. The station seems completely deserted, until Ensign Chekov discovers the body of a man who apparently has died of old age, and panics. Robert Johnson, a member of the station crew, appears with his wife Elaine. Both claim to be in their late 20s, yet appear 50 years older. The two soon die in the Enterprise sickbay. Mr. Spock and civilian scientist Dr. Janet Wallace begin an investigation. Their only clue is a comet that passed Gamma Hydra IV recently. Soon the landing party, with the exception of Chekov, begin to age rapidly as well. Lt. Galway ages most rapidly and soon dies. By now they have learned that the comet gave off low-level radiation that most likely caused the aging effect. As Kirk continues to age, he becomes increasingly forgetful, including ordering the use of an obsolete code despite having recently been told the code had been broken by the Romulans. This leads Commodore Stocker to order Spock to convene a hearing, in which Kirk is found unfit to command. With Spock also afflicted, Stocker assumes command, and orders a direct course to Starbase 10, ignoring warnings that this will take the ship through the Romulan neutral zone. Meanwhile, Kirk, McCoy, and Spock discuss Chekov's immunity to the affliction. Remembering Chekov's fright at the discovery of the dead body, McCoy surmises that Chekov's increased adrenaline levels may have had some effect, and recalls that adrenaline had once shown promise as a treatment for radiation sickness. Mr. Spock and Dr. Wallace, assisted by Nurse Chapel, begin work on an adrenaline-based compound to test on the landing party. As Enterprise enters the neutral zone, Romulan vessels attack, ignoring all attempts at contact. Stocker, having no field command experience and paralyzed with indecision, considers surrendering, but is reminded that Romulans do not take prisoners. In sickbay, Spock announces that the drug is ready, warning that it may kill as well as cure. Kirk insists on taking the first injection. The drug reverses the aging effect, and Kirk races to the bridge to relieve Stocker. Kirk bluffs the Romulans by sending a message to Starfleet Command, deliberately using the broken code, warning that Enterprise will self-destruct using the \\"corbomite device\\", which will also destroy any nearby ships. The Romulans move to a safe distance, giving Enterprise room to make a surprise escape. Production and reception DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy) said of the make-up used in this episode, \\"I only worked half days on that show because I was in makeup the other half. I'd sit in the chair for a while, then I'd take a break, go to the john, come back and they'd work some more. It was a tremendous makeup effort. There were three makeup men working on me all the time, on my hands and on my face. Leonard [Nimoy] was lucky on that show. He was blessed by the fact that Vulcans don't age as fast as humans.\\" Critic Darren Mooney notes that the aging in the episode focuses on the negative, physical process, and none of the grace and enjoyment of life's accomplishments. Part of this focus on the physical aspects of aging came from associate producer Robert Justman's notes to producer Gene Coon where he details the steps of Kirk's aging. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B-\\" rating, noting the focus on the physical aspects of aging, saying, \\"Nobody learns a valuable lesson about how getting old is just a natural part of life.\\" References External links  *\\"The Deadly Years\\" Remastered version at TrekMovie.com Category:Star Trek: The Original Series (season 2) episodes Category:1967 American television episodes Category:Films scored by Sol Kaplan ","title":"The Deadly Years"},{"id":"1113887","text":"B√©on is the name of several communes in France: * B√©on, Ain * B√©on, Yonne ","title":"B√©on"},{"id":"1113889","text":"The Crown Heights riot was a race riot that took place from August 19 to 21, 1991, in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York City. Black residents turned against Orthodox Jewish Chabad residents, resulting in a deterioration of already tense racial relations in the densely populated community. The riots began on August 19, 1991, after two children of Guyanese immigrants were accidentally struck by one of the cars in the motorcade of Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the leader of Chabad, a Jewish religious movement. One child died and the second was severely injured. In the wake of the fatal accident, some black youths attacked several Jews on the street, seriously injuring several and fatally injuring an Orthodox Jewish student from Australia. Two weeks after the riot, a non-Jewish man was killed by a group of black men; some believed that the victim had been mistaken for a Jew. The riots were a major issue in the 1993 mayoral race, contributing to the defeat of Mayor David Dinkins, an African American. He was blamed for an ineffective police response. Ultimately, black and Jewish leaders developed an outreach program between their communities to help calm and possibly improve racial relations in Crown Heights over the next decade.\\"Beep Honor Peace Coalition: Crown Heights leaders reflect on 10-year milestone\\", New York Daily News, August 23, 2001. Causes Car crash At approximately 8:20 pm on Monday, August 19, 1991, Yosef Lifsh, 22, was driving a station wagon with three passengers west on President Street, part of the three-car motorcade of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement. The procession was led by an unmarked police car with two officers, with its rooftop light flashing. The police car and Schneerson's automobile crossed Utica Avenue on a green light and proceeded along President Street at a normal speed, but Lifsh's vehicle had fallen behind. Not wishing to lose sight of Schneerson's car, Lifsh either crossed Utica Avenue on a yellow light or ran a red light. There was no indication of the exact speed of his vehicle. Lifsh's vehicle struck a car being driven on Utica Avenue, veered onto the sidewalk, knocked a 600-pound (275 kg) stone building pillar down and pinned two children against an iron grate covering the window of a first-floor apartment in a four-story brick building (). Seven-year-old Gavin Cato, the son of Guyanese immigrants, who was working on his bicycle chain while on the sidewalk near his apartment on President Street, died instantly. His seven- year-old cousin Angela Cato, who was playing nearby, survived but was severely injured. Lifsh believed he had the right of way to proceed through the intersection because of the police escort. Lifsh said he deliberately steered his car away from adults on the sidewalk, toward the wall, a distance of about , in order to stop the car. Lifsh later said that the car did not come to a full stop when it hit the building, but slid to the left along the wall and hit the children. Death of Gavin Cato Accounts differ as to the next sequence of events. After the collision, Lifsh said that the first thing he did was to try to lift the car in order to free the two children beneath it. Members of the EMS unit, who arrived on the scene about three minutes after the accident, said that Lifsh was being beaten and pulled out of the station wagon by three or four men.Girgenti Report, 1:79‚Äì81. A volunteer ambulance from the Hatzolah ambulance corps arrived on the scene at about 8:23 pm, followed by police and a City ambulance. The latter took Gavin Cato to Kings County Hospital, arriving at 8:32 pm; Cato was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Volunteers from a second Hatzolah ambulance helped Angela Cato, until a second City ambulance arrived and took her to the same hospital. Two attending police officers, as well as a technician from the City ambulance, directed the Hatzolah driver to remove Lifsh from the scene for his safety, while Gavin Cato was being removed from beneath the station wagon. According to The New York Times, more than 250 neighborhood residents, mostly black teenagers, many of whom were shouting \\"Jews! Jews! Jews!\\", jeered the driver of the car and turned their anger on the police. Some members of the community were outraged because Lifsh was taken from the scene by a private ambulance service while city emergency workers were still trying to free the children who were pinned under the car. Some believed that Gavin Cato died because the Hatzolah ambulance crew was unwilling to help non-Jews. There was a rumor at the time that Lifsh was intoxicated. A breath alcohol test administered by police within 70 minutes of the accident indicated this was not the case. Other rumors circulating shortly after the accident included: Lifsh was on a cell phone, Lifsh did not have a valid driver's license, and that police prevented people, including Gavin Cato's father, from assisting in the rescue of the children.

Accessed December 27, 2016. \\"Around 11:00 p.m., someone reportedly shouted, 'Let's go to Kingston Avenue and get a Jew!'\\" A number of black youths set off westward toward Kingston Avenue ( away from Utica Avenue), a street of predominantly Jewish residents several blocks away, vandalizing cars, and throwing rocks and bottles as they went. Viewpoints After the death of Gavin Cato, members of the black community believed that the decision to remove Lifsh from the scene first was racially motivated. They also said that this was one example of a perceived system of preferential treatment afforded to Jews in Crown Heights. The preferential treatment was reported to include biased actions by law enforcement and uneven allocations of government resources, amongst others. Many members of the black community were concerned that the number of Jews in the community had increased and that they were buying all of the property in the crowded area. A number of studies focused on the allegation that law enforcement habitually favored Jews over African Americans. City Journal refuted the allegation. An interview with Rabbi Shmuel Butman, published in 1991, mentions a police directive to Hatzolah to transport Lifsh, along with Jews already injured by rioters, without transporting either of the Cato children. \\"We did exactly what the police officers wisely advised us.\\" Based on protesters' statements and actions during the rioting, Butman said, \\"We were always hoping that after World War II no Jew would ever be killed just for being Jewish, but this is what happened in the city of New York.\\" In his eulogy at the funeral, the Rev. Al Sharpton referred to \\"diamond dealers\\" (a Jewish business) and said, \\"It's an accident to allow an apartheid ambulance service in the middle of Crown Heights.\\" A banner was displayed at the funeral that said, \\"Hitler did not do the job.\\" Edward S. Shapiro, a historian at Brandeis University, later described the riot as \\"the most serious anti- Semitic incident in American history\\" and published a book about it in 2006. He notes that there are many interpretations of what happened: Riots and murders Yankel Rosenbaum killing About three hours after the riots began, early on the morning of August 20, a group of approximately 20 young black men surrounded Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Jewish University of Melbourne student in the United States conducting research for his doctorate. They stabbed him several times in the back and beat him severely, fracturing his skull. Before being taken to the hospital, Rosenbaum identified 16-year- old Lemrick Nelson Jr. as his assailant in a line-up shown to him by the police. Rosenbaum died later that night because the doctor didn't notice a stab wound in his chest. Nelson was charged with murder as an adult;Under New York State law, 16-year-olds can be charged as adults for homicide. he was acquitted at trial. Later he was convicted in federal court of violating Rosenbaum's civil rights and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Nelson eventually admitted that he had stabbed Rosenbaum. Rioting For three days following the accident, numerous African Americans and Caribbean Americans of the neighborhood, joined by growing numbers of non-residents, rioted in Crown Heights. In the rioting of the ensuing three days, according to Edward Shapiro, many of the rioters \\"did not even live in Crown Heights.\\" During the riots, Jews were injured, stores were looted, and cars and homes were damaged. The rioters identified Jewish homes by the mezuzot affixed to the front doors. An additional 350 police officers were added to the regular duty roster on August 20 and were assigned to Crown Heights in an attempt to quell the rioting. After episodes of rock- and bottle-throwing involving hundreds of blacks and Jews, and after groups of blacks marched through Crown Heights chanting \\"No Justice, No Peace!\\", \\"Death to the Jews!\\", and \\"Whose streets? Our streets!\\", an additional 1,200 police officers were sent to confront rioters in Crown Heights. On the third day of the disturbances, Al Sharpton and Sonny Carson led a march.Berger, Paul. \\"In Crown Heights, Residents Still Cling to Their Grievances\\". The Jewish Daily Forward. forward.com. August 19, 2011. The marchers proceeded through Crown Heights carrying antisemitic signs and burning an Israeli flag.Shapiro, Edward S. Crown Heights: Blacks, Jews, and the 1991 Brooklyn Riot. UPNE, 2006): 38-40. Rioters threw bricks and bottles at police; shots were fired at police and police cars were pelted and overturned, including the Police Commissioner‚Äôs car. Riots escalated to the extent that a detachment of 200 police officers was overwhelmed and had to retreat for their safety. On August 22, over 1,800 police officers, including mounted and motorcycle units, had been dispatched to stop the attacks on people and property. By the time the three days of rioting ended, 152 police officers and 38 civilians were injured, 27 vehicles were destroyed, seven stores were looted or burned, and 225 cases of robbery and burglary were committed. At least 129 arrests were made during the riots, including 122 blacks and seven whites. Property damage was estimated at one million dollars. Related shooting murder On September 5, two weeks after the riot had been controlled, Anthony Graziosi, an Italian sales representative with a white beard dressed in dark business attire, was driving in the neighborhood. As he stopped at a traffic light at 11 pm, six blocks away from where Yankel Rosenbaum had been murdered, a group of four black men surrounded his car and one of them shot and killed him. It was alleged by Graziosi's family and their attorney, as well as Senator Al D'Amato, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, former Mayor Ed Koch, and a number of advocacy organizations, that Graziosi's resemblance to a Hasidic Jew precipitated his murder. The New York Police Department, Mayor Dinkins, newspaper columnist Mike McAlary, and the U.S. Justice Department did not agree. The murder was not treated as a hate crime.Crown Heights: Blacks, Jews, and the 1991 Brooklyn riot, Edward S. Shapiro, University Press of New England, 2006, p. 57. Court case A grand jury composed of 10 black, 8 white, and 5 Hispanic jurors found no cause to indict Lifsh. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes explained that under New York law, the single act of \\"losing control of a car\\" is not criminal negligence, even if death or injury resulted. Lifsh waived immunity and testified before the grand jury. About an hour after hearing Lifsh‚Äôs testimony, the grand jury voted not to indict him. Subsequently, Lifsh moved to Israel, where his family lives, because he claimed his life was threatened. In Israel, Lifsh settled in the Lubavitch village of Kfar Chabad. Afterwards, Hynes fought unsuccessfully for the public release of the testimony that the grand jury had heard. His lawsuit was dismissed, and the judge noted that more than three-quarters of the witnesses who had been contacted refused to waive their right to privacy. The judge also expressed concern for the witnesses' safety. Aftermath Impact on the 1993 mayoral race The Crown Heights riot contributed to the defeat of David Dinkins in his second mayoral bid.Spencer, B. (2000). The Death of American Antisemitism, p. 52 He was attacked by many political adversaries in his reelection bid, including vocal proponents of \\"black nationalism, back-to- Africa, economic radicalism, and racial exclusiveness.\\" Girgenti Report On November 17, 1992, New York Governor Mario Cuomo gave the Director of Criminal Justice Services, Richard H. Girgenti, the authority to investigate the rioting and the Nelson trial. The Girgenti Report was compiled by over 40 lawyers and investigators. The 656-page document, dated July 1993, is available through a website of the Washington, DC-based Police Foundation, which prefaces the report with a disclaimer that the \\"review does not seek to put blame on any entity for what happened...\\" The report was extremely critical of Police Commissioner Lee Brown. The report also criticized Mayor Dinkins for poor handling of the riots. However, the report found no evidence to support the most severe charge against Dinkins and Brown: that they had purposely delayed the police response in order to allow rioters to \\"vent\\" their rage.Martin Gottlieb \\"The Crown Heights Report: The Overview\\", The New York Times, July 21, 1993. The first night of the riot, Dinkins, along with Police Commissioner Brown, both African Americans, went to Crown Heights to talk to the community to dispel the rumors about the circumstances surrounding the accident. They had no appreciable influence on the rioters, most of whom were young black men. In a 16-minute speech on the Thanksgiving holiday following the riot, Dinkins rebutted allegations that he had prevented police from protecting citizens in Crown Heights. The Jewish community believed Dinkins failed to contain the riot and failed to exercise his responsibility, to their detriment.Cohen, D. N. \\"Crown Heights Jews feel vindicated by report\\". Jewish Tribune (Rockland County, NY), July 23‚Äì29, 1993.) Use of the term \\"pogrom\\" The Crown Heights riot was an important issue that was raised repeatedly on the campaign trail in the 1993 mayoral election.Interpretations of the Crown Heights Riot, Edward S. Shapiro, American Jewish History, Volume 90, Number 2, June 2002, pp. 97‚Äì122. According to Edward S. Shapiro, politicians opposed to Mayor Dinkins used the word \\"pogrom\\" to characterize the riot in order to discredit the mayor's response to the riot, writing \\"the controversy over how to define the Crown Heights riot was not merely an issue of semantics.\\" Rudy Giuliani, who would be elected as the next mayor of New York, referred to the Crown Heights riot as a \\"pogrom\\" on July 1, 1993, in a speech at Bay Ridge, Brooklyn: \\"You can use whatever word you want, but in fact for three days people were beaten up, people were sent to the hospital because they were Jewish. There's no question that not enough was done about it by the city of New York. One definition of pogrom is violence where the state doesn't do enough to prevent it.\\"Daily News, July 1, 1993. Other political opponents to Dinkins used the term, including Ed Koch, who had been defeated by Dinkins in the 1989 Democratic mayoralty primary, and Andrew Stein, a candidate in the 1993 Democratic mayoral primary. The term had been used previously in 1991 by journalists such as A. M. Rosenthal in The New York Times and Eric Breindel in the New York Post, and politicians such as New York City Councilman Noach Dear and later by Judah Gribetz, president of the JCRC of New York. By September 1991, it had become routine within Jewish circles to describe the riot as a pogrom. Some Jews continued to use this term for the riot a decade later, as shown by articles in publications such as Jewish Week, Jerusalem Post, The Forward and The Jewish Press; others went further and called it \\"America's Kristallnacht\\". Use of the word was rejected by Dinkins and his supporters, primarily on the basis that a pogrom by definition is state-sponsored. Dinkins said \\"To suggest that this is [a pogrom] is not to contribute to the resolution of the problem but to exacerbate tensions and problems that are there.\\" Dinkins was personally offended by the use of \\"pogrom\\" since it insinuated that the riot was state-sanctioned and that he personally was an antisemite. \\"I am incensed by it... [it is] patently untrue and unfair.\\" Michael Stanislawski, Professor of Jewish History at Columbia University, wrote in 1992 that it was \\"historically inaccurate\\" to couple \\"pogrom\\" with Crown Heights, because the word denoted organized violence against Jews \\"having some sort of governmental involvement.\\" Journalists also disagreed with the use of the term, including Joyce Purnick in The New York Times, Earl Caldwell in the New York Daily News, and an article in The City Sun. Rev. Al Sharpton said that Giuliani was engaged in \\"race-baiting\\" by using the word \\"pogrom.\\" Henry Siegman and Marc D. Stern of the American Jewish Congress also publicly rejected use of the term to refer to the riot. In 2011, shortly before the twentieth anniversary of the riots, an editorial in The Jewish Week wrote: \\"A divisive debate over the meaning of pogrom, lasting for more than two years, could have easily been ended if the mayor simply said to the victims of Crown Heights, yes, I understand why you experienced it as a pogrom.\\" Ethnic relations Prior to the riots, Eastern Parkway divided the black community in northern Crown Heights and the Jewish community in southern Crown Heights. Efforts aimed at the improvement of the relations between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights began almost immediately following the rioting. Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden summoned the leaders of each of the ethnic communities to Borough Hall within days after the riots ended, creating what became known as the Crown Heights Coalition. The Coalition, led by Edison O. Jackson, then President of Medgar Evers College, and Rabbi Shea Hecht, Chairman of the Board of the National Committee for Furtherance of Jewish Education (NCFJE), operated for ten years as an inter-group forum in which to air neighborhood concerns and work out issues. Golden used the Coalition to initiate interracial projects designed to promote dialogue. One project involved sending a Jewish leader and a Black leader together in a pair to public intermediate and high schools in the area to answer questions from the children about each other's cultures. A week after the riots, Hatzolah helped repair an ambulance of a black-owned volunteer service. The following year, the Brooklyn Children's Museum held an exhibit on the contributions made by blacks and Jews in New York. In 1993, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was active in promoting improved black-Jewish relations.Jerome A. Chanes, \\"Review of the Year: Intergroup Relations\\", American Jewish Year Book (American Jewish Committee, 1994), p. 123. In 1993, a series of neighborhood basketball games were scheduled between the two groups, including a scrimmage held as part of the halftime entertainment of a New York Knicks vs. Philadelphia 76ers professional basketball game. Also that year, rabbi Israel Shemtov, whose anti-crime patrol had long been perceived by many black residents as biased against them, rushed to the aid of a black woman who had been shot on the street in Crown Heights, putting her in his car and taking her to the hospital. The Crown Heights Mediation Center was established in 1998 to help resolve local differences, also a direct outcome of the Coalition.Conflict Control, The Jewish Week, November 13, 1998. Anniversary commemorations On August 19, 2001, a street fair was held in memory of Cato and Rosenbaum, and their relatives met and exchanged mementos of hopes of healing in Crown Heights. Again in 2016, family members Carmel Cato and Norman Rosenbaum planned to meet together to commemorate their loss. Twenty years after the riot, a Manhattan synagogue invited Sharpton to participate in a panel discussion marking the anniversary. Norman Rosenbaum, brother of the murdered Yankel Rosenbaum, was outraged, saying inviting Sharpton to speak was \\"an absolute disgrace\\" and that his \\"vile rhetoric incited the rioting.\\" He added that Sharpton \\"did absolutely nothing then to improve black-Jewish relations ‚Äî and nothing since.\\" Sharpton expressed regret for some aspects of his involvement. He insisted that his marches were peaceful, although his language and tone \\"sometimes exacerbated tensions.\\"Chung, Jen. \\"Al Sharpton Regrets How He Handled Crown Heights Riot Reaction\\". Gothamist. gothamist.com. August 21, 2011. Klein, Dan. \\"Al Sharpton: I made ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô during Crown Heights riots\\". Jewish Telegraphic Agency. jta.org. August 22, 2011. In a 2019 speech to a Reform Jewish gathering, Sharpton said that he could have \\"done more to heal rather than harm\\". He recalled receiving a call from Coretta Scott King at the time, during which she told him \\"sometimes you are tempted to speak to the applause of the crowd rather than the heights of the cause, and you will say cheap things to get cheap applause rather than do high things to raise the nation higher\\". Demographics To this day, the demographic trends of Crown Heights remain largely the same as in 1991. Jews did not flee from Crown Heights, and the Lubavitch population of Crown Heights increased after the riot, leading to an expansion of the area in which they reside.Crown Heights: Blacks, Jews, And the 1991 Brooklyn Riot, by Edward S. Shapiro, p. xvii. In popular culture * On the sketch comedy show In Living Color, the 1991 season 3 premiere episode did a sketch parodying West Side Story called Crown Heights Story.

After joining the British Army in 1839, he saw service, as a second captain, in South Africa. In 1858, as a major, he was appointed Secretary of a Royal Commission set up to examine the state and efficiency of British land-based fortifications against naval attack; and this led to further work in Canada and South Australia. From 1875 to 1888 he was, consecutively, Governor of the Straits Settlements, Governor of South Australia and Governor of New Zealand. Early life Born on 10 September 1821 in Cowes in the Isle of Wight, Jervois was the son of General William Jervois (pronounced \\"Jarvis\\"), and his wife Elizabeth Jervois n√©e Maitland. Belonging to a military family of Huguenot descent, he was educated at Dr. Burney's Academy, Gosport, before entering the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Military service Upon graduating from Woolwich, Jervois was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in March 1839. From then until 1841, Jervois was trained at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham. In 1842, having been promoted to lieutenant the year before, Jervois was sent to South Africa where he served as a brigade major. As a second captain he saw service in the 7th Xhosa War, 1846‚Äì1847 during which he drew military sketches of British Kaffraria (now part of the Eastern Cape Province) in South Africa. Returning to Britain in 1848, he commanded a company of Sappers and Miners at Woolwich and then in June 1849 was ordered to Alderney with instructions to manage the construction of substantial fortifications. Following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to inspect the progress of the fortifications in 1854, he was promoted to the rank of major. Having been refused permission to go to the Crimea he returned to London in January 1855, he became the Commanding Royal Engineer (Major) for the London District and Assistant Inspector-General of Fortifications in April the following year. Jervois became Secretary of a Royal Commission set up on 20 August 1859 to examine the state and efficiency of British land-based fortifications against naval attack. It was specifically tasked to consider Portsmouth, Spithead, the Isle of Wight, Plymouth, Portland, Pembroke Dock, Dover, Chatham and the Medway. The commission's report was published on 7 February 1860. Amongst other things, it proposed several options for a ring of defences around London, none of which were adopted, although elements were used in the later London Defence Scheme. Jervois went on to oversee the design of the resulting fortifications that became known as the Palmerston Forts. Promotion to lieutenant colonel came in 1861, and in 1864 and 1865, he was sent to Canada to review its fortifications and at the conclusion of his inspection he submitted what became a politically controversial report that stated that the Great Lakes and Upper Canada were not defensible. He then lectured about iron fortifications, and inspected and provided advice regarding the defences of various British colonies including Gibraltar and the Andaman Islands. He was promoted to colonel in 1867. In 1871 he was sent to India; and then worked on the defences of Cork harbour, which were completed in 1874. Following the withdrawal of British garrison troops from Australia in 1870, Jervois and Lieutenant Colonel Peter Scratchley were commissioned by a group of colonies to advise on defence matters. They inspected each colony's defences and produced the Jervois- Scratchley reports of 1877 and 1878. These emphasised the importance of shore- based fortifications to defend against naval attack and also led to the establishment of local infantry and artillery units. In the 1880s many of the reports' recommendations were implemented by the various colonial governments and they went on to form the basis of defence planning in Australia and New Zealand until Federation. Jervois was raised to the rank of major general in 1877; he received a final promotion to lieutenant general in 1882. Diplomatic career Governor of the Straits Settlements In April 1875, Jervois was appointed the Governor of the Straits Settlements, a British dependency which included Penang, Malacca and Singapore. He took office in Singapore on 8 May 1875, and served until 3 April 1877. Decisions he made during his tenure cemented Britain's foothold on the Malay peninsula; he was instrumental in the formation of a local militia and the quelling of a Malay uprising. Although distrustful of Malays, he was sympathetic to the Chinese and would later bolster public support for oriental immigration during his time as Governor of South Australia. Governor of South Australia During an 1877 inspection of Australian maritime defences, Jervois was appointed Governor of South Australia. He was given notice of his \\"promotion\\" while in Melbourne in June, although the true reason for his reassignment was that the Colonial Office disliked his interference on the Malay mainland. Jervois arrived in South Australia on HMS Sapphire on 2 October 1877. Jervois arrived in the colony during a time of political crisis. Later in October, the Colton Ministry resigned over a disagreement with the Legislative Council about the new Parliamentary buildings. Jervois resisted the pressure to dissolve parliament, and James Boucaut became Premier. Jervois' term also coincided with unusually good rainfall and a massive agricultural expansion. He laid the foundation stones of the University of Adelaide, the Institute and the Art Gallery, and commissioned a new vice-regal summer residence at Marble Hill. Governor of New Zealand Jervois then served as Governor of New Zealand from 1883 to 1888. In this role, Jervois provided advice on harbour defence, guided the colonial government on Imperial matters, was active in the country's social life, and worked to promote equality. He officiated at the opening of Auckland University College in 1883, declaring that it would be accessible to all New Zealanders, and recognised the service of nurses in the Zululand conflict, awarding a Royal Red Cross to a New Zealand woman for the first time. He also engaged with the Maori leadership. He also served as president of the New Zealand Institute and patronised many sporting institutions, including the New Zealand Amateur Rowing Association. Later life At the conclusion of his term as governor-general in New Zealand, Jervois returned to England in 1889. The following year, he was appointed to serve on the Stanhope Commission, which again reviewed the state of Britain's fortifications. He returned to New Zealand briefly in 1892, before being appointed the colonel commandant of the Royal Engineers the following year. His wife, Lucy, with whom he had had three daughters and two sons since their marriage in 1850, died in 1895. Jervois died on 17 August 1897, at the age of 75, as a result of injuries sustained in a carriage accident and was buried at Virginia Water, Surrey. Honours Jervois received numerous honours for his military and diplomatic service. He was invested Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1863, Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1874, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1888. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1888. Several streets were also named after him, including: Jervois Quay in Wellington, and Jervois Close and Jervois Road in Singapore.

Founded in 1912, it represented the more moderate wing of the labour movement. In 1916 it joined with other political groups to establish the modern Labour Party.  Origins  The United Labour Party has its origins in the first Labour Party, a distinct organisation from the modern one. The first Labour Party had been established in 1910 after the perceived failure of its predecessor, the Independent Political Labour League. The Labour Party represented the moderate wing of the labour movement, with the Socialist Party representing the more radical faction.  Initial unification  By 1912 there was growing recognition that the division of the labour movement was costing votes, and a \\"unity conference\\" was called. The Socialists and the associated Federation of Labour (the \\"Red Feds\\") refused to attend, however, saying that they would continue to advocate their more hard-line positions. As such, the Unity Conference consisted only of the Labour Party, various moderate trade unions, and independent labour candidates. At the conclusion of the conference, it was agreed that the Labour Party, the moderate unions, and a number of independents would together form a new party. The new group was called the United Labour Party. The outcome of the conference was slightly disappointing for its organisers, as it had been hoped that the Socialists would join, but hopes for the new party were nevertheless high. Later the same year, the Waihi miners' strike occurred. The labour movement was split, with hard-liners praising the strikers and moderates condemning the action as dangerous and misguided. The United Labour Party took the latter path, believing that cautious negotiation was more effective than militant action. The strike was eventually suppressed by the government of William Massey, with one miner being killed. The strike created much disunity in the labour movement, and many believed that active measures were necessary to bring the movement closer together. As such, another \\"Unity Conference\\" was called in 1913. This time, the Socialist Party was willing to attend. After extensive negotiations, it was decided that the labour movement should speak with a single voice, and that the United Labour Party and the Socialist Party should merge. The new party would be called the Social Democratic Party. The union elements of the United Labour Party would be merged with the Socialist- affiliated Federation of Labour to produce the new United Federation of Labour.  Fractionalization  Some members of the United Labour Party did not accept the decision to merge, however. Of particular concern to them was a clause in the Social Democratic Party's charter that obliged it to support strikes in certain circumstances. These members decided to remain outside the Social Democrats, and continued to use the United Labour label. They became unofficially known as the United Labour Party Remnant. The Remnant officially repudiated the more Marxist tendencies that the Social Democrats had inherited from the Socialist Party, and promoted arbitration as a better alternative to strike action. The Remnant considered itself to be vindicated when, later in the year, the Social Democrats were thrown into disarray by a heavy-handed government response to dockworkers' and miners' strikes. In the 1914 elections, the United Labour Party Remnant won three seats in Parliament, with the victorious candidates being Alfred Hindmarsh, Bill Veitch, and Andrew Walker while the Social Democrats won two seats, and a labour-aligned independent John Payne won another seat.  Creation of the present Labour Party  Despite the differences between the United Labour Party Remnant and the Social Democrat Party, the two worked together in Parliament after the 1914 election. Alfred Hindmarsh of the United Labour Party served as the leader of the six labour-aligned MPs. Gradually, this increased co-operation caused the ULP Remnant and the SDP to conclude that full unification was not impossible, and in 1916, the two finally came together (along with various independents) to form the Labour Party, which still survives today.

History of PEBCO After an increase in the cost of living for the Black population in Port Elizabeth ‚Äì following a 100% rent-fee price hike in the late 1970s ‚Äì the residents of Port Elizabeth decided to organise themselves and form an organisation that would challenge socio-economic injustices that were meted out on Black people including the apartheid regime. On the 10 October 1979, after having officially established the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO), a public meeting was held where it was decided that a protest against the increase in rent, transport, fuel and lighting, township services charges and food costs be held.Msila, V. (2014) A Place to Live: Red Location and its history from 1903 to 2013. SUN PRESS PEBCO's immediate aims and demands were: to fight for equal rights for all people of Port Elizabeth; to fight all discriminatory legislation enacted by the government and local authorities; to seek participation in decision making on all matters affecting the people of South Africa; to fight for the granting of the right to Blacks to buy land under freehold title at any place of their choice; and to resist any attempt, direct or indirect, to deprive Blacks of their South African citizenship.Houston, G.F. (1999) The National Liberation Struggle in South Africa: A Case Study of the United Democratic Front 1983-1987. Aldershot:Ashgate Their fundamental aim included the creation of one municipality for the whole of Port Elizabeth, therefore rejecting the system of community councils and separate municipalities for Blacks and Whites.Msila, V. (2014) A Place to Live: Red Location and its history from 1903 to 2013. SUN PRESS The Disappearance The 1980s proved to be a volatile period for activism in Port Elizabeth and as such, leaders of PEBCO were detained for short stints from time to time. In 1980, five of its leaders were detained, including Thozamile Botha, the founding member, who in the previous year ‚Äì 1979 ‚Äì was dismissed at the Ford Company in New Brighton for his political involvement and organising workers on site. He soon left the country in May 1980 to join the ANC in exile, leaving his comrade Qaqawuli Godolozi as PEBCO's new president. Five years later, on 8 May 1985, three members ‚Äì Sipho Hashe, Champion Galela, and Qaqawuli Godolozi ‚Äì disappeared from the airport in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. This was due to the fact that PEBCO had now affiliated itself with the United Democratic Front (UDF), which was believed by some at the time to be an internal wing of the then- banned African National Congress (ANC). As a result of the three's disappearance, the Consumer Boycott Committee organised a huge consumer boycott which began in July 1985. Although it was strongly suspected that the Security Police had something to do with the three activists' disappearance, nothing was known of their fate of until November 1997. The Confession On 11 November, former Security Police Officer Colonel Gideon Nieuwoudt,News24 https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Nieuwoudt-charged-for-Pebco-3-20040211 while applying for amnesty during a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing, confessed to participating in the beating, robbery, and murder of the PEBCO Three. According to his testimony, Nieuwoudt lured the three men by having a paid police informant pose as a British embassy official interested in providing a cash donation to PEBCO call Sipho Hashe at his home. The informant convinced Sipho and his two friends to come to the airport to pick up the donation. (Nieuwoudt later refused to name the informant for fear of his safety.) The three men were apprehended by members of the Security Police and taken to an abandoned police station on a farm at Post Chalmers, near Cradock. They were then interrogated, stripped of their possessions, beaten, sedated, and finally strangled. The bodies were burned and the remains were thrown into the nearby Fish River. Eugene de Kock a former head of section C1 at the Vlakplaas farm north of Pretoria where many of these atrocities occurred ‚Äì in his submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) about the death of the PEBCO Three ‚Äì admits to this and writes that in late 1985 there began an altercation between two members of his Vlakplaas team, sergeant Joe Mamasela and warrant officer Gert Beeslaar who had been involved in an operation in Port Elizabeth in which the PEBCO Three were murdered.Msila, V.

The use of the term is most active in Canada. Use of the term outside Canada is sporadic but significant. The term appears especially well established in Russia and China, with agrologists on university faculty lists and agrology curricula. Agrology is synonymous with agricultural science when used in Canada, is nearly synonymous with the U.S. term agronomy, and has a meaning related to agricultural soil science when used outside Canada. Canada The term agrologist was coined by Dr. J. B. Harrington and adopted in 1946 to fill the need in Canada to have a term to denote \\"provincial agriculturalist\\". The title of Professional Agrologist is conferred on persons with at least a Bachelor's Degree in Agriculture and who can demonstrate the qualities needed to responsibly teach, practise, or conduct experiments and research in the agricultural sciences. According to the Agricultural Institute of Canada website, an agrologist can also hold a degree in a field related to agriculture, or in some provinces pass rigorous prescribed examinations to attain a professional designation. Agrology is a regulated profession in all Canadian provinces. Agrology designations are managed by separate governing bodies in each province, with each operating under its own legislation. Agrology refers to agricultural science and agricultural economics when used in Canada; however, the definition is not limited application of science to agriculture. Because of the extensive history of agricultural research into land and water resources, the definition in Canada includes applications science to management and conservation of land and water resources, and habitat. The Registrars of Professional Agrologists across Canada adopted the following definition of Agrology in May 2007: \\"Agrology is the practice of bioresource sciences to provide knowledge and advice to support the development of the agriculture sector and the health of the society, environment, and economy.\\" Outside Canada Outside of Canada, the term agrology is synonymous with soil science and is not in common usage in English-speaking countries. Agrology in soil science society glossaries Two national member societies (Canadian, American) of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) maintain and publish glossaries of scientific terms. Other soil science societies defer to the American glossary. The term agrology is not in use. Edaphology or crop edaphology in combination with soil management would be the preferred approach used by soil scientists to concisely describe soil science as it applies to crop production. Agrology dictionary definitions , no dictionary definition of agrology is yet consistent with the Canadian use of the term and dictionary definitions fall into one of four categories. # agrology is defined as synonymous with soil science. The root agr- is represented as meaning soil. # agrology is defined as synonymous with soil science, but the context implies that soil science is a subdiscipline of agricultural science. # agrology is defined as the subdiscipline of soil science as it applies to crop production. This would make agrology synonymous with the term crop edaphology. # agrology is defined as the subdiscipline of agronomy that considers the influence of soil.

Punk ideologies are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the punk subculture and punk rock. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles. It was primarily concerned with concepts such as mutual aid, against selling out, egalitarianism, humanitarianism, anti- authoritarianism, anti-consumerism, anti-corporatism, anti-war, decolonization, anti-conservatism, anti-globalization, anti-gentrification, anti-racism, anti-sexism, gender equality, racial equality, health rights, civil rights, animal rights, disability rights, free-thought and non- conformity. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range of anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies are often left-wing and go against right-wing authoritarian ideology. Punk ideologies are usually expressed through punk rock music and lyrics, punk literature such as amateur fanzines, spoken word performances or recordings, punk fashion, or punk visual art. Some punks have participated in direct action, such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades, squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, graffiti, vandalism and public and business property destruction. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, protests or boycotts. They support and squat in urban and rural collective houses with held group funds in common. Punk fashion was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the status quo. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear accessories, clothing or have tattoos that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement. An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to selling out, which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward pop (e.g. electropop) and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly rock (e.g. pop rock) in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of authenticity is important in the punk subculture‚Äîthe pejorative term poseur is applied to those who try to associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying core values or philosophy. Because anti-establishment attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of independent record labels, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of major labels. The do it yourself (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression DIY was coined by commentators after the fact. On religious issues, punk is mostly atheist or skeptic, but some punk bands are theist and have promoted religions or spirituality such as Christianity, Islam, Umbanda, the Rastafari movement, Neo-Paganism, Buddhism, Vedanta or Krishna.  Specific ideologies and philosophies  The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).  Anarchism  A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol. There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed \\"peace punks\\" or \\"anarcho-punks.\\" While some well-known punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Exploited had songs about anarchy, notably the Pistols' \\"Anarchy in the UK\\", they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.Glasper, Ian (2006), The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984, Cherry Red publishing, Anarcho-punks typically believe in direct action. Many anarcho-punks are pacifists (e.g. Crass and Discharge) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, squatting, legal graffiti, culture jamming, ecotage, freeganism, boycotting, civil disobedience, hacktivism and subvertising. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. Conflict). This manifests itself as rioting, illegal graffiti, vandalism, wire cutting, hunt sabotage, participation in Class War-style activities, melee weapons and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: Aus-Rotten, Dave Insurgent, Crass, Subhumans (British band), Colin Jerwood, and Dave Dictor.  Animal rights and veganism  In the 1980s, both straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho- punk in the United Kingdom became associated with animal rights. Consequently, vegetarianism and veganism became a feature of the punk subculture. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe.  Apoliticism  Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band Charged GBH and the singer G.G. Allin, although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song \\"Violence Now\\". Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: glam punk, psychobilly, horror punk, punk pathetique, deathrock and pop punk. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including The Dictators, Ramones (which featured staunch conservative Johnny Ramone alongside liberal activist Joey Ramone), New York Dolls, Television, Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers, and Richard Hell & The Voidoids.  Christianity  Christian punk is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the Christian music industry, while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently Crashdog, Ballydowse and The Psalters, the latter two of whom identified as Christian anarchists. Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include Altar Boys, The Crucified, Five Iron Frenzy, Flatfoot 56, and pop-punk band MxPx, who earned a gold record in 1998.  Conservatism  A small number are conservative, rejecting leftist- anarchism, liberalism, communism and socialism in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include Johnny Ramone, Dee Dee Ramone, Forgotten Rebels, Billy Zoom, Joe Escalante, Bobby Steele, Duane Peters and Dave Smalley. Some Christian punk and hardcore bands have conservative political stances, in particular some of the NYHC bands.

It's where she first saw David Bowie when she was 14 and it made her want to be a singer..  Feminism  Riot grrrl is an underground feminist punk movement that began during the early 1990s within the United States in Olympia, Washington and the greater Pacific Northwest. Riot grrrl is a subcultural movement that combines feminism, punk music and politics. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as having grown out of the riot grrrl movement, and has recently been seen in current fourth-wave feminist punk music. Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, classism, anarchism and female empowerment. Primary bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Skinned Teen, Emily's Sassy Lime and Sleater- Kinney, as well as queercore groups such as Team Dresch and the Third Sex.  Hare Krishna  The Filipino punk band the Wuds which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to Hare Krishna movement. In the 1990s, some notable members of the New York hardcore scene, including Ray Cappo (Youth of Today, Shelter and other bands), John Joseph (Cro-Mags) and Harley Flanagan (Cro-Mags) converted to Hare Krishna. This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.  Islam  Taqwacore is a punk subgenre centred on Islam, its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include Alien Kulture, The Kominas and Secret Trial Five.  Liberalism  Liberal punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the liberal left. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: Joey Ramone, Fat Mike of NOFX, Ted Leo, Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, Crashdog, Dropkick Murphys, Hoxton Tom McCourt, Jared Gomes of Hed PE, Tim Armstrong of Rancid and Tim McIlrath of Rise Against. Some punks participated in the Rock Against Bush movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate John Kerry.  Libertarianism  Libertarian (or right-libertarian) punks advocate free market capitalism, a minimal government and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band Antiseen, Exene Cervenka, Krist Novoselic founding member of Nirvana and Mojo Nixon have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative, Michale Graves has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.  Neo-Nazism  Nazi punks have a white nationalist ideology that is closely related to that of white power skinheads. Ian Stuart Donaldson and his band Skrewdriver are credited with popularizing white power rock and hatecore (for its hateful lyrical themes), or Rock Against Communism. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as Sid Vicious and Siouxsie Sioux, who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as Swastikas for shock or comedy value.  Nihilism  Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, nihilism was a fixture in some early punk rock and protopunk. The Sex Pistols were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the Trouser Press Record Guide writing that their \\"confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio- political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands.\\"Robbins, Ira, \\"Sex Pistols\\", in The Trouser Press Record Guide, 4th ed., ed. Ira Robbins, p.585, Collier, 1991. However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though \\"much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said\\", so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.  Situationism  Flyer for DUST happening circa. 1992 The Situationist International (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the United Kingdom.Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. Malcolm McLaren introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band Sex Pistols. Vivienne Westwood, McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around Hulme and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' Jamie Reid's distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.  Socialism  The Clash were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing socialism to the punk scene. Clash frontman Joe Strummer said of his socialist views \\"I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism.\\" Some of the original Oi! bands expressed a rough form of socialist working class populism ‚Äî often mixed with patriotism. Many Oi! bands sang about unemployment, economic inequality, working class power and police harassment. In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with Red Wedge. Notable socialist punks include: Attila the Stockbroker, Billy Bragg, Bruce La Bruce, Garry Bushell (until the late 1980s), Chris Dean, Gary Floyd, Jack Grisham, Stewart Home, Dennis Lyxz√©n, Thomas Mensforth, Fermin Muguruza, Alberto Pla, Tom Robinson, Seething Wells, Paul Simmonds, Rob Tyner, Joe Strummer, Ian Svenonius, Mark Steel and Paul Weller (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: \\"... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function\\".  Straight edge  Straight edge originated in the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene with the Minor Threat song \\"Straight Edge\\" written by frontman Ian MacKaye and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drug use. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from caffeine, casual sex and meat. Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the hardline subculture. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: Tim McIlrath, CM Punk and Davey Havok.  Ideological Conflict Within Punk Subculture  Due to the ethos of non-conformity, and anti-establishment, anti-corporate, and anti-authoritarian values that gave rise to the punk subculture, groups and individuals that self-identify as being a part of the punk subculture, while holding right-wing views (such as those associated with the Conservative Punk website), libertarian views, neo- Nazi views (Nazi punk), or are apolitical (e.g., horror punk), may often be considered by others within the punk scene to not be legitimately a part of it, but, rather, only using the fashion and visual aesthetics of the subculture. This conflict of ideological values has resulted in a the prevalence of a sentiment that it isn't possible to be both right wing and punk at the same time, among much of the punk scene, considering the two to be incompatible and mutually exclusive. A notable example of this phenomenon manifesting in the punk music scene can be seen in an incident that occurred during the 2016 American Music Awards, where the punk rock band Green Day chanted anti-conservative, anti-racist, and anti-fascist messages, in response to current events, Another example of this push against right-wing ideology in punk culture, occurred during a show by the celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys, where bassist and singer, Ken Casey, tackled an individual that gave a nazi- salute. Shortly after the incident, Casey spoke to the audience, stating \\"Nazis are not fucking welcome at a Dropkick Murphys show\\". Band member Tim Brennan later reaffirmed this sentiment.. Of additional note is the song \\"Nazi Punks Fuck Off\\" by hardcore punk band, Dead Kennedys, which has come to be considered an anti-nazi anthem.  Criticism of punk ideologies  Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. The Clash occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs \\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\\" and \\"Death or Glory\\". Crass's song \\"White Punks on Hope\\" criticizes the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accuses Joe Strummer of selling out and betraying his earlier principles. Their song \\"Punk is Dead\\" attacks corporate co-option of the punk subculture. Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra wrote many songs, such as Nazi Punks Fuck Off, criticizing aspects of the punk subculture: \\"Punk ain't no religious cult Punk means thinking for yourself You ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...‚Äù'' Misfits frontman Michale Graves, who cofounded the Conservative Punk website, argued that punks have become \\"hippies with mohawks\\". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism. The English Maoist organisation, the Progressive Cultural Association published a track called \\"Punk Rock Is Fascist\\", which says punk rock is part of a reactionary plot to spread fascism by diverting youth's energy away from revolutionary activities. They also claim punk acts as part of the divide and rule stratagem of American imperialism by creating both a Generation gap and pitting youth against each other. One of its founders, the classical composer, Cornelius Cardew, called The Clash \\"Reactionary\\". In their book The Rebel Sell, Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter argue that counterculture politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argue that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.

The act is reputed to have sparked the riot that led to the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which included the English Civil War. Background Title page of The Book of Common Prayer, Scotland 1637 Since the early years of the 17th century, the Scottish Church had been established as an Episcopal Church on the same basis as its English cousin the Anglican Church, but was far more puritan, both in doctrine and practice. In 1633 King Charles I came to St Giles' to have his Scottish coronation service, using the full Anglican rites, accompanied by William Laud, his new Archbishop of Canterbury. In the years that followed he began to consider ways of introducing Anglican-style church services in Scotland. The King arranged a Commission to draw up a prayer book suitable for Scotland, and in 1637 an Edinburgh printer produced: These developments met with widespread opposition. Incident The first use of the prayer book was in St Giles' on Sunday 23 July 1637, when James Hannay, Dean of Edinburgh, began to read the Collects, part of the prescribed service, and Jenny Geddes, a market-woman or street-seller, threw her stool straight at the Minister's head. Some sources describe it as a \\"fald stool\\" or a \\"creepie-stool\\" meaning a folding stool as shown flying towards the Dean in the illustration, while others claim that it was a larger, three-legged cuttie-stool. As she hurled the stool she is reported to have yelled: \\"\\" meaning \\"Devil cause you colic in your stomach, false thief: dare you say the Mass in my ear?\\" This was the start of a general tumult with much of the congregation shouting abuse and throwing Bibles, stools, sticks and stones. John Prebble reports the phrase \\"Daur ye say Mass in my lug?\\" as being addressed to a gentleman in the congregation who murmured a dutiful response to the liturgy, getting thumped with a Bible for his pains, and describes Jenny as one of a number of \\"waiting-women\\" who were paid to arrive early and sit on their folding stools to hold a place for their patrons. Officers summoned by the Provost ejected the rioters, who, for the rest of the service, stayed to hammer at the doors and throw stones at the windows. Jacobite Broadside engraving, supposedly of Jenny Geddes' stool 17thC folding stool, Royal Museum of Scotland More serious rioting in the streets (and in other cities) followed, and the Provost and magistrates were besieged in the City Chambers, to the extent that it became necessary to negotiate with the Edinburgh mob. At the suggestion of the Lord Advocate Thomas Hope it appointed a committee known as the Tables to negotiate with the Privy Council. Characteristically, Charles turned down the Tables' demands for withdrawal of the Anglican liturgy and more riots ensued with talk of civil war. This led to widespread signing of the National Covenant in February 1638, with its defiance of any attempt to introduce innovations like the Prayer Book that had not first been subject to the scrutiny of Parliament and the General Assembly of the Church. In November of the same year, the bishops and archbishops were formally expelled from the Church of Scotland, which was then established on a full Presbyterian basis. Charles reacted by launching the Bishops' Wars, thus beginning the Wars of Three Kingdoms. In the aftermath of the riots definitive evidence is hard to come by, and some doubt if Geddes started the fight or if she even existed, but she remains a part of Edinburgh tradition and has long had a memorial in St Giles. The sculpture that was added recently shows a three-legged cuttie-stool rather than a folding stool. Lord Barrett of Newburgh wrote of the riot on 29 August 1637, \\"I hear they were by the women beaten out of the church with their little stools (which it seems their custom is to sit upon).\\"HMC 4th Report: Earl de la Warr (London, 1874), p. 293. Around 1787, Robert Burns named his mare after Jenny Geddes and wrote amusingly of this faithful horse. Commemoration Jenny Geddes Plaque In 1886 a plaque was erected to Geddes's memory in St Giles' Cathedral. It was paid for by the philanthropist Robert Halliday Gunning.

This area became settled by Europeans after a gold-bearing reef was discovered in 1886 and sparked the gold rush that gave rise to the establishment of Johannesburg. The large black townships of the East Rand were the scene of heavy clashes between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party before the end of Apartheid. The region extends from Germiston in the west to Springs in the east, and south down to Nigel, and includes the towns of Boksburg, Benoni, Brakpan, Kempton Park, Edenvale, and Bedfordview. As part of the restructuring of municipalities in South Africa at the time, the local governments of the East Rand were merged into a single municipality in 1999, called City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality, meaning \\"place of peace\\". Despite having a separate municipal government, like the West Rand, the East Rand is included as the part of the Witwatersrand urban area. To this end, the East Rand shares the same dialling code as Johannesburg (011 locally) and the same metropolitan route numbering system as Johannesburg (and the West Rand).

The man the Americans called the \\"boxer with the educated left hand\\" received his due when he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998 at a ceremony held in Los Angeles, recognised as one of the greatest boxers never to have won a world title. Dave was the 2009 Inductee for the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame Veterans category. Early life Born at Burnt Bridge Mission Kempsey, New South Wales, fifth of eight children of George Ritchie, a rodeo-rider and timber-cutter of mixed Aboriginal and European descent, and his Aboriginal wife Mabel, n√©e Russell. Sands' brothers Clement, Percival, George, Alfred and Russell also boxed, emulating their father and their maternal great-uncle Bailey Russell, a noted bare-knuckle fighter. In 1939 Percy travelled to Newcastle to train with Tom Maguire, At the age of 15 Sands joined Percy training with Maguire and both lived at Maguire's gym. Dave and his five brothers took on the Sands name, taken off a train guard \\"Snowy\\" Sands who helped Percy Ritchie, travel to fight fare free in 1940. Career Without Maguire's knowledge, Dave fought a four-round preliminary bout in August 1941 at Newcastle Stadium, swinging his way to victory in the first round. Maguire disapproved, but quickly transformed him into a skilled boxer. By the end of 1942 he had knocked out a dozen opponents at Newcastle. On 11 August 1945 he married 18-year-old Bessie Emma Burns at St Paul's Church of England, Stockton, New South Wales. Sands was soon boxing in twelve-round matches before excited crowds of up to ten thousand people in Brisbane and Sydney. In May 1946 he defeated Jack Kirkham for the Australian middleweight title. Three months later he knocked out Jack Johnson in four rounds to become national light-heavyweight champion. The rematches were even more one-sided: Kirkham was defeated in five rounds and Johnson fell after 2¬Ω minutes of furious punching. By 1948 Sands had beaten all his local opponents and most American 'imports'. His mauling of a French fighter Tony Toniolo in less than two minutes in February 1949 led the English promoter Jack Solomons to take an interest in him. Grave of Dave Sands at Sandgate Cemetery. Despite an enthusiastic reception from the British press, Sands began his campaign for a world title disastrously. In London on 4 April 1949, while suffering from a swollen, recently vaccinated arm, he was outpointed by Tommy Yarosz. Fifteen days later Sands won, dismally, against a spoiler, Lucien Caboche. Maguire then moved him to Newcastle upon Tyne, where friendly locals and a promoter Joe Shepherd restored his confidence. After two solid victories, he returned to London and in July thrashed the much fancied Robert Villemain in the 'fight of the year'. On 6 September Sands demolished Dick Turpin in 2 minutes 35 seconds for the British Empire middleweight title. Shortly after his triumphal return to Australia in November 1949, Sands survived a serious accident when the steering on his motorcar failed and the vehicle somersaulted into a creek. Over the next eighteen months he contested and won nine fights, one of them a fifteen-rounder in September 1950 in which he took the Australian heavyweight championship from Alf Gallagher. Sands had become a leading contender for the world middleweight title and Maguire vainly sought to arrange a bout with the American champion 'Sugar' Ray Robinson. In the tricky maze of international boxing-promotion, his efforts were marked by a 'paper-chase' of offers and counter-offers. Sands defeated Mel Brown in London in July 1951 in a preliminary to a title-fight between Robinson and another contender Randolph Turpin. Had Maguire's negotiations succeeded, Sands would have been in Turpin's place and probably would have beaten an unfit Robinson, as did Turpin. In October 1951, Sands won two fights in the United States of America. Back home, he hoped for a world title-bout, but he was estranged from Maguire. A new manager Bede Kerr reopened discussions with Robinson's connections, but 'the chance never came'. Death On 11 August 1952, the truck Sands was driving with 15 passengers overturned at roadworks near Dungog, New South Wales.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18277191 Sands died of head and internal injuries that evening in the local hospital and was buried at Sandgate Cemetery, near Newcastle, New South Wales. His wife, and their son and two daughters survived him; their third daughter was born in November. Sands had earned about ¬£30,000, but it went on manager's fees, travel costs, tax, family expenses and generosity to his kin. A public appeal raised more than ¬£2500, sufficient to pay off his Stockton home and create a trust fund for his family.

Picture from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Utah. The exposed geology of the Capitol Reef area presents a record of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in an area of North America in and around Capitol Reef National Park, on the Colorado Plateau in southeastern Utah. Nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 m) of sedimentary strata are found in the Capitol Reef area, representing nearly 200 million years of geologic history of the south- central part of the U.S. state of Utah. These rocks range in age from Permian (as old as 270 million years old) to Cretaceous (as young as 80 million years old.)NPS, \\"Capitol Reef\\" Rock layers in the area reveal ancient climates as varied as rivers and swamps (Chinle Formation), Sahara-like deserts (Navajo Sandstone), and shallow ocean (Mancos Shale). The area's first known sediments were laid down as a shallow sea invaded the land in the Permian. At first sandstone was deposited but limestone followed as the sea deepened. After the sea retreated in the Triassic, streams deposited silt before the area was uplifted and underwent erosion. Conglomerate followed by logs, sand, mud and wind-transported volcanic ash were later added. Mid to Late Triassic time saw increasing aridity, during which vast amounts of sandstone were laid down along with some deposits from slow-moving streams. As another sea started to return, it periodically flooded the area and left evaporite deposits. Barrier islands, sand bars and later, tidal flats, contributed sand for sandstone, followed by cobbles for conglomerate, and mud for shale. The sea retreated, leaving streams, lakes and swampy plains to become the resting place for sediments. Another sea, the Western Interior Seaway, returned in the Cretaceous and left more sandstone and shale only to disappear in the early Cenozoic. From 70 to 50 million years ago the Laramide orogeny, a major mountain building event in western North America, created the Rocky Mountains to the east. The uplift possibly acted on a buried fault to form the area's Waterpocket Fold. More recent uplift of the entire Colorado Plateau and the resulting erosion has exposed this fold at the surface only within the last 15 to 20 million years. Ice ages in the Pleistocene increased the rate of precipitation and erosion. The cracked upper parts of the Waterpocket Fold were especially affected and the fold itself was exposed and dissected. 250px|thumb|Stratigraphic section (USGS), Geologic cross section (NPS) Primary deposition of sediments Some important concepts: A formation is a formally named and defined geologic unit with unique characteristics. Those characteristics were created during a largely unbroken period of time and result from the specific depositional environment that the formation was laid down in. A member is a minor unit in a formation and a bed is a distinct subunit of a member. Groups are sets of formations that are related in significant ways such as, for example, all being deposited during a dry period that lasted millions of years or as the result of an ocean periodically flooding the same area over millions of years. The various kinds of unconformities are gaps in the geologic record. Such gaps can be due to a prolonged absence of deposition or due to subsequent erosion that removes previously deposited rock units. The following sections are ordered from oldest to youngest rock units in order to create a geologic history of events. This is the opposite order one would see in an actual cross section of the sediments because newer rock units are deposited on top of older ones per the law of superposition. Cutler and Kaibab formations (Permian) The blue ocean surrounding the supercontinent Pangaea is Panthalassa In early Permian time, Utah was on a continental shelf that was occasionally covered by a shallow arm of the Panthalassa Ocean.Stokes, 1988, page 95, paragraph 3 That part of Laurasia was on a passive continental margin not unlike the current west coast of equatorial Africa. The resultant formations are part of the approximately 290- to 250-million-year-old Cutler FormationMorris et al., 2003, page 96, Tectonics and Geologic History\\" (called a group locally)'Cutler Formation' is the accepted usage by the USGS while 'Cutler Group' is preferred by the Utah Geological Survey, according to the GEOLEX database entry for 'Cutler'. Accessed March 18, 2006 Utah was nearly on the paleoequator while the first members of the Cutler Formation were deposited but it had migrated nearly to 10¬∞ north latitude by around 275 million years ago. The Cutler records sedimentation during this time and is composed of four members (youngest to oldest): *White Rim Sandstone, (resistant caprock) *Organ Rock Shale (locally missing), *Cedar Mesa Sandstone, and the *Elephant Canyon (locally buried). Only the two sandstone members of the Cutler Formation, the Cedar Mesa and White Rim, are exposed in the park but they cannot be easily distinguished from each other and are thus often treated as a single stratigraphic unit there.Morris et al., 2003, page 86, \\"Culter Group\\", paragraph 1 The White Rim and Cedar Mesa are composed of fossilized cross- bedded sand dunes that were likely deposited in an arid coastal environment that periodically flooded with sea water. Sand in these formations are somewhat sorted by size, well-rounded (worn by abrasion), and range from very fine- to medium-grained.Morris et al., 2003, page 90 Good outcrops of the locally 800 foot (240 m) thick Cedar Mesa and 420 foot (128 m) thick White Rim can be found in the bottom of Sulphur Creek and at the bottom of the Circle Cliffs outside the park's western border.Harris et al., 1997, page 62 In other areas the Organ Rock Shale is between the Cedar Mesa and White Rim but it pinches out east of the park. Both the locally buried Elephant Canyon and missing Organ Rock are exposed in nearby Canyonlands National Park 60 miles (100 km) east (see geology of the Canyonlands area). Later in Permian time, the Kaibab Sea invaded the land and laid down a limey ooze that later lithified to form the locally up to 200 foot (60 m) thick Kaibab Limestone. This is the same light gray to white formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the southwest (see Geology of the Grand Canyon area). The lower parts of the Kaibab were interbedded with sand and silt before its main component, limestone, was converted into chert-rich dolomite by the intrusion of magnesium. The formation contains fossils of invertebrates including brachiopods, bryozoans, crinoids, gastropods, and pelecypods. Outcrops of the cliff-forming Kaibab in Capitol Reef can only be seen in the deeper canyons located in the westernmost part of the park.Morris et al., 2003, page 90, \\"Kaibab Limestone\\" Retreat of the Kaibab Sea by the Mid Permian exposed its seabed to erosion, resulting in 100 foot (30 m) deep channels and the creation of a gap in the geologic record called an unconformity. Moenkopi Formation (Triassic) Ripple marks in Moenkopi Formation rock. Local climatic conditions were wetter and more tropical in the Early Triassic than they were previously. In the Capitol Reef area the resulting Moenkopi Formation is divided into four members (from oldest to youngest): *Black Dragon Member *Sinbad Limestone Member, *Torrey Member, and *Moody Canyon Member. Distinctive exposures of the uppermost Moenkopi are along the lower slopes of the west-facing cliffs of the Waterpocket Fold. Uplift and subsequent partial erosion of the Moenkopi then created an approximately 6 million year long unconformity that lasted the entire Mid Triassic. Moenkopi Formation below Chinle on cliff above Capitol Reef Scenic Drive. The 50 to 110 foot (15 to 34 m) thick slope-forming Black Dragon is composed of reddish conglomerate, sandstone, and siltstone that were likely deposited on a coastal plain followed by a tidal flat. Chert clasts from the underlying Kaibab Limestone make-up part of conglomerates at the member's base while ripple marks and mudcracks are common in its upper parts. Also common in the upper parts of the member are thin interbeds of carbonate rock with some fossils. Later in the early Triassic, fossil-rich to muddy limey ooze with small amounts of silt and sand were laid down as a short-lived arm of the ocean covered the region. This created the locally 70 to 140 foot (21 to 43 m) thick yellowish-colored Sinbad Limestone member of the Moenkopi. Some of the fossils found in this layer include the brachiopod genus Lingula and the ammonite genus Meekoceras. A tidal flat briefly returned to the area after the sea retreated. This created the locally 250 to 320 foot (76 to 98 m) thick reddish-brown to chocolate colored siltstone and fine-grained sandstone of the Moenkopi's Torrey Member.Morris et al., 2003, page 90 to 91, \\"Moenkopi Formation\\" Some of the finer-grained beds display ripple marks and mudcracks while the sandstone has horizontal and low-angle crossbedding. Small to large fossilized track-ways from amphibians and reptiles are found in this layer as well as casts of halite. The youngest member of the Moenkopi is the 320 to 430 foot (98 to 130 m) thick Moody Canyon Member. Moody Canyon is informally sub-divided into two units: *a lower slope-forming 200 to 300 foot (60 to 90 m) thick unit of reddish-brown siltstone and *an upper cliff-forming 120 to 130 foot (37 to 40 m) thick unit of reddish-orange siltstone. About 30 to 40% of the stone in the upper unit is ripple-laminated while the lower unit is structureless to horizontally laminated.Morris et al., 2003, page 91 Good exposures of the ripple-laminated upper unit are found on the lower part of Egyptian Temple. Chinle Formation (Triassic) Non-cropped image A complex, relatively high velocity and likely braided stream system covered most of southern Utah in the Late Triassic. Various members of the resulting Chinle Formation are found over much of the Colorado Plateaus. Logs, sand, mud and wind-transported volcanic ash from distant eruptions were mixed by streams as they migrated over a subsiding basin to form the Chinle. Uranium salts accumulated in this formation in economically extractable quantities and petrified wood was formed (petrification was probably aided by the presence of volcanic ash). Chinle members represented in the Capitol Reef area are (from oldest to youngest): *Shinarump Member, *Monitor Butte Member, *Petrified Forest Member, and *Owl Rock Member. Together they form the purple and orange rounded slopes and hills that are occasionally above white cliffs along the Waterpocket Fold's west face. Discontinuous beds of sediment were deposited in broad channels eroded into the Moenkopi, creating the locally 0 to 90 foot (0 to 27 m) thick white to yellowish gray cliff-forming Shinarump Member of the Chinle Formation. The Shinarump is made of low to high-angle cross-stratified and friable fine to coarse-grained sandstone interbedded with conglomerate. Good outcrops of the Shinarump are found near the park's west entrance capping such features as the Egyptian Temple and Chimney Rock while all traces of this member are absent further east. Members above the Shinarump tend to be finer due to the slower speed of the streams that deposited them. A river system then migrated northward and transitioned into either a large lake or marsh. As this occurred, bentonite-rich clay (formed in part from volcanic ash erupted from nearby volcanoes) and clayey cross-bedded sand with some interbeds and lenses of lime ooze were laid down. This eventually became the light purplish-gray claystone, sandstone, and carbonate rock of the Chinle's Monitor Butte Member. Burrows that measure 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter and 5 feet (1.5 m) long were excavated by lungfish into the Monitor Butte. This member easily stands out in the lower to middle slopes of the Waterpocket Fold's west face in such places as The Castle and along the cliff's just north of State Route 24 as it enters the park. Very sinuous rivers covered the area in later Triassic time, forming the sediments of the Chinle's Petrified Forest Member. The Petrified Forest is composed of reddish-orange bentonite-rich cross-bedded siltstones and clayey fine-grained quartz sandstones. The lower part of this member forms gullied slopes and the upper part forms a resistant cliff called the 'Capitol Reef bed.' Carbonate nodules along with fossil bivalves, coprolites, marine snails, lungfish toothplates, and tetrapods are found in the Petrified Forest Member. Deposition from a series of lakes then dominate the geologic record, resulting in the locally 150 to 200 foot (45 to 60 m) thick Owl Rock Member of the Chinle. The Owl Rock is made of purple and orange mudstones, fine-grained sandstones and siltstones with interbedded 1 to 10 foot (30 to 300 cm) thick green to mottled pink micritic and knobby limestone. Fossilized desiccation mudcracks that are up to 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 3 feet (1 m) deep are found at the very top of the Owl Rock (they were later filled with sand from the overlying Wingate Sandstone). Also found in the Owl Rock are trace fossils of cylindrical burrows and fossils of ostracodes. The Owl Rock erodes into littered slopes and is found directly below the Wingate Sandstone along the Waterpocket Fold's west face. Glen Canyon Group (Triassic) The Castle. Non-cropped image All three formations of the Glen Canyon Group were laid down in the Mid to Late Triassic during a time of increasing aridity. Slightly clockwise and northward movement of the North American Plate was bringing the area into a dryer climatic belt. The direction of cross-bedding in Glen Canyon Group sand dunes suggests that prevailing winds from the north transported the sand into the region. Outcrops of the Glen Canyon Group's three formations are the most prominently exposed rock layers in the spine of the Waterpocket Fold. Together they reach a thickness of 1,500 to 2,700 feet (460 to 820 m) in the area and their sandstones are seen in many of the arches, domes and slot canyons in Capitol Reef.Morris et al., 2003, page 92 They are, from oldest (lowest) to youngest (highest); *Wingate Sandstone *Kayenta Formation *Navajo Sandstone Sand dunes migrated back and forth on the shore of the Sundance Sea, creating the 350 foot (107 m) thick cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone. This formation is composed of orange-colored cross bedded fossilized sand dunes made of fine-grained and well-rounded quartz sand. Wingate outcrops are found capping the Waterpocket Fold's western escarpment. Prominent examples are easy to see near the Visitor Center in the Fruita Cliffs and in The Castle. Double arch in Kayenta Formation (USGS). The climate became more humid later in Triassic time. Slow-moving, southwestward flowing braided streams laid down thin-bedded layers of sand, silt, mud and cobbles in channels, across low flood plains and in lakes. Fossilized footprints of dinosaurs and the crocodile-like tritylodonts can be found in this 350 foot (107 m) thick ledgy- slope forming formation, called the Kayenta. The Kayenta weathers into three units; a lower ledge and middle cliff that are dominated by cross-bedded sandstone and an upper slope that has relatively more siltstone. It is often difficult to spot the contact between the Windgate and Kayenta due to their similar color and grain size. One place where the contact is easiest to discern is west of State Route 24 along the Fremont River at mile marker 82. Capitol Dome is made of Navajo Sandstone A massive Sahara-like desert geologists call an erg then invaded the area, covering it with 800 to 1,100 feet (240 to 335 m) of accumulated white to tan-colored fossilized sand dunes. The resulting formation, called the Navajo Sandstone, is composed of cross- bedded and very clean sandstone with well-rounded, generally very fine-grained and frosted sand. It reached its greatest thickness, 2,000 feet (610 m) in what is now Zion National Park (see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area). The cross-bedded make-up of the Navajo leads to the formation of curvilinear canyons and rounded domes such as Capitol Dome and Navajo Dome. In other places it forms massive cliffs and monoliths. Subsequent erosion leveled the tops of the sand dunes and left them in up to 60 foot (18 m) thick easy to discern layers. San Rafael Group (Jurassic) Golden Throne, a rock formation in Capitol Reef National Park. Though the park is famous for white domes of the Navajo Sandstone, this dome's color is a result of a lingering section of yellow Carmel Formation carbonate, which has stained the underlying rock. Frequent but short-lived changes in sea level during the Mid to Late Jurassic periodically flooded the area with shallow extensions of the ocean. The resulting San Rafael Group is composed of four formations that were deposited on top of the Glen Canyon Group's regionally traceable erosion surface. San Rafael Group formations are (from oldest to youngest); *Page Sandstone, *Carmel Formation, *Entrada Sandstone, *Curtis Formation, and *Summerville Formation. San Rafael formations can be seen on the east-dipping part of the Waterpocket Fold. Climatic conditions were still arid when the locally 0 to 100 feet (0 to 30 m) thick Page Sandstone was deposited above the reach of high tide yet near the shore of an advancing sea (sabkha-like conditions).Morris et al., 2003, pages 92‚Äì93 This formation is composed of three members; the *Harris Wash, *Judd Hollow, and the *Thousand Pockets. Together they were laid on top of the Navajo sand dunes as the sea slowly flooded the vast desert. An outcrop of the Judd Hollow Member can be seen from mile marker 86.5 as a red cliff above the Fremont River falls. The cross- bedded sandstone just above the red cliff is an example of the Thousand Pockets Member. The Fremont River crosses the Waterpocket Fold in the upper half of this satellite picture, while the white line of Capitol Reef bisects the lower half. In Mid Jurassic time gypsum, sand, and limey silt were deposited in what may have been a graben that was periodically covered by sea water and thus a place where repeated flooding was followed by evaporation.Harris et al., 1997, page 63, section 4, paragraph 1 The resulting Carmel Formation is composed of 200 to 1,000 feet (60 to 300 m) of reddish- brown siltstone, mudstone and sandstone that alternates with whitish-gray gypsum and fossil-rich limestone in a banded pattern. Fossils include marine bivalves and ammonites.Morris et al., 2003, page 94 Most of the Carmel has been removed from the Waterpocket Fold's crest but outcrops can be seen capping the Golden Throne and atop various domes in the area. It can also be seen as reddish-brown triangular-shaped spurs called 'flatirons' that form the Waterpocket Fold's eastern rampart. Non-cropped image A near-shore environment dominated by barrier islands, sand bars and tidal flats later returned to the region. The sand and silt deposited created the 400 to 900 foot (120 to 275 m) thick reddish orange Entrada Sandstone. Distinctive jointing systems in the Entrada lead to the formation of cathedrals and monoliths in Capitol Reef's Cathedral Valley, arches in Arches National Park and 'goblins' (the local name for hoodoos) in nearby Goblin Valley State Park. Entrada exposures in the southern part of the park are mostly made of flat- bedded siltstones and erode into slopes. Moving north, Entrada exposures increasingly become rich in cross-bedded sandstone and erode into cliffs with fewer and fewer slopes. Fine-grained sand and silt mixed with sandy lime were laid down as sediments on top of the Entrada Sandstone, forming the locally 0 to 175 foot (53 m) thick erosion-resistant Curtis Formation. A green iron potassium silicate called glauconite in the Curtis indicates it was deposited in a shallow sea. Outcrops of the light grayish-green Curtis can be seen as a capstone in the northern section of the park while it is locally absent in the southern part. Tidal flat conditions returned as the shallow sea that created the Curtis Formation retreated from land. Thin beds of reddish-brown mudstone alternating with less frequent beds of greenish-gray sandstone and limestone were deposited as sediments, forming the locally 50 to 250 foot (15 to 75 m) thick Summerville Formation. This formation erodes into ledgy cliffs and slopes and can be seen above Curtis caprock in Cathedral Valley. Fossilized mudcracks and ripple marks are found in the Curtis along with up to 28 foot (8.5 m) thick gypsum-rich beds. Morrison Formation (Jurassic) Morrison Formation from near Notom-Bullfrog Road (USGS). Again above sea level, streams laid down mud and sand in their channels, on lakebeds, and in swampy plains during the Upper Jurassic. This became the Morrison Formation, which is locally divided into three members (from oldest to youngest); *Tidwell Member, *Salt Wash, and *Brushy Basin. The 50 to 100 foot (15 to 30 m) thick Tidwell Member is locally difficult to recognize and therefore may or may not be in the area's rocks. Easier to identify and study outcrops elsewhere in southeastern Utah indicate they were deposited in hypersaline lagoons. Clay, mud, silt, cross-bedded sand, and pebbles were later deposited by meandering streams and in flood plains, forming the locally 100 to 500 foot (30 to 150 m) thick Salt Wash Member. Claystone and mudstone beds of this member erode into gray slopes that can exhibit brown, red, yellow, and green colors. Salt Wash sandstone is moderately sorted and fine to medium grained while pebble conglomerate beds are made of chert with small amounts of silica-rich limestone. Both bed types erode into ledges and small cliffs. The Salt Wash was locally mined in the 1950s to extract uranium ore.Harris et al., 1997, page 64, section 5 The 200 to 350 foot (60 to 105 m) thick Brushy Basin Member is composed of claystone, mudstone, and siltstone with small amounts of conglomerate and sandstone. Clays in this member are rich in smectite and thus tend to swell when wet and dry to a crumbled surface that looks a bit like popcorn. Fossilized dinosaur bones are abundant in this member in several places located in Utah and western Colorado. The bones are usually scattered and are thus hard to identify but nearly complete skeletons have been found in lake floor and flood-plain clays. Good exposures of the Brushy Basin Member can be seen in the Bentonite Hills. Cedar Mountain and Dakota formations (Cretaceous) The Capitol Reef area was on the edge of an epicontinental sea for much of the Cretaceous (USGS). Early Cretaceous time brought continental deposition that was dominated by rivers to the area. Sandstones and mudstones accumulated to form the 0 to 166 foot (50.5 m) thick slope-forming Cedar Mountain Formation. The 73 foot (22 m) thick Buckhorn Conglomerate Member thins out north and east of the park and is nearly absent in it, making it difficult to distinguish the underlying Morrison from the somewhat more pastel-colored Cedar Mountain. Fossilized freshwater animals such as mollusks and ostracods along with dinosaurs, fish scales, pollen and a genus of fern called Tempskya have been found in this formation.Morris et al., 2003, page 95 The passive continental margin became active when the Farallon Plate started to dive below the North American Plate. Geologists call the resulting mountain-building event the Sevier orogeny. Compressive forces detached sedimentary units across western Utah and Nevada from their Precambrian basement rocks and pushed them eastward. The weight of the resulting high mountain range that formed to the west, lowered much of Utah and allowed the sea to invade. This grew into a vast sea that periodically divided North America in the Cretaceous called the Western Interior Seaway. Non-marine sediments of the approximately 100- to 94-million-year-old Dakota Sandstone were deposited on the shore of this seaway early in the Cretaceous.Morris et al., 2003, page 97 The up to 150 foot (45 m) thick formation consists of fine- grained tan to brownish-gray colored quartz-rich sandstone that is interbedded with thin layers of carbon-rich shale, coal, and conglomerate. Petrified wood is found in the lower part of the formation while fossilized marine bivalves such as Corbula and Pycnodonte newberryi are in the upper layers. This fossil progression shows a record of flooding that created the seaway. Dakota erode into small cliffs and hogbacks that can be seen in the southern section of the park.Morris et al., 2003, page 95, \\"Dakota Sandstone\\" Mancos Shale and Mesaverde Formation (Cretaceous) Approximately 94 to 85 million years ago, the seaway advanced onto and retreated from land as it laid down the Mancos Shale. The Mancos is composed mostly of shale but two of its members, the Ferron and Muley Canyon, are sandstone that were laid down when relative sea level temporarily dropped. The five Mancos members from oldest to youngest are: #Tununk Shale, #Ferron Sandstone, #Blue Gate Shale, #Muley Canyon, and #Masuk. Mancos Shale slopes along the east side of Strike Valley (USGS) Parts of this formation are found in some mesas and buttes in the southernmost part of the park and in badlands east of the park.Harris et al., 1997, page 65, section 6, paragraph 2 Open marine conditions created the locally 40 to 720 feet (12 to 220 m) thick gullied slope-forming Tununk Shale Member. It is made of bluish-gray shale with interbedded mudstone, fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. The Tununk erodes into a slope and is locally fossil- rich.Billingsley et al., 1987, page 5 It is most prominently exposed in the Blue Desert immediately southeast of Cathedral Valley and contains fossilized examples of cephalopods, bivalves, and fish scales. A wave-dominated delta and river system then spread over the area, creating the locally 205 to 385 feet (62 to 117 m) thick cliff-forming Ferron Sandstone. It is composed of brown fine-grained sandstone along with white cross-bedded sandstone with interbedded carbonate-rich gray shale. The marine bivalve Inoceramus and trace fossils of Ophiomorpha are found in the lower part of this member. Ferron Sandstone north of the area contains seams of coal in its upper part, prompting some petroleum geologists to study this member to model oil-bearing regions. Mancos Shale badlands. Open marine conditions returned in the Late Cretaceous, forming the locally 1,200 to 1,500 foot (365 to 460 m) thick slope-forming Blue Gate Shale. This member is composed of bentonite rich clays, siltstone and some sandstone. It erodes into gullied slopes similar in appearance to the Tununk Shale. The presence of two species of planktonic foraminifera in the upper Blue Gate, Clioscaphites vermiformis and Clioscaphites choteauenis, was used to date this member. An ancient shoreline once again approached the area, resulting in the formation of the locally 300 to 400 feet (90 to 120 m) thick Muley Canyon Member. It is composed of evenly bedded, fine-grained sandstone and carbon-rich shales. Coal beds are found in the upper parts of this member, indicating continental coastal plain conditions at that time. Alternating layers of shallow marine and non-marine sediments were deposited as the shoreline fluctuated back and forth over the area. These sediments became the locally 650 to 750 foot (200 to 230 m) thick Masuk Member. The Masuk consists of cliff-forming cross-bedded sandstones and slope-forming yellowish-gray to bluish-gray mudstones with interbedded light gray sandstones. Fossils of bivalves, ceratopsian dinosaurs, crocodiles, gastropods, and turtles have been collected in this member.Morris et al., 2003, page 95, \\"Mancos Shale\\" The Western Interior Seaway was shrinking due to infilling and uplift while the high mountains to the east were being reduced by erosion. Barrier beaches and river deltas migrated eastward into the seaway. The resulting 300 to 400 foot (90 to 120 m) thick Mesaverde Formation consists of light-brown to dark-gray thick-bedded and cross-stratified sandstone with interbedded dark gray shale and intertongues with the Masuk Member of the overlying Mancos Shale.Morris et al., 2003, pages 95‚Äì96, \\"Mesaverde Formation\\" and Billingsley et al., 1987, page 5 Only small remnants are found capping a few mesas in the park's eastern section. Uplift and Cenozoic events Waterpocket Fold, Lake Uinta and volcanism Photo of the fold looking south from the Strike Valley Overlook (USGS) The Laramide orogeny compacted the region from about 70 million to 50 million years ago and in the process created the Rocky Mountains. Many monoclines (a type of gentle upward fold in rock strata) were also formed by the deep compressive forces of the Laramide. One of those monoclines, called the Waterpocket Fold, is the major geographic feature of the park. The 100 mile (160 km) long fold has a north-south alignment with a steeply east-dipping side. The rock layers on the west side of the Waterpocket Fold have been lifted more than 7,000 feet (2,100 m) higher than the layers on the east.NPS, \\"Geology\\", paragraph 1 Thus older rocks are exposed on the western part of the fold and younger rocks on the eastern part. This particular fold may have been created due to movement along a fault in the Precambrian basement rocks hidden well below any exposed formations. Small earthquakes centered below the fold in 1979 may be from such a fault.Harris et al., 1997, page 65, section 7 Contemporary with the Waterpocket Fold's formation was the development of an intermontane (between mountains) basin in the area. Lake Uinta filled this basin with stream water derived from the north and south. This large lake existed from about 58 million until 35 million years ago and is responsible for creating the Flagstaff Limestone and Green River Formation, which locally reach a thickness of around 200 feet (60 m). Elsewhere these formations have a combined thickness of over 9,000 feet (2,740 m). The Flagstaff is a white-colored, fossil rich layer that is composed of limestone, tufa and conglomerate that erodes into ledges and slopes. Compressive forces caused by the Laramide orogeny were followed by some minor stretching as a new equilibrium was established. This created weaknesses in the crust that allowed magma to intrude toward the surface to create composite volcanos west of the area some 25 to 20 million years ago. Within the fold, magma intruded through and between formations about 4.6 to 3.7 million years ago to respectively create dikes and sills. Small basaltic lava flows erupted through fissures at the surface and igneous activity continued sporadically afterwards. Subsequent erosion preferentially removed the softer sedimentary rock that initially entombed the dikes, sills, and volcanic plugs, often leaving them standing in relief.Harris et al., 1997, page 60, \\"Igneous Rocks\\" Examples can be seen in South Desert and Cathedral Valley at the northern end of the fold. Erosion The Fremont River has been able to keep up with the uplift of the Waterpocket Fold. Ten to fifteen million years ago the entire region was uplifted several thousand feet (well over a kilometer) by the creation of the Colorado Plateaus. This time the uplift was more even, leaving the overall orientation of the formations mostly intact. Most of the erosion that carved today's landscape occurred after the uplifting of the Colorado Plateau with much of the major canyon cutting probably occurring between 1 and 6 million years ago.NPS, \\"Erosion\\" Even in this desert climate, water is the erosional agent most responsible for the carving of the landscape. The pull of gravity, in the form of rock falls or rock creep, plays a major role in the shaping of the cliff lines. Wind is a minor agent of erosion here. The drainage system in the area was rearranged and steepened as the Waterpocket Fold was uplifted. Larger streams, such as the Fremont River, were more likely to keep up with the uplift by downcutting into the Waterpocket Fold faster. Other streams, such as Sand Creek, changed their course by flowing parallel to the fold and cutting into less resistant formations. Yet other streams tried to keep up with the uplift by carving slot canyons only to later change course, leaving their canyons literally high and dry.Harris et al., 1997, page 66, section 9, paragraph 1 A total of 7,000 feet (2,100 m) of overlying Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediment has been removed by erosion in the area.Morris et al., 2003, page 98, paragraph 1 Big Thomson Mesa seen from space Wetter and cooler conditions developed during the Pleistocene epoch and briefly returned via at least two neoglacial episodes (little ice ages) in the current epoch, the Holocene.Harris et al., 1997, page 66, section 9 The various rivers and streams in the area were engorged by increased precipitation and with melt- water from mountain glaciers on the Henry Mountains to the east and the Aquarius Plateau to the west of the park.Hintze, 1973 Flash floods, mass wasting of hillsides, frost wedging, and landslides all contributed to a significantly faster rate of erosion. Glaciers plucked 20- to 30-million-year- old black basaltic boulders from atop Boulder and Thousand Lake Mountains that were subsequently deposited over the park area by meltwater streams from the glaciers, rockslides and floods.Harris et al., 1997, page 60, \\"Igneous Rocks\\", paragraph 2 External links References Works cited *Billingsley, G.H., Breed, W.J. and Huntoon, P.W.; 1987; Geologic Map of capitol Reef National Park and vicinity, Utah; Utah Geologic Survey (viewed March 25, 2006) *Halka Chronic, Roadside Geology of Utah (Mountain Press; 1990) *Ann G.

Almost 70% of the Australian Capital Territory's (ACT) pastures, pine plantations, and nature parks were severely damaged, and most of the Mount Stromlo Observatory was destroyed. After burning for a week around the edges of the ACT, the fires entered the suburbs of Canberra on 18 January 2003. Over the next ten hours, four people died, over 490 were injured, and 470 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, requiring a significant relief and reconstruction effort.  Buildup to the event  Map showing the progress of the fires over time On 8 January 2003, lightning strikes started four fires in New South Wales, over the border but in close proximity to Canberra. Despite their proximity and very small initial sizes, low intensity, and low rate of spread, these fires were not extinguished or contained by New South Wales emergency services personnel. Subsequent inquiries into the bushfires, including the Roche report, the McLeod inquiry, and the Coroners Report, identified poor management of the initial response as a key contributor to the disaster that unfolded on 18 January 2003. On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter that had been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading water buckets from the dam at the time of the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to the weight of his clothes and lack of life vest, was unable to be dragged from the water. The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board to dive into the dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie. The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital. Both Stanhope and Lucas-Smith received the Royal Life Saving Society's rescue medal to commemorate their bravery in the rescue. McKenzie received the society's highest award, the Bravery Cross, which recognises undertaking a rescue in an aquatic environment under circumstances that endanger the rescuer's life. On 17 January, the Emergency Services Bureau (ESB) released its final media release prior to 18 January at 8:50 pm. This media release differed to any previous one in format and content. It also provided several clues that were overlooked in the assessment of the risk Canberra faced. For example, one point of the release stated that bushfire logistical support staging areas were being relocated from Bulls Head and Orroral Valley (far outside urban Canberra) to the North Curtin District Playing Fields (far inside urban Canberra), signalling both a major retreat by fire fighters and pointing to imminent danger to the city itself. Events of 18 January Woden Town Centre Canberra's suburban hills engulfed in flames during the bushfires. ACTFB firefighters hosing down the roof of the Emergency Services Bureau. The morning of Saturday 18 January 2003 was hot, windy and dry. Temperatures as high as and winds exceeding , plus a very low relative humidity, were the main weather features of the day. Two fires continued to burn out of control in the Namadgi National Park, with the entire park, along with the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, being closed due to the threat. A second fire, in the Brindabella Ranges, was threatening to break containment lines. By 9 am on the morning of Saturday 18 January, burned leaves appeared on lawns in houses in the Weston Creek, Kambah, and Tuggeranong suburbs bordering the western extremity of Canberra. By 10 am, news helicopters were overflying Duffy and reporting news of the fires interstate and internationally, but no news was available locally. Throughout the day, the fires burned closer to the fringes of Canberra's suburbs, and there was no sign of authorities gaining control of the situation. At around 2 pm, police evacuated the township of Tharwa to the south of Canberra. By mid-afternoon, it had become apparent that the fires posed an immediate threat to the settlements near Canberra, such as Uriarra and Stromlo, as well as to the houses on the city's urban-bushland interface. A state of emergency was declared at 2.45 pm by the ACT's Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope. The fires reached the urban area at 3 pm. The first emergency warning advisories were broadcast shortly after, on radio and television, with the advisories updated throughout the day. These advisories, accompanied by the Emergency Warning Signal stated that a significant \\"deterioration\\" of the fire situation in the ACT had occurred and placed several suburbs on alert to evacuate. As the day continued, these advisories advised the evacuation of several suburbs (also enforced by Police on the ground) and placed most suburbs of Canberra on some level of alert. By now, the fire had reached the fringes of many suburbs, was surrounding Tharwa, and threatened the historic Lanyon Homestead, which was hosting a wedding and protected by only a single fire truck. By 3.50 pm, some houses were alight in the suburbs of Duffy and Chapman, with the loss of a home in Holder soon after. An ACT Fire Brigade unit, perceiving the fire from a vantage point in Fyshwick, overrode instructions by the radio controller to ignore the signs and remain where they were. The unit headed to Duffy, attempting to alert both controllers and residents to the imminent danger. That unit was caught in a fire front on Warragamba Avenue Duffy at around 4.10 pm, after having rescued at least two residents. Both the crew and residents were forced to flee the appliance when the fire struck. Due to fire damage to infrastructure and extreme winds bringing down powerlines across the area, large parts of the city lost power. Fires also started in Giralang because of powerline problems. Evacuation centres were set up at four schools ‚Äì Canberra College, Ginninderra College, Erindale College, and Narrabundah College. A dark cloud hung over the city, and, although it was not in danger, Parliament House was closed. By 5 pm, houses were reported destroyed in Duffy, Chapman, Kambah, Holder, and Rivett, as well as in the small forestry settlement of Uriarra. It was later found that the first casualty of the fires, an elderly woman named Dorothy McGrath, had died at the nearby Stromlo Forestry Settlement. Escape for residents was hampered by poor warning and by the settlement's location, surrounded by the pine forest. Fires in the Michelago area forced the closure of the Monaro Highway into Canberra. Fires spread through the Kambah Pool area and into the suburb of Kambah, causing damage to many homes and one of the ACT's primary Urban and Rural fire stations. Fire spread through parkland, crossing the Tuggeranong Parkway and Sulwood Drive finally engulfing Mount Taylor. Within an hour, houses were also burning in Torrens, on the slopes of Mount Taylor, and in Weston. The fires by now had inflicted severe damage to the city's infrastructure. Power supplies were cut to several suburbs. These outages affected both the Emergency Services Bureau's own headquarters in Curtin and the Canberra Hospital (running on back-up generators), which was under intense pressure from people suffering burns and smoke inhalation. In Curtin, the ESA headquarters was in danger from the fires. With back-up power available only to the Communications Centre, many personnel were forced to work on tables outside as Army Reserve personnel hosed down the building. It was later noted that the ESB could have moved its operations away from danger to other emergency service locations such as the AFP Winchester Centre or Tuggeranong Police Station. Water, gas, sewerage, and communications were heavily affected. Water, gas, and landline communications was unavailable to several suburbs due to damage to supply lines and city reservoirs. Mobile telecommunications were severely affected due to increased traffic, causing serious disruption to mobile phone networks and the ESA's own radio and dispatch networks. A local generator services business later reported on their website that the ash and smoke were so intense, that some back-up power diesel generators at communication and data centres failed to produce enough power due to air intake filters clogging up. At least one generator air intake filter burned as it sucked in burning leaves blowing in the strong winds. The fires impacted part of the Lower Molonglo Water Quality Control Centre (LMWQCC), responsible for treating the city's sewage and waste water before its release into the Molonglo River. The plant's operations were disrupted due to fire damage, causing concern about the possible release of sewage into the Molonglo River, as the plant's reserve storage could only hold one day of surplus. However, the lack of resources and equipment failures for crews protecting the plant could have led to a catastrophe, as detailed in Danny Camilleri's testimony in Coroner Maria Doogan's subsequent inquest into the fires. Camilleri testified that his crews arrived to find much of the area around the plant on fire, with a significant risk of the fire endangering dangerous substances stored at the plant to treat waste, including chlorine. He stated that if the fire had caused a breach in the chlorine tanks, it would have created \\"a poisonous cloud that would blow toward Canberra necessitating mass evacuations\\". By 10 pm, one of the four evacuation centres in Canberra was completely full, and the others were filling up quickly. Reports of looting also began to arrive from the damaged areas. Both Prime Minister John Howard and Governor General Peter Hollingworth changed their plans to return to Canberra as soon as was possible. While the very worst of the fires had passed, the situation was still far from stable, and going into Sunday, 19 January, houses were still ablaze across numerous suburbs. Aftermath NASA photo of south-eastern Australia, showing fires which were still burning, 22 January By the evening of 19 January, it was clear that the worst-hit suburb was Duffy, where 200+ residences were destroyed, and that four people had died: Alison Tener, 38, Peter Brooke, 74, and Douglas Fraser, 60, and Dorothy McGrath, 76, of the Mount Stromlo Forestry Settlement. The loss of life, damage to property, and destruction of forests to the west of the city caused not just economic loss but significant social impacts. Map showing the amount of the ACT burnt by the fires Bushfires severely harmed the vegetation of the Cotter River Catchment and caused water quality problems in the three dams in the catchment: Corin, Bendora and Cotter Dams. For quite some time after the fires, turbidity in the water due to silt and ash from surrounding burnt-out forests meant Canberra had to rely on Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River, which was not affected by the fires. Given the drought and existing water shortages, this effectively reduced Canberra's water reserves to around 15% for some time. An upgrade to the Stromlo Water Treatment Plant was subsequently required to allow extra filtration of water to cope with the diminished quality in the future. As with any bushfire, the environment will take significant time to regenerate. Regeneration of vegetation was delayed by an ongoing drought in the region. Mount Stromlo The burnt-out remains of the Mount Stromlo Observatory a year after the fires. Statue of an astronomer and the concept of the cosmic distance ladder, made from the declination ring and other parts of the 1925 Yale-Columbia Refractor wrecked by the 2003 Canberra bushfires which burned out the Mount Stromlo Observatory; at Questacon, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. Perhaps the most notable cultural and scientific loss caused by the fires was the damage to the scenic and renowned Mount Stromlo Observatory (headquarters of the Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics of the Australian National University), which is estimated to be the source of a third of Australia's astronomical research. Five historically significant telescopes were destroyed. Instrumentation and engineering workshops, the observatory's library, and the main administration buildings were consumed. The visitors' centre or \\"Exploratory\\" housing public exhibits and cafe escaped the fires unscathed, despite being on the edge of a steep gradient, which fires had roared up, and being only metres from the telescope, which was completely destroyed. The insurance payment sought by the Australian National University (ANU), amounting to 75 million Australian dollars, could have become the largest insurance claim in Australian history. However, in August 2009, during trial in the ACT Supreme Court, the three insurance companies settled out of court, paying the ANU an undisclosed sum. A related claim against ANU's insurance broker, Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd, for failing to renew insurance coverage on some structures, was also settled for an unstated amount in June 2011. Canberra artist Tim Wetherell was commissioned by ANU to produce a sculpture from the ruins of the Mount Stromlo telescopes. The finished sculpture was named \\"The Astronomer\\" and installed in the Parliamentary Triangle, outside Questacon. Official responses Following the 2003 bushfires, the ACT and New South Wales and Australian governments initiated community and official responses to the fire. Bushfire Recovery Taskforce The Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established to advise the ACT Government, provide leadership for the recovery, and act as a bridge between Government agencies and the community. McLeod Inquiry The ACT Government established the McLeod Inquiry to examine and report on the operational response to the bushfires. The Inquiry was headed by Ron McLeod, a former Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Inquiry handed down its findings on 1 August 2003. The inquiry found that: *The fires, started by lightning strikes, might have been contained, had they been attacked more aggressively in the 24 hours after they broke out. Large stretches of dry, drought-affected vegetation and weather conditions that were extremely conducive to fire meant that once the fires reached a certain size, they were very difficult to control. *Management of fuel load in parks and adequate access to remote areas were both lacking. *Emergency service personnel performed creditably, but they were overwhelmed by the intensity of the fires and the unexpected speed of their advance on 18 January. *A comprehensive ACT Emergency Plan was in place at the time of the fire; it worked, particularly in recovery after the fires, in dealing with the large number of people who needed temporary shelter and assistance as a consequence of the fires. *Inadequacies in the physical construction and layout of the Emergency Services Bureau centre in Curtin were a hindrance. The centre was unable to handle efficiently the large amount of data and communications traffic into and out of the centre at the height of the crisis. *There were some equipment and resourcing deficiencies within the ACT's emergency service organisations. *Information and advice given to the community about the progress of the fires, the seriousness of the threat, and the preparations the public should be making was seriously inadequate. There was also confusion as to whether homes had to be evacuated. The Inquiry recommended there should be increased emphasis given to controlled burning as a fuel-reduction strategy, access to and training of emergency personnel in remote areas needed to be improved and a number of changes be made to the emergency services and the policies that govern their operations, including a greater emphasis on provision of information to the public. ACT Coroner's Bushfire Inquiry The Coroner's inquiry commenced in January 2003, and hearing officially opened on 16 June 2003. The Coroner's Court of the Australian Capital Territory conducted an inquiry into the cause, origin, and circumstances of the 2003 bushfires and inquests into the four deaths associated with those fires. The inquiry was under the provisions of the ACT Coroners Act 1997. The inquiry was marked by controversy, and in February 2005 the ACT Supreme Court heard an application that the coroner be disqualified due to bias. The inquiry into the fires was on hold until August 2005, when the Full Bench of the Supreme Court delivered its decision, declaring that Coroner Maria Doogan should not be disqualified on the ground of a reasonable apprehension of bias. The inquiry reconvened on 17 August 2005. After over 90 days of examining the evidence, the inquiry wrapped up on 25 October 2005. Although the inquiry was supposed to be completed in early 2006, submissions continued into mid-2006, with the Coroner delivering her findings, \\"The Canberra Firestorm\\",https://www.courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/publications/1074 \\"The Canberra Firestorm\\" in December 2006.  House Select Committee on the recent Australian bushfires  On 26 March 2003 the House of Representatives established a Select Committee to inquire into the Australian bushfires at that time, including the Canberra bushfire. The committee tabled the report of its inquiry on 5 November 2003 and the Australian government presented its response to the report on 15 September 2005.  Fire tornado  The first documented case of a fire tornado in Australia was during the 2003 Canberra bushfire. It was calculated to have horizontal winds of and vertical air speed of , spawned by its own wind rotation from a pyrocumulonimbus cloud and causing the flashover of in 0.04 seconds. It was also the first known fire tornado to have EF3 wind speeds on the Enhanced Fujita scale and the only known one until the 2018 Carr Fire in California.  Bushfire memorial  ACT Bushfire Memorial in Duffy On 18 January 2006, three years after the day of the bushfires, a bushfire memorial was opened on land which had been affected by the fires in Stromlo forest. The ACT Bushfire Memorial was commissioned by the ACT government to acknowledge the impact of the fires and thank the many organisations and individuals who played crucial roles in the fire fighting and recovery efforts. The memorial was designed by Canberra artists Tess Horwitz, Tony Steel and Martyn Jolly and incorporates elements requested by the ACT community. It is a journey from the day of the fire, through the process of recovery, to the honouring of memory. The entrance memorial walls are made from the community's salvaged bricks, which are inscribed with messages of grief and gratitude. Beyond the walls, a site framed by a grove of casuarinas contains red glass and metal forms, referring to the force of the firestorm and to the lightning strikes that sparked the main fires. An avenue leads to an amphitheatre enclosing a pond and bubbling spring. Glass columns bordering the pond contain details from photos provided by the community which speak of memory and human resilience. On 18 February 2006, an independent group of fire victims installed a plaque to honour the four people who died in the fires and the volunteer firefighters who fought so hard. The plaque is located at the end of the walkway to the memorial, immediately before the memorial walls. Fire victims and residents held a simple ceremony to mark the occasion.

Though the 1970 election was legitimate, in August 1973 the Chilean Senate declared the Allende administration to be \\"unlawful\\", due in large part to its expropriation of private property. Allende's presidency was ended by a military coup before the end of his term. During his tenure, Chilean politics reached a state of civil unrest amid strikes, lockouts, economic sanctions, CIA-sponsored propaganda, and a failed coup in June 1973. Allende's coalition, Unidad Popular, faced the problem of being a minority in the congress and it was plagued by factionalism. On 11 September 1973, a successful coup led by General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the government of Allende. During the bombing of the presidential palace by the Chilean Air Force, President Allende, after mounting a brief armed resistance against the military, eventually committed suicide (it has also been alleged that he was murdered by an infiltrator), terminating the period of Chilean history known as the \\"Presidential Republic\\" (1925‚Äì1973). Allende becomes president Chileans marching in support of Allende In the 1970 election, Allende ran with the Unidad Popular (UP or Popular Unity) coalition. Succeeding the FRAP left-wing coalition, Unidad Popular comprised most of the Chilean Left: the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Radical Party, the Party of the Radical Left (until 1972), the Social Democratic Party, MAPU (Movimiento de Acci√≥n Popular Unitario) (in 1972, a splinter group ‚Äì MAPU Obrero Campesino ‚Äì emerged) and since 1971 the Christian Left. Allende received a plurality with 36.2% of the vote. Christian Democrat Radomiro Tomic won 27.8% with a very similar platform to Allende's. Both Allende and Tomic promised to further nationalize the mineral industry and redistribute land and income among other new policies. Conservative former president Jorge Alessandri, standing for the National Party, received slightly under 34.9% of the vote.Angell, 1993, p. 50 According to the constitution, Congress had to decide between the two candidates who had received the most votes. The precedent set on the three previous occasions this situation had arisen since 1932 was for Congress simply to choose the candidate with the largest number of votes; indeed, former president Alessandri had been elected in 1958 with 31.6% of the popular vote. In this case, however, there was an active campaign against Allende's confirmation by Congress, including clandestine efforts to prevent him taking office, and his presidency was ratified only after he signed a \\"Statute of Constitutional Guarantees\\". This statute was suggested as a means to convince the majority of Christian Democrat senators that favoured Allessandri, as they doubted Allende's allegiance to democracy, or at least the UP's. After signing the statute, members of the Christian Democrat party in the Senate gave their vote in favor of Allende. It has been argued that given that less than the majority of the voters voted for him, Allende did not have a clear \\"mandate\\" to embark in the policies put forward on his program; however, it is also true that in the post-World War II period three out of the four previous presidents of Chile had, like Allende, also been elected with less than 50% of the vote, due in part to Chile's multi-party system. Specifically, the winners of the four presidential elections prior to Allende's 1970 election had won with: 56.1% (the 1964 election of Frei), 31.6% (the 1958 election of Alessandri), 46.8% (the 1952 election of Ib√°√±ez) and 40.2% (the 1946 election of Gonzalez Videla). The legality of the 1970 election itself is not in dispute. \\"The Chilean Way to Socialism\\" In office, Allende pursued a policy he called \\"La v√≠a chilena al socialismo\\" (\\"The Chilean Way to Socialism\\"). This included nationalization of certain large-scale industries (notably copper), of the healthcare system, continuation of his predecessor Eduardo Frei Montalva's policies regarding the educational system, a program of free milk for children, and land redistribution. The previous government of Eduardo Frei had already partly nationalised the copper industry by acquiring a 51 percent share in foreign owned mines. The primary U.S. business in Chile at this time was copper mining. The Chilean government sought to fully nationalize U.S. mining operations and the Chilean constitution required \\"just compensation\\" to be made according to \\"minimum international standards.\\" However, the Allende government chose to hold mining companies liable for damages they caused to the state. Subsequently, Chile made significant deductions in computing the amount of compensation due to the North American industries. Such deductions included charges for \\"loans invested poorly\\" and \\"excessive profits\\" among other reasoning. \\"Excessive profits\\" were assessed dating back to the 1950s. Ultimately, deductions for \\"social and financial malfeasance\\" when combined with other deductions resulted in the total deductions greatly exceeding the base book values of the mining enterprises. In effect, compensation to three of the five nationalized mines was wholly eliminated by subjective deductions determined by Allende's government.John Fleming, The Nationalization of Chile's Large Copper Companies in Contemporary Interstate Relations, 18 Vill. L. Rev. 593 (1973) Allende also nationalized coal mining in 1971, a move that was welcomed by the miners of Lota. Chilean presidents were allowed a maximum of six years in office, which may explain Allende's haste to restructure the economy. He had a significant restructuring program organized. At the beginning, there was broad support in Congress to expand the government's already large part of the economy, as the Popular Unity and Christian Democrats together had a clear majority. But the government's efforts to pursue these policies led to strong opposition by landowners, some middle- class sectors, the rightist National Party, financiers, and the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1973 was displeased with the direction of the educational policyCECH - Conferencia Episcopal de Chile [www.iglesiachile.org] ). Eventually the Christian Democrats united with the National Party in Congress. The Popular Unity coalition itself was far from unanimous. Allende himself said he was committed to democracy and represented a more moderate faction of his Socialist Party. He was supported by the Communist Party, that‚Äîdespite being ultimately less committed to representative democracy‚Äîfavoured a cautious, gradual approach. For example, the Communists urged to find a compromise with the Christian Democrats and supported the application of reforms through Congress. In contrast, the radical leftist wing of the Socialist Party wanted to smash the capitalist system at once, even if that meant violent actions. If one includes smaller parties, Allende's moderate left-wing line was supported by moderate Socialists, Communists, Radicals (Social Democrats merged with that party in June 1972) and part of the MAPU (later: MAPU/OC), whereas the left-wing Socialists (led by Altamirano), the extremist elements of the MAPU, of the Christian Left and the MIR (not belonging to the Unidad Popular) represented the far-left. During its first year in office, the Allende Government achieved economic growth, reductions in inflation and unemployment, a redistribution of income, and an increase in consumption. The government also significantly increased salaries and wages, reduced taxes, and introduced free distribution of some items of prime necessity. Groups which had previously been excluded from the state labor insurance scheme (mainly the self-employed and small businessmen) were included for the first time, while pensions were increased for widows, invalids, orphans, and the elderly. The National Milk Plan affected 50% of Chilean children in 1970, providing 3,470,000 with half a litre of milk daily, free of charge.Ricardo Israel Zipper, Politics and Ideology in Allende‚Äôs Chile The land-redistribution that Allende highlighted as one of the central policies of his government had already begun under his predecessor Eduardo Frei Montalva, who had expropriated between one-fifth and one-quarter of all properties liable to takeover. The Allende government's intention was to appropriate all holdings of more than eighty basic irrigated hectares.Faundez, 1988 Allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of Chile's poorest citizens; a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalized enterprises or on public works projects. Towards the end of 1971, Fidel Castro toured Chile extensively during a four-week visit.Castro Speech Data Base - LANIC - Browse Speeches from 1971 This gave credence to the belief of those on the right that \\"The Chilean Way to Socialism\\" was an effort to put Chile on the same path as Cuba. Economics Chile real wages between 1967 and 1977. Orange lines mark the beginning and end of Allende's presidency. The short-term economic results of Minister of Economics Pedro Vuskovic's expansive monetary policy were unambiguously favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in Chile‚Äôs long- endemic chronic inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). In 1972 the Chilean escudo changed 140%. The average Real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of 5.6% (\\"negative growth\\"), and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined.Flores, 1997: title missing from ReferencesStats on declining GDP, in constant dollars http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/chile/gdp-per-capita During this time, a shortage in basic commodities led to the rise of black markets which ended in late 1973 after Allende was ousted. In addition to the earlier- discussed provision of employment, Allende also raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971. These rises in wages were negated by continuing increases in prices for food. Although price rises had also been high under Frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, August 1972. In the period 1970-72, while Allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%.Nove, 1986, pp. 4‚Äì12, tables 1.1 & 1.7 Although nominal wages were rising, there was not a commensurate increase in the standard of living for the Chilean population. The falls in exports were mostly due to a fall in the price of copper. Chile was at the mercy of international fluctuations in the value of its single most important export. As with almost half of developing countries, more than 50 percent of Chile's export receipts were from a single primary commodity.Hoogvelt, 1997 Adverse fluctuation in the international price of copper negatively affected the Chilean economy throughout 1971-72. The price of copper fell from a peak of $66 per ton in 1970 to only $48‚Äì49 in 1971 and 1972. In addition to the hyperinflation, the fall in the value of copper and lack of economic aid would further depress the economy. Initially, the governing coalition expected the unearned wage increases and the consequent increase in government spending to be corrected once the 'structural changes' like nationalisation and agrarian reforms were completed. However, by June 1972, Allende was beginning to see the economic hazards. The minister of economy was changed and some austerity measures introduced, but to little avail. Amidst declining economic indicators, Allende's Popular Unity coalition actually increased its vote to 43 percent in the parliamentary elections early in 1973. However, by this point what had started as an informal alliance with the Christian DemocratsFederal Research Division of the Library of Congress: Chile - Constitutional History - Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830-1973. Retrieved 11 December 2006. was anything but that. The Christian Democrats now leagued with the right-wing National Party and other three minor parties to oppose Allende's government, the five parties calling themselves the Confederation of Democracy (CODE). The conflict between the executive and legislature paralyzed initiatives from either side. His economic policies were used by economists Rudi Dornbusch and Sebastian Edwards to coin the term macroeconomic populism.Dornbusch, Edwards, 1989 Foreign interference and relations Argentina Allende received the 1973 election of H√©ctor C√°mpora, who had previously lived in exile in Chile, as good news. Allende sent in Aniceto Rodr√≠guez to Buenos Aires to work on an alliance between the Socialist Party of Chile and the Justicialism. Later Allende assisted to the presidential inauguration of Campora. All of this was seen with good eyes by Juan Per√≥n who came to refer to Allende as \\"compa√±ero\\". However Per√≥n also used Allende as a warning example for the most radical of his followers. In September just a few days before the 1973 Chilean coup d'etat he addressed the Tendencia Revolucionaria: Per√≥n condemned the 1973 coup as a \\"fatality for the continent\\" stating that the coup leader Augusto Pinochet represented interests \\"well known\\" to him. He praised Allende for his \\"valiant attitude\\" of committing suicide. He took note of the role of the United States in instigating the coup by recalling his familiarity with coup-making processes. Soviet Union Salvador Allende's predecessor, President Frei, improved relations with the USSR. In February 1970, President Frei's government signed Chile's first cultural and scientific agreement with the Soviet Union. Allende's Popular Unity government tried to maintain normal relations with the United States, but when Chile nationalized its copper industry, Washington cut off U.S. credits and increased its support to opposition. Forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, Chile gained commitments from the USSR to invest some $400 million in Chile in the next six years. Allende's government was disappointed that it received far less economic assistance from the Soviet Union than it hoped for. Trade between the two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked to the purchase of Soviet equipment. Moreover, credits from Russia were much less than those provided by China and countries of Eastern Europe. When Allende visited Soviet Union in late 1972 in search of more aid and additional lines of credit, he was turned down. Allegations have been made in a book by Christopher Andrew, based on the handwritten notes of alleged KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin, that Allende was connected to the KGB.The Times extract from the Mitrokhin Archive volume II, by Mitrokhin and historian Christopher Andrew However, the belief that Allende was a KGB agent is not universal. Declarations from KGB General Nikolai Leonov, former Deputy Chief of the First Chief Directorate of the State Security Committee of the KGB, state that the Soviet Union supported Allende's government economically, politically and militarily.Nikolai Leonov, \\"Soviet Intelligence in Latin America During the Cold War \\", Lectures by General Nikolai Leonov, Centro de Estudios Publicos (Chile), 22 September 1999. Leonov stated in an interview at the Chilean Center of Public Studies (CEP) that the Soviet economic support included over $100 million in credit, three fishing ships (that distributed 17,000 tons of frozen fish to the population), factories (as help after the 1971 earthquake), 3,100 tractors, 74,000 tons of wheat, and more than a million tins of condensed milk. In mid-1973, the USSR had approved the delivery of weapons (artillery, tanks) to the Chilean Army. However, when news of an attempt from the Army to depose Allende through a coup d'√©tat reached Soviet officials, the shipment was redirected to another country. United States opposition to Allende The United States opposition to Allende started several years before he was elected President of Chile. Declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the CIA spent $3 million in anti-Allende propaganda \\"to scare voters away from Allende's FRAP coalition\\", and spent a total of $2.6 million to finance the presidential campaign of Eduardo Frei. The U.S. administration of U.S. President Richard Nixon, then embroiled in the Vietnam War and Cold War with the Soviet Union, was openly hostile to the possibility of a second Marxist regime (after Cuba) in the Western Hemisphere. There was clandestine support by the U.S. government to prevent Allende from taking office after election: On 16 October 1970, a formal instruction was issued to the CIA base in Chile, saying in part, \\"It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup. It would be much preferable to have this transpire prior to 24 October, but efforts in this regard will continue vigorously beyond this date. We are to continue to generate maximum pressure toward this end, utilizing every appropriate resource. It is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the USG and American hand be well hidden\\". Regarding the botched attempted-kidnapping and manslaughter of Chilean Army Commander Ren√© Schneider on 22 October 1970 (Schneider was a constitutionalist opposed to the idea of a coup preventing Allende from taking office or removing him after the fact), the Church Committee observed: \\"The CIA attempted, directly, to foment a military coup in Chile. It passed three weapons to a group of Chilean officers who plotted a coup. Beginning with the kidnapping of Chilean Army Commander-in-Chief Rene Schneider. However, those guns were returned. The group which staged the abortive kidnap of Schneider, which resulted in his death, apparently was not the same as the group which received CIA weapons.\\" However, the group which killed Schneider had previously been in contact with the CIA. The agency later paid that group $35,000, according to the Hinchey report, \\"in an effort to keep the prior contact secret, maintain the good will of the group, and for humanitarian reasons\\".Hinchey Report , 18 September 2000. CIA documents indicate that while the CIA had sought his kidnapping, his killing was never intended. Public outrage over the killing of Schneider cooled sentiments for a coup, and neither the U.S. nor Chilean military attempted other removal actions in the early years of the Allende administration. On 26 October, President Eduardo Frei Montalva (Salvador Allende was inaugurated 3 November) named General Carlos Prats as commander in chief of the army in replacement of Ren√© Schneider. Carlos Prats was also a constitutionalist.Andrew J. Rhodes, \\"Chilean Civil-Military Relations\\" With Allende in office, the United States reduced economic aid to the Chilean government. In 1973, the CIA was notified by contacts of the impending Pinochet coup two days in advance, but contends it \\"played no direct role\\" in the coup. After Pinochet assumed power, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Nixon that the United States \\"didn't do it\\" (referring to the coup itself) but had \\"created the conditions as great as possible\\".Kissinger Telcons on Chile Crisis In October 1972, Chile saw the first of what were to be a wave of confrontational strikes led by some of the historically well-off sectors of Chilean society; these received the open support of United States President Richard Nixon. A strike by trucking company owners, which the CIA supported by funding them with US$2 million within the frame of the \\"September Plan\\", began on 9 October 1972.El paro que coron√≥ el fin √≥ la rebeli√≥n de los patrones , El Periodista, 8 June 2003 The strike was declared by the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Transporte, then presided by Le√≥n Vilar√≠n, one of the leaders of the far-right paramilitary group Patria y Libertad. The Confederation, which brought together 165 trucking company business associations, employing 40,000 drivers and 56,000 vehicles, decreed an indefinite strike, paralyzing the country. It was soon joined by the small businessmen, some (mostly professional) unions, and some student groups. Its leaders (Vilar√≠n, Jaime Guzm√°n, Rafael Cumsille, Guillermo Elton and Eduardo Arriagada) expected to topple the government through the strike. Other than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day strike was to bring the head of the army, general Carlos Prats, into the government as Interior Minister, as a sign of appeasement. Comienzan los problemas , part of series \\"Icarito > Enciclopedia Virtual > Historia > Historia de Chile > Del gobierno militar a la democracia\\" on LaTercera.cl. Retrieved 22 September 2006. Carlos Prats had succeeded General Ren√© Schneider after his assassination on 24 October 1970, by two groups, General Roberto Viaux and General Camilo Valenzuela, who had benefitted from logistical and financial support from the CIA. Prats was a supporter of the legalist Schneider doctrine and refused to involve the military in a coup against Allende. In March and July 1972, Allende and the Christian Democrats tried to forge a compromise. The moderate Party of the Radical Left, representing the UP coalition in March, held talks with the Christian Democratic Party over regulations of nationalized firms, but ultimately failed, as the minister of economy Pedro Vuskovic boycotted the negotiations and carried out legally dubious expropriations. As a result, the Radical Left also left the UP coalition, hence the coalition lost 5 senators and 7 deputies. In July, the resumed talks were almost going to succeed, until the more conservative elements within the Christian Democrat party managed to break off the negotiations. From that point on, the political life of the country was highly polarized between two opposing camps: the governing left-wing Unidad Popular and the right-wing opposition of Christian Democrats who were allied with the National Party, a vehemently right-wing opposition party. Tanquetazo Congressional resolutions On 22 August 1973, the Christian Democrats and the National Party members of the Chamber of Deputies voted 81 to 47, a resolution that asked the authorities\\"The President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces\\". to \\"put an immediate end\\" to \\"breach[es of] the Constitution...with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans\\". The resolution declared that the Allende Government sought \\"to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State...[with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system\\", claiming it had made \\"violations of the Constitution...a permanent system of conduct\\". Essentially, most of the accusations were about the Socialist Government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the \\"creation and development of government-protected [socialist] armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces\\". President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as \\"notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks\\".English translation on Wikisource. Two days later, on 24 August 1973, Allende responded, point-by point to the accusations and, in turn, accused Congress of \\"facilitat[ing] the seditious intention of certain sectors\\" and promoting a coup or a civil war by \\"invoking the intervention of the Armed Forces and of Order against a democratically elected government\\". He pointed out that the declaration had failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority constitutionally required to bring an accusation against the president and argued that the legislature was trying to usurp the executive role. He wrote, \\"Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it...With a tranquil conscience...I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside\\". He concluded by calling upon \\"the workers, all democrats and patriots\\" to join him in defense of the constitution and of the \\"revolutionary process\\". La respuesta del Presidente Allende on Wikisource. Final coup In early September 1973, Allende floated the idea of resolving the crisis with a referendum. However, the Chilean military seized the initiative of the Chamber of Deputies' 22 August Resolution (which had implored Allende's military removal) to oust Allende on 11 September 1973. As the Presidential Palace was surrounded and bombed, Allende committed suicide.

Leaves, stems, and rhizomes are used raw or cooked and served as a side dish with meat and rice. The rhizomes of two local species are eaten with chicken's or pig's feet during festivals. The rhizomes are used to make tea or soaked in wine or liquor to flavor the beverages. They are also fried with sugar and honey to make sweet snacks. The starchy rhizomes can be dried, ground, and added to flour to supplement food staples. The rhizome of P. sibiricum is pulped, boiled, strained, and thickened with barley flour to make a sweet liquid seasoning agent called tangxi. At times, people in China have relied on P. megaphyllum as a famine food. The shoots of some Polygonatum can be boiled and used like asparagus. P. cirrifolium and P. verticillatum are used as leafy vegetables in India. The American species P. biflorum has a starchy root that was eaten like the potato and used as flour for bread. P. sibirica is used for a tea called dungulle in Korea.  Traditional medicine  The traditional use of Polygonatum in the treatment of diabetes was first observed in 1930 by Hedwig Langecker. After experiments, she concluded that it was effective in fighting nutritional hyperglycemia, though not that caused by adrenaline release, probably due to its glucokinin content.Source:Quer, P√≠o Font \\"Plantas Medicinales - El Diosc√≥rides renovado\\". 1961/2005 Barcelona: Ediciones Pen√≠nsula, P. verticillatum is used in Ayurveda as an aphrodisiac.Kasmi, I., et al.

It is based in Aberystwyth. The RCAHMW maintains and curates the National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW), an archive with an online platform called Coflein. Professor Nancy Edwards is Chair of the Commissioners.  Mission statement  The Royal Commission has a national role in the management of the archaeological, built and maritime heritage of Wales, as an originator, curator and supplier of information for individual, corporate and governmental decision-makers, researchers and the general public. To this end it; * Surveys, Interprets and Records the man-made environment of Wales; * Compiles, Maintains and Curates the National Monuments Record of Wales; * Promotes an understanding of this information by all appropriate means. The Royal Commission is committed to close partnership working with other organisations in Wales, in particular Cadw and the Welsh Archaeological Trusts. History In 1882 Sir John Lubbock pioneered the First British Ancient Monuments Act. This Act, concerned principally with prehistoric monuments rather than with later, medieval structures, encouraged owners to voluntarily transfer important sites into the safekeeping of Her Majesty's Commissioners of Works. It also discouraged the public from damaging monuments by threatening to impose stiff penalties. The first Schedule of monuments resulted from a nationwide inquiry among interested local antiquarian societies. In order to add monuments to this Schedule, the First Inspector of Ancient Monuments, General Pitt-Rivers, travelled the British Isles examining the known sites, and searching for new ones. Unfortunately, only limited information was available to him and his helpers about the nature, location and condition of many monuments, and there was no easy way to assess the potential national significance or value of any given site. In Wales, there were only three monuments on the first Schedule. These were Plas Newydd megalith, Anglesey, Arthur's Quoit, Gower, Glamorgan and the megalith at Pentre Ifan, Pembrokeshire. By the turn of the century it was becoming clear that a census of archaeological sites was needed, so that a selection of the best could be put forward for Statutory Protection. Consequently, by 1908 the administrative frameworks were in place to establish individual Royal Commissions on Ancient Monuments separately in Scotland, England and Wales. Significantly, their original remit was to encompass not only Historic Monuments, but also Constructions. On 10 August 1908 a Royal Commission was authorised and appointed by King Edward VII to 'make an inventory of the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions connected with or illustrative of the contemporary culture, civilisation and conditions of life of the people in Wales and Monmouthshire from the earliest times, and to specify those which seem most worthy of preservation'. This last injunction was the most urgent purpose of the Commission in the eyes of the legislators, but the inventory was its essential preliminary. The protection of significant sites under the Ancient Monuments Act of Queen Victoria's reign had been severely hampered by a basic lack of knowledge of the country's stock of monuments. So it was felt that an independent and official body was needed to prepare a reliable inventory from which examples could be selected and recommended for statutory protection. This need was not peculiar to Wales, and in 1908 identical Royal Commissions were established for Scotland and England too. Commissioners The early commissioners were distinguished men (there was no woman) who were notable figures in Welsh cultural life, each with a distinctive contribution to make to the task ahead. Their involvement in such long-established scholarly institutions as the Cambrian Archaeological Association and the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion proved invaluable to the Royal Commission from the beginning. For the first four decades of its existence it was based, like other Royal Commissions, in London, which allowed easy access to the British Museum, the Public Record Office and the Cymmrodorion Society, which also had its headquarters in the capital. The Royal Commission's first chairman was Sir John Rhys (died 1915), philologist and professor of Celtic at Oxford University. He oversaw the publication of the first four inventory volumes, which appeared in quick succession: for Montgomeryshire (1911), Flintshire (1912), Radnorshire (1913) and Denbighshire (1914). The second chairman (until his death in 1934) was Evan Vincent Evans. By profession an accountant and journalist, he was a friend of Welsh politicians and a stalwart of eisteddfodau and the Cymmrodorion. The early commissioners, included Edward Anwyl (died 1914), another philologist, professor of Welsh and Comparative Philology at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. Griffith Hartwell Jones (died 1944) was an Anglican clergyman living in Surrey but also chairman of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion. Robert Hughes was a former lord mayor of Cardiff, which had recently been created a city. Henry Owen, a lawyer, was a notable Pembrokeshire historian and another leading light of the Cymmrodorion. J. A. (later Sir Joseph) Bradney, who was the pre-eminent historian of Monmouthshire, was appointed a commissioner during the Great War, when he was also a lieutenant-colonel in the militia. The last of these early commissioners to be appointed (in 1920) was John Morris-Jones, poet and professor of Welsh in the University College of North Wales, Bangor. None of these men were practising archaeologist by the later definition of the term. Two other commissioners, however, included W. E. Llewellyn Morgan, who was on the army retired list, had spent several decades penning field descriptions of monuments; those which he made for the Royal Commission, drawing on his earlier notes, were sufficiently respected to be included in the Pembrokeshire inventory (1925). Finally, Robert Carr Bosanquet (died 1935) was professor of Classical Archaeology at the University of Liverpool. The day-to-day work of the new Commission required specialist staff, and its first secretary was Edward Owen. Between 1908 and 1928 he did much to establish the Commission on sound and respected foundations. A reputable historian of Anglesey origins, he was trained as a lawyer and had served, like many a British civil servant, in the India Office, where he supervised the military store accounts and prepared statistical statements for India. As overall editor of the inventories, he was at pains to extend his knowledge beyond his own expertise in medieval and later manuscripts. His scholarship was widely admired by the Cymmrodorion and the Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society among others. He was also closely involved with the University of Liverpool, where he became reader in Welsh Medieval Antiquities (1921) during his time as the Commission's secretary. Owen's staff included his assistant in 1908, Edward Thomas, was a fine writer and observer of the landscape but he found the Commission's work uncongenial (he regarded himself 'a fish out of water') and resigned to concentrate on literature. Thomas proved to be one of Britain's finest war poets, but in 1917 he was killed in action at Arras. Three other of the early staff made greater contributions to the Commission. George Eyre Evans's life (1857‚Äì1939) spanned the formative years of modern archaeology. As a prolific antiquary with many publications to his name before he joined the Commission, he was most closely associated with Carmarthenshire, particularly the county museum and the antiquarian society. Alfred Neobard Palmer (1847-1915) was appointed in 1910 as a 'temporary assistant inspector of Ancient Monuments' for six months, at 15s. a day with a guinea for subsistence and travelling. Palmer suffered ill health, and his appointment was an act of kindness by Edward Owen, who had earlier secured him a government pension in recognition of his historical researches. A chemist by profession, Palmer turned himself into a local historian, particularly of Wrexham, where the local studies library is named after him. Ivor Mervyn Pritchard, an architect employed by HM Office of Works and Public Buildings, made a long lasting contribution. His services were loaned to the Commission to make plans and drawings for the inventories and he seems to have been responsible for much of the photography. The wash drawing of St Asaph Cathedral that is the frontispiece of the Flintshire volume is by Pritchard, and his plans and pen-and-ink drawings can be seen in the inventories for Denbighshire (1914), Carmarthenshire (1917) and Merioneth (1921). First inventories Following the publication of the first inventories (of Montgomeryshire and Flintshire in 1911-12),the Commission's work was praised in Parliament for its quality and value for money; but the Great War naturally slowed things down. Edward Owen, now unpaid, managed to keep the work going and the Carmarthenshire volume was published at the height of the war in 1917. At the same time (and although he was in his sixties), Owen was anxious to contribute to the war effort through a position in the newlyformed statistics department of the War Office, but he was turned down. For a brief period after the war Owen ran the Commission from his home in Wrexham, until new offices could be found in London. During his visits to the capital he took to sleeping in the office to carry out the work expected of him - which earned a mild rebuke from the Chief Commissioner of Works. The future of the Royal Commission was in some doubt during the years of austerity, when the Office of Works considered a purge of Royal Commissions. This prompted the chairman, Vincent Evans, to urge Owen to publish the Merioneth volume as soon as possible, and when it appeared in 1921 Evans shrewdly sent a copy to the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, who responded by congratulating the commissioners for 'doing a real public service'. The Commission's continuance was not questioned again for nearly seventy years. Nevertheless, financial cutbacks delayed the appearance of the Pembrokeshire inventory, and the Commission itself did not meet formally for two and a half years. The fundamental nature of the inventories was bound to lead the Commission into other areas concerned with the historic sites and monuments it was recording, and this has characterised the Commission throughout its life. As early as 1916 Owen was allowed to make representations to the town clerk of Chepstow about the proposed destruction of a stretch of medieval town wall, and in 1926 the Commission was represented on the committees running the excavations at the Roman fort at Kanovium (Caerhun). Owen himself was in constant demand to give talks to national and local societies, and a steady stream of requests for information came in - for example on the Roman fort at Tomen-y-mur, Whitland Abbey, stone circles, place names and, especially, genealogy. During the mid-1920s developments in professional archaeology exerted growing pressure for change in the approaches, methodology and structure of the Royal Commission. While the Commission had fulfilled its role of identifying monuments worthy of preservation, the volume on Pembrokeshire (1925) attracted criticism for its dearth of original fieldwork and its failure to keep up with advances in architectural recording and interpretation. Edward Owen was prepared to defend the Commission's approach to its work, which had the merit of publishing lists of sites and monuments swiftly in the county inventories. But Owen also saw the need to keep abreast of scholarly advances, even though the financial climate of the post-war years made it difficult to find suitably qualified staff when they would be expected to work for practically nothing. A thorough review of the Commission's operations resulted in major revision of his original guidelines. The Commission had been fortunate in recruiting Cyril Fox, the new director of the National Museum of Wales, as a commissioner; supported by R. C. Bosanquet, he was largely responsible for the changes that were now made. What survived of Owen's guidelines were the county arrangement of inventories and the broad classification scheme he had devised. There was a shift in focus from the use of documents and antiquarian reports to fieldwork, and an insistence on a full record of each site, building or object, with original plans and descriptions made by the Commission itself. Categories or types of structures and objects were henceforward to be identified routinely, noting any significant variations of detail, and reference to the methods used by the English and Scottish Commissions in describing and mapping monuments would be more frequent. The opportunity was not taken to extend the remit of the Commission's investigators to buildings dated after 1714, but this year was an advance on the earlier guidelines. Special attention would now be drawn to domestic structures of all sorts, including 'humbler dwellings'. Another novelty was consultation with 'official referees' whose specialist advice would supplement the expertise of the small number of commissioners, especially in new and developing fields of knowledge. This enabled the Commission to recruit advisers of the calibre of J. E. Lloyd (the distinguished medieval historian) and Mortimer Wheeler (the go-ahead archaeologist who became keeper of the London Museum after resigning as director of the National Museum of Wales in 1926). In the remaining two years of his secretaryship Owen put in order the work already done on Anglesey. It was left to his successor, Wilfred j. Hemp, to oversee the full implementation of the new guidelines. As an experienced inspector of Welsh monuments in the Office of Works and a plain-speaking advocate of archaeology and archaeologists, in many ways Hemp was ideal for the task. On the other hand, he found the administrative burdens in a period of economic depression tiresome and his insistent attempts to squeeze resources from the 'singularly ill-informed' Treasury seem to have been less effective than the efforts of Vincent Evans, who was familiar with the corridors of Whitehall. The annual budget of the Commission was raised from ¬£1,250 to ¬£1,700 at the time of Hemp's appointment, but the story of the next decade is essentially one of constant struggle by both chairman and secretary to secure expert investigative staff and refine the quality of reporting, building on the principles of 1926. Leonard Monroe, a trained architect, was appointed as the secretary's assistant, and Hemp decided to employ Stuart Piggott, a young archaeologist with a distinguished career ahead of him, instead of a typist (but on a typist's salary of ¬£3 a week). Convinced that each specialist member of 'a skeleton staff of three should be a first rate man', Hemp nevertheless estimated that it would take forty years to complete the county inventories to the standard now adopted. The test of the Commission's revised strategy and Hemp's stewardship was the Anglesey inventory, on which work had been proceeding since the mid-1920s. In November 1929 Hemp estimated that 'it should be completed in about four years, if the services of a typist can be obtained'. In Hemp's mind it also depended on strengthening the complement of staff, particularly in field archaeology; but, as the government grappled with economic crises over the next few years, there was little sympathy shown at the Treasury. A desperate Leonard Monroe repeatedly threatened to resign, and in 1933 Stuart Piggott did so. Even Hemp was moved to tell the commissioners that henceforward they could only count on receiving the 'statutory allowance' of his time. In the event, the Anglesey book was published in 1937. Its approach and structure set the pattern for the inventory volumes that would follow over the next half-century. One of its most striking features was its emphasis on the comparative study of sites and buildings and on the use of examples to establish types of structures so as to provide a deeper understanding of past societies. Site descriptions were arranged by parishes, maps and plans were generously provided, the spelling of Welsh place names followed principles recommended by J. E. Lloyd rather than the antiquated practices of the Ordnance Survey, and a helpful glossary of terms was included. The book was praised because it 'not only set a fresh standard for work in Wales, but also dealt more comprehensively with the archaeology and history of the district concerned than did the publications of the fellow Commissions for England and Scotland'. Sadly, Vincent Evans, the long-serving chairman who had presided over the transformation of the Commission's work, died in November 1934, before the Anglesey inventory was published. He was succeeded by the Earl of Plymouth. The next item on the agenda was the Caernarfonshire inventory. There was much to be said for applying the knowledge gained in Anglesey to the county immediately across the Menai Strait, and sporadic collection of materials on Caernarfonshire had taken place already. But the Second World War caused major disruption to the Commission's plans for this volume. During the war Hemp ran the evacuated Commission from his home in Criccieth. This enabled him to devote happy days to research and writing on a county that was the Commission's priority. His long-standing interest in history, genealogy and heraldry was applied to the wealth of medieval stone carvings and inscriptions, and his experience as an inspector for the Office of Works enabled him to report in 1941 on clearances at Conwy Castle so that additions could be made to its newly surveyed plan. Soon after the war ended, Hemp retired and Leonard Monroe moved elsewhere. In terms of experienced staff, and therefore continuance of its work, the Commission stood at a crossroads. Second World War During the war another strand of investigation and recording began that was later to be bound into the Royal Commission. This was the creation in 1940 of the National Buildings Record for England, Scotland and Wales because of concern that buildings might be destroyed by enemy action without any record ever having been made of them. With limited resources, it set about the formidable task of rapidly compiling a national architectural archive, and in a very short space of time it amassed an impressive collection of photographs and drawings, including the Courtauld Institute's already established Conway Library. Leonard Monroe was seconded to the National Buildings Record from the Royal Commission to cover south Wales. Photographers around the country were also engaged to photograph buildings in areas judged to be at greatest risk: most prolific of those working in Wales was George Bernard Mason, who produced photographs of exceptional quality. After the war the National Buildings Record photographers took to recording buildings ahead of the new threat posed by demolition, as owners of many fine houses could no longer afford to maintain them. In 1946 the Royal Commission was clear about its programme of future work: to complete the Caernarfonshire inventory along modern lines. But more immediate decisions were needed about where the Commission should be based and who was to lead its small staff. A. H. A. Hogg (died 1989) was appointed the secretary in 1949. Hogg was by profession a civil engineer, but he had strong interests and field experience in archaeology going back to his teenage years. He came to the Royal Commission from a lectureship in engineering at Cambridge University. Hogg was par excellence a field worker, who imbued two generations of investigators with the principles and practices of rigorous recording, using chain, tape and theodolite. Probably at his urging, it was decided to base the Commission in Aberystwyth rather than return to London. Aberystwyth had the advantages of a central location in Wales and scholarly facilities close by in The National Library of Wales. The Commission has remained in Aberystwyth ever since. By 1949 the rest of the Commission's staff was mostly young and inexperienced, with the singular exception of C. N. Johns, who had wide knowledge as a crusader castle archaeologist in the Palestine Department of Antiquities in the 1930s and '40s, and immediately after the war had been seconded from the Royal Commission to be the British controller of antiquities and excavations in Libya. His was a name to conjure with in Middle Eastern archaeology for long after, and he applied his field experience to good effect in north Wales. During the years of recovery and growing prosperity in the '50s and early '60s, the staff grew in number and became more specialised in both field survey and site and building recording, eventually with a specialist photographer and professional illustrator, all of whose services ensured that the three Caernarfonshire volumes published between 1956 and 1964 maintained and enhanced the standards achieved in the Anglesey book twenty years earlier. Petrol rationing at first had delayed the fieldwork, which was made more difficult, too, by mountainous terrain and bad weather. An important modification of the principles was made to extend the cut-off date for recording vernacular architecture of Wales from 1714 to 1750, with some examination of buildings constructed between then and 1850. These changes in the evolution of the Commission's interpretation of 'historic monuments' reflected the passage of time and the life of buildings, as well as ideas about what should be recorded and preserved. In the more industrialised counties of Wales this would shortly raise very large issues for the Commission's future programme. like the earlier stress on 'humbler dwellings' in the Anglesey inventory (of which a new edition appeared in 1960), the modifications doubtless owed much to Cyril Fox, still one of the commissioners, and to the publication of his and Lord Raglan's three volumes on Monmouthshire Houses in 1951-4. The Caernarfonshire books broke new ground in their recording of hundreds of huts and field systems, site descriptions like that of Caernarfon Castle (in Volume II), and the space given to local vernacular architecture and the small churches of the Caernarfonshire countryside. Volume II recorded the discoveries of the Roman marching camp at Penygwryd and Roman fort at Pen Llystyn. Volume III included the first complete survey ever made of Bardsey, the Isle of Saints. The whole enterprise was informed by a multiplicity of skilful plans and maps, as well as by hundreds of photographs. National Monuments Record of Wales In 1963 responsibility for the National Buildings Record was transferred to the three Royal Commissions and it was amalgamated with the records gathered during the course of their own work over the previous half-century. The Commissions were explicitly empowered to continue this established architectural work. In Wales Peter Smith was assigned as the emergency recorder with special responsibility for domestic architecture. By this stage the Commission had also amassed a considerable archive of measured drawings, surveys and photographs through its own inventory programme. These records documented archaeological sites and buildings of all periods, and the amalgamation created a substantial national archive which was renamed the National Monuments Record of Wales to reflect its unique scope and importance. Its primary functions were 'to provide an index of all monuments, so that inquirers can be directed at once to the best information concerning any structure; and to fill the gaps in that information'. These ambitious and important aims resulted in a classified card index, innovatory in its day, for every known site and structure in Wales. Managed by C. H. Houlder, it laid the foundation of the Commission's structured archive, database and enquiry service as they are today. Monuments in the National Monuments Record of Wales are assigned a National Primary Record Number or NPRN. When the Commission came to survey the county of Glamorgan, it faced a much larger and more complex body of architecture than that in previous inventories. A greater proportion of investigators' time was needed for architectural survey than for traditional earthwork archaeology, and it was realised that it would be possible to progress the work more efficiently if the system of recording by parishes were abandoned in favour of recording by a combination of period and monument type. Volume I, published in 1976, therefore focussed exclusively on prehistoric and early medieval Glamorgan and represented a major departure. This and the plans for further thematic volumes in the Glamorgan inventory were essentially the work of A. H. A. Hogg and his team. Although Hogg himself had retired as secretary in 1973, he continued to lend his services to the Commission until his late seventies. In the meantime several other important developments had broadened the Royal Commission's responsibilities. In 1969 it took the initiative to list information for local authorities. Commissioners were sensitive to the inevitably slow progress of the authoritative, detailed inventory programme, and it seemed helpful to complement it with a rapid survey of those monuments that were increasingly at risk from development: they were defined as 'all types of ancient structures which are no longer capable of active use', a definition that allowed the inclusion of certain industrial monuments but excluded churches and mansions. A further advantage of this new project was that priority could be given to two counties that so far had no inventories. Yet only two of these new lists were issued: the first for Cardiganshire in 1970 and the second in 1973 for the 'Early Monuments' of Monmouthshire. Excavated and recorded sites A second experiment capitalised on the Commission's growing archive of excavated and recorded sites. In 1971 it published what it saw as 'the first of a series of reports by which... the National Monuments Record of Wales hopes to provide accounts of the major field monuments for which no adequate descriptions exist'. This was a detailed survey of the hut settlement on Gateholm Island, Pembrokeshire. The commissioners turned for another development to one of the senior investigators, Peter Smith, who had been studying over a number of years the historical and stylistic evolution of house types in Wales. The resulting book, Houses of the Welsh Countryside, which was brought out at the end of 1975 to coincide with 'Architectural Heritage Year',decisively demonstrated that the inventories could take yet another form, as national studies of a topic. Smith's book, a contribution of European importance to the history of domestic architecture, was published to great acclaim, and an expanded edition appeared in 1988. Excavation was a prominent activity of the Royal Commission during Hogg's period as secretary, reflecting his own interests and the dearth of other organisations to carry them out. For example, between 1957 and 1960 staff were diverted to the rescue excavation of the Roman fort at Pen Llystyn, Caernarfonshire, and in 1962 Hogg directed rescue excavations associated with a hydro-electric scheme on the site of Bronze Age cairns at Aber Camddwr, Cardiganshire. For several seasons in the 1960s, L. A. S. Butler conducted excavations in medieval Conwy, including in the vicarage garden where a medieval building had possibly been destroyed during Owain Glyn D≈µr's revolt. Other excavations at this time were part of the inventory programme for Glamorgan, such as at Harding's Down in Gower, where a rampart section was cut and an entrance and two hut platforms were revealed in an Iron Age hillfort. The Commission made many significant archaeological discoveries, not the least being the identification of six new Roman marching camps between 1954 and 1972. Of great significance for the future were the trials which the Commission made in the early 1970s of the use of vertical aerial photography to speed up the survey of nationally important sites: of the Pembrokeshire hillforts Gaer Fawr and Carn lngli in 1973, and in 1974 of Carn Goch, a hillfort in Carmarthenshire. The methodology was also adopted for the medieval site of Cefnllys Castle in Radnorshire. Staff The Commission's staff was active in the wider archaeological world in the post-war period. Hogg had a fruitful partnership with the castle historian, D. J. C. King, to compile lists of early castles and masonry castles in Wales and the Marches. He and several colleagues collaborated to publish the reports of pre-Second World War excavations at the hillfort of Pen Dinas, Aberystwyth. The fourth secretary of the Royal Commission, Peter Smith (from 1973 to 1991), had joined the organisation in 1949 after a brief period as a trainee architect during which he became disillusioned with the prevailing modernist trend in architecture. At the outset his principal aim was to continue with the Glamorgan inventory, and five massive volumes were published between 1976 and 2000 which were highly praised - though even as the millennium ended the plan had not been fully realised. At the same time progress was made on the sites and monuments of Brecknock and a revision of the Radnorshire book of 1913 was begun to bring it up to modern scholarly standards. The chairman of the Commission, W. F. Grimes, encouraged greater interest in industrial remains - though he himself was a notable prehistorian. Particular attention was given to the early communications systems of the Swansea valley: a prelude to more extensive studies of Wales's canals and the remains of the Swansea region's industries. In the post-war decades the Royal Commission had consistently supported the county history movement in Wales, and in due time practically all the volumes that appeared - and continue to appear - in the series of histories of the counties of Glamorgan, Cardigan, Pembroke, Merioneth and Monmouth have drawn on the Commission's archive for illustrations and, in some cases, on its staff and commissioners for chapters. On the other hand, the Royal Commission's role in excavation was bound to change from the 1970s onwards. The creation of the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts as excavating units removed the need for the Commission to be as centrally involved in such activity as it once had been. Following the formation of English Heritage to cover historic environment functions in England, it was decided to take a fresh look at the Royal Commissions. Management consultants were engaged by the government to examine 'value for money'. As far as Wales was concerned, in 1988 their report stated that 'Our strong impression of RCAHMW is that the best has become the enemy of the good. It is inward-looking, rather with the aura of an old-fashioned university department, it has not recognised the need for good management practices and the Commission has not fully recognised the value of integrating non-inventory activities into its priorities... If RCAHMW is to represent good value for money, there needs to be major re-orientation of effort.' This report was accepted by the government. The debate about the usefulness of 'static' county inventories in a changing world where developers, planners and owners needed direct access to current, reliable information about the historic environment had gone on for decades. The 1960s had seen the first shift away from inventory compilation with the establishment of the National Monuments Records in Wales, Scotland and England - making concrete the concept of the dynamic record. This dynamic record was made real through the work of the Welsh Archaeological Trusts, who were pioneers in developing computerised Historic Environment Records (HERs) in the 1970s. This was pioneered by Don Benson who was then Chief Executive of the Dyfed Archaeological Trust, and the HERs remain key to the delivery of archaeological public benefit across Wales today.. The 'active' role of the HERs is supported by the 'archive' role of the NMRW. Ordnance Survey From the Royal Commission's point of view, an alternative to the static record of the inventories had been under consideration before the Commission's inception - the Ordnance Survey's (OS) record of archaeological sites for map depiction - and this would in due course be brought into the Royal Commissions. The Ordnance Survey's archaeology officer, C. W. Phillips, argued that, 'This continuous aspect of the work is of great importance and compares favourably with that of some other institutions which are unable to continue their work in it effectively once they have completed the inventory of a county, excellent though that inventory normally is'. He warned ruefully that, the Royal Commissions' completion of their inventories 'cannot be expected before much of the matter of their inquiry has been either damaged or destroyed'. Antiquities had been shown on OS maps from the late eighteenth century (at least two of the iconic features of these maps were introduced first in Wales: Gothic script for antiquities in 1812 and Egyptian typeface for Roman remains in 1816). Until the end of the Great War the identification and interpretation of antiquities had taken place in consultation with local experts and antiquaries, but in 1920 the Survey had appointed its first archaeological officer, 0. G. S. Crawford, who built up a small but expert group, including W. F. Grimes, who later became chairman of the Welsh Commission. Throughout the 1950s and '60s the OS archaeology branch amassed a considerable body of material on antiquities, which went far beyond what was required for mapping. The sites index included a short description and interpretation of each site, with bibliographical references and field observations. These were usually accompanied by a measured plan, normally at the appropriate basic mapping scale but sometimes supplemented with enlarged surveys and cross-sections to aid interpretation and help in draughting the published map. In 1983 the Survey's archaeological division was transferred to the three Royal Commissions along with its invaluable sites index and responsibility for surveying, interpreting and maintaining a record of archaeological sites depicted on OS maps. In Wales since then the Royal Commission itself has continued to provide mapping information to the Ordnance Survey for basic scales and for derived mapping such as the popular 1/50,000 scale Landranger series. The supply of this information is an invaluable product of the Royal Commission's archaeological survey projects, ensuring that every user of Ordnance Survey maps can appreciate the historic sites depicted. The consultants in 1988 estimated that only 11 per cent of the Commission's resources were allocated to Wales's National Monuments Record. They accordingly recommended an adjustment of the balance with the Commission's publications programme: increased priority should be given to the National Monuments Record 'as the destination of... survey data' for Wales, and computer-based technologies should be developed for 'the storage, retrieval and dissemination of data'. Along with improved management structures and an emphasis on staff training to ensure the future capacity of the Commission, here was a clear remit for the new chairman, Professor J. B. Smith, and the new secretary, Peter White, who came from English Heritage with extensive experience of administrative and financial management; both were appointed in 1991. In the following year a revised Royal Warrant confirmed the changed priorities of the Royal Commission. In 1991 the crucial information technology post was created, and Terry James rather belatedly recast the Commission's data and introduced electronic recording. The use of the same software as that for the regional sites and monuments records helped the Commission to lead a partnership that resulted in data exchange through the Extended National Database (END). Welsh Uplands Survey Less significant were the expansion of the aerial survey programme of the 1980s and the introduction of the extraordinarily fruitful survey to cover all of the extensive Welsh uplands. Both of these initiatives continue to make distinctive contributions to Welsh archaeology by locating thousands of hitherto unsuspected sites. Greater managerial skills were needed to operate the Commission's increasingly complex infrastructure and the Plas Crug building at Aberystwyth, into which the Commission moved in 1990. At the same time the undoubted professionalism and scholarship of the Commission's staff were harnessed to maximum effect. This was well demonstrated by the large Welsh Nonconformist Chapels project, which was carried forward in partnership with the voluntary organisation, Capel. In time, all such projects came to be allocated to one of three branches, covering the main functions of survey and investigation, information management and public services, with close working between the staff of each. The Commission's publications continued to prove a strength and extended far beyond the county inventories. Books were produced on topical subjects and particular sites or buildings. Studies of the collieries of Wales, Brecon Cathedral, Newport Castle (Pembrokeshire) and Guns across the Severn (the fortifications in the Severn channel) spring to mind. Gradually, from the 1990s onwards, there also developed a portfolio of outreach activity to complement management of the archive, supported by an education officer and organised from a refurbished library that welcomes the public. Archive The Royal Commission's archive gave the organisation a renewed raison d'√™tre. Years of under-capitalisation of the National Monuments Record had meant that it had no effective, modern finding aids. Computerisation of the records data now began to unlock its riches, including the collection of images, the largest of its kind in Wales and half as big again as that of the National Library. The National Monuments Record had become a nationwide resource of a nature different to that of the regional sites and monuments records. It expanded rapidly with significant donations from many public and private sources supplementing the detailed survey and photographic records of the Commission itself. Transfers from many other public organisations, including Cadw on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government, take place from time to time. Important collections have been accepted from the private and commercial sectors, one of the most notable being the acquisition in 2008 of the Aerofilms collection of historic oblique air photographs. Today, the photographs in the National Monuments Record are Wales's largest national collection, with about 1.5 million images. A foretaste of the future was the Commission's participation in the Gathering the Jewels project, which provided an opportunity to make available online many notable images from the National Monuments Record and began a digitisation programme which remains one of the Commission's priorities in its service to the public. SWISH Partnership Providing public access to its collections is a paramount objective of the SWISH partnership (Shared Web Information Services for Heritage) to develop online public services. This collaboration with the Scottish Royal Commission, based in Edinburgh, was the first such project between the two devolved administrations that had recently come into being. SWISH supports Coflein, the Commission's free internet service, which at present carries details of some 80,000 sites as well as the National Monuments Record archive catalogue, and gives direct access to an ever-expanding number of images and other digital records - a resource that would have far exceeded the expectations of the consultants in 1988. In 2006 SWISH began developing the Historic Wales Portal, which offers access to the historic environment records of a wide range of bodies, including the National Museum, Cadw, and the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts. The SWISH partnership enabled access to the National Monuments Record using map searching online. In allocating additional funding to this imaginative project, the new Welsh Assembly Government demonstrated its confidence in the abilities and purposes of the Royal Commission and the role it plays in safeguarding and managing the nation's heritage. Hidden Histories A five-episode BBC television series following the field investigations of the Commission, Hidden Histories, was broadcast in 2008 on BBC2 Wales and in 2009 on BBC4. A second series was in production in summer 2009. Both series were made by Element Productions Ltd and presented by Huw Edwards. Proposed merger In May 2012, the Welsh Government announced that it wished \\"to create a process whereby the core functions of the Royal Commission could be merged with other organizations, including Cadw\\". The merger would have been similar to that undertaken in England in 1999, when the English Royal Commission was absorbed into English Heritage. Following a consultation exercise, the Minister for Culture and Sport announced in January 2014 that the two organisations would remain separate for the time being. Services The RCAHMW maintains and curates the National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW) holding a national collection of information about the archaeological, architectural and historical heritage of Wales and provides a public information service, drawing on both archival and published sources and benefiting from specialist advice from RCAHMW staff. The National Monuments Record includes drawings, photographs, maps, plans and descriptions for a total of over 80,000 sites, buildings and maritime remains. With 1.5 million photographs, it is the largest photographic archive in Wales. The NMRW is an archive for research purposes, as distinct from the Historic Environment Records maintained by the Welsh Archaeological Trusts on behalf of Welsh Ministers by statute, which are the primary active record for all of Wales. Enquiry services The National Monuments Record of Wales welcomes enquiries from individuals and organisations interested in the many and varied aspects of the heritage of Wales. Library and search room The Commission's specialist reference library contains books and journals, which may be consulted during public opening hours. Copies of material from the archive may also be purchased. Research and recording The Survey and Investigation Team of the Royal Commission are responsible for collating information on the heritage of Wales, both on land and within Welsh waters. Their work concentrates particularly on under-represented and under-recognised elements of Welsh heritage, together with features of national or regional importance. The Royal Commission draw heavily on work undertaken by the Welsh Archaeological Trusts, and are particularly proficient in acquiring information from other databases. The results are disseminated widely through a range of media, often without acknowledging the original source. Archive The National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW) holds information about the historic environment of Wales. It includes almost two million items, including photographs, drawings, surveys, reports and maps. Coflein Coflein is the online database for the National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW). The name is derived from the Welsh cof (memory) and lein (line). Coflein contains details of many thousands of archaeological sites, monuments, buildings and maritime sites in Wales, together with an index to the drawings, manuscripts and photographs held in the NMRW archive collections. Coflein is very much an archive, whereas the Historic Environment Records are a statutory resource maintained by the Welsh Archaeological Trusts on behalf of Welsh Ministers, and are the primary active record for all of Wales. Publications The Commission has published over a hundred books developing and promoting understanding of aspects of the historic environment.

He is currently an assistant coach with the United States men's national soccer team.  Playing career  Kub√≠k was born in Vysok√© M√Ωto, Pardubice Region and began his career in 1981 with Hradec Kr√°lov√©, and moved to local powers Slavia Prague the following year. He made his international debut for Czechoslovakia in 1985. In 1989, he was bought by Serie A club Fiorentina, and played there for two years. He moved to Ligue 1 club FC Metz in 1991, and then to Bundesliga team 1. FC N√ºrnberg in 1993, before returning to the Czech Republic with Drnovice FK, SK Slavia Prague, and AFK L√°znƒõ Bohdaneƒç. Kub√≠k moved to Major League Soccer in 1998, joining the expansion team Chicago Fire. While helping the Fire to win both the MLS Cup and the U.S. Open Cup in their inaugural year, Kub√≠k was named the MLS Defender of the Year. Kub√≠k continued to be a valuable attacking force from the back in 1999, registering 5 goals and 8 assists, and was named in the MLS Best XI for a second time. The Fire traded Kub√≠k to the Dallas Burn during the 2001 offseason in exchange for Sergi Daniv. Kub√≠k's final year was again beset by injuries, and he only managed to play 11 games for the Burn. Kub√≠k retired due to injury at the end of the 2001 MLS season and returned to the Czech Republic. Kub√≠k was also a stalwart for the Czechoslovakian and Czech Republic's national teams, representing Czechoslovakia in the 1990 FIFA World Cup and the Czech Republic in Euro 96. He played in his last international game in 1997.  Coaching and managerial career  Kub√≠k had a brief spell working for Hradec Kr√°lov√© and in the summer of 2006 was appointed as manager of Polish side ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw. However, he was sacked in October 2006 after just 11 league games in charge. He was appointed manager of the English Football League Two side Torquay United on 27 November 2006 through his close friendship with Torquay chairman Chris Roberts. Despite his impressive playing career, his lack of managerial experience and contacts in England was a problem, not aided by Roberts appointing Richard Hancox as Kubik's assistant. Torquay struggled under Kubik, winning just twice in 15 games, and he left club by mutual consent on 5 February 2007, with Torquay deep in relegation trouble. Roberts also resigned as chairman later that month. Torquay would be relegated at the end of the season, ending a 79-year spell in the Football League.

It is an often painful condition in which the nail grows so that it cuts into one or both sides of the paronychium or nail bed. While ingrown nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet, they occur most commonly with the toenails (as opposed to fingernails), and for the most part are only problematic and painful on the big toe. A common conception is that the nail enters into the paronychium, but an \\"ingrown toenail\\" can simply be overgrown toe skin. The condition starts first from a microbial inflammation of the paronychium, and then a granuloma, which results in a nail buried inside of the granuloma. A true ingrown toenail is caused by actual penetration of flesh by a sliver of toenail.Ingrown Toenail: Signs and symptoms Ingrown nail in hallux toe Symptoms of an ingrown nail include pain along the margins of the nail (caused by hypergranulation that occurs around the aforementioned margins), worsening of pain when wearing tight footwear, and sensitivity to pressure of any kind, even the weight of bedsheets. Bumping of an affected toe can produce sharp and even excruciating pain as the tissue is punctured further by the nail. By the very nature of the condition, ingrown nails become easily infected unless special care is taken early to treat the condition by keeping the area clean. Signs of infection include redness and swelling of the area around the nail, drainage of pus and watery discharge tinged with blood. The main symptom is swelling at the base of the nail on the ingrowing side (though it may be both sides). Onychocryptosis should not be confused with a similar nail disorder, convex nail, nor with other painful conditions such as involuted nails, nor with the presence of small corns, callus or debris down the nail sulci (grooves on either side). Causes The main contributor to onychocryptosis is footwear, particularly ill-fitting shoes with inadequate toe-box room and tight stockings that apply pressure to the top or side of the foot. Other factors may include the damp atmosphere of enclosed shoes, which soften the nail-plate and cause swelling on the epidermal keratin (eventually increasing the convex arch permanently), genetics, trauma and disease. Improper cutting of the nail may cause the nail to cut into the side-fold skin from growth and impact, whether or not the nail is truly \\"ingrown\\". The nail bends inwards or upwards depending on the angle of its cut. If the cutting tool, such as scissors, is at an attitude in which the lower blade is closer to the toe than the upper blade, the toenail will tend to grow upwards from its base, and vice versa. The process is visible along the nail as it grows, appearing as a warp advancing to the end of the nail. The upper corners turn more easily than the center of the nail tip. Holding the tool at the same angle for all nails may induce these conditions; as the nail turns closer to the skin, it becomes harder to fit the lower blade in the right attitude under the nail. When cutting a nail, it is not just the correct angle that is important, but also how short it is cut. A shorter cut will bend the nail more, unless the cut is even on both top and bottom of the nail. Simple representation of the formation of ingrown nails. Causes may include: * Shoes causing a bunching of the toes in the developmental stages of the foot (frequently in people under 21), which can cause the nail to curl and dig into the skin. This is particularly the case in ill-fitting shoes that are too narrow or too short, but any toed shoes may cause an ingrown nail. * Poor nail care, including cutting the nail too short, rounded off at the tip or peeled off at the edges instead of being cut straight across. * Broken toenails. * Trauma to the nail plate or toe, which can occur by dropping objects on or stubbing the toenail, or by the nail protruding through the shoe (as during sports or other vigorous activity), can cause the flesh to become injured and the nail to grow irregularly and press into the flesh. * Predisposition, such as abnormally shaped nail beds, nail deformities caused by diseases or a genetic susceptibility, increases the chance of an ingrown nail, but the ingrowth cannot occur without pressure from a shoe. * A bacterial infection, treatable with antibiotics. One study compared patients with ingrown toenails to healthy controls and found no difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. In some cases, however, there is nail deformity. Ingrown toenails are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that have too much soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.  Prevention  The most common digit to become ingrown is the big toe, but ingrowth can occur on any nail. Ingrown nails can be avoided by cutting nails straight across; not along a curve, not too short and no shorter than the flesh around it. Footwear that is too small or too narrow, or with too shallow a \\"toe box\\", will exacerbate any underlying problem with a toenail. Sharp square corners may be uncomfortable and cause snagging on socks. Proper cutting leaves the leading edge of the nail free of the flesh, precluding it from growing into the toe. Filing of the corner is reasonable. Some nails require cutting of the corners far back to remove edges that dig into the flesh; this is often done as a partial wedge resection by a podiatrist. Ingrown toe nails can be caused by injury, commonly blunt trauma in which the flesh is pressed against the nail causing a small cut that swells. Injury to the nail can cause it to grow abnormally, making it wider or thicker than normal, or even bulged or crooked. Management The treatment of an ingrown toenail partly depends on its severity. Conservative treatment Mild to moderate cases are often treated conservatively with warm water and epsom salt soaks, antibacterial ointment and the use of dental floss. If conservative treatment of a minor ingrown toenail does not succeed, or if the ingrown toenail is severe, surgical treatment may be required. A \\"gutter splint\\" may be improvised by slicing a cotton-tipped wooden applicator diagonally to form a bevel and using this to insert a wisp of cotton from the applicator head under the nail to lift it from the underlying skin after a foot soak.American Association of Orthopedic Specialists, \\"ingrown toenail\\" at Surgery A toe following wedge resection with an image of the nail removed Surgical treatment for an ingrown nail is carried out by a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and special surgical instruments. The surgical approach is the removal of the offending part of the nail plate known as a wedge resection. If the ingrown toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. Surgical treatment for ingrown nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments. Nail bracing A less widely used treatment for ingrown toenails is nail bracing. Nail braces work by gently lifting the sides of the toenail and eventually retraining the nail to grow to a flatter shape over time. The total time needed for the nail to be reshaped is one full nail growth or about 18 months.: There are two main types of nail braces: adhesive and hooked. Adhesive nail braces are generally made of a thin strip of composite material that is glued to the top of the nail. The strip naturally tries to return to a flat state and lifts the edges of the nails in the process. Hooked nail braces consist of a hook (usually made of dental wire) placed under either side of the nail with some type of tensioning system pulling the hooks together. Because of the curved shape of the nail, the tensioning device rests on the higher middle of the nail by applying upward pressure to the sides of the nail. In studies of diabetics, who need to avoid surgery when possible, nail bracing was found to be effective at providing immediate, as well as long- term, relief.

Sabalo (SS-302) was laid down on 5 June 1943 by Cramp Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia; launched on 4 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Martha C. Oman, wife of Rear Admiral Charles M. Oman (Ret.), commander of the U S Naval Convalescent Hospital, Monroe, N.Y.; and commissioned on 19 June 1945 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Lt. Comdr. James Gold Andrews in command. After trials in the Delaware River, Sabalo proceeded to the Submarine Base, New London, Conn., for shakedown and training. She operated locally from New London until June 1946 when she began preparations for inactivation. She decommissioned on 7 August at Portsmouth, N.H., and was placed in reserve in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, remaining there until recommissioning on 1 June 1951 at New London. In August 1951, Sabalo departed New London for Pearl Harbor, her new home port. Arriving in September, she conducted local operations into February 1952. From 18 February to 28 September, she underwent conversion to a \\"Fleet Snorkel\\" type at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. This was a less-extensive alteration than the GUPPY conversion received by many World War II \\"Fleet boats\\" during the same general period. Sabalo was given a new streamlined sail, but retained her original hull form. Following this conversion, she alternated local operations with simulated war patrols while deployed to the western Pacific. The first deployment, 26 December 1952 to 26 June 1953, was followed by a second, mid-November 1954 to 10 May 1955. Her third deployment, 17 September ‚Äì 4 November 1955, was conducted off Alaska and among the eastern Aleutian Islands. In September 1966, Sabalo's home port was changed to San Diego, and she resumed training operations off the west coast, primarily providing services to ships undergoing ASW, type, and refresher training. Sabalo served in that capacity as a unit of the 1st Fleet until decommissioned on 1 July 1971. Struck from the Navy Register the same day, she was sunk as a target in SubSinkEx Project \\"Thurber\\" off San Diego on 21 February 1973. Some sources http://usssabalo.org/History_Sabalo.html indicate that the sinking was by deliberate partial flooding to acquire acoustic data on submarine implosions.

It is similar to the console-based GNU Midnight Commander, GNOME Commander for the GNOME desktop environment, or Total Commander for Windows, all of which can trace their paradigmatic features to the original Norton Commander for DOS. It supports extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced search, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content comparisons, batch renaming, etc. It supports the following archive formats: tar, ZIP, bzip2, gzip, RAR, ace, ARJ, LHA, 7z and RPM and can handle other KIO Slaves such as smb or fish. Krusader is published under GNU General Public License.  User interface  Krusader's user interface is based on the orthodox file manager (OFM) principle, also known as Commander-like file managers, the family of file managers based on the old Norton Commander interface. The orthodox file manager has two windows called panels where one is active and the other inactive. The idea is to manipulate files from active to inactive panel or within the active panel. Only the keyboard is required to do this, which makes the process much faster. Using the mouse is still an option. Krusader's deep integration into KDE (e.g. KParts, KIO) allows it to provide several additional services.  File viewer-editor  One of the many tools that Krusader provides is the viewer-editor. Using the KParts object model, Krusader executes components that are capable of viewing (and sometimes editing) specific filetypes and embeds their client area directly into a new Krusader window. This makes it possible (for example) to view an office document directly from within Krusader. Any application that implements the KParts model correctly can be embedded in this fashion.  Platforms  Krusader is primarily developed for the Linux platform, but it is available for some other platforms. These include BSD and Apple Mac OS X.

Career before politics Before entering Parliament Bloxham was an IHC community support worker and owned a masonry business together with her husband Rod. Political career Bloxham first became involved with politics in 1981 when she joined the Labour Party and from 1987 to 1990 she was a member of Labour's national council. In 1993 she contested the Labour nomination for the electorate, but lost to Jim Sutton as she \\"...knew there was no way the Timaru Labour Party would select me because of my gender for one thing.\\" By then she was totally disillusioned with Labour particularly the Rogernomics economic reforms and immediately joined New Zealand First upon the party's foundation. At the 1993 general election she stood as the New Zealand First candidate in Timaru, finishing fourth. In 1994 she was elected vice-president of New Zealand First and party spokesperson for health. Member of Parliament She was an MP from 1996 to 1999, representing the New Zealand First party.

It was first described in 1825 for an occurrence in the Espartinas Saltworks, Ciempozuelos, Madrid, Spain and was named for the French chemist, Louis Jacques Th√©nard (1777‚Äì1826). Thenardite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and often forms yellowish, reddish to gray white prismatic crystals although usually in massive crust deposits. Thenardite is fluorescent, white in shortwave and yellow-green in longwave UV radiation. In humid conditions, thenardite gradually absorbs water and converts to the mineral mirabilite, Na2SO4¬∑10H2O.

At , it is the highest peak in the Atlas Mountains, Morocco, North Africa and the Arab World. Located south of the city of Marrakesh, and visible from it, Toubkal is an ultra prominent peak, the highest for over . For climbers it is \\"the most popular mountain objective in the Atlas mountains\\". Geography Although much of the High Atlas consists of sedimentary rocks, the Toubkal massif is an area of volcanic rocks which have weathered into alpine crests, cut by deep, narrow valleys. To the south, the mountain drops steeply down for to a small lake called Lac d'Ifni. To the west, the mountain's edge is marked by a pass, the Tizi n'Ouanoums at . From this pass, the mountain's W-S-W ridge rises up to Toubkal West, which forms a shoulder at before continuing to the summit at . The north and western side of Toubkal drains down to the Mizane Valley, which has the passes of both Tizi n'Ouanoums and Tizi n'Ouagane at its head. Two hanging valleys on the western side of the mountain - the Ikhibi Nord and Ikhibi South provide ready access for trekkers and climbers to reach Toubkal's summit. At one time the northern valley provided the normal route of ascent, but the construction of a mountain hut by the French Alpine Club below Ikhibi Sud now encourages trekkers to ascent via the southern route instead. Access Toubkal is popular with trekkers and ski mountaineers, but less so with climbers, despite its ease of access and sunny climate. Trekkers usually approach the mountain from Marrakesh via the road-end village of Imlil. Qualified guides can be hired, as well as porters, to carry equipment and food supplies higher into the mountains. Since 2018, guides are now required even for the normal route, due to recent events on the trail (murder and deadly slips). Otherwise it is a moderate hike and navigation is not a problem. The normal route starts with an easy walk to the village of Aroumd. Past Aroumd a floodplain is crossed and the route follows the left slope of the valley southwards. The valley bends to the east to the tiny settlement of Sidi Chamharouch, which has grown around a Muslim shrine. At Sidi Chamharouch, the path leads over the stream and runs steeply uphill to the right side of the Isougouane valley, which leads to two stone-built refuges (Refuge du Toubkal and Refuge Les Mouflons) that are often used as base camp at . It is possible to buy good meals in the Refuge du Toubkal. Tents can be pitched near the refuges for a small charge & they offer five dorms for a total of 89 persons. Routes The highest peak of Toubkal The first recorded ascent was on 12 June 1923 by the Marquis de Segonzac, Vincent Berger and Hubert Dolbeau, but the mountain may well have been climbed before that date.Robin G. Collomb, Atlas Mountains, Goring: West Col, 1980 Toubkal's height was measured the following year, and determined as being Nowadays measured at 4,167 metres, the summit is crowned with a large pyramidal metal trigonometric marker, and offers views taking in most of the Atlas and Little Atlas Mountains. It is possible to climb mountain Toubkal in two days - first day up to the refuge (around seven hours), second day to the summit (around four hours ascent, three hours descent) and back to Imlil (up to five hours). In summer the mountains can be very dry, but are sometimes subject to storms. Although the temperature should remain above zero during the day, freezing conditions are possible over 3,500m. In winter the mountains are covered in snow and ice, and can be prone to avalanches. Skiing is possible as the snow can lie to considerable depth and cover many rocky slopes. Information about the state of the route can be obtained at Marrakesh tourist offices or at Imlil. 1) Ikhibi Sud (normal route). From the Toubkal refuge, a path crosses the stream, climbs a steep scree slope to the east and enters a hanging valley, then climbs another steep slope to reach a col (Tizi'n'Toubkal at 3,940m). At the col the route turns left (northwards) up easy slopes to the narrow summit crest of Jebel Toubkal. The ascent during the summer (from May) is non-technical yet moderately difficult, only complicated by steep and slippery scree slopes and altitude sickness. Sturdy boots and proper (windproof) clothing are required, and trekking poles are helpful on the scree. An ice-axe may be needed on the remaining snowfields in the early summer. The ascent during the end of the winter and spring (February/March) is more difficult; crampons are necessary to ascend through the snow and - in some cases - ice. Ascent: ; 2.5 ‚Äì3 hours. 2) Ikhibi Nord Not as frequently ascended as Ikhibi Sud, but technically easier. The route starts some distance down the valley from the Toubkal refuge, and turns right (eastwards) to follow a track up through a hanging valley to a col on the north side of Toubkal. Ascent:; 3‚Äì4 hours. The col also gives access to adjacent peaks of Imouzzer and Tibherine 3) West-North-West Ridge (ONO Arete). (First ascent by J de Lepinay and party, 1936). Infrequently climbed, but a long and pleasant traverse containing many gaps and towers. Some difficulties can be avoided by means of an abseil. Grade III/IV; 7 hours. On 17 December 2018, two trekkers, from Denmark and Norway, were murdered close to the foot of the trail in a terror-related attack.

As classical composer and virtuoso Bell was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Because he had been misdiagnosed at an early age as having a disease that would lead to blindness, his parents gave him a musical upbringing. He was something of a child prodigy, composing his first concerto at the age of 12. He graduated from the Royal College of Music in 1957. While studying there, he became friends with the flautist James Galway. From 1958 to 1990 he composed several classical works, including three piano sonatas, two symphonies, Three Images of Ireland in Druid Times (in 1993) for harp, strings and timpani, Nocturne on an Icelandic Melody (1997) for oboe d'amore and piano and Three Transcendental Concert Studies (2000) for oboe and piano. He had mastered and held a notable collection of instruments, including various harps, harpsichord, piano, cymbalom, and all the members of the oboe family of instruments (musette, oboe, cor anglais, bass oboe) and the heckelphone As manager of the Belfast Symphony Orchestra, Bell was responsible for maintaining the instruments and keeping them in tune. Out of curiosity, he asked Sheila Larchet-Cuthbert to teach him how to play the harp. Over time he had many harp teachers. In 1965 he became an oboist and harpist with the BBC Northern Ireland Orchestra. He had been known to be able to skilfully play the pedal harp, neo-Celtic harp, and wire-strung Irish-Bardic harp. Bell served as a professor of harp at the Academy of Music in Belfast. Bell was briefly featured in a 1986 BBC documentary, The Celts, in which he discussed the role and evolution of the harp in Celtic Irish and Welsh society. Derek Bell also appeared with Van Morrison at the Riverside Theatre at the University of Ulster in April 1988. An hour-long BBC special was broadcast in which Derek Bell talks extensively as well as accompanying Morrison on several songs including \\"On Raglan Road\\". The video is available on YouTube in full \\"VAN MORRISON - In Conversation and Music 1988\\". Apart from this, video of him only exists in minor interviews and performances with The Chieftains. As dulcimer player The hammered dulcimer is documented as having been played in Ireland in the 18th century and is mentioned by James Joyce as an instrument he heard being played in the street. Bell introduced a small cimbalom (a hammered dulcimer from central and eastern Europe), which he called tiompan after the medieval Irish instrument. Bell was an admirer of the music of Nikolai Karlovich Medtner and was the co-founder, with the bass-baritone Hugh Sheehan, of the first British Medtner Society which gave a series of successful concerts of Medtner's music in the 1970s long before Medtner's music was recognised as it is today. The Chieftains On St Patrick's Day in 1972 Bell performed on the radio of the music of Turlough O'Carolan, an 18th-century blind Irish harpist. At that time O'Carolan's music was virtually unknown, though today almost every album of harp music contains one of his compositions. Working with Bell on the project were several members of The Chieftains. Bell became friends with the leader of the Chieftains, Paddy Moloney. For two precarious years, he recorded both with the BBC Northern Ireland Orchestra and with The Chieftains, until finally becoming a full-time member of the Chieftains in 1975. Eccentricity Bell was the only member of the band to wear a tie at every public performance. He favoured socks with novelty designs, such as images of Looney Tunes characters. He wore scruffy suits, often with trousers that were too short. He was eccentric and told obscene jokes. The title of his 1981 solo album Derek Bell Plays With Himself has a conscious double-entendre. While touring in Moscow he grabbed his alarm clock and put it in his pocket while rushing to catch a plane. He was then stopped by the Soviet police on suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon. Paddy Moloney affectionately called him \\"Ding Dong\\" Bell. He relished the eclectic collaborations, such as those with Van Morrison, Sting and the Chinese orchestra. In 1991 he recorded with his old friend James Galway. He was awarded an MBE in the 2000 Queen's Birthday Honours for services to traditional music. Eastern religions From the early 1960s, Bell was a friend of Swami Kriyananda, also known as J. Donald Walters (also an avid composer of music for the Irish harp). Bell and some associates visited Kriyananda at his spiritual centre in Ananda village in Nevada City, California. Bell wrote a preface to an edition of Kriyananda's book Art As a Hidden Message. He writes, \\"After reading it, I decided to get in touch with him... I also visited Ananda several times, the beautiful village Kriyananda himself founded in 1968... I offered to record some of Kriyananda's music.\\" His first album, Mystic Harp, with Kriyananda was positively reviewed by the New York Times, \\"This is a lovely, light album full of charm and innocence [...] The Mystic Harp will take you to places that stretch from the innocence of childhood to the mystery and otherworldliness of the spiritual.\\" His final album was also with Kriyananda, Mystic Harp vol II, a collection of compositions in a new age style for solo harp quite different from the traditional and classical compositions for which he was otherwise known. In August 2002, only weeks before his death, Bell visited Kriyananda. Although he was raised as a Protestant, he became a Buddhist later in life. Death Bell died of cardiac arrest in Phoenix, Arizona on 17 October 2002, just four days shy of his 67th birthday. He is remembered at Cambridge House Grammar School, Ballymena, as House Patron of Bell House.

Muslim disagreement over whether to include the Basmala within the Quranic text, reached consensus following the 1924 Cairo Edition, which included it as the first verse (ƒÅyah) of Quran chapter 1 but otherwise included it as an unnumbered line of text preceding the other relevant 112 chapters.William A. Graham \\"Basmala\\" Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an, Vol. 1 The Basmala is used by Muslims in various contexts (for instance, during daily prayer) and is used in over half of the constitutions of countries where Islam is the official religion or more than half of the population follows Islam, usually the first phrase in the preamble, including those of Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Pakistan, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. In Arabic calligraphy, the Basmala is the most prevalent motif, even more so than the Shahadah. In Unicode, the Basmala is encoded as one ligature at code point U+FDFD in the Arabic Presentation Forms-A block.  Name  The traditional name for the phrase in Classical Arabic was Tasmiyah (). Other common phrases in Islam were also given their own names based on verb form 2 verbal nouns, including Tasbih () for \\"Subhan Allah\\", Tahmid () for \\"Alhamdulillah\\", Takbir () for \\"Allahu Akbar\\", Tahlil () for \\"la ilaha illa Allah\\", and \\"Ta'awwudh\\" () for the phrase \\"I seek refuge with God from the pelted Satan\\" (, ). The word basmala was derived from a slightly unusual procedure, in which the first four pronounced consonants of the phrase bismi-llƒÅhi... were used to create a new quadriliteral root:A New Arabic Grammar of the Written Language by J.A. Haywood and H.M. Nahmad (London: Lund Humphries, 1965), , p. 263. b-s-m-l (). This quadriliteral root was used to derive the noun basmala and its related verb forms, meaning \\"to recite the basmala\\". The method of coining a quadriliteral name from the consonants of multiple words in a phrase is also used to create the name '\\"Hamdala\\" for Alhamdulillah, instead of the traditional name of Tahmid. The same procedure is also used to create the term Hawqala.  Use and significance  Thuluth simple script According to Lane, ' has the more intensive meaning, taken to include as objects of \\"sympathy\\" both the believer and the unbeliever, and may therefore be rendered as \\"the Compassionate\\"; ', on the other hand, is taken to include as objects the believer in particular, may be rendered as \\"the Merciful\\" (considered as expressive of a constant attribute). In the Qur'an, the Basmala is usually numbered as the first verse of the first sura, but, according to the view adopted by Al-Tabari, it precedes the first verse. Apart from the ninth sura (\\"At-Tawba\\"), Al-Qurtubi reported that the correct view is that the Basmala ignored at the beginning of At-Tawba because Gabriel did not refer to the Basmala in this surah, another view, says that Muhammad died before giving a clarification if At-Tawba is part of the eighth sura (Al-Anfal) or not. It occurs at the beginning of each subsequent sura of the Qur'an and is usually not numbered as a verse except at its first appearance at the start of the first sura. The Basmala occurs as part of a suras text in verse 30 of the 27th sura (\\"An-Naml\\"), where it prefaces a letter from Sulayman to Bilqis, the Queen of Sheba. The Basmala is used extensively in everyday Muslim life, said as the opening of each action in order to receive blessing from God. Reciting the Basmala is a necessary requirement in the preparation of halal food. In the Indian subcontinent, a Bismillah ceremony is held for a child's initiation into Islam. The three definite nouns of the Basmala‚ÄîAllah, ar-Rahman and ar- Rahim‚Äîcorrespond to the first three of the traditional 99 names of God in Islam. Both ar-Rahman and ar-Rahim are from the same triliteral root R-·∏§-M, \\"to feel sympathy, or pity\\". The Basmala has a special significance for Muslims, who are to begin each task after reciting the verse. It is often preceded by Ta'awwudh.  Hadith  Thuluth script There are several ahadith encouraging Muslims to recite it before eating and drinking. For example: > Jabir reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (saw) saying, \\"If a person > mentions the Name of Allah upon entering his house or eating, Satan says, > addressing his followers: 'You will find nowhere to spend the night and no > dinner.' But if he enters without mentioning the Name of Allah, Satan says > (to his followers); 'You have found (a place) to spend the night in, and if > he does not mention the Name of Allah at the time of eating, Satan says: > 'You have found (a place) to spend the night in as well as food.\\"' :‚Äî From > Muslim > Aisha reported: \\"The Prophet said, ‚ÄúWhen any of you wants to eat, he should > mention the Name of God in the beginning (Bismillah). If he forgets to do it > in the beginning, he should say Bismillah awwalahu wa akhirahu (I begin with > the Name of God at the beginning and at the end)\\". :‚Äî From At-Tirmidhi and > Abu Dawud > Umaiyyah bin Makshi reported: \\"The Prophet was sitting while a man was > eating food. That man did not mention the Name of God till only a morsel of > food was left. When he raised it to his mouth, he said, Bismillah awwalahu > wa akhirahu. The Prophet smiled at this and said, \\"Satan had been eating > with him but when he mentioned the Name of God, Satan vomited all that was > in his stomach\\". :‚Äî From Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa'i > Wahshi bin Harb reported: \\"Some of the Sahaba of the Prophet said, 'We eat > but are not satisfied.' He said, 'Perhaps you eat separately.' The Sahaba > replied in the affirmative. He then said, 'Eat together and mention the Name > of God over your food. It will be blessed for you.' :‚Äî From Abu Dawood According to a Tradition, Muhammad said:Titus Burckhardt (2008) [1959]. An Introduction to Sufi Doctrine. World Wisdom Inc., Bloomington IN, USA. . p. 36. > All that is contained in the revealed books is to be found in the Qur‚Äôan and > all that is contained in the Qur‚Äôan is summed up in the surat al-fatihah > (\\"The opening one\\") while this is in its turn contained in the formula > Bismillahi-r-Rahmani-r-Rahim (\\"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the > Merciful\\"). A tradition ascribed to Imam Ali states: > The basmalah is in essence contained in the first letter, Ba, and this again > in its diacritical point, which thus symbolizes principal Unity.  Tafsir  thumb In a commentary on the Basmala in his Tafsir al-Tabari, al-Tabari writes: :‚ÄúThe Messenger of Allah (the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Jesus was handed by his mother Mary over to a school in order that he might be taught. [The teacher] said to him: ‚ÄòWrite ‚ÄúBism (In the name of)‚Äù.‚Äô And Jesus said to him: ‚ÄòWhat is ‚ÄúBism‚Äù?‚Äô The teacher said: ‚ÄòI do not know.‚Äô Jesus said: ‚ÄòThe ‚ÄúBa‚Äù is Baha‚Äôu'llah (the glory of Allah), the ‚ÄúSin‚Äù is His Sana‚Äô (radiance), and the ‚ÄúMim‚Äù is His Mamlakah (sovereignty).‚Äù In note 330 on page 274 of the same book Dr. Momen states the following: \\"At- Tabar√≠, J√°mi‚Äô-al-Bay√°n, vol. 1, p.40. Some of the abbreviated editions of this work (such as the Mu‚Äôassasah ar-Ris√°lah, Beirut, 1994 edition) omit this passage as does the translation by J. Cooper (Oxford University Press, 1987). Ibn kath√≠r records this tradition, Tafs√≠r, vol. 1, p. 17. As-Suy√∫t√≠ in ad-Durr al-Manth√∫r, vol. 1, p. 8, also records this tradition and gives a list of other scholars who have cited it including Ab√∫ Na‚Äô√≠m al-Isfah√°n√≠ in Hilyat al- Awliya‚Äô and Ibn ‚ÄòAs√°kir in Tar√≠kh Dimashq.\\"  Numerology  The total value of the letters of Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim, according to the standard Abjadi system of numerology, is 786. This number has therefore acquired a significance in folk Islam and Near Eastern folk magic. A recommendation of reciting the basmala 786 times in sequence is recorded in Al-Buni. S√ºndermann (2006) reports that a contemporary \\"spiritual healer\\" from Syria recommends the recitation of the basmala 786 times over a cup of water, which is then to be ingested as medicine.Katja S√ºndermann, Spirituelle Heiler im modernen Syrien: Berufsbild und Selbstverst√§ndnis - Wissen und Praxis, Hans Schiler, 2006, p. 371. It has also become common to abbreviate the phrase by typing \\"786\\", especially in online communication, and especially among South Asian Muslims. In popular culture The Iranian authorities permitted an album of songs by English rock band Queen to be released in Iran in August 2004, partly because the song \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" contains several exclamations of the word Bismillah.

It is on the northern approach to the pass, a saddle between the Otira and Bealey Rivers high in the Southern Alps. Otira means \\"o\\" (place of) and \\"tira\\" (the travellers). John Burns Gallery of Modern Art nestled in the ≈åtira valley Otira was originally a stop on the Cobb and Co stagecoach from Canterbury to the West Coast. The Midland Line was extended from Stillwater to Jacksons in 1894 and then Otira in 1899, when the pass was navigated by coach from Otira until the railway tunnel opened in 1923. During construction of the tunnel, Otira housed about 600 workers and their families. The Otira Railway Station was opened on 13 November 1900 (ex- Goat Creek on 15 October 1900), and closed in February 1992. In the 1950s the town had a population of about 350, but this had dropped to 11 in 1988. For Otira and its surrounds the population was 54 in the 2013 census, a decrease of 33 from 2006. While a small number of railway houses existed at the time the Otira Tunnel was being built, the vast majority were built in 1922 and 1923. They were needed to house staff required for the greatly-upscaled railway operation following the completion of the tunnel. Love Brothers from Port Chalmers had the contract to build 43 houses in the new village. A further house was built in 1951 at the bottom end of the village road. This survives today, along with 16 others from the former railway village. The New Zealand Railways Corporation sold the village houses to Glenstone Holdings around the end of 1990, with a peppercorn lease on the land. In 1998 the remaining 18 ex-railway houses (one has since burnt down) were sold to Chris and Bill Hennah, along with the large two-storeyed hotel, community hall and fire station. The 20-odd hectares of leased land included the school grounds. The Hennahs bought the old school building itself, and nearby indoors swimming pool in 2002. Love Brothers also built the railway hostel for refreshment rooms staff, along with the refreshment rooms which were situated at the north end of the railway station. The 'Refresh', as it was known, closed in November 1987 with the commencement of the TranzAlpine service between Christchurch and Greymouth. Having paid $73,000 in 1998, the Hennahs put the village on the market in 2010 with an asking price of NZ$1.5 million. No bids were received but it remained on the market. When advertised again in 2013 the sale price had dropped to NZ$1 million, and it sold the following year to Lester Rowntree for an undisclosed sum, although as at 2020 the Hennahs still own the ex- school building and swimming pool. Not far from the hotel (originally opened in 1902 but rebuilt following a fire in 1911) is the former post office which was built in 1952 to replace an earlier one. This has been refurbished into an art gallery known as the 'John Burns Gallery of Modern Art'. The complex exhibits world class art which is a surprise to many visitors, housed as it is in the middle of the Southern Alps. The former postmaster's house also survives. Heading up the valley, there are a number of houses dotted along the highway. Rata Lodge Backpackers is situated near Goat Creek and provides alternative accommodation to the Otira Stagecoach Hotel. When the tunnel opened in 1923, traction power for the Otira to Arthur's Pass electrified section was provided by a steam-driven generating station known as the 'Power House' ‚Äî a large imposing building which included a big shed and repair workshop for the electric locomotives. The steam generating plant closed in July 1941, with the source of power then coming from the newly-constructed transmission line from Lake Coleridge to the West Coast. This involved building a transformer substation at Otira, along with a rectifier substation at the tunnel mouth. Staffing required at the Otira substation meant four houses were built, two of which still survive. Meanwhile the old power house has been demolished. Close to the town are two major feats of civil engineering: the Otira Tunnel, and the Otira Viaduct. Otira Viaduct The Otira viaduct The Otira viaduct is to the south of Otira, between Otira and the Arthur's Pass summit. Completed in 1999 by McConnell Smith Pty Ltd, the four-span viaduct carries State Highway 73 over a stretch of unstable land, replacing a narrow, winding, dangerous section of road that was prone to avalanches, slips and closures.

He was the New Zealand First Member of Parliament for Te Tai Tonga from 1996 to 1999. Early life Born in Manutuke, Wyllie affiliates to the NgƒÅi TƒÅmanuhiri, NgƒÅti Ruapani and Rongowhakaata iwi. He was educated at Gisborne Boys' High School where he played rugby for the 1st XV. He then went to Victoria University of Wellington, where he studied law. He worked as a bus driver, court clerk, teacher trainee and as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Education, Iwi Transition Agency and the Department of Health. Rugby career While at Victoria, Wyllie played rugby league for New Zealand Universities between 1975 and 1977. He then played representative rugby union for Wellington from 1978 to 1983 and New Zealand MƒÅori from 1979 to 1982. In the off-seasons he played overseas, in Ireland, the United States, Germany and France. His sole appearance for the All Blacks came in 1980, when he played against the touring Fijian side, scoring a try. The game was not recognized as a full international. Member of Parliament Wyllie represented Te Tai Tonga as a member of parliament from 1996 to 1999 for the New Zealand First Party. He defeated 29-year parliamentary veteran Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan with a majority of 285 votes enabling New Zealand First to capture all five MƒÅori seats in the 1996 election (including Te Tai Tonga). When the Tight five led by Tau Henare splintered from New Zealand First and created the Mauri Pacific party, Wyllie chose to remain loyal to the party core. During the 1999 election he sought re-election as MP for Te Tai Tonga, but chose not to stand on the party list. He was defeated by Mahara Okeroa of the Labour Party by 4522 votes.

It is located some north-west of Paris and from Rouen. Construction began in 1196 under the auspices of Richard the Lionheart, who was simultaneously King of England and feudal Duke of Normandy. The castle was expensive to build, but the majority of the work was done in an unusually short period of time. It took just two years and, at the same time, the town of Petit Andely was constructed. Ch√¢teau Gaillard has a complex and advanced design, and uses early principles of concentric fortification; it was also one of the earliest European castles to use machicolations. The castle consists of three enclosures separated by dry moats, with a keep in the inner enclosure. Ch√¢teau Gaillard was captured in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands several times in the Hundred Years' War, but in 1449 the French king captured Ch√¢teau Gaillard from the English king definitively, and from then on it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Ch√¢teau Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt to be a threat to the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey is open to the public from March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year. History Background Richard the Lionheart inherited Normandy from his father, Henry II, in 1189 when he ascended the throne of England. There was rivalry between the Capetians and the Plantagen√™ts, Richard as the Plantagen√™t king of England was more powerful than the Capetian king of France, despite the fact that Richard was a vassal of the French king and paid homage for his lands in the country. From 1190 to 1192, Richard the Lionheart was on the Third Crusade. He was joined by Philip II of France as each was wary that the other might invade his territory in his absence. Richard was captured and imprisoned on the return journey to England, and he was not released until 4 February 1194. In Richard's absence, his brother John revolted with the aid of Philip; amongst Philip's conquests in the period of Richard's imprisonment was the Norman Vexin and a few towns around such as Le Vaudreuil, Verneuil and √âvreux. It took Richard until 1198 to reconquer a part of it.. Construction Perched high above the River Seine, an important transport route, the site of Ch√¢teau Gaillard, in the manor of Andeli, was identified as a naturally defensible position. In the valley below the site was the town of Grand Andely. Under the terms of the Treaty of Louviers (January 1196) between Richard and Philip II neither king was allowed to fortify the site; despite this, Richard intended to build a castle at Andeli. Its purpose was to protect the duchy of Normandy from Philip II‚Äîit helped fill a gap in the Norman defences left by the fall of Ch√¢teau de Gisors and above all Ch√¢teau de Gaillon, a castle which belonged to Philip and used as an advanced French fortification to block the Seine valley‚Äîand to act as a base from which Richard could launch his campaign to take back the Norman Vexin from French control. Indeed, Les Andelys is located just in front of Gaillon on the other side of the Seine valley. Richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation. Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the diocese's most profitable, and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war. When Philip besieged Aumale in northern Normandy, on the border with Picardy, Richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor, although the act was opposed by the Church. A 17th-century portrait of Richard the Lionheart, the man responsible for building Ch√¢teau Gaillard. In an attempt to get Pope Celestine III to intercede, Walter de Coutances left for Rome in November 1196. Richard sent a delegation to represent him in Rome. One of the party, Richard's Lord Chancellor William Longchamp (who was also Bishop of Ely), died during the journey, although the rest, including the Philip of Poitou, Bishop of Durham, and Guillaume de Ruffi√®re, Bishop of Lisieux, arrived in Rome. Walter de Coutances meanwhile issued an interdict against the duchy of Normandy which prohibited church services from being performed in the region. Roger of Howden detailed \\"the unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of Normandy\\". Construction began with the interdict hanging over Normandy, but it was later repealed in April 1197 by Celestine, after Richard made gifts of land to Walter de Coutances and the diocese of Rouen, including two manors and the prosperous port of Dieppe. The site of Ch√¢teau Gaillard had not been fortified before, and the town of Petit Andely was constructed at the same time; together with the historical Grand Andely, the two are known as Les Andelys. The castle sits on a high limestone promontory, 90 m above Les Andelys and overlooking a bend in the River Seine. The castle was connected with Les Andelys through a series of contemporary outworks. During King Richard's reign, the Crown's expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent by Henry II, Richard's father, although this has been attributed to a concentration of resources on Richard's war with the king of France. However, the work at Ch√¢teau Gaillard cost an estimated ¬£12,000 between 1196 and 1198. Richard only spent an estimated ¬£7,000 on castles in England during his reign, similar as his father Henry II. The Pipe rolls for the construction of Ch√¢teau Gaillard contain the earliest details of how work was organised in castle building and what activities were involved. Amongst those workmen mentioned in the rolls are miners, stone cutters, quarrymen, masons, lime-workers, carpenters, smiths, hodmen, water carriers, soldiers to guard the workers, diggers who cut the ditch surrounding the castle, and carters who transported the raw materials to the castle. A master-mason is omitted, and military historian Allen Brown has suggested that it may be because Richard himself was the overall architect; this is supported by the interest Richard showed in the work through his frequent presence. The keep of Ch√¢teau Gaillard is surrounded by a moat. Not only was the castle built at considerable expense, but it was built relatively rapidly; construction of large stone castles often took the better part of a decade; for instance the work at Dover Castle took place between 1179 and 1191 (at a cost of ¬£7,000). Richard was present during part of the construction to ensure construction proceeded at a rate he was happy with. According to William of Newburgh, in May 1198 Richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a \\"rain of blood\\". While some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen, Richard was undeterred: After just a year, Ch√¢teau Gaillard was approaching completion and Richard remarked \\"Behold, how fair is this year-old daughter of mine!\\" Richard later boasted that he could hold the castle \\"were the walls made of butter\\". By 1198, the castle was largely completed. At one point, the castle was the site of the execution of three soldiers of the king of France in retaliation for a massacre of Welsh mercenaries ambushed by the French; the three were thrown to their deaths from the castle's position high above the surrounding landscape. In his final years, the castle became Richard's favourite residence, and writs and charters were written at Ch√¢teau Gaillard, bearing \\"apud Bellum Castrum de Rupe\\" (at the Fair Castle of the Rock). Richard did not enjoy the benefits of the castle for long, however, as he died in Limousin on 6 April 1199, from an infected arrow wound to his shoulder, sustained while besieging Ch√¢lus. The Siege of Ch√¢teau Gaillard An impression by Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc, a 19th- century architect experienced in renovating castles, of how the Siege of Ch√¢teau Gaillard would have looked After Richard's death, King John of England failed to effectively defend Normandy against Philip's ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. Ch√¢teau de Falaise fell to Philip's forces, as well as castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24 June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid siege to Ch√¢teau Gaillard, which was captured after a long siege from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued the siege throughout the winter and King John made no attempt to relieve the castle, it was only a matter of time before the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for the siege is Philippidos, a poem by William the Breton, Philip's chaplain. As a result, modern scholars have paid little attention to the fate of the civilians of Les Andelys during the siege. The local Norman population sought refuge in the castle to escape from the French soldiers who ravaged the town. The castle was well supplied for a siege, but the extra mouths to feed rapidly diminished the stores. Between 1,400 and 2,200 non- combatants were allowed inside, increasing the number of people in the castle at least fivefold. In an effort to alleviate the pressure on the castle's supplies, Roger de Lacy, the castellan, evicted 500 civilians; this first group was allowed to pass through the French lines unhindered, and a second group of similar size did the same a few days later. Philip was not present, and when he learned of the safe passage of the civilians, he forbade further people being allowed through the siege-lines. The idea was to keep as many people as possible within Ch√¢teau Gaillard to drain its resources. Roger de Lacy evicted the remaining civilians from the castle, at least 400 people, and possibly as many as 1,200. The group was not allowed through, and the French opened fire on the civilians, who turned back to the castle for safety, but found the gates locked. They sought refuge at the base of the castle walls for three months; over the winter, more than half their number died from exposure and starvation. Philip arrived at Ch√¢teau Gaillard in February 1204, and ordered that the survivors should be fed and released. Such treatment of civilians in sieges was not uncommon, and such scenes were repeated much later at the sieges of Calais in 1346 and Rouen in 1418‚Äì1419, both in the Hundred Years' War. The French gained access to the outermost ward by undermining its advanced main tower. Following this, Philip ordered a group of his men to look for a weak point in the castle. They gained access to the next ward when a soldier named Ralph found a latrine chute in use through which the French could clamber into the chapel. After ambushing several unsuspecting guards, and setting fire to the buildings, Philip's men then lowered the movable bridge and allowed the rest of their army into the castle. The Anglo-Norman troops retreated to the inner ward. After a short time the French successfully breached the gate of the inner ward, and the garrison retreated finally to the keep. With supplies running low Roger de Lacy and his garrison of 20 knights and 120 other soldiers surrendered to the French army, bringing the siege to an end on 6 March 1204. In drawn-out medieval sieges, contemporary writers often emphasised the importance of dwindling supplies in the capitulation of the garrison, as was the case with the Siege of Ch√¢teau Gaillard. With the castle under French control, the main obstacle to the French entering the Seine valley was removed; they were able to enter the valley unmolested and take Normandy. Thus, for the first time since it had been given as a duchy to Rollo in 911, Normandy was directly ruled by the French king. The city of Rouen surrendered to Philip II on 23 June 1204. After that, the rest of Normandy was easily conquered by the French. Under French control In 1314, Ch√¢teau Gaillard was the prison of Margaret and Blanche of Burgundy, future queens of France; they had been convicted of adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair, and after having their heads shaved they were locked away in the fortress. Following the Scottish defeat at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333 during the Second War of Scottish Independence, the child-king David II and certain of his court were forced to flee to France for safety. At the time, southern Scotland was occupied by the forces of King Edward III of England. David, then nine years old, and his bride Joan of the Tower, the twelve-year- old daughter of Edward II, were granted the use of Ch√¢teau Gaillard by Philip VI. It remained their residence until David's return to Scotland in 1341. David did not stay out of English hands for long after his return; he was captured after the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346 and endured an eleven- year captivity in the Tower of London. During the Hundred Years' War between the English and French crowns, possession of the castle switched several times. Ch√¢teau Gaillard‚Äîalong with Ch√¢teau de Gisors, Ivry-la-Bataille, and Mont Saint-Michel‚Äîwas one of four castles in the Normandy which offered resistance to Henry V of England in 1419, after the capitulation of Rouen and much of the rest of the Duchy. Ch√¢teau Gaillard was besieged for a year before it was surrendered to the English in December 1419; all the resisting castles except Mont Saint-Michel eventually fell, and Normandy was temporarily returned to English control. √âtienne de Vignolles, a mercenary (routier) known as La Hire, then re-captured Ch√¢teau Gaillard for the French in 1430. However, the English were revived by the capture and execution of Joan of Arc, and although by then the war was turning against them, a month later they captured Ch√¢teau Gaillard again. When the French gained ascendancy again between 1449 and 1453 the English were forced out of the region, and in 1449 the castle was taken by the French for the last time. By 1573, Ch√¢teau Gaillard was uninhabited and in a ruinous state, but it was still believed that the castle posed a threat to the local population if it was repaired. Therefore, at the request of the French States-General, King Henry IV ordered the demolition of Ch√¢teau Gaillard in 1599. Some of the building material was reused by Capuchin monks who were granted permission to use the stone for maintaining their monasteries. In 1611, the demolition of Ch√¢teau Gaillard came to an end. The site was left as a ruin, and in 1862 was classified as a monument historique. In 1962, a conference on the contributions of the Normans to medieval military architecture was held at Les Andelys. Allen Brown attended the conference and remarked that the castle was \\"in satisfying receipt of skilful care and attention\\". The journal Ch√¢teau Gaillard: √âtudes de Castellogie M√©di√©vale, which was published as a result of the conference, has since run to 23 volumes, based on international conferences on the subject of castles. In the 1990s, archaeological excavations were carried out at Ch√¢teau Gaillard. The excavations investigated the north of the fortress, searching for an entrance postulated by architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc, but no such entrance was found. However, the excavation did reveal was that there was an addition to the north of the castle to enable the use of guns. Typologically, the structure has been dated to the 16th century. The conclusion of the excavations was that the site had \\"enormous archaeological potential\\", but that there were still unanswered questions about the castle. After Philip II took Chateau Gaillard, he repaired the collapsed tower of the outer bailey that had been used to gain access to the castle. The archaeological investigation examined the tower generally thought to be the one collapsed by Philip, and although it did not recover any dating evidence, the consensus is that he completely rebuilt the tower. In conjunction with the archaeological work, efforts were made to preserve the remaining structures. Today, Ch√¢teau Gaillard's inner bailey is open to the public from March to November, while the outer baileys are open all year round. Layout and innovations A plan of Ch√¢teau Gaillard by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, with north pointing to the bottom-left hand corner. The inner- bailey and keep is at the bottom of the plan and the outer-bailey is at the top. But there is at least one mistake, the tower supposed to contain the latrins on the right of the keep, was not round but square. Ch√¢teau Gaillard consists of three baileys‚Äîan inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle‚Äîand a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner-bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles to be the result of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Ch√¢teau Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Ch√¢teau de Chinon, built by Henry II in the mid-12th century on a promontory overlooking a town. The outer bailey is the southernmost feature of the castle; it is pentagon shaped and there are five towers spaced along the wall, three of which are at corners. North of the outer bailey is the middle bailey which is an irregular polygon; like the outer bailey, the wall of the middle bailey is studded with towers. The towers allowed the garrison to provide enfilading fire. In the fashion of the time, most of the towers in the curtain walls of the middle and outer baileys were cylindrical. Ch√¢teau Gaillard was one of the first castles in Europe to use machicolations‚Äîstone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall. Machicolations were introduced to Western architecture as a result of the Crusades. Until the 13th century, the tops of towers in European castles had usually been surrounded by wooden galleries, which served the same purpose as machicolations. An Eastern innovation, they may have originated in the first half of the 8th century. Within the middle bailey was the inner bailey. The gatehouse from the middle to the inner-bailey was one of the earliest examples of towers flanking the entrance to remove the blind-spot immediately in front of the gate. This was part of a wider trend from around the late 12th or 13th century onwards for castle gateways to be strongly defended. The design of the inner bailey, with its wall studded with semi-circular projections, is unparalleled. This innovation had two advantages: firstly, the rounded wall absorbed the damage from siege engines much better as it did not provide a perfect angle to aim at; secondly, the arrowslits in the curved wall allowed arrows to be fired at all angles. The inner bailey, which contained the main residential buildings, used the principles of concentric defence. This and the unusual design of the inner bailey's curtain wall meant that castle was advanced for its age, since it was built before concentric fortification was fully developed in Crusader castles such as Krak des Chevaliers. Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe; for instance when Edward I of England‚Äîwho had himself been on Crusade‚Äîbuilt castles in Wales in the late 13th century, four of the eight he founded were concentric. The keep was inside the inner bailey and contained the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king's chamber, historian Liddiard believes it is probably a throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Ch√¢teau Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries. Allen Brown described Ch√¢teau Gaillard as \\"one of the finest castles in Europe\\" and the military historian Sir Charles Oman wrote that: Despite Ch√¢teau Gaillard's reputation as a great fortress, Liddiard highlights the absence of a well in the keep as a peculiar weakness, and the castle was built on soft chalk, which would have allowed the walls to be undermined. But other sources evoke the presence of three wells in the three different baileys and the soft chalk does not really weaken the very thick walls. Its weakness is more the result of its location (higher hill behind), its extension (more than ) on a long narrow ridge and the difficulties in linking up the different baileys to allow a good communication and to secure an efficient defence without a large garrison.Joseph Deca√´ns, \\"Le ch√¢teau Gaillard\\" in L'architecture normande, Tome II, p. 285, editions Charles Corlet / Presses universitaire de Caen, Cond√©-sur-Noireau, 1997. Ch√¢teau Gaillard was important not solely as a military structure, but as a salient symbol of the power of Richard the Lionheart. It was a statement of dominance by Richard, having reconquered the lands Philip II had taken. Castles such as Ch√¢teau Gaillard in France, and Dover in England, were amongst the most advanced of their age, but were surpassed in both sophistication and cost by the works of Edward I of England in the latter half of the 13th century.

The UDRP currently applies to all generic top level domains (.com, .net, .org, etc.), some country code top-level domains, and some older top level domains in specific circumstances. Historical background When ICANN was first set up, one of the core tasks assigned to it was \\"The Trademark Dilemma\\", the use of trade marks as domain names without the trademark owner's consent. By the late 1990s, such use was identified as problematic and likely to lead to consumers being misled. In the United Kingdom, the Court of Appeal described such domain names as \\"an instrument of fraud\\".British Telecommunications plc v One in a Million Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 903, Aldous LJ at 920. One of ICANN's first steps was to commission the United Nations World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to produce a report on the conflict between trademarks and domain names. Published on 30 April 1999, the WIPO Report recommended the establishment of a \\"mandatory administrative procedure concerning abusive registrations\\", which would allow for a \\"neutral venue in the context of disputes that are often international in nature.\\" The procedure was not intended to deal with cases with competing rights, nor would it exclude the jurisdiction of the courts. It would, however, be mandatory in the sense that \\"each domain name application would, in the domain name agreement, be required to submit to the procedure if a claim was initiated against it by a third party The WIPO Report sets out the now familiar three stage test of the UDRP. Following adoption by ICANN, the UDRP was launched on 1 December 1999, and the first case determined under it by WIPO was World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc v. Michael Bosman, involving the domain name worldwrestlingfederation.comWIPO Domain Name Decision: D1999-0001. Wipo.int. Retrieved on 2014-04-28. Providers of the UDRP are: * The Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC)http://www.adndrc.org/mten/index.php * National Arbitration Forum (NAF) * World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) * Czech Arbitration Court, Arbitration Center for Internet Disputeshttp://www.adr.eu/index.php(CAC) * The Arab Center for Dispute Resolution (ACDR) How it is made mandatory When a registrant chooses a domain name, the registrant must \\"represent and warrant\\", among other things, that registering the name \\"will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party\\", and agree to participate in an arbitration-like proceeding should any third party assert such a claim. Process A complainant in a UDRP proceeding must establish three elements to succeed: * The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; * The registrant does not have any rights or legitimate interests in the domain name; and * The domain name has been registered and the domain name is being used in \\"bad faith\\". In a UDRP proceeding, a panel will consider several non-exclusive factors to assess bad faith, such as: * Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark; * Whether the registrant registered the domain name to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, if the domain name owner has engaged in a pattern of such conduct; and * Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or * Whether by using the domain name, the registrant has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, internet users to the registrant's website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark. The goal of the UDRP is to create a streamlined process for resolving such disputes. It was envisioned that this process would be quicker and less expensive than a standard legal challenge. The costs to hire a UDRP provider to handle a complaint often start around US$1,000 to $2,000. If a party loses a UDRP proceeding, in many jurisdictions it may still bring a lawsuit against the domain name registrant under local law. For example, the administrative panel's UDRP decision can be challenged and overturned in a U.S. court of law by means of e.g. the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. If a domain name registrant loses a UDRP proceeding, it must file a lawsuit against the trademark holder within ten days to prevent ICANN from transferring the domain name. Examples The UDRP process has already been used in a number of well-known cases, such as Madonna Ciccone, p/k/a Madonna v. Dan Parisi and \\"Madonna.com\\". In this case, the arbitration panel found against the defendant registrant based on all three of the above factors and ordered the domain name turned over to Madonna. Often there is contention over similar but not identical domain names, in which the offended party files a court action claiming trademark or copyright infringement. For example, actor Robert De Niro has claimed ownership of all domain names incorporating the text \\"Tribeca\\" for domain names with any content related to film festivals. In particular, he has a dispute with the owner of the website http://tribeca.net.http://tribeca.net Domain name disputes under new gTLDs In 2012, ICANN launched a process to create new generic top-level domains. Over 1,900 applications were made. As part of the expansion of the domain name system, ICANN introduced a number of new brand protection mechanisms. Opinions differ as to whether or not these new processes will be effective. Industry commentators predict that the UDRP will continue to be used, and that there will be a \\"substantial increase in cybersquatting\\". Evidence from previous expansions of the namespace, however, indicates the continued dominance of .com both in size and as the first-choice domain for cybersquatting (based on number of disputes).

Recipe Unlimited also owns other restaurants including Swiss Chalet, Milestones, Montana's and Harvey's. Founded in 1978, there are Kelseys restaurants across Canada, excluding the province of Quebec (where the chain was withdrawn in 2008). History Once a chain of more than 140 locations from Quebec westerly to British Columbia, the company has closed all but two locations in British Columbia, shuttered nine locations in Alberta, closed all locations in Saskatchewan, and closed all locations in Manitoba. In Ontario, numerous locations across the company have closed including locations in Kitchener, Simcoe, and Fort Erie. The Owen Sound location was due to close on December 20, 2013. As of November 2013 there are just 88 Kelseys locations left in Canada, primarily in the province of Ontario. Kelseys logo used from 2006 to 2015 Kelseys has a licensing agreement through early 2011 with CBS Consumer Products for the rights to the theme song from the 1980s sitcom Cheers, which the chain says could lead to \\"other opportunities\\" in the future.Kelsey's press release, February 3, 2008 Kelseys also uses the show's title in its slogan \\"Cheers to good friends\\", although (due to the generic nature of the word \\"cheers\\" in regards to pubs and the like) it is not clear whether permission from CBS was required for this. Rebranding Kelseys' parent company Recipe Unlimited has been going through an era of rebranding and renovations including its location at 1011 The Queensway Etobicoke, Ontario where the company is piloting a new restaurant design that features an emphasis on a newer style of Kelseys dining experience. Many under-performing Kelseys restaurants have been closing down over the past couple of years and the new design is going to try to change the customer's eating experience to become more lively and exciting. The restaurant's old slogan \\"Neighbourhood Bar and Grill\\" has been upgraded to \\"Ambitiously Hardworking and Sociably Unpredictable\\". Bright neon colours are found throughout the restaurant along with an upgraded menu that features a smaller and more limited selection of the most popular items found at other Kelseys locations. The new bar menu that was first used at this Kelseys is now available throughout all 88 locations in Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. The new bar menu is modelled after its location in Etobicoke featuring bright neon colours along with new items that reflect more of a pub than a bar and grill. The restaurant design is going to be applied to more locations when the franchisees choose to upgrade. Criticism A CBC Marketplace investigation in February 2018 found the Kelseys servers in Ontario had to tip out 3% of their sales, a rise from 2% prior to the province's minimum wage increase.

Dortmunder Actien Brauerei is a German brewery in the city of Dortmund, founded in 1868 by the businessmen Laurenz Fischer and Heinrich and Friedrich Mauritz together with master brewer Heinrich Herberz. Originally, it was called Herberz & Co Brewery (Bierbrauerei Herberz & Co.). History Due to business steadily improving, the company expanded and went public in 1872, changing its name to \\"Dortmunder Actien Brauerei\\" (Dortmund Joint Stock Brewery). In 1879, the company started to export its beer internationally. In 1881, Carl von Linde himself equipped the brewery with one of his refrigeration machines, allowing for a boom of bottom-fermented beer. In 1893, the brewery established a chemical and bacteriological laboratory. Although World War I led to a crash in beer production, the brewery was equipped with its own railway connection in 1917. After the near-total destruction of Dortmund in World War II, the brewery was rebuilt by 1949. From 1959 to 1963, DAB switched from the old wooden to new aluminium barrels. The Hansa Brewery, a local competitor, was acquired in 1971. On its grounds, DAB erected a new modern brewery, finished in 1983, at the time the largest of the Ruhr area. However, the cost of the acquisition of Hansa was substantial, and burdened DAB for years to come. Questionable decisions by the company management in the 1990s exacerbated the situation, leading to a collapse of the company brands and the increasing production of generic brands to make use of the capacities. Even the acquisition of the brand names of another local competitor in economic difficulties, the Kronen Brewery, could not stop the downward trend which to this day, even though the company is the last brewery in Dortmund, has not been fully stopped. Most prominent stock holder today is the Radeberger Group of breweries, which in turn belongs to the company founded by August Oetker, today one of the most prominent players in the German food and drink industry. DAB produces a lager called DAB after their initials. DAB was also the favorite beer of Erich Honecker, former leader of East Germany. Dortmunder Hansa Hansa Pils Label Dortmunder Hansa refers to a number of beers from Dortmund, Germany, brewed by Dortmunder Hansa Brewery, a division of Dortmunder Actien Brauerei. Its popularity is due in some part to its low price. Hansa brews a variety of beers, including Pilsener, Altbier, Malzbier, K√∂lsch and wheat beer. Because of its low price, Hansa Pils is often used in Radler. The low price also led to its popularity in the punk subculture in Germany. The former Hansa Brewery is in the North-Central section of Dortmund, and today serves as the Dortmunder Actien Brauerei, which took over Dortmunder Hansa in 1971. The facility also houses the Dortmunder Brewery Museum. Before changing its name to Dortmunder Hansa, the beer was brewed in the same location, then called the Borussia Brewery.

The last two conditions can be stated in less formal terms: Additively, \\\\mathcal{O} is a free abelian group generated by a basis for A over \\\\mathbb{Q}. More generally for R an integral domain contained in a field K, we define \\\\mathcal{O} to be an R-order in a K-algebra A if it is a subring of A which is a full R-lattice.Reiner (2003) p. 108 When A is not a commutative ring, the idea of order is still important, but the phenomena are different. For example, the Hurwitz quaternions form a maximal order in the quaternions with rational co-ordinates; they are not the quaternions with integer coordinates in the most obvious sense. Maximal orders exist in general, but need not be unique: there is in general no largest order, but a number of maximal orders. An important class of examples is that of integral group rings. Examples Some examples of orders are:Reiner (2003) pp. 108‚Äì109 * If A is the matrix ring M_n(K) over K, then the matrix ring M_n(R) over R is an R-order in A * If R is an integral domain and L a finite separable extension of K, then the integral closure S of R in L is an R-order in L. * If a in A is an integral element over R, then the polynomial ring R[a] is an R-order in the algebra K[a] * If A is the group ring K[G] of a finite group G, then R[G] is an R-order on K[G] A fundamental property of R-orders is that every element of an R-order is integral over R.Reiner (2003) p. 110 If the integral closure S of R in A is an R-order then this result shows that S must be the maximal R-order in A. However this hypothesis is not always satisfied: indeed S need not even be a ring, and even if S is a ring (for example, when A is commutative) then S need not be an R-lattice. Algebraic number theory The leading example is the case where A is a number field K and \\\\mathcal{O} is its ring of integers. In algebraic number theory there are examples for any K other than the rational field of proper subrings of the ring of integers that are also orders. For example, in the field extension A=\\\\mathbb{Q}(i) of Gaussian rationals over \\\\mathbb{Q}, the integral closure of \\\\mathbb{Z} is the ring of Gaussian integers \\\\mathbb{Z}[i] and so this is the unique maximal \\\\mathbb{Z}-order: all other orders in A are contained in it. For example, we can take the subring of the complex numbers in the form a+2bi, with a and b integers.Pohst and Zassenhaus (1989) p. 22 The maximal order question can be examined at a local field level. This technique is applied in algebraic number theory and modular representation theory.

He was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Chesterfield, previously held by Tony Benn, from 2001 to 2010. Early life He grew up in Sheffield on a council estate. He went to Prince Edward Primary School, Manor Top, then Firth Park Secondary School (now Firth Park Community Arts College), a comprehensive from 1969 (when he was 12). Career Holmes graduated in History from the University of York in 1978 and before being elected an MP, was a history teacher for 22 years. He gained a PGCE from the University of Sheffield. He taught from 1979‚Äì84 at Chesterfield School (now Brookfield Community School\\"Examination of Witnesses (Questions 960 ‚Äì 979)\\", Q967, Education and Skills Committee Evidence, House of Commons, 8 December 2003 (parliament.uk)), then Buxton College from 1984‚Äì90, and from 1990‚Äì2001 he was Head of Sixth Form at Buxton Community School (the successor to Buxton College). Political career Holmes joined the SDP in 1983. From 1987‚Äì95, representing the Liberal Democrats, he was a councillor for Brimington South Ward, then from 1999‚Äì2003 for Walton ward on Chesterfield Borough Council. Holmes is currently the lead councillor for the opposition on Chesterfield Borough Council and is a councillor for Barrow Hill and New Whittington ward. Parliamentary career His election as chairman of the parliamentary party in 2005 was a surprise to many, since it came at the expense of incumbent chairman Matthew Taylor (a close friend of then Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy). Commentators attributed the result to dissatisfaction with some elements of Kennedy's leadership and a belief amongst MPs that the role of party chairman should be more that of a backbenchers' 'shop steward' and less under the influence of the leadership. Holmes, not yet an MP, supported Simon Hughes in the leadership election following Paddy Ashdown's retirement in 1999. At the 2005 party conference, he voted against plans by the leadership to support capping the European Union budget at 1% of GDP and to privatise the post office (and was on the winning side in both votes). However, he publicly declared himself to be in full support of Kennedy's leadership following rumours that Hughes was planning a leadership challenge. In the leadership election caused by the resignation of Charles Kennedy, Paul Holmes took on the role of chair to Simon Hughes' leadership campaign Holmes was a member of the House of Commons Education & Skills Select Committee from 2001‚Äì2007, but stood down from the Committee in July 2007 to concentrate on his appointment as Shadow Minister for Housing. Previously Holmes had been a Spokesman on Disability (2001‚Äì2005), Work and Pensions (2002‚Äì2005) and Arts and Heritage (2006‚Äì2007). In December 2007 he returned to the back benches, being one of only two MPs in the party to lose their shadow cabinet responsibilities in the reshuffle after Nick Clegg's election as Liberal Democrat leader. Holmes hit the headlines in March 2008 when he was the only Liberal Democrat MP to sign an Early Day Motion praising Fidel Castro at the time of his resignation. He was quoted on the BBC as saying \\"It is true Cuba has political prisoners and no free elections, but it has very good dentistry.\\" Holmes was the Liberal Democrat Shadow Minister for Justice and sat on the Children, Families and Schools Select Committee. Holmes is a founding member of the centre-left Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats.About us ‚Äì The Beveridge Group 28 October 2007 He is also an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK, and was also a vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, before his defeat in the 2010 general election.

Holmes fronted the first prime time current affairs show of the time, Holmes, which ran on TV One from 1989 to 2004. Holmes hosted the Newstalk ZB breakfast show from 1985 to 2008, and the Saturday morning show from 2009 to 2012. Holmes' other ventures included several notable hosting slots, including a short-lived weekly show on Prime Television in 2005, two stints as the anchor of This Is Your Life and from 2009 until his retirement in 2012, and the Sunday morning political talk show Q+A. Due to his high-profile appearances and controversial manner, Holmes' personal life was often documented alongside his charitable efforts. He spent much of his career in the spotlight, including his campaigning of the Paralympics, the birth of his son, the collapse of his marriage, his daughter's drug problems and his death. Holmes was also credited with bringing AIDS awareness to New Zealand, after featuring a story on a young girl with the disease, Eve van Grafhorst, on Holmes. Owing to his success, Holmes picked up a celebrity-like status and often made appearances in other media such as long running soap opera Shortland Street. Holmes underwent treatment for cancer in 1999 and heart surgery in 2012. He retired shortly after the latter treatment and in 2013 was knighted by the Governor-General of New Zealand. Just two weeks later, Holmes died at his Hawkes Bay home.  Early life  Born in 1950 as the first son of Chrissie and Henry Holmes, a mechanic, Holmes grew up in the Hawke's Bay and attended Karamu High School. He and his younger brother Ken were involved in rowing and debating, and Paul became a prefect. The family had another son, Christopher, who died shortly after birth. Holmes had a particular interest in radio, and by sixth form he was practising announcing into the family tape recorder, auditioning at the local radio station, and acting on stage. At high school, Holmes became close friends with Mike Williams (future President of the New Zealand Labour Party) and Peter Beaven (future CEO of Pipfruit NZ). The trio remained friends for the rest of Holmes' life. In 1968, Holmes left his family home and began studying law at Victoria University of Wellington. He shared a room at the university accommodation Weir House with Williams. Shortly into his course, he swapped his degree to the arts and was awarded a BA. Holmes was inspired by the actor Dustin Hoffman and wished to emulate his success. He got his first professional acting job on a radio production of Antony and Cleopatra and acted alongside Sam Neill in the drama society club. Whilst studying, Holmes worked at a Hawke's Bay freezing-works.  Career  Holmes began his career on radio in Christchurch in the 1970s. He then worked in Australia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands before returning to New Zealand to take up a morning slot on Wellington station 2ZB. In March 1987, Holmes took over from 1ZB host Merv Smith, who had been breakfast host for many years. This coincided with a change in format from community radio (middle of the road music, news, community notices, etc.) to Newstalk. The change was controversial, as many long-standing Smith listeners did not like Holmes or the news, interview and talkback format with no music. 1ZB fell to seventh position in the ratings and it took over a year before Holmes' show eventually rose to number one in the ratings for the programme's time slot. In 1989, Holmes became part of the younger, new-look revamp of Television New Zealand's prime-time news. His 7pm network programme (simply titled Holmes, initially starting at 6:30 and later moving to 7:00 when the news was extended to one hour), analysing news items in greater depth, ran until 2004. Holmes' first TV segment featured guest Dennis Conner, the America's Cup skipper. After being provoked, Conner walked off the set, providing Holmes with headlines the next day. Holmes published an autobiography in 1999. A year later he released an album on CD, simply titled Paul Holmes. In the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours, Holmes was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to broadcasting and the community. After 15 years anchoring Holmes, he was reportedly disgusted to have been offered a six-month contract instead of an annual alternative and subsequently on 2 November 2004 he resigned from the show. Shortly after this he moved to rival TV company Prime Television, which had offered him a three-year contract. His new show, Paul Holmes, launched on Prime on 7 February 2005. The new show was up against two new competitors, John Campbell's Campbell Live on TV3 and Susan Wood's Close Up on TV One, in a three-way competition that had previously never been seen on New Zealand television. In February 2005, the show rated 7.1 percent for its timeslot, compared with his former programme on TV One (renamed Close Up) at 31 percent share. In March 2005, following the launch of a rival show on TV3, Campbell Live, Nielsen Media Ratings listed Holmes' show at 4 percent. Poor ratings forced a timeslot change to 6 pm after only four months. By this time, the show had been retitled Holmes. However, these small changes were not enough to save the show, the timeslot change proving fatal. On 8 August 2005, almost six months to the day after the show launched, it was axed by Prime Television, with Prime chief executive Chris Taylor citing poor ratings and inability to attract viewers from the traditional primetime news strongholds of TV One and TV3. The show returned in a weekly format in late 2005 and in 2006 was revamped into an hour long chat show similar to the popular UK show hosted by Michael Parkinson. In 2005, Holmes was dropped from the New Zealand Listener‚Äôs 50 most powerful people list largely because of his TV show's poor ratings and influence. Paul Holmes also appeared on Shortland Street as Leslie Grant. He appeared on MƒÅori Television's Waitangi Day coverage on 6 February 2007. In March, TV One, Holmes's former network, announced that he would be among the \\"stars\\" on the third season of the New Zealand version of Dancing with the Stars. At the end of 2008 Holmes left his weekday breakfast show on Newstalk ZB after hosting the show for almost 22 years. Holmes then presented the Saturday morning show on Newstalk ZB. From 2009 to 2012 Holmes returned to TVNZ to present the political talk show Q+A on TV One. In early 2011, Holmes published Daughters of Erebus, a book on the 1979 Erebus Air New Zealand DC-10 airliner crash. Retirement and death In January 2012 Holmes received treatment in hospital after a \\"health scare\\". He had previously battled prostate cancer in 1999, but had been released shortly after. The scare was reportedly the return of the cancer. In June he underwent open heart surgery and was placed into an induced coma to heal. In November 2012 a television blog posted a story claiming Holmes only had weeks to live due to congestive heart failure. Holmes rejected the rumor. Holmes broadcast his final interview in November 2012, with Kim Dotcom as the subject. Several weeks later, Holmes resigned from his radio work and on 8 December, announced his retirement. Following their interview, Holmes and Dotcom became friends and in Holmes' final days, he was visited by him. Holmes being knighted by the governor- general, Sir Jerry Mateparae, on 16 January 2013In the 2013 New Year Honours, Holmes was appointed as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to broadcasting and the community.\\"New Year Honours 2013\\" (29 January 2013) 8 The New Zealand Gazette 293. His investiture was conducted on 16 January 2013 at his residence, earlier than originally scheduled due to his failing health. Just a week later, Holmes was admitted to hospital. He was held under observation for two nights and was then released back into the care of his family. Many of those who had previously clashed with Holmes released statements making peace with the broadcaster, but a notable refusal to comment came from Dennis Conner (the American skipper who walked out of the first Holmes episode). Holmes died on 1 February 2013 at his family home in the Hawkes Bay. His public funeral was held on 8 February. Personal life Holmes' personal life was highly documented in the media in part due to his celebrity status measuring up to those he interviewed. He had brushed death numerous times in his life. The first occurred in 1973 when he suffered a major car accident in which he fractured his neck and developed a brain hemorrhage which cut vision to one of his eyes. He also survived several aircraft crashes, including a helicopter crash into the sea at Anaura Bay in June 1989, which killed fellow passenger cameraman Jo Von Dinklage. In 2004, he had two crash landings piloting his vintage Boeing Stearman biplane, on 14 January southeast of Turangi, and on 31 December at Bridge PƒÅ Aerodrome near Hastings. Holmes also survived numerous health scares, including overcoming prostate cancer in 1999, and the heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In 1991, Holmes became a father when his partner, Hinemoa Elder, gave birth to a son, Reuben Holmes. Elder had a daughter from a past relationship, Millie, whom Holmes was very attached to and who openly described herself as a \\"daddy's girl\\". Holmes later stated one of the proudest moments in his lifetime was when Millie referred to him as \\"dad\\". Holmes married Elder the following year but the marriage only lasted 5 years. Towards the end of the marriage, Holmes began a short-lived affair with co-worker Fleur Revell that eventually saw him leave his wife and children. In 1998, Holmes started seeing real estate agent Deborah Hamilton. In 1999, the two moved in with each other, and in 2003, married. In 2007, Holmes' stepdaughter, Millie Elder-Holmes, was arrested on charges of possession of methamphetamine. Holmes stood by Millie and ended up campaigning against the drug. Holmes' public addressing of the issue and opposition to Millie's boyfriend led to the two falling out for over a year. In January 2010, they reconciled. Charges were eventually dropped. In 2014, Millie's boyfriend, Connor Morris, was killed in a fight in Massey, West Auckland. Controversy Holmes gained media attention for a number of controversial remarks about prominent individuals and issues, including a comment made in 2003 about wahi tapu (MƒÅori sacred places). *In 2001, the Broadcasting Standards Authority ruled against Holmes for lack of balance and journalistic integrity in a series of news stories covering a campaign dubbed 'A Generation Lost?' The campaign, led by Auckland-based marketer Richard Poole, blamed the then Helen Clark-led Government for a brain-drain of 'young New Zealanders', a key political issue at the time. The campaign was later exposed as politically motivated and financially backed by the New Zealand Business Roundtable, which Holmes was reputed to have known about but did not disclose.Broadcasting Standards Authority - Ruling #2001-049‚Äì050 *In September 2003, he repeatedly referred to then-United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan as a \\"cheeky darkie\\" during his radio show.Excerpt from Paul Holmes Newstalk ZB radio programme. <> There was an international outcry following the comments, but Holmes kept his job after making several emotional apologies, claiming he had been \\"tired\\".

He labelled Waitangi Day as \\"loony Maori fringe self-denial day\\" and described a \\"hopeless failure of Maori to educate their children and stop them bashing their babies.\\" The piece resulted in a number of formal complaints, which were upheld by the New Zealand Press Council.

It also occurs as the mineral orpiment (Latin: auripigment), which has been used as a pigment called King's yellow. It is produced in the analysis of arsenic compounds. It is a group V/VI, intrinsic p-type semiconductor and exhibits photo-induced phase-change properties. The other principal arsenic sulfide is As4S4, a red-orange solid known as the mineral realgar.  Structure  As2S3 occurs both in crystalline and amorphous forms. Both forms feature polymeric structures consisting of trigonal pyramidal As(III) centres linked by sulfide centres. The sulfide centres are two-fold coordinated to two arsenic atoms. In the crystalline form, the compound adopts a ruffled sheet structure.Wells, A.F. (1984). Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. . The bonding between the sheets consists of van der Waals forces. The crystalline form is usually found in geological samples. Amorphous As2S3 does not possess a layered structure but is more highly cross-linked. Like other glasses, there is no medium or long-range order, but the first co-ordination sphere is well defined. As2S3 is a good glass former and exhibits a wide glass-forming region in its phase diagram. Properties It is a semiconductor, with a direct band gap of 2.7 eV.Arsenic sulfide (As2S3) The wide band gap makes it transparent to infrared between 620 nm and 11 ¬µm.  Synthesis   From the elements  Amorphous As2S3 is obtained via the fusion of the elements at 390 ¬∞C. Rapid cooling of the reaction melt gives a glass. The reaction can be represented with the chemical equation: :2 As + 3 S ‚Üí As2S3  Aqueous precipitation  As2S3 forms when aqueous solutions containing As(III) are treated with H2S. Arsenic was in the past analyzed and assayed by this reaction, which results in the precipitation of As2S3, which is then weighed. As2S3 can even be precipitated in 6M HCl. As2S3 is so insoluble that it is not toxic. Reactions Upon heating in a vacuum, polymeric As2S3 \\"cracks\\" to give a mixture of molecular species, including molecular As4S6. As4S6 adopts the adamantane geometry, like that observed for P4O6 and As4O6. When a film of this material is exposed to an external energy source such as thermal energy (via thermal annealing ), electromagnetic radiation (i.e. UV lamps, lasers, electron beams)), As4S6 polymerizes: :2/n (As2S3)n As4S6 As2S3 characteristically dissolves upon treatment with aqueous solutions containing sulfide ions. The dissolved arsenic species is the pyramidal trianion AsS: : As2S3 \\\\+ 6 NaSH ‚Üí 2 AsS + 3 H2S As2S3 is the anhydride of the hypothetical thioarsenous acid, As(SH)3. Upon treatment with polysulfide ions, As2S3 dissolves to give a variety of species containing both S-S and As-S bonds. One derivative is S7As-S‚àí, a ring that contains an exocyclic sulfido center attached to the As atom. As2S3 also dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions to give a mixture of AsS and AsO.Holleman, A.

Advances in laser patterning techniques such as three-dimensional direct laser writing (3-D DLW) and chemical wet-etching chemistry, has allowed this material to be used as a photoresist to fabricate 3-D nanostructures. As2S3 has been investigated for use as a high resolution photoresist material since the early 1970s,Zenkin, S. A.; Mamedov, S. B.; Mikhailov, M. D.; Turkina, E. Yu.; Yusupov, I. Yu. Glass Phys. Chem. 1997, 5, pp 393-399. using aqueous etchants. Although these aqueous etchants allowed for low-aspect ratio 2-D structures to be fabricated, they do not allow for the etching of high aspect ratio structures with 3-D periodicity. Certain organic reagents, used in organic solvents, permit the high-etch selectivity required to produce high-aspect ratio structures with 3-D periodicity.  Medical applications  As2S3 and As4S4 have been investigated as treatments for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).  For IR- transmitting glasses  Arsenic trisulfide manufactured into amorphous form is used as a chalcogenide glass for infrared optics. It is transparent between 620 nm and 11 ¬µm. The arsenic trisulfide glass is more resistant to oxidation than crystalline arsenic trisulfide, which minimizes toxicity concerns.Material Safety Data Sheet It can be also used as an acousto-optic material. Arsenic trisulfide was used for the distinctive eight-sided conical nose over the infra-red seeker of the de Havilland Firestreak missile.  Role in ancient artistry  The ancient Egyptians reportedly used orpiment, natural or synthetic, as a pigment in artistry and cosmetics.  Miscellaneous  Arsenic trisulfide is also used as a tanning agent. It was formerly used with indigo dye for the production of pencil blue, which allowed dark blue hues to be added to fabric via pencil or brush. Precipitation of arsenic trisulfide is used as an analytical test for presence of dissimilatory arsenic-reducing bacteria (DARB).Linping Kuai, Arjun A. Nair, and Martin F. Polz \\"Rapid and Simple Method for the Most-Probable-Number Estimation of Arsenic-Reducing Bacteria\\" Appl Environ Microbiol. 2001, vol. 67, 3168‚Äì3173. .  Safety  As2S3 is so insoluble that its toxicity is low. Aged samples can contain substantial amounts of arsenic oxides, which are soluble and therefore highly toxic.  Natural occurrence  Orpiment is found in volcanic environments, often together with other arsenic sulfides, mainly realgar. It is sometimes found in low-temperature hydrothermal veins, together with some other sulfide and sulfosalt minerals.

She was a list MP for New Zealand First from 1996 to 1998. Member of Parliament Morris was an MP from 1996 to 1999, representing the New Zealand First party. She was first elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as a list MP, and when her party formed a coalition with the National Party, she became a Minister. Her most prominent role was as Minister of Youth Affairs, where her own relative youth was seen as an asset ‚Äî she was understood to be the youngest person ever appointed to ministerial rank (at the age of 26). In 1996 she caused controversy by suggesting that young New Zealanders should have better access to contraceptives. Her suggestion was publicly opposed by the Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys. When the coalition collapsed, and New Zealand First itself began to split up, Morris was one of the first MPs to leave the party, saying that she could no longer accept the \\"perpetual state of crisis\\" generated by its leader, Winston Peters. Unlike some other New Zealand First defectors, Morris did not make a deal with the National Party to keep her ministerial portfolios, resigning from her position on 18 August 1998. Morris remained an independent until her resignation from Parliament in 1999. As she had been elected on the New Zealand First list, her replacement, Gilbert Myles, was also drawn from that list. Life after politics Since leaving Parliament, Morris has worked in public relations and as an advocate for New Zealand children. After time living and working overseas on disarmament issues with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, she returned to New Zealand to work for non-governmental organisations. She worked at Plunket, Barnardo's, Save the Children and UNICEF New Zealand, leading the movement for children. She helped establish Every Child Counts and then the Tick4Kids networks, working to get child abuse and child poverty onto the public agenda. In 2007, she was awarded the Vodafone World of Difference grant. She lent her support for the controversial repeal of Section 59, which removed the defence of reasonable force in child discipline. At the 2013 local authority elections Morris-Travers stood for, and was elected to, the Paraparaumu Raumati Community Board. In 2016, Deborah Morris-Travers delivered her Ted talk to TedX Wellington. She later became the Green Party Chief of Staff. In 2017, she left her position as Chief of Staff due to disagreements over Metiria Turei's public admission to historical benefit and electoral fraud which eventually caused a loss of support for the party and led to Turei's resignation. Later Morris ruled out a bid for the co-leadership in the election to replace Turei. Republicanism and electoral reform In 1994, Morris was a founding member of the Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand, and supports a New Zealand republic. She was also part of the campaign for proportional representation, achieving MMP.

Vaticinium ex eventu is a form of hindsight bias. The concept is similar to postdiction. Examples In religious writings The Babylonian \\"Marduk Prophecy\\", a text describing the travels of the Marduk idol from Babylon, \\"prophesies\\" of the statue‚Äôs seizure during the sack of the city by Mursilis I in 1531 BC, Assyria, when Tukulti-Ninurta I overthrew Kashtiliash IV in 1225 BC and took the idol to Assur, and Elam, when Kudur- nahhunte ransacked the city and pilfered the statue around 1160 BC. A copyTablet K. 2158+ was found in the House of the Exorcist at Assur, whose contents date from 713‚Äì612 BC and is closely related thematically to another vaticinium ex eventu text called the Shulgi prophecy, which probably followed it in a sequence of tablets. Both compositions present a favorable view of Assyria. The Book of Daniel utilizes vaticinium ex eventu, by its seeming foreknowledge of events from Alexander's conquest up to the persecution of Antiochus IV in the summer of 164 BCE.. The stories of the first half are legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the Maccabean period (2nd century BCE). Its inclusion in Ketuvim (Writings) rather than Nevi'im (Prophets) was likely because it appeared after the canon for those books had closed, and the dominant view among Jews and scholars is that Daniel is not in any case a prophetic book but an apocalypse. Statements attributed to Jesus in the Gospels that foretell the destruction of Jerusalem (e.g. probably Luke 21:20) and its temple are examples of vaticinia ex eventu; the Gospels were all written after the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70, in which the temple was destroyed. Secular *The Ancient world saw the technique of vaticinium ex eventu used by a wide variety of figures, from Pindar and Herodotus to Horace and Virgil.J. J. O'Hara, Death and the Optimistic Prophecy in Vergil's Aeneid (2014) pp. 128-9 *The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri includes a number of such prophecies of Dante's own exile from Florence. *In Jerusalem Delivered, Torquato Tasso uses the vaticinium ex eventu trope in presaging the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus: \\"Un uom de la Liguria avr√† ardimento / a l'incognito corso esporsi in prima\\" *References in the late correspondence of Virginia Woolf to \\"how I love this savage medieval water [...] and myself so eliminated\\"Quoted in H. Lee, Virginia Woolf (1996) p. 752 are sometimes taken as presaging her suicide by drowning a few months later: the danger of vaticinium ex eventu has however also been observed.Olivia Laing, To the River (2011) pp. 195-8 See also Notes References *Vaticinium ex eventu (or post eventum) Dictionary of the Bible * Category:Prophecy Category:Latin religious words and phrases ","title":"Vaticinium ex eventu"},{"id":"1114297","text":"Pi or \\\\pi is a mathematical constant equal to a circle's circumference divided by its diameter.

Abandonment may be physical (the parent is not present in the child's life) or emotional (the parent withholds affection, nurturing, or stimulation).Henley, Arthur. \\"The abandoned child.\\" Deviancy and the family. Ed. Clifton D. Bryant and J. Gipson Wells. Philadelphia: F. A. Davis, 1973. 199-208. The abandoned child syndrome is not recognized as a mental disorder in any of the medical manuals, such as the ICD-10 or the DSM-IV, neither is it part of the proposed revision of this manual, the DSM-5. Parents who leave their children, or when a parent is alienated from their children by the other parent (after a bitter divorce, DCHS, foster care), can cause psychological damage to the child. This damage is reversible, but only with appropriate assistance. Abandoned children may also often suffer physical damage from neglect, malnutrition, starvation, and abuse. Signs and symptoms Symptoms may be physical or mental, and may extend into adulthood and perhaps throughout a person's life. * Alienation from the environment ‚Äì withdrawal from social activities and resistance towards others. * Guilt ‚Äì the child believes that they did something wrong that caused the abandonment (often associated with depression). * Fear and uncertainty ‚Äì \\"clinginess\\" and insecurities.Myers, Linda Joy (2005). \\"Connecting the Past and the Present: Healing Abandonment and Abuse through Awareness\\" . * Sleep and eating disorders ‚Äì malnutrition, starvation, disturbed sleep and nightmares. * Physical ailments ‚Äì fatigue, drug and alcohol abuse, anxiety, depression, lack of energy and creativity, anger, and grief. Causes When children are raised without the psychological or physical protection they need, they may internalize incredible fear. This is known as chronic loss. Not receiving the necessary psychological or physical protection results in abandonment. If children live with repeated abandonment, this creates experiences causes toxic shame.

He is known for his removal to England of the seven-tonne bust of Ramesses II, the clearing of sand from the entrance of the great temple at Abu Simbel, the discovery and documentation of the tomb of Seti I (still sometimes known as \\"Belzoni's Tomb\\"), including the Sarcophagus of Seti I, and the first to penetrate into the second pyramid of Giza. Early life Belzoni was born in Padua. His father was a barber who sired fourteen children. His family was from Rome and when Belzoni was 16 he went to work there, saying that he studied hydraulics. He intended on taking monastic vows, but in 1798 the occupation of the city by French troops drove him from Rome and changed his proposed career. In 1800 he moved to the Netherlands where he earned a living as a barber. In 1803 he fled to England to avoid being sent to jail.a biography of Belzoni on the Minnesota State University site There he married an Englishwoman, Sarah Bane. Belzoni was a tall man at tall (one source says that his wife was of equally generous build, but all other accounts of her describe her as being of normal build) and they both joined a travelling circus. They were for some time compelled to subsist by performing exhibitions of feats of strength and agility as a strongman at fairs and on the streets of London. In 1804 he appears engaged at the circus at Astley's amphitheatre at a variety of performances.Stanley Mayes: The Great Belzoni, The Circus Strongman who Discovered Egypt's Trasures, Belzoni had an interest in phantasmagoria and experimented with the use of magic lanterns in his shows. Egyptian antiquities Giovanni Battista Belzoni The 'Young Memnon', Rameses II, at the British Museum In 1812 he left England and after a tour of performances in Spain, Portugal and Sicily, he went to Malta in 1815 where he met Ismael Gibraltar, an emissary of Muhammad Ali, who at the time was undertaking a programme of agrarian land reclamation and important irrigation works.www.ancient-egypt.co.uk Belzoni wanted to show Muhammad Ali a hydraulic machine of his own invention for raising the waters of the Nile. Though the experiment with this engine was successful, the project was not approved by the pasha. Belzoni, now without a job, was resolved to continue his travels. On the recommendation of the orientalist J. L. Burckhardt he was sent by Henry Salt, the British consul to Egypt, to the Ramesseum at Thebes, from where he removed with great skill the colossal bust of Ramesses II, commonly called \\"the Young Memnon\\". Shipped by Belzoni to England, this piece is still on prominent display at the British Museum. This weighed over 7 tons. It took him 17 days and 130 men to tow it to the river. He used levers to lift it onto rollers. Then he had his men distributed equally with 4 ropes drag it on the rollers. On the first day (27 July) he only covered a few yards, the second he covered 50 yards deliberately breaking the bases of 2 columns to clear the way for his burden. After 150 yards, it sank into the sand, and a detour of 300 yards on firmer ground was necessary. From there, it got a little easier, and, on 12 August, he finally made it to the river where he was able to load it on a boat for shipment to the British Museum in London. His excavation and removal of the Young Memnon and other stones during this expedition was explicitly authorized by a firman from Muhammad Ali himself, the Pasha of Egypt. He also expanded his investigations to the great temple of Edfu, visited Elephantine and Philae, cleared the great temple at Abu Simbel of sand (1817), made excavations at Karnak, and opened up the sepulchre of Seti I (still sometimes known as \\"Belzoni's Tomb\\"). He was the first to penetrate into the second pyramid of Giza, and the first European in modern times to visit the oasis of Bahariya. He also identified the ruins of Berenice on the Red Sea. In 1819 he returned to England and published an account of his travels and discoveries entitled Narrative of the Operations and Recent Discoveries within the Pyramids, Temples, Tombs and Excavations in Egypt and Nubia, &c;Published by Remy, 1835 the following year. During 1820 and 1821 he also exhibited facsimiles of the tomb of Seti I. The exhibition was held at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London.The Magic Lantern; Or, Sketches of Scenes in the Metropolis, Blessington 1823 In 1822 Belzoni showed his model in Paris. In 1823 he set out for West Africa, intending to travel to Timbuktu. Having been refused permission to pass through Morocco, he chose the Guinea Coast route. He reached the Kingdom of Benin, but was seized with dysentery at a village called Gwato, and died there. According to the celebrated traveller Richard Francis Burton he was murdered and robbed. In 1829 his widow published his drawings of the royal tombs at Thebes. Commemoration alt=Medal depicting Giovanni Belzoni, British Museum A medal depicting a profile of Belzoni created by William Brockedon was cast in 1821 by Sir Edward Thomason. Belzoni‚Äôs friend Sir Francis Ronalds had introduced artist and subject. Years later, in 1859 in Padua, Ronalds advised sculptor Rinaldo Rinaldi on the large medallion he was creating to commemorate Belzoni in his hometown.

Early life and career Sutherland was born in Christchurch in 1951 and was raised in a Halswell orphanage. He attended Lincoln High School and after completing his education he worked many different jobs as a labourer, farm worker and forester. He eventually moved to Nelson where he trained as a sawfiler. There he became involved in the trade union movement, serving as a union secretary. He also became regional representative of the Wellington and Nelson Shop Employees' Union and president of the Nelson Trades Council. He was also a member of the Nelson Community Education Council, Nelson Polytechnic Council and the Nelson Public Relations and Promotion Committee. His work in the union movement around Nelson brought him into close contact with the Labour MP for Tasman (and later Prime Minister) Bill Rowling. Sutherland joined the Labour Party himself and worked with Rowling, first as treasurer of the Tasman Labour Party electorate committee, and subsequently as its chairman. Sutherland would later attribute his political acumen to Rowling's tutelage. He then sought nomination as Labour candidate for Nelson, in 1980 during Mel Courtney's split with the Labour Party. He was narrowly defeated for the nomination by Philip Woollaston. That same year he unsuccessfully sought the position of vice-president of the Labour Party. He moved back to Christchurch in 1984 and worked as a union official and continued his political involvement. He was assistant secretary of the Canterbury, Westland and Nelson Shop Employees' Union and chairman of the Labour Party's Canterbury Regional Council. Political career Sutherland was first elected to Parliament in the 1987 election as MP for the Christchurch electorate of Avon, replacing the retiring Mary Batchelor after a tight three-way contest for the Labour candidacy. His first term in Parliament was a very stressful time for him. Labour ministers such as Roger Douglas and Richard Prebble were leading the party down a right-wing track (Rogernomics). Traditional Labour members resisted but were outnumbered and Sutherland saw himself as \\"in opposition in his own caucus\\". When high-profile Labour MP Jim Anderton quit the party to form the NewLabour Party in protest of Rogernomics, Sutherland was widely tipped to follow him to the new party. He instead opted to stay and fight for \\"old Labour\\" values drew criticism from some in the union movement. He was vindicated in this regard when the party later turned its back on Rogernomics following the governments defeat in 1990 election. Sutherland supported Helen Clark's leadership coup bid after the 1993 election and, in perhaps his most outspoken moment, called on disgruntled MPs to \\"pull their heads in\\" and listen to rank-and-file members who wanted an end to Labour's internal bickering. He retained that electorate until it was abolished in the 1996 election, when he successfully contested the reconstituted Christchurch East electorate. He opted not to be placed on Labour's 1996 party list. He retired from politics at the 1999 election. When announcing his retirement he said he wanted to look for new career directions and spend more time with his family and also reaffirmed his opposition to Rogernomics stating \\"I hope we are now at a turning point in New Zealand history where the absolute waste and stupidity of free market ideology is coming under scrutiny\\". Sutherland's most notable incident as an MP was a late night escapade where he swam a length of the parliamentary swimming pool whilst wearing National Prime Minister Jenny Shipley's togs. While a shock to the public, he was renowned around Parliament by colleagues as a prankster and possessing an active sense of humour. From 1990 to 1993 he was Labour's spokesperson for Consumer Affairs and Civil Defense and spokesperson for Family Affairs from 1996 to 1999. Sutherland did not hold any ministerial portfolios, but became Labour's Junior Whip in 1993. He was noted among his colleagues as a hard worker behind the scenes as junior whip, contributing much to party unity through a time of frequent rifts. Later life and death After leaving politics, he went into business as owner of a video store. He had always been a technology enthusiast and liked to possess state of the art stereo and television equipment. Sutherland died suddenly in Christchurch on 21 June 2005, aged 54. He was survived by wife Verna, son David, daughter Christine and one grandchild.

History The school opened in 1956 as Branston County Secondary Modern. By 1959 around 350 pupils were enrolled. The name was shortened to Branston County Secondary School in 1968, and to Branston School in 1970. The name was changed to Branston School and Community College in 1972, and later shortened to Branston Community College. The original school consisted of a central block of classrooms, which included a dining hall on the ground floor, and a gymnasium. Woodwork and metalwork workshops were built nearby, while sports changing rooms and greenhouses were at the back. The school for many years ran a house system based on royal houses, with allocated colours: Tudor (yellow), Lancaster (red), Windsor (green), Stuart (blue), York (white) and Hanover (orange). This system has since ended. Classroom space expanded through increased pupil numbers. A new library and office accommodation block, sports complex, swimming pool, youth wing, sixth form unit, science and language block and house rooms have been added over the years. Today The school became a Business & Enterprise College in September 2002. In the 2005 school league table results for Lincolnshire, the school came 22nd out of 66 similar schools in the county for attainment at GCSE/GNVQ level, and 16th out of 36 for attainment at A level/AS level. In September 2007 it was rated an \\"outstanding school\\" category by Ofsted. Inspectors judged relationships between students and staff and student behaviour to be \\"outstanding\\". In December 2010 the school changed its name from Branston Community College to Branston Community Academy. Branston has previously held Business and Enterprise Specialist status and was one of the first 18 British schools designated as a Specialist Business and Enterprise College in September 2002. In 2003 the school became a DCSF Pathfinder Enterprise School, and in 2006 it was designated as the regional hub school for Enterprise. In 2005 the College set up a four-year partnership with Lincolnshire Cooperative and it has also been asked by the Specialist Schools Trust to take part in the research project, Capturing Transformation. According to the Lincolnshire County Council website: > The Library has extensive book, non-book and ICT resources, a large area for > private study and contains the College-run Learndirect Centre. The College > has invested heavily in broadband and wireless technology in addition to the > several dedicated, networked ICT rooms. Houses were abolished in the early 21st century and tutor groups were instead set by year groups. In December 2011, however, new house names were introduced: Lancaster, Vulcan, Spitfire and Hurricane.

It was built in response to the First Welsh War in the late 13th century, replacing an earlier fortress located a mile to the south. During a national uprising by Owain Glynd≈µr, the Welsh captured the castle in 1404, but it was recaptured by the English four years later. In 1637 it became a Royal mint by Charles I, and produced silver shillings. The castle was slighted by Oliver Cromwell in 1649. History Marcher lord Gilbert de Clare built an earlier Motte and bailey castle a mile south of the current site in around 1110. It was called Tan-y-castell, Aberrheidol Castle and Old Aberystwyth. In 1116 it was sieged by Gruffydd ap Rhys, King of Deheubarth, but his attempt to capture it proved fruitless. He was eventually successful in 1136, capturing it and burning it to the ground with the help of Owain Gwynedd and his brother, Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, the sons of Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd, since the Norman invaders had killed their sister, Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd, Gruffydd ap Rhys's wife. Owain Gwynedd gave it to Cadwaladr to rebuild, but Cadwaladr's later attempt to murder Anarawd ap Gruffydd, the new king of Deheubarth, resulted in Owain Gwynedd sending his son Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd to burn it in 1143. The castle was rebuilt and later reinforced with stone. After a succession of at least three owners, it was taken by Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great in 1221. Llywelyn razed the castle and erected a new one in its place. The current castle was rebuilt in its current location by Edward I of England in 1277 after the end of the first war against Llywelyn ap Gruffydd Llywelyn the Great's grandson. The Welsh took the castle in 1282 at the start of the 1282 war and burned both the castle and the town. Under master mason James of St George, the castle was eventually completed in 1289, though it was sieged extensively during the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294-5. The town of Aberystwyth was flourishing by 1307; its Welsh name was Llanbadarn Gaerog (). However, by the time of the Black Prince in 1343 the castle was in a bad state of disrepair; the main gateway and drawbridges, the king's hall and long chamber, the kitchen range, and the outer bailey were falling down. In 1404, Owain Glynd≈µr captured the castle during a national uprising against English occupation. There would be a treaty signed between Glynd≈µr & the King of France at the Castle. Four years later, it was retaken by the English, and became an important seat of the government. In 1637 Charles I turned the castle into a Royal mint, and it became a producer of silver shillings. The mint's operator raised a regiment of Royalist soldiers during the English Civil War. The mint closed down during the Civil War, but served as a warehouse for storing silver and lead. Oliver Cromwell slighted the castle in 1649. Architecture Building work started in 1277 at the time of the First Welsh War. It was begun during Edward I's first Welsh campaign at the same time as work started at Flint, Rhuddlan and Builth Wells. The inner ward was built in a diamond-shaped concentric castle, with a twin D-shaped gatehouse keep and mural towers at each corner. The outer ward is described as consisting of a \\"twin D-shaped gatehouse, a barbican, a rock-cut ditch and a large curtain wall with towers\\".

It was founded in the 12th century by a community of Tironensian monks first brought to Scotland in the reign of Alexander I. It occupies ground overlooking the confluence of the Tweed and Teviot waters, the site of what was once the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh and the intended southern centre for the developing Scottish kingdom at that time. Kelso thus became the seat of a pre-eminently powerful abbacy in the heart of the Scottish Borders. In the 14th century, Roxburgh became a focus for periodic attack and occupation by English forces and Kelso's monastic community survived a number of fluctuations in control over the area, restoring the abbey infrastructure after episodes of destruction and ultimately retaining Scottish identity. From 1460 onwards, life for the abbey probably grew more settled, but came once again under attack in the early sixteenth century. By the mid-century, through a combination of turbulent events, the abbey effectively ceased to function and the building fell into ruin. Although the site of Kelso Abbey has not been fully excavated in modern times, evidence suggests that it was a major building with two crossings. The only remains standing today are the west tower crossing and part of the infirmary. The massive design and solid romanesque style of the tower indicate a very large building of formidable, semi-military construction and appearance, evidence of the importance with which Roxburgh was regarded when the abbacy was at the height of its power. Foundation The north transept of the west crossing, showing the north doorjamb and full gable flanked with massive columnar towers. Kelso Abbey was founded at Roxburgh in 1128 by a community of monks of the Tironesian order, from Tiron, near Chartres, in France.Moffat, A., (2006). Kelsae: A History of Kelso from Earliest Times. page 12. Birlinn Ltd. The community had first entered Scotland, c. 1113, under the patronage of David I as Prince of the Cumbrians during the reign of his brother, Alexander I, when the monks were given a commission to found their community at a site near Selkirk.Medieval monasteries of Great Britain - L Butler and C Given-Wilson. It is not known for certain why the community came to abandon this first site in 1128, although David, now King of Scots, was developing Roxburgh as a major economic and administrative centre for Southern Scotland. Other institutions established by David at Roxburgh included the royal mint. Construction of the abbey is believed to have commenced immediately, and by 1143 progress was sufficiently advanced for the building to be dedicated to The Blessed Virgin and Saint John. The King's son, Henry, Earl of Northumbria, who predeceased his father, was interred in the abbey in 1152.The buildings of Scotland: Borders, Pevsner Architectural Guides . Development and defence Kelso Abbey, which was situated in sight of Roxburgh Castle across the Tweed water, soon grew to be one of the wealthiest and grandest in Scotland, with much of its income coming from its vast estates in the Border country. John, abbot of Kelso from 1160 to 1180, was the first abbot in Scotland to be granted the mitre.Cowan & Easson, Religious Houses, p. 68 After Scotland's royal dynasty began lose the overlordship of Northumbria during the reign of William I, David's southern \\"capital\\" came into close proximity to the border with England and was subject to attack during the Wars of Scottish Independence. In 1299, the abbot of Kelso was the English appointee, Thomas de Durham (1299‚Äì1307), but the abbey defended its Scottish identity. Throughout this turbulent period, Roxburgh Castle and Berwick upon Tweed, the major Scottish port serving the area, were frequently under English occupation. Whenever the abbey was subject to attack, the damage was repaired by the monks. In 1460, James II was killed within sight of the abbey as the result of a fatal accident during the campaign which secured repossession of Roxburgh castle that same year. Kelso Abbey was the venue for the hasty coronation of the infant king, James III, which quickly followed. During the period 1460 to 1513, political and military control in the area was more stable and life for the abbey was probably relatively settled. After 1517, however, it was again subject to English attacks. Sixteenth-century destruction bell found in a field near the Abbey Kelso Abbey effectively ceased to function due to a combination of events in the mid-sixteenth century. First, in the 1540s, the building sustained major damage in attacks perpetrated under the orders of the English king, Henry VIII, part of the so- called Rough Wooing, in which most of southern Scotland's abbeys, including those at Melrose, Dryburgh and Jedburgh, were targeted for destruction by forces under the command of the Earl of Hertford. This physical assault was followed in 1560 by monastic disestablishment under the Scottish Reformation, from which time the Tironensian community at Kelso was no longer officially recognised. A small remaining contingent of monks may have continued at the site for a number of years following the 1560 dissolution, but after further attacks and damage the abbey was declared officially derelict in 1587. By the late 16th century the estates of the former monastery came under fully secular control and in 1607 they were finally granted as a secular lordship, titled Holydean, to the last commendator of the abbey, Robert Ker of Cesford. Post- reformation usage Between 1647 and 1771, part of the abbey ruins was occupied by a parish kirk, with other parts of the structure being dismantled and used as a source of stone by locals for buildings in the town of Kelso. The post-reformation kirk appears to have been a compact vaulted structure intruded within the west transepts in about 1748. This adapted structure included a vaulted gaol. South face of the surviving West tower of Kelso Abbey (viewed from the south east). In 1805, huge parts of the ruins were cleared away, including the parish church and the gaol, leaving only the abbey's west tower and transept remaining to this day. A more recent addition (1933) has been a memorial cloister to the 8th Duke of Roxburghe designed by Reginald Fairlie in the original style of the cloisters when the abbey was first built. Architectural notes Little of the ground plan of this once large abbey exists, but the surviving ruin of the west tower, together with its crossing, is impressive and shows a building that was strong and fortress like. Evidence from Vatican archives, dated 1517, indicates that the complete building had two crossings, west and east, each with single towers, a double-cruciform design that was relatively rare in Europe. The high altar of the abbey would have been at the east tower crossing. Although the east end does not survive, it may have been in a rounded form if, as would be expected, the firm Romanesque design of the extant western tower was consistent throughout the building. The gable of the north transept of the west tower crossing (pictured right) presents the most intact surviving face. The earliest remains of the abbey are the two bays of the south arcade of the nave (partly visible at the far left of the picture). These have rounded arches dating from about 1128. Later additions above this are a triforium from the late 12th Century, and above this clerestory is a continuous arcade. There is no regular vertical pattern between three levels of arcading, a feature which is unique in Scotland or England. The masonry above the clerestory suggests that there was no nave vaulting. The south and west faces of the west tower still rise high to the level of the belfry openings and this structure is not earlier than the beginning of the 13th Century. The west transepts and the west vestibule also survive, though only the north jamb survives of the west crossing's doorways. In the 20th century, the \\"Roxburghe Aisle\\" was built onto the Abbey as the burial vault of the Dukes of Roxburghe.

In pure form it is a colorless gas. Hydrogen bromide is very soluble in water, forming hydrobromic acid, which is saturated at 68.85% HBr by weight at room temperature. Aqueous solutions that are 47.6% HBr by mass form a constant- boiling azeotrope mixture that boils at 124.3 ¬∞C. Boiling less concentrated solutions releases H2O until the constant-boiling mixture composition is reached. Both the anhydrous and aqueous solutions of HBr are common reagents in the preparation of bromide compounds. Uses of HBr Hydrogen bromide and hydrobromic acid are important reagents in the production of inorganic and organic bromine compounds. The free-radical addition of HBr to alkenes gives alkyl bromides: : RCH=CH2 \\\\+ HBr ‚Üí R‚àíCHBr‚àíCH3 These alkylating agents are precursors to fatty amine derivatives.

She was born in Tamaulipas. In the early 1980s, she auditioned with tycoon music producer Sergio Andrade to be a singer, with whom she married when she was 15 years old. In 1985, Andrade formed a girl group, managed by himself. Portillo was chosen for the group; the name \\"Boquitas Pintadas\\" was chosen because it sounded very different from the names of other typical teenage bands of the era, many of which tried to copy Menudo with their name. Because of the band's name, Mary Raquenel Portillo later became known as \\"Mary Boquitas\\". Gloria Trevi was another member of the band. \\"Boquitas Pintadas\\" had five members in total; however, it was Trevi and Portillo who were able to forge a friendship that went beyond their days at \\"Boquitas Pintadas\\". She continued living with Sergio Andrade, and was a backup singer at Gloria Trevi's performances as well. She and Andrade got divorced in 1990. Nevertheless, she kept on living with him in spite of the fact that he married 15 years-old Aline Hern√°ndez and also that he had formed a \\"harem\\" made of young girls who lived together with him, including Gloria Trevi, who attempted to become superstars thanks to Sergio Andrade. In 1994 Sony Music International released her first solo album, produced by Andrade, named \\"Mary Boquitas\\" and from that album the song \\"A Contratiempo\\", which was a successful single in Mexico staying many weeks in first place on radio stations, became a favorite song till now in Mexico. Mary Boquitas was considered one of the best singers in Mexico and Latin America at the time. In 2000, Raquenel was arrested and imprisoned in Brazil along with Sergio Andrade and Gloria Trevi. She was accused of corruption of minors. Furthermore, she was believed to be Sergio Andrade's accomplice in the rape of teenager Karina Yapor, who got pregnant by him. She was further accused of abandoning Karina's son in Spain (under de command of Andrade). Moreover, in Brazil she was also accused of quartering the corpse of Gloria Trevi's dead daughter before being thrown in a river (all by order of Andrade), who died mysteriously thirty-three days after she was born. However, Raquenel and Gloria were absolved in 2004 and were released. In November 2004 she was invited by Carmen Salinas (one of the most important actress and producer in Mexico) to be a part of the play \\"Aventurera\\". Boquitas from then until now (2008) is one of the principal stars in the play (as an actress, dancer and singer). In 2009 she released a new album titled Para Olvidarte. Boquitas was \\"Martina\\", a successful role in the soap opera \\"Muchachitas como t√∫\\" in Mexico and now playing in US. She won two awards for that role. She was Laura in a comedy video home in Mexico; and now is coming soon on cinema the action movie Like Brothers where she has the first role. In 2008 she composed and sang on a new album produced by Joan Romagoza, a Spanish composer and producer. In 2016, she starred in the We TV (U.S. TV channel) series My Life is a Telenovela. In 2017 she released the single \\"Una Nueva Mujer\\" which met moderate success in YouTube.

It is essentially the same as an optical parametric oscillator, but without the optical cavity (i.e., the light beams pass through the apparatus just once or twice, rather than many many times). Optical parametric generation (OPG) Optical parametric generation (OPG) (also called \\"optical parametric fluorescence\\", or \\"spontaneous parametric down conversion\\") often precedes optical parametric amplification. In optical parametric generation, the input is one light beam of frequency œâp, and the output is two light beams of lower frequencies œâs and œâi, with the requirement œâp=œâs+œâi. These two lower-frequency beams are called the \\"signal\\" and \\"idler\\", respectively. This light emission is based on the nonlinear optical principle. The photon of an incident laser pulse (pump) is, by a nonlinear optical crystal, divided into two lower-energy photons. The wavelengths of the signal and the idler are determined by the phase matching condition, which is changed, e.g. by temperature or, in bulk optics, by the angle between the incident pump laser ray and the optical axes of the crystal. The wavelengths of the signal and the idler photons can, therefore, be tuned by changing the phase matching condition. Optical parametric amplification (OPA) Photon picture of optical parametric amplification: A pump photon excites a virtual energy level whose decay is stimulated by a signal photon resulting in the emission of an identical second signal photon and an idler photon under conversion of energy and momentum. The output beams in optical parametric generation are usually relatively weak and have relatively spread-out direction and frequency. This problem is solved by using optical parametric amplification (OPA), also called difference frequency generation, as a second stage after the OPG. In an OPA, the input is two light beams, of frequency œâp and œâs. The OPA will make the pump beam (œâp) weaker, and amplify the signal beam (œâs), and also create a new, so-called idler beam at the frequency œâi with œâp=œâs+œâi. In the OPA, the pump and idler photons usually travel collinearly through a nonlinear optical crystal. Phase matching is required for the process to work well. Because the wavelengths of an OPG+OPA system can be varied (unlike most lasers which have a fixed wavelength), they are used in many spectroscopic methods. As an example of OPA, the incident pump pulse is the 800 nm (12500 cm‚àí1) output of a Ti:sapphire laser, and the two outputs, signal and idler, are in the near- infrared region, the sum of the wavenumber of which is equal to 12500 cm‚àí1. Noncollinear OPA (NOPA) Because most nonlinear crystals are birefringent, beams that are collinear inside a crystal may not be collinear outside of it. The phase fronts (wave vector) do not point in the same direction as the energy flow (Poynting vector) because of walk-off. The phase matching angle makes possible any gain at all (0th order). In a collinear setup, the freedom to choose the center wavelength allows a constant gain up to first order in wavelength. Noncollinear OPAs were developed to have an additional degree of freedom, allowing constant gain up to second order in wavelength. The optimal parameters are 4 degrees of noncollinearity, Œ≤-barium borate (BBO) as the material, a 400-nm pump wavelength, and signal around 800 nm. This generates a bandwidth 3 times as large of that of a Ti-sapphire-amplifier. The first order is mathematically equivalent to some properties of the group velocities involved, but this does not mean that pump and signal have the same group velocity. After propagation through 1-mm BBO, a short pump pulse no longer overlaps with the signal. Therefore, chirped pulse amplification must be used in situations requiring large gain amplification in long crystals. Long crystals introduce such a large chirp that a compressor is needed anyway. An extreme chirp can lengthen a 20-fs seed pulse to 50 ps, making it suitable for use as the pump. Unchirped 50-ps pulses with high energy can be generated from rare earth-based lasers. The optical parametric amplifier has a wider bandwidth than a -amplifier, which in turn has a wider bandwidth than an optical parametric oscillator because of white-light generation even one octave wide. Therefore, a subband can be selected and fairly short pulses can still be generated. The higher gain per mm for BBO compared to Ti:Sa and, more importantly, lower amplified spontaneous emission allows for higher overall gain. Interlacing compressors and OPA leads to tilted pulses. Multipass OPA Multipass can be used for walk off and group velocity (dispersion) compensation; constant intensity with increasing signal power means to have an exponential rising cross section. This can be done by means of lenses, which also refocus the beams to have the beam waist in the crystal; reduction of OPG by increasing the pump power proportional to the signal and splitting the pump across the passes of the signal; broadband amplification by dumping the idler and optionally individually detuning the crystals; complete pump depletion by offsetting the pump and signal in time and space at every pass and feeding one pump pulse through all passes; high gain with BBO, since BBO is only available in small dimensions. Since the direction of the beams is fixed, multiple passes cannot be overlapped into a single small crystal like in a Ti:Sa amplifier. Unless one uses noncolinear geometry and adjusts amplified beams onto the parametric fluorescence cone produced by the pump pulse.http://link.aip.org/link/?APPLAB/86/211120/1 Multipass bow type chirped pulse amplifier  Relationship to parametric amplifiers in electronics The idea of parametric amplification first arose at much lower frequencies: AC circuits, including radio frequency and microwave frequency (in the earliest investigations, sound waves were also studied). In these applications, typically a strong pump signal (or \\"local oscillator\\") at frequency f passes through a circuit element whose parameters are modulated by the weak \\"signal\\" wave at frequency fs (for example, the signal might modulate the capacitance of a varactor diode). The result is that some of the energy of the local oscillator gets transferred to the signal frequency fs, as well as the difference (\\"idler\\") frequency f-fs. The term parametric amplifier is used because the parameters of the circuit are varied. The optical case uses the same basic principle--transferring energy from a wave at the pump frequency to waves at the signal and idler frequencies--so it took the same name.

Biography Born in Peckham, London, the son of a milkman,Richard Williams Obituary: Dave Godin, The Guardian, 20 October 2004 Dave Godin spent his early childhood in Peckham before bombing forced the family to move to Bexleyheath, Kent, where he won a scholarship to Dartford Grammar School. Godin began collecting American R&B; records when at school, where he encouraged the younger Mick Jagger's interest in black American music. He said: \\"..It was at Dartford Grammar School that I met Mick Jagger and introduced him to black music, I'm ashamed to say. It's ironic that as a result of meeting me he's where he is today.\\" Godin played a minor role in the early jam sessions out of which the Rolling Stones emerged, but resented Jagger for what he saw as the Stones' exploitation of black music.Phil Johnson Obituary: Dave Godin, The Independent, 20 October 2004] After working at an advertising agency, and as a hospital porter in place of National Service (he was a conscientious objector), Godin founded the Tamla Motown Appreciation Society, and in time was recruited by Berry Gordy to become Motown's consultant in the UK, setting up its distribution through EMI. At a recording of Ready Steady Go! in 1964, Jagger asked Godin to introduce him to Marvin Gaye. \\"I told him to fuck off and introduce himself\\", Godin recalled. In 1967 he founded Soul City, a record shop which in 1967 developed into a record label on which he released such then-obscure soul classics as \\"Go Now\\" by Bessie Banks, with colleague David Nathan and friend Robert Blackmore. It was in their shop that Godin coined the term 'northern soul',Obituary: Dave Godin, The Daily Telegraph, 28 October 2004 a description that he would popularise through his work as a music journalist. In a 2002 interview with Chris Hunt of Mojo, he explained that he had first come up with the term in 1968 as a sales reference to help staff in his shop differentiate the more modern funkier sounds from the smoother, Motown-influenced soul of a few years earlier: > \\"I had started to notice that northern football fans who were in London to > follow their team were coming into the store to buy records, but they > weren't interested in the latest developments in the black American chart. I > devised the name as a shorthand sales term. It was just to say ‚Äòif you‚Äôve > got customers from the north, don't waste time playing them records > currently in the US black chart, just play them what they like ‚Äì ‚ÄòNorthern > Soul‚Äô.\\"Dancers Only by Chris Hunt, Mojo [2002] In his career he also coined the term Deep Soul and he promoted the interests of a large number of American musicians whose work had fallen out of favour in their home country. His second career was in cinema exhibition. Having studied art, design and film course at Sheffield Polytechnic, he became a senior film officer for the British Film Institute and helped found and was the manager of the Anvil Cinema, Sheffield (1983‚Äì90), the only cinema in the UK to be funded by a local authority. In the mid 1990s he started to compile a series of CDs of rare (and some not so rare) recordings ‚Äì Dave Godin's Deep Soul Treasures ‚Äì for Ace Records, which featured such artists as Loretta Williams, Eddie and Ernie, Jaibi, Ruby Johnson and Jimmy and Louise Tig. The albums were greeted with universal critical acclaim, and Godin described the series as the proudest achievement of his life. Godin, a vegan, was an advocate of animal rights and Esperanto. He was also known for his involvement in anarchist and anti-capitalist organisations, including Freedom Newspaper and Class War. He was the only atheist in his local pro-life organisation. Towards the end of his life he developed an interest in Jainism. He died in Rotherham in 2004, aged 68.

He is the leader of the liberal New Party. ≈Ωivkoviƒá served as mayor of Ni≈° from 1997 to 2000. He played a significant role during the protests and the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. After the assassination of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá, he headed the Government of Serbia for a year. His reign was marked by a state of emergency period and the Operation Sabre, action aimed at finding those responsible for political assassinations and combating organized crime. Early life and education ≈Ωivkoviƒá was born in Ni≈°, Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia where he attended High School Bora Stankoviƒá, subsequently enrolling at the Belgrade Business School, where he received a Diploma in Economics and Social science. He worked as an entrepreneur before engaging into politics. Political career Early years Zoran ≈Ωivkoviƒá entered politics in 1992 by joining the Democratic Party (DS) and became a member of Serbian Parliament and the party's Deputy Leader under the leadership of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá. In late 1996, ≈Ωivkoviƒá lead the civil protests of the opposition against the electoral fraud in Ni≈° and became the first democratic Mayor of Ni≈° in 1997. 2000‚Äì2004 In 2000, ≈Ωivkoviƒá contributed greatly to the mobilization of the democratic opposition of Serbia during October 5 overthrow of Milo≈°eviƒá from power. In November 2000, ≈Ωivkoviƒá became the Federal Minister of Interior of FR Yugoslavia and served until 2003, when the position was abolished following the constitutional formation of State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. After the assassination of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá, ≈Ωivkoviƒá was elected as the 7th Prime Minister of Serbia and decisively lead his reformist Government through the state of emergency period and promoted offensive measures on cracking down organized crime and corruption, but his Government collapsed as a consequence of the controversial arrests, government scandals, and unrest within the coalition. After eleven months of heading the Government of Serbia, weakening public support saw ≈Ωivkoviƒá stepping down from the Democratic Party leadership position, following the loss of power in parliamentary elections held in December 2003 and successful challenge for party leadership by Boris Tadiƒá, who emerged as the new leader. ≈Ωivkoviƒá was pushed to the sidelines within Democratic Party, as he never got on with the new party leadership under Boris Tadiƒá. 2004‚Äìpresent Following a loss of power in 2004, ≈Ωivkoviƒá formed a non- governmental organization Milenijum - Center for Development of Civil Society, as a channel for his desire to \\"modify the consciousness of Serbian citizens related to the need of involving each individual into ongoing process of changes\\". During that period ≈Ωivkoviƒá was often linked in the media to another Democratic Party outcast ƒåedomir Jovanoviƒá who was vocally critical of the DS direction under the new leadership, but the two never really formed any kind of common political plan of action. Regarding his involvement with the Democratic Party, ≈Ωivkoviƒá claimed that he is \\"only a member\\" in spite of some views who saw his potential comeback to the party's Executive Board.Zivkovic rehabilitated;B92, 11 May 2005 During this period, ≈Ωivkoviƒá was still present in public life, making occasional appearances on political talk shows, commenting on his past days with Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá and criticizing the lack of reformist agenda in the Government of Vojislav Ko≈°tunica. Disappointed that the Democratic Party did not include him on their 250 candidates list for the 2007 parliamentary elections, he basically left active politics only to emerge to prior to the general elections in May 2012 actively opposing Boris Tadiƒá's re-election as the President of Serbia and blaming him for the DS loss of power in May 2012.Gradjani izborom kaznili bahatost i oholost DS-a ;bktvnews.com, May 2012 In November 2012, he left Democratic Party after 20 years of membership, stating that he intends to form a new party in early 2013Zivkovic: New party in February or March ;Tanjug, 6 December 2012 which would continue the reform process, modernization of Serbia and the actions launched by DS, which were interrupted in early 2004.Zivkovic announces new party;izbornareforma.rs, November 2012 Personal life Zoran ≈Ωivkoviƒá is married to Biserka, a lawyer and political activist.

IUPAC defines azo compounds as: \\"Derivatives of diazene (diimide), HN=NH, wherein both hydrogens are substituted by hydrocarbyl groups, e.g. PhN=NPh azobenzene or diphenyldiazene.\\" The more stable derivatives contain two aryl groups. The N=N group is called an azo group. The name azo comes from azote, the French name for nitrogen that is derived from the Greek (a-, \\"not\\") + (z≈çƒì, life). Many textile and leather articles are dyed with azo dyes and pigments. Aryl azo compounds Aryl azo compounds are usually stable, crystalline species. Azobenzene is the prototypical aromatic azo compound. It exists mainly as the trans isomer, but upon illumination, converts to the cis isomer. Aromatic azo compounds can be synthesized by azo coupling, which entails an electrophilic substitution reaction where an aryl diazonium cation is attacked by another aryl ring, especially those substituted with electron- donating groups: : + Ar‚Ä≤H ‚Üí ArN=NAr‚Ä≤ + H+ Since diazonium salts are often unstable near room temperature, the azo coupling reactions are typically conducted near 0 ¬∞C. The oxidation of hydrazines (R‚àíNH‚àíNH‚àíR‚Ä≤) also gives azo compounds. Azo dyes are also prepared by the condensation of nitroaromatics with anilines followed by reduction of the resulting azoxy intermediate: :ArNO2 \\\\+ Ar‚Ä≤NH2 ‚Üí ArN(O)=NAr‚Ä≤ + H2O :ArN(O)=NAr‚Ä≤ + C6H12O6 ‚Üí ArN=NAr‚Ä≤ + C6H10O6 \\\\+ H2O For textile dying, a typical nitro coupling partner would be disodium 4,4‚Ä≤-dinitrostilbene-2,2‚Ä≤-disulfonate. Typical aniline partners are shown below.Klaus Hunger, Peter Mischke, Wolfgang Rieper, Roderich Raue, Klaus Kunde, Aloys Engel: \\"Azo Dyes\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.. An orange azo dye As a consequence of –ø-delocalization, aryl azo compounds have vivid colors, especially reds, oranges, and yellows. Therefore, they are used as dyes, and are commonly known as azo dyes, an example of which is Disperse Orange 1. Some azo compounds, e.g., methyl orange, are used as acid-base indicators due to the different colors of their acid and salt forms. Most DVD-R/+R and some CD-R discs use blue azo dye as the recording layer. The commercial success of azo dyes motivated the development of azo compounds in general. Alkyl azo compounds Aliphatic azo compounds (R and/or R‚Ä≤ = aliphatic) are less commonly encountered than the aryl azo compounds. A commercially important alkyl azo compound is azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), which is widely used as an initiator in free-radical polymerizations and other radical-induced reactions. It achieves this initiation by decomposition, eliminating a molecule of nitrogen gas to form two 2-cyanoprop-2-yl radicals: :380px For instance a mixture of styrene and maleic anhydride in toluene will react if heated, forming the copolymer upon addition of AIBN. A simple dialkyl diazo compound is diethyldiazene, EtN=NEt. Because of their instability, aliphatic azo compounds pose the risk of explosion. AIBN is produced by converting acetone cyanohydrin to the hydrazine derivative followed by oxidation:Jean-Pierre Schirmann, Paul Bourdauducq: \\"Hydrazine\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. . :2 (CH3)2C(CN)OH + N2H4 ‚Üí [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2H2 \\\\+ 2 H2O : [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2H2 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2 \\\\+ 2 HCl Safety and regulation Many azo pigments are non-toxic, although some, such as dinitroaniline orange, ortho-nitroaniline orange, or pigment orange 1, 2, and 5 have been found to be mutagenic. Likewise, several case studies have linked azo pigments with basal cell carcinoma. European regulation Certain azo dyes can break down under reductive conditions to release any of a group of defined aromatic amines. Consumer goods which contain listed aromatic amines originating from azo dyes were prohibited from manufacture and sale in European Union countries in September 2003. As only a small number of dyes contained an equally small number of amines, relatively few products were affected.European Ban on Certain Azo Dyes , Dr. A. P√ºntener and Dr. C.

Overview The term monad comes from the Greek feminine noun monas (nominative singular, ŒºŒøŒΩŒ¨œÇ), \\"one unit,\\" where the ending -s in the nominative form resolves to the ending -d in declension.Francis E. Peters Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon 1970 p. 42. In some gnostic systems, the Supreme Being is known as the Monad, the One, the Absolute, Ai≈çn Teleos (the Perfect Aeon, ), Bythos (Depth or Profundity, ), Proarchƒì (Before the Beginning, ), Hƒì Archƒì (The Beginning, ), the Ineffable Parent, and/or the primal Father. Prominent Christian gnostics like Valentinus taught that the Monad is the high source of the Pleroma, the region of light constituting \\"the fullness of the Godhead.\\" Through a process of emanation, various divine entities and realms emerge from the One. Arranged hierarchically, they become progressively degraded due to their remoteness from the Father. The various emanations of the One, totaling thirty in number (or 365, according to Basilides), are called Aeons. Among them exist Jesus (who resides close to the Father) and the lowest emanation, Sophia (wisdom), whose fall results in the creation of the material world.Louis P. Pojman, \\"Valentinus,\\" in The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 3rd ed., ed. Robert Audi. According to Theodoret's book on heresies (Haereticarum Fabularum Compendium i.18), the Arab Christian Monoimus (c. 150‚Äì210) used the term Monad to mean the highest god that created lesser gods, or elements (similar to Aeons). In some versions of Christian gnosticism, especially those deriving from Valentinius, a lesser deity known as the Demiurge had a role in the creation of the material world separate from the Monad. In these forms of gnosticism, the God of the Old Testament, Yahweh, is often considered to have been the Demiurge, not the Monad,Louis P. Pojman, \\"gnosticism,\\" in The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 3rd ed., ed. Robert Audi. or sometimes different passages are interpreted as referring to each. Apocryphon of John, written , gives the following description: The Apocryphon of John was banned by the Christian Church and rediscovered among other gnostic texts in a large jar at Nag Hammadi, Egypt in 1945. Historical background According to Hippolytus of Rome, this view was inspired by the Pythagoreans, for whom the first existing thing was the Monad, which begat the dyad, which begat the numbers, which begat the point, begetting lines, and so on.Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. Pythagorean and Platonic philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry condemned the \\"gnosis\\" that would later characterize Gnostic systems for their treatment of the Monad or One (see Neoplatonism and Gnosticism). For a long time, legend persisted that a young man by the name of Epiphanes, who died at the age of 17, was the leader of Monadic Gnosticism. However, scholars think the legend may have come from misunderstanding of the Greek word epiphanƒìs which may have been mistaken as a personal name if in text, when in fact the Greek means distinguished, as in a distinguished teacher.Mead, G.R.S. 1900. \\"Epiphanes, Fragments of a Faith Forgotten, pp. 232‚Äì235, available online by The Gnostic Society Library.

Early life Cole was born in Buxton, Derbyshire, England. He grew up in nearby Chapel-en-le-Frith and went to New Mills Grammar School and later attended Runshaw College in Leyland. He studied a year of law at University College London but switched to the University of Glasgow, where he studied philosophy and English, and also met the future members of The Commotions. Career The Commotions' 1984 debut, Rattlesnakes, contained literary and pop culture references to such figures as Arthur Lee, Norman Mailer, Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint, Simone de Beauvoir, Truman Capote and Joan Didion. The group produced two more albums, Easy Pieces and Mainstream, before disbanding in 1989, when Cole relocated to New York City and recorded with various artists, including Fred Maher, Robert Quine and Matthew Sweet. This solo setting produced two albums, Lloyd Cole in 1990 and Don't Get Weird on Me Babe in 1991. The latter was recorded in two parts: one side continued the New York rock of his first solo album, while the other side featured a session orchestra, much in the style of Burt Bacharach or Scott Walker. Although some reviewers have claimed Don't Get Weird on Me Babe (the title being a quotation from the American minimalist writer Raymond Carver) to be a creative peak, it produced significantly fewer record sales. While he remained with Polydor as his record label, the US distribution contract with Capitol Records ended. (US rights were immediately picked up by Rykodisc.) His song \\"Downtown\\" (from Lloyd Cole, 1990) was featured in the movie Bad Influence (1990) ‚Äì starring Rob Lowe and James Spader ‚Äì while \\"Pay For It\\" (from Don't Get Weird On Me Babe, 1991) was on the soundtrack of When The Party's Over, starring Sandra Bullock. Cole continued redefining his sound with Bad Vibes (1993), a collaboration with producer/remixer Adam Peters, using a harder sound. Love Story (1995) established stripped-down, largely acoustic sound landscapes with the help of Stephen Street (known for his work with Blur and The Smiths) and former Commotion Neil Clark; the album produced a minor hit with the song \\"Like Lovers Do\\", affording Cole a mid-90s appearance on Top of the Pops. The album's song Let's Get Lost would later be used in the movie Danny Deckchair (Jeff Balsmeyer, 2003). However, following a massive purge of the artist roster that came with Universal Music's takeover of PolyGram and Cole's disappointment with the label, his contract was terminated, despite at least two full-length recordings being locked in its vaults (later released in 2002 by One Little Indian). In 1998 Cole's song \\"Margo's Waltz\\" (off 1991's Don't Get Weird On Me Babe album) was featured in the movie There's Something About Mary. In 1997 and 1998 Cole played with some New York musicians under the name The Negatives. The group consisted of Jill Sobule, Dave Derby of the Dambuilders, Mike Kotch and Rafa Maciejak, who recorded an eponymous CD, released mainly in Western Europe and North America. He has since released solo albums on smaller independent labels. Sanctuary Records released Music in a Foreign Language (2003) in the UK. Recorded largely by Cole himself (including tracks recorded directly onto a Mac), the songs had a stark, folk-inspired singer-songwriter style. The album was released in the U.S. by the One Little Indian label, which also collected a number of outtakes (recorded from 1996 to 2000) on 2002's Etc. and released an instrumental ambient electronica album, Plastic Wood, the same year. Music in a Foreign Language's title track and My Other Life would later be used in Eytan Fox's movie Ha-Buah (The Bubble, 2006). In 2004, to mark the 20th anniversary of the release of Rattlesnakes, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions reformed to perform a one-off tour of the UK and Ireland which generated some media interest, mostly in UK broadsheets. The reformation was never intended to be permanent, and Cole released another solo album in 2006, Antidepressant, using his usual home recording outfit by playing all the instruments himself with friends like Sobule, Derby and the guitar work of former Commotion Neil Clark on some tracks. The follow-up Broken Record, released in September 2010, marked a departure from his solo recordings, as it was performed by a band of longstanding friends and working partners, including Fred Maher, Joan Wasser, Rainy Orteca, Dave Derby and Blair Cowan ‚Äì as well as two musicians, Matt Cullen (guitar; banjo) and Mark Schwaber (guitar; mandolin), with whom Cole tours, billed as 'Lloyd Cole Small Ensemble'. The recording of the album was entirely financed by advance purchases by his fans and contributions from Tapete Records, which later distributed the album and also oversaw and negotiated the rights to release a boxed set with his complete collection of b-sides, alternative takes and previously unreleased material, under the title Cleaning Out the Ashtrays. A further album co-funded by fans, Standards, was released in June 2013, and includes contributions from Fred Maher and Matthew Sweet, Blair Cowan (The Commotions) and Joan Wasser (a.k.a. Joan As Police Woman). The critically acclaimed album returned Lloyd Cole to the UK Album Top 75 for the first time since 1999. In February 2013 a new album of electronic music by Cole and Hans-Joachim Roedelius was released.} In 2016 Cole went on tour with The Leopards to celebrate the release of the Lloyd Cole and the Commotions Collected Recordings 1983‚Äì1988 box set. Live album Lloyd Cole and the Leopards ‚Äì Live at Brooklyn Bowl was released through his website along with several live recordings of shows he performed with his son William on guitar. In early 2017 the single Man on the Verge was released as a taster for the Lloyd Cole in New York ‚Äì Collected Recordings 1988‚Äì1996 box set. A new studio album, Guesswork, was released on 26 July 2019 by earMUSIC. The electronic sounding album featured contributions from a.o. Fred Maher and former Commotions Blair Cowan and Neil Clark. The album was received very positively by both fans and press (MOJO 4 stars, Q Magazine 4 stars, Uncut 7/10). It was pronounced Album of the Week by the UK's Independent. On iTunes it entered at No. 2 in France, No. 4 in UK and No. 5 in Germany. In Sweden it went to No. 1. On his Facebook-page Lloyd wrote on the day of release: \\"Career wise (ie family stuff excepted) this is the happiest I've been since Rattlesnakes charted at #13 in 1984 or was it #14? This record took a lot out of me. I'm happy it seems to be doing what I hoped it would do.\\" Live performances Cole is on tour frequently, playing small club venues in a one- man acoustic setting and presenting rock songs from his past career remodelled as simple folk songs. He interacts extensively with the audience and some songs are told rather than played, in a manner like spoken word or comedy. Performances recorded in April 2008 at Whelan's in Dublin and in 2003 in Bremen (also broadcast by Radio Bremen) were used for two live albums called the Folksinger series.} In 2010 he formed a small ensemble consisting of American musicians Mark Schwaber and Matt Cullen and, in October and November of that year, completed an extensive tour of Europe. Further tours of New Zealand and Australia and Europe followed in 2011. In autumn 2016, Cole undertook a short tour of the UK and Europe, titled 'The Retrospective', playing acoustic versions of songs written between 1983 and 1996. Personal life Cole married his American wife, Elizabeth Lewis, in December 1989.} They live in Easthampton, Massachusetts, USA with their two sons.} Cole's parents were golf club stewards and he is an avid golfer. Cole's 5.3 handicap tied 11th place on Golf Digest's top 100 list of musicians with Alice Cooper and Dan Tyminski. An article he wrote, about playing the famous golf courses of the Melbourne Sandbelt while being on tour, was awarded with the Best Feature of the Year Award by the Australian Golf Writers Association.} Covers Cole has recorded and performed a number of songs by Marc Bolan: \\"Children of the Revolution\\", \\"The Slider\\", \\"Mystic Lady\\" and \\"Romany Soup\\". Cole has also covered \\"I'm Not Willing\\" by Moby Grape; \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\", \\"Tower of Song\\" and \\"Chelsea Hotel\\" by Leonard Cohen; \\"People Ain't No Good\\" by Nick Cave; \\"Vicious\\" by Lou Reed; \\"I Don't Believe You\\", \\"She Belongs to Me\\", \\"You're a Big Girl Now\\", \\"I Threw it All Away\\" \\", \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" (Black session live) and \\"Most of the Time\\" by Bob Dylan; \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" by The Beatles; \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" by The Kinks;} \\"Human\\" by The Human League (with Stephin Merritt's 6ths); \\"Being Boring\\" by Pet Shop Boys; \\"Believe\\" by Cher; \\"Glory\\" by Television; \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\", \\"Lady Came From Baltimore\\", and \\"Reason To Believe\\" by Tim Hardin; \\"Pocket Calculator\\" by Kraftwerk; \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" by Burt Bacharach; \\"These Days\\" by Jackson Browne (not to be confused with Cole's own song \\"These Days\\" on Mainstream); \\"Rock 'n' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" by AC/DC; \\"Please Don't Tell Me How This Story Ends\\" by Kris Kristofferson; \\"Memphis\\" by Karen Black; and \\"Chinese Translation\\" by M. Ward. His versions often differ significantly in arrangement to the originals. Cole's \\"Rattlesnakes\\" has been covered by Tori Amos, while Sandie Shaw has recorded a version of \\"(Are You) Ready to Be Heartbroken?\\". In 2006, Scottish band Camera Obscura released the song \\"Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken\\" as an answer song to Cole's 1984 hit \\"(Are You) Ready to Be Heartbroken?\\".

She was an member of parliament from 1984 to 1999, representing the National Party. She served as a minister for the National Government for six of those years. Early life O'Regan was born to farming parents at Te Mata, on the West Coast of the North Island and attended Hamilton Girls' High School. She chose a nursing career but left after two years due to suffering from back problems. After leaving nursing, O'Regan was involved in community organisations like the Plunket Society, SPELD (a non- profit organisation that supports people with dyslexia) and the Hamilton Speech Therapy Association. Political career O'Regan was a voting delegate for the National Party in the Raglan electorate candidate selection ahead of the 1975 election, where she supported Marilyn Waring. O'Regan would work for Waring as her electoral agent for eight years. O'Regan was elected to the Waipa County Council in 1977 and served as a county councillor for eight years; she was the first woman to be elected to the council. When Waring, then representing the Waipa electorate, retired from Parliament, O'Regan was selected as the new National Party candidate for the electorate in 1984. She held Waipa for twelve years until it was abolished in 1996.  In Opposition, 1984‚Äì1990  The National Government was defeated at the 1984 election. On her entry to Parliament, O'Regan sought to highlight the plight of children with specific learning disabilities by introducing a private members bill seeking recognition by the education system of children with these disabilities. It was not successful, but the bill was carried over by the Labour Party in Government. It was finally discharged after 1990.  In Government, 1990‚Äì1999  National regained the government benches in 1990. In the Fourth National Government, O'Regan was appointed as a Minister outside of Cabinet, as Minister of Consumer Affairs, Associate Minister of Health, Associate Minister of Social Welfare and Associate Minister of Women's Affairs. These remained her portfolios until the 1996 election; she additionally served as Minister of Youth Affairs in 1996. As Associate Minister of Health, she amended the Human Rights Act to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and having organisms in the body which might cause disease and established a free breast cancer screening programme. In 1993, O'Regan was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. In 1994, O'Regan led the New Zealand Delegation to the United Nations Population and Development Conference in Cairo and also gave the Second Country Report to CEDAW at the United Nations in New York. Ahead of the 1996 general election, the Waipa electorate was disestablished. O'Regan contested the Tauranga electorate against former the former National Party MP for Tauranga, Winston Peters, who was contesting the electorate under his New Zealand First Party. O'Regan was unsuccessful in this election but remained in Parliament as a list MP. With the National Party forming a coalition government with New Zealand First, O'Regan did not continue in Cabinet and was instead appointed the Chairperson of the Internal Affairs select committee from 1996 to 1999. O'Regan continued her interest in population and development issues by establishing, with the help of Family Planning International, a New Zealand Parliamentarians' Group on Population and Development. In the 1999 general election, she again challenged Peters, and came within 62 votes of defeating him--had she won, the New Zealand First party would have lost all parliamentary representation. Labour's candidate Margaret Wilson, who came third in the electorate, requested a recount. The final result was a 63 votes majority for Peters. O'Regan attempted to oust Peters from the electorate by encouraging voters to vote tactically, and vote for her rather than the Labour's Wilson. However, Peters was re-elected but with a much reduced margin. Unlike in 1996, O'Regan was not high enough on National's party list to remain in Parliament and thus retired from politics.  Later career  In the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, O'Regan was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. She was the chair of the Te Awamutu Community Public Relations Organisation. She was Chair of the Human Ethics in Research Committee for eight years at Waikato Institute of Technology and served on the New Zealand Law Society Waikato/Bay of Plenty Complaints Committee. Political views O'Regan was a council member of Family Planning New Zealand. She favoured compulsory sex education from age ten and condom vending machines in all secondary schools and public toilets. In an obituary, O'Regan's daughter Susan O'Regan described her mother as a Royalist, feminist, and strong believer in equal rights.  Personal life  O'Regan has two children to her first husband Neil O'Regan, whom she married in 1968. The couple divorced; O'Regan married former National MP Michael Cox in 1992. O'Regan was diagnosed, through the free screening programme she had established as Associate Minister of Health, with breast cancer in 2008. She died of her illness on 2 May 2018.

Between 1984 and 1989, the band scored four Top 20 albums and five Top 40 singles in the UK. After they broke up in 1989, Cole embarked on a solo career but the band reformed briefly in 2004 to perform a 20th anniversary mini-tour of the UK and Ireland. Band history The band were formed whilst Cole (who was born in Derbyshire, England) was studying at the University of Glasgow. They signed to Polydor Records; their debut single \\"Perfect Skin\\" reaching number 26 in the UK chart in spring 1984, while the second single \\"Forest Fire\\" reached 41. Their first album, Rattlesnakes, was released in October 1984. Produced by Paul Hardiman and featuring string arrangements by Anne Dudley, it peaked at No. 13 in the UK and was certified Gold for sales over 100,000 copies. NME included it in its Top 100 Albums of All Time list, and the title track was later covered by the American singer Tori Amos. The Welsh band Manic Street Preachers included the album amongst their top ten list. The band's follow-up album, Easy Pieces, was produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley (who had previously produced Madness, The Teardrop Explodes and Elvis Costello and the Attractions). Released in November 1985, the album was a quicker commercial success than its predecessor (entering the UK album chart at No. 5, and certified gold within a month). The singles \\"Brand New Friend\\" and \\"Lost Weekend\\" were the band's first and only UK Top 20 hits (reaching No. 19 and No. 17 respectively). Two years later, the band released their third album, their final one whilst together, Mainstream. Produced by Ian Stanley (former writer and keyboard player of Tears for Fears), the album peaked at No. 9 in the UK and was also certified gold, but contained only one UK Top 40 single, \\"Jennifer She Said\\" (No. 31). Its first single \\"My Bag\\", and a later release, the From The Hip EP, failed to make the Top 40. In 1989, the band decided to split up and released a \\"best of\\" compilation, 1984-1989, which was their fourth Top 20 album (UK No. 14) and fourth Gold certification. Following this, Cole embarked on a solo career with the release of his eponymous album in 1990. On the first two Commotions albums, Cole was the band's main songwriter (though he co-wrote several songs with various bandmembers). The third album is credited to the band as a whole, though Cole remained the sole lyricist. Particularly notable were Cole's literate lyrics (he was studying philosophy at university when the band started) and namedropping the likes of Norman Mailer, Leonard Cohen, Arthur Lee, Grace Kelly, Truman Capote, Simone de Beauvoir, Nancy Sinatra, and Eva Marie Saint as well as referring to Sean Penn (somewhat sympathetically) as \\"Mr. Madonna\\". In 2006, Scottish band Camera Obscura released the song \\"Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken\\" as an answer song to the Commotions' 1984 hit \\"(Are You) Ready to Be Heartbroken?\\".

Early life and background Mallikarjun was born on New Year's Eve of 1910, at Mansur, a village five kilometres west of Dharwad, Karnataka. His father, Bheemaraayappa, was the village headman, a farmer by occupation and an ardent lover and patron of music. He had four brothers and three sisters. His elder brother Basavaraj owned a theatre troupe, and thus at age nine Mallikarjun did a small role in a play. Spotting the talent in his son, Mallikarjun's father engaged him to a travelling Yakshagana (Kannada theatre) troupe. The owner of this troupe took a liking to the tender and melodious voice of Mallikarjun and encouraged him to sing different types of compositions during the drama-performances. Hearing one such performance, he was picked up by Appaya Swamy under whom he had his initial training in Carnatic music. Sometime later, he was introduced to Hindustani music under Nilkanth Bua Alurmath of Miraj who belonged to the Gwalior gharana. The latter brought him to Alladiya Khan (1855‚Äì1946), the stalwart and the then patriarch of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, in the late 1920s, who referred him to his elder son, Manji Khan. Following Manji Khan's untimely death, he came under the tutelage of Manji Khan's younger brother Bhurji Khan. This grooming under Bhurji Khan had the most important influence on his style of singing. Career Mallikarjun Mansur at a concert Mansur was well known for his command over a large number of rare (aprachalit) ragas such as Shuddh Nat, Asa Jogiya, Hem Nat, Lachchhasakh, Khat, Shivmat Bhairav, Kabir Bhairav, Bihari, Sampoorna Malkauns, Lajawanti, Adambari Kedar, Ek Nishad Bihagda and Bahaduri Todi, as well as his constant, mercurial improvisations in both melody and metre without ever losing the emotional content of the song. Initially, his voice and style resembled that of Manji Khan and Narayanrao Vyas, but gradually he developed his own style of rendition. He also remained music director with His Master's Voice (HMV) and later music advisor to All India Radio's Dharwad station. Awards He received all three national Padma Awards, the Padma Shri in 1970, Padma Bhushan in 1976, and Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour given Government of India in 1992. In 1982, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour conferred by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance & Drama. Books Mansur wrote an autobiographical book titled Nanna Rasayatre () in Kannada, which has been translated into English as a book titled My Journey in Music by his son, Rajshekhar Mansur. Personal life Mansur was married to Gangamma. He had seven daughters and a son, Rajashekhar Mansur. Amongst Mansur's children, Rajashekhar and Neela Kodli are vocalists. Mansur recovered from an illness after being in coma for two weeks in April 1992. On 12 September that year, he died after he developed breathing complications, in Dharwad. He was given a state funeral. Legacy The residence of Mallikarjun Mansur, Mrutyunjaya, today houses a museum in his memory. The museum is managed by Dr. Mallikarjun Mansur National Memorial Trust functioning under the Department of Kannada and Culture, State Government of Karnataka. Every year the Trust organises a National Concert on 12 and 13 September to commemorate his death anniversary, with artists from his legacy performing in the morning at the museum and invited artists performing later in the evening. The Trust annually announces three awards on 31 December to commemorate his birth anniversary. To mark his birth centenary, a three-day music festival was organised in Dharwad and Hubli from 1 to 3 January 2011, wherein singers from across India performed and performances were held at the Kariyamma Devi temple premises at his birthplace Mansur village. His ancestral home in Mansur was also converted into a memorial. In 2013, a five audio CD collection, \\"Akashvani Sangeet\\" of his music including rare \\"Vachana Gayana\\" renditions, was released by All India Radio archives at a ceremony held at Srijana Rangamandir at the Karnatak College Dharwar campus.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 3,605. It is about south of the city and county town of Lincoln and north of Sleaford. The centre of the village is a conservation area. History The village is a documented settlement in the Domesday Book of 1086 and is thought to date from Saxon times. It appears to be associated with the name \\"Medrich\\". The addition of the plural ending \\"-es\\" together with the familiar \\"-ham\\" ending is thought to have produced \\"Medrichesham\\" (the homestead of Medrich), which in time became corrupted into the modern name of the village. The earliest surviving document relating specifically to the village dates from 24 June 1314, in the reign of Edward II. In July 1599, a great fire left only a few houses standing.

He also served as the third Lieutenant Governor of Quebec (1876-1879). A notary by training, Letellier belonged to an old and prominent family. He was a half-brother of Horace B√©langer. In 1851, he was elected in a by-election to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada as a supporter of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine. He was defeated in a general election a few months later by his rival Jean-Charles Chapais. In 1860, Letellier won election to the legislative council of the united province and, in 1863, he was appointed minister of agriculture in the Reform - rouge Cabinet of Joint Premiers John Sandfield Macdonald and Antoine-Aim√© Dorion. The government fell the next year, however, in favour of a Tory - Parti bleu administration. Letellier opposed Canadian Confederation prior to 1867, but accepted it once it became a reality. He was appointed by royal charter as a charter member of the Senate of Canada when it was created in 1867. He sat as a \\"Nationalist Liberal\\", and was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1867 until the 1872 election when the Liberals took power under Alexander Mackenzie. Letellier became Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister of Agriculture in Mackenzie's Cabinet. He had also attempted to concurrently win a seat in the Quebec legislative assembly, but was defeated in his attempts in 1869 and 1871 to win election. In 1876, Mackenzie advised the Governor General of Canada to appoint Letellier to the position of lieutenant-governor of Quebec. As lieutenant governor, he dismissed the government of Conservative Quebec Premier Charles-Eug√®ne Boucher de Boucherville on March 1, 1878, despite the fact that the government enjoyed a 20-seat majority in the Quebec legislative assembly and a two-to-one majority in the legislative council. Letellier justified the dismissal on charges that the government was acting incompetently and corruptly on the matter of railway legislation. He also argued that if the de Boucherville government hadn't made concessions to \\"rings\\" of interest within the legislature on the issue, it would lose the legislature's support. De Boucherville called the move a \\"coup d'etat\\", and complained to the Governor General of Canada. Both houses of the Quebec legislature passed motions of censure against the lieutenant-governor. When the federal Conservatives under Sir John A. Macdonald defeated the federal Liberals in the 1878 election, the new federal Cabinet tried to have Letellier dismissed as lieutenant-governor of Quebec. The Governor General, the Marquess of Lorne, referred the matter to the Colonial Secretary in London who advised him to follow the advice of his ministers. Letellier was dismissed.

The advent of the Internet has led to a rapid increase in self-packaging of holidays. However, tour operators still have their competence in arranging tours for those who do not have time to do DIY holidays, and specialize in large group events and meetings such as conferences or seminars. Also, tour operators still exercise contracting power with suppliers (airlines, hotels, other land arrangements, cruise companies and so on) and influence over other entities (tourism boards and other government authorities) in order to create packages and special group departures for destinations that might otherwise be difficult and expensive to visit.

Whitmore‚Äôs parents were George Knaggs, who had been born in London, England, and Rachel Sly, who had Dutch parentage. One of at least eight children, he was born in 1763 on his father‚Äôs farm by the Maumee River in Ohio. He was educated at home, being taught French, Latin, and Dutch by his mother. He was friendly with the local Native American people, and was appointed a United States Indian agent in 1781 (some say by George Washington). In July 1784 the headman of the Ottawa nation granted him a tract of land on the Maumee River on which Fort Miami was later built. On August 20, 1794 he fought with General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers against a mixed Canadian and Indian force. He also acted as interpreter. He moved to Detroit, where his father had opened a trading store, and in 1797, married Josette Labadie. In 1803 he bought a homestead and farm on the Detroit River by Knaggs Creek (now disappeared), where he raised five children, and built a windmill. It became a stopping point for Indians of the Ottawa, Chippewa, Pottawatomi and Wabash tribes. Whitmore Knaggs could converse in all these languages. He was a personal friend of the Indian leader Tecumseh (who was later killed by James Knaggs). In 1805 he was made a captain in the Michigan Militia, and fought against the British and the Indians in the War of 1812, from 1812 to 1815.

In general, registration authorities all perform a similar function, in promoting the use of a particular standard through facilitating its use. This may be by applying the standard, where appropriate, or by verifying that a particular application satisfies the standard's tenants. Maintenance agencies, in contrast, may change an element in a standard based on set rules ‚Äì such as the creation or change of a currency code when a currency is created or revalued (i.e. TRL to TRY for Turkish lira). The Object Management Group has an additional concept of certified provider, which is deemed an entity permitted to perform some functions on behalf of the registration authority, under specific processes and procedures documented within the standard for such a role. An ISO registration authority (RAs) is not authorized to update standards but provides a registration function to facilitate implementation of an International Standard (e.g. ISBN number for books). Frequently, facilitating the implementation of an ISO standard‚Äôs requirements is best suited, by its nature, to one entity, an RA. This, de facto, creates a monopoly situation and this is why care needs to be taken with respect to the functions carried out and the fees charged to avoid an abuse of such a situation.http://www.iso.org/iso/registration_authorities_guidelines_for_committees.pdf In most cases, there is a formal legal contract in place between the standards body, such as the ISO General Secretariat, and the selected registration authority. ISO registration authorities differ from a maintenance agency. Maintenance agencies are authorized to update particular elements in an International Standard and as a matter of policy, the secretariats of MAs are assigned to bodies forming part of the ISO system (member bodies or organizations to which a member body delegates certain tasks in its country). The membership of MAs and their operating procedures are subject to approval by the Technical Management Board. While registration authorities for a particular standard typically do not change, the position is not formally guaranteed and is subject to review and reassignment to a different firm or organization. In some cases, the concept of a registration authority may not exist for a standard at all.

He was one of the first men to circumnavigate the world in both directions, and later commanded a British vessel during the American Revolutionary War.  Early life  Furneaux was born at Swilly House near Stoke Damerel, Plymouth Dock, son of William Furneaux (1696-1748) of Swilly, and Susanna Wilcocks (1698-1775).Hough (1995), pages 228-229 He entered the Royal Navy and was employed on the French and African coasts and in the West Indies during the latter part of the Seven Years' War (1760‚Äì1763). He served as second lieutenant of under Captain Samuel Wallis on the latter's voyage round the globe (August 1766 ‚Äì May 1768) and due to Wallis being ill and confined to his cabin, Furneaux was the first European to set foot on Tahiti, hoisting a pennant, turning a turf, and taking possession of the land in the name of His Majesty (25 June 1767).  Service with Cook  In November 1771, Furneaux was given command of HMS , which accompanied James Cook (in ) on his second voyage. On this expedition Furneaux was twice separated from his leader (8 February 1773 to 19 May 1773; and 22 October 1773 to 14 July 1774, the date of his return to England). On the former occasion he explored a great part of the south and east coasts of Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), and made the earliest British chart of the same. Unfortunately he mapped several place names incorrectly. He glimpsed the opening to D'Entrecasteaux Channel and thought that was Storm Bay. He thought he had rounded Cape Pillar and was on the east coast just south of Cape Frederick Hendrik, whereas he had turned left one stop early and was at Bruny Island, where he named Adventure Bay for his ship. The cape to his north he assumed to be Cape Frederick Hendrik, with Frederick Hendrik Bay on the other side of it - so put both names on his chart. Off to the north-east, Furneaux could see where Maria Island should be, but there seemed to be a few extras, so he changed the name to Maria Isles.Captain Furneaux's Narrative, with some Account of Van Diemen's Land. http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1306441h.htmlSketch of Van Diemen Land, National Library of Australia Map nk-2456-50 Most of his names here survive; Cook, visiting the shore-line on his third voyage, confirmed Furneaux's account and delineation of it, with certain minor criticisms and emendations, and named after him the Furneaux Group at the eastern entrance to Bass Strait, and the group now known as the Low Archipelago. After Adventure was finally separated from Resolution off New Zealand in October 1773, Furneaux returned home alone, bringing with him Omai of Ulaietea (Raiatea). This first South Sea Islander to travel to Great Britain returned to Tahiti with Cook on 12 August 1777.  Later commands  Furneaux was made a navigator in 1775. During the American Revolutionary War, he commanded HMS Syren in the British attack of 28 June 1776 upon Charleston, South Carolina. Syren, with Furneaux in command, was wrecked near Point Judith, Rhode Island on 6 November 1777.Winfield (2007) The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) has published a detailed history of the Syren's activities in the American Revolution, as well as some of the original documents related to her loss, confirming 6 November as the correct date. By 10 November Furneaux and his crew were prisoners in Providence, Rhode Island, awaiting later exchange. RIMAP has also noted that the Syren is one of at least five ships associated with Captain Cook and his circumnavigating men with an historical connection to the State of Rhode Island. Furneaux died unmarried in 1781 and was buried in Stoke Damerel Church where he had been christened.

It is covered by ANSI/NISO standard Z39.50, and ISO standard 23950. The standard's maintenance agency is the Library of Congress. Z39.50 is widely used in library environments, often incorporated into integrated library systems and personal bibliographic reference software. Interlibrary catalogue searches for interlibrary loan are often implemented with Z39.50 queries. Work on the Z39.50 protocol began in the 1970s, and led to successive versions in 1988, 1992, 1995 and 2003. The Contextual Query Language (formerly called the Common Query Language)CQL: the Contextual Query Language: Specifications SRU: Search/Retrieval via URL, Standards, Library of Congress is based on Z39.50 semantics.  Search syntax  The protocol supports search, retrieval, sort, and browse. Search queries contain attributes, typically from the bib-1 attribute set which defines six attributes to specify information searches on the server computer: use, relation, position, structure, truncation, completeness. The syntax of Z39.50 allows for very complex queries. In practice, the functional complexity is limited by the uneven implementations by developers and commercial vendors. The syntax of Z39.50 is abstracted from the underlying database structure. For example, if the client specifies an author search using attribute 1003, the server must determine how to map that search to the indexes it contains. This allows Z39.50 queries to be formulated without knowing anything about the target database, but it also means that results for the same query can vary widely among different servers. One server may have an author index and another may use its index of personal names, whether they are authors or not. A third may have no name index and fall back on its keyword index, and yet another may have no suitable index and return an error. An attempt to remedy the inconsistency is the Bath Profile (named after Bath, England, where the working group first met in 1999). This document rigidly specifies the search syntax to employ for common bibliographic searches, and the expected response of Bath-compliant servers. Implementation of the Bath Profile has been slow but is gradually improving the Z39.50 landscape. The Bath Profile is maintained by Library and Archives Canada.  Modernization efforts  Z39.50 is a pre-Web technology, and various working groups are attempting to update it to fit better into the modern environment. These attempts fall under the designation ZING (Z39.50 International: Next Generation), and pursue various strategies. The successors to Z39.50 are the twin protocols SRU/SRW (Search/Retrieve via URL/Search/Retrieve Web service), which drop the Z39.50 communications protocol (replacing it with HTTP) while still attempting to preserve the benefits of the query syntax. SRU is REST-based, and enables queries to be expressed in URL query strings; SRW uses SOAP. Both expect search results to be returned as XML. These projects have a much lower barrier to entry for developers than the original Z39.50 protocol, allowing the relatively small market for library software to benefit from the web service tools developed for much larger markets.

Worrall is a small rural village in the civil parish of Bradfield within the boundary of the City of Sheffield. It stands in an elevated position at a height of approximately 230 metres and is north west of Sheffield City Centre. The village has an area of 233 hectares and a population of 1,306 in 2006.Sheffield Council Neighbourhood Profile for Worrall. At the time of the 2011 Census this village fell within the Stannington ward of the City. Gives details of population and area of village. Although a distinct village, Worrall has tenuous borders with the Sheffield suburbs of Wadsley, Middlewood and Loxley to the south and east and with the adjoining village of Oughtibridge to the north; to the west is a rural area extending out towards the village of High Bradfield. History The origins of Worrall go back to Viking times as the names of Towngate Road and Lund Road indicate. Also it is sited away from existing Anglo-Saxon villages such as Wadsley and this was quite common for many Viking settlements. There is no evidence of Anglo-Saxon activity in Worrall. It had its roots in farming and was mentioned in records as part of a manor which also included the areas of Ughill and Wadsley. The manor was held by the Saxon chief Aldene and included 14 bovates of land and an open woodland, a mile square. The villages name derives from the Saxon word Hrivfull meaning \\"top\\" and this would certainly apply to Worrall's lofty position above the Don and Loxley valleys. After the Norman Conquest Worrall was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being part of the land held by Roger de Busli. Throughout its history Worrall was closely connected with the nearby village of Wadsley which lies two km to the SW. A certain Geoffrey (\\"of Worrell\\") de la Pole, c,1430-1474, is believed to have been associated with Worrall. In 1541 Henry Everingham was named as lord of the manor of both villages in a charter which granted relief from paying certain duties as long as tenants paid their annual rent. The manor of Worrall was transferred to the ownership of Robert Swyft in 1557 and then to Sir Francis Leake before passing into the estates of the Earl of Shrewsbury. In the 18th century the Stead family estate owned properties in Worrall; at his death Thomas Stead (1728‚Äì93) owned 16 properties and in various parts of Hallamshire and Sheffield. Throughout this period Worrall was predominantly a farming community. Worrall developed some small-scale industry at the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when some small Little Mester workshops were set up to make cutlery and knives. Nearby Wadsley had a reputation for making pocket knives and Worrall found it easier to trade with Wadsley than with the more distant Sheffield. Ganister mining and quarrying were other industries that grew in the area. Quarrying developed from the middle of the 17th century when there was an expansion of farming in the area and farmhouses and cottages needed to be built for the workers. The biggest quarry in the area was the Middlewood quarry off Mowson Lane which was owned by George Turner. Local historian Joe Castle has suggested that stone from this quarry was used to build the Wicker Arches in Sheffield. The quarry closed at the start of World War II and is now a new housing development. There were three ganister mines in the immediate Worrall area. The Yews Mine and the Langhouse Mine were owned by Charles Bramall, while the Stubbin Mine was owned by the Oughtibridge Silica Firebrick Company and was the last to close in November 1927. The Bramall Company owned 2 silica brickworks in the area - Birtin Works and Caledonia Works, both had closed by 1927. Present day Today Worrall is mostly a residential village with a mixture of new and older housing. Most of its working residents commute to their jobs in Sheffield and other areas. There is a higher proportion of older people in the village compared to the rest of Sheffield with 32% of the population aged between 45 and 64. 87% of the houses in Worrall are owner occupied, a high figure compared to the 60% average for Sheffield as a whole.NHS Worrall Neighbourhood Profile. There are still several farms on the periphery of the village but farming is much reduced from the 19 farms that existed in the immediate area in the 1930s. Some such as Lund Farm, Grange Farm and The Yews Farm have been sold for housing development in recent years. The last farm to operate in the centre of Worrall is the Wiggan dairy farm on Towngate Road. Sycamore Park is a public recreation area off Briarfields Road in the village; it is 1.4 hectares (3.46 acres) in area and has a playground, mini football pitch, cycle track and picnic benches. Sheffield Council website Gives details of Sycamore Park. Significant buildings Worrall Hall Farm (right) and Worrall Hall (left). There are two public houses in the village. The Blue Ball is believed to have been originally two cottages which were connected at some time to make bigger premises. There is no documented date of origin although it was registered as a public house in the Sheffield Directory in 1851. The Shoulder of Mutton was formerly farm buildings but has been a pub since at least 1817, it was modernised in the 1980s. Worrall Independent Chapel dates from 1878 and has a foundation stone inscribed \\"This stone was laid by John Wycliffe Wilson of Sheffield July 15th 1878\\". Worrall National school was founded in 1848 and eventually closed in 1966 with the pupils being transferred to Oughtibridge Primary School; the old school house is now a private residence. Bradfield School, a secondary school for pupils aged between 11 and 16 was built in 1957 on Kirk Edge Road as it leaves the village; there are approximately 1,000 pupils at the school. Worrall Hall situated on Kirk Edge Road is the oldest building in Worrall but it has three distinct sections all of different time periods. The west wing dates from the 16th century while the central section has a date stone of 1720; the eastern section dates from 1820. The Hall was formerly a listed building but was taken off the list in 1985. It is a private house and has undergone renovation work in recent years after becoming run down. The adjoining Worrall Hall Farm has not been a working farm for many years. The Yews is a building located on Worrall Road as it enters the village from the SE. It dates from the 1880s and was formerly a hospital. It was owned by Sheffield Primary Care Trust and was used as offices for the Mental Health Team. Now it has been sold at auction and there is a renovation project to turn it into a ¬£1million plus valued home. The Worrall Memorial Hall is a venue for local social and fundraising activities; it is situated near the local park. Hillsborough Golf Club lies to the south of the village. The course was created in 1920 with the club house added in 1936. Worrall Male Voice Choir was formed on 7 September 1970 and is a highly respected local vocal group which is based in the village; it has a busy schedule of concerts and fund raising activities. The Monastery of The Holy Spirit, known locally as Kirk Edge convent stands two km to the west of the village. Built in 1871, it is a monastery of the Carmelite order of nuns.

He spent 50 years on radio until his retirement in 2020. Early years Ojeda was born in Jayuya. He moved to Ponce when he was still a youngster. While studying in high school, he got his first opportunity to talk live in a daily show, becoming a newscaster for Ponce's WPAB radio station. Career as a newscaster Ojeda signed a contract with WAPA in 1960, and moved to San Juan. He worked at WAPA as newscaster (and occasional disc jockey) until 1968, moving on that year to work for rival WKAQ-Radio Reloj. While there, he had to cover the historic riots at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras in 1971. In one of the incidents covered by Ojeda a shooting ensued, and Ojeda, in the middle of the shootout, rescued a police lieutenant who had been shot. Despite his efforts, the police officer died from his gunshot wounds in the back of the remote unit truck while Ojeda was broadcasting his and his driver's frantic rush to the nearest emergency room live. Ojeda was later offered a job as the news director and anchorman of Telemundo Puerto Rico's television news show. He decided, however, not to take the job, opting instead to join then governor Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n's staff, as a member of Puerto Rico's Communications Office. Ojeda needed to work as a journalist, however, and, by 1973, he decided to step in front of the television cameras for the first time, working at channel 11's news show. Not long after Ojeda joined channel 11, the channel's owner had died and the station went bankrupt, so Ojeda signed on with WAPA-TV to work as a field reporter at Noticentro 4. Ojeda spent most of his time at Noticentro 4 traveling across Puerto Rico, working as an on-the-field reporter, but he also sporadically got chances to host the show, usually filling in for a sick anchorman or woman. He worked on various tragedies, government scandals and other types of news while at Noticentro 4, essentially pioneering investigative reporting in Puerto Rican television. Ojeda, Sin Limite In 1987, he was given his own television talk show, Ojeda, Sin Limite (Ojeda, Without Limit). He became known for his strong questioning of participants of the show, and the show produced a number of classic moments of Puerto Rican television; such as the time that two of the three candidates for Puerto Rican commissioner in Washington, D.C., the PNP's Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ (former governor of Puerto Rico) and the PPD's Miguel Hernandez Agosto got into a shouting match, calling each other \\"liar\\" multiple times and almost physically assaulting each other. After his show was cancelled, Ojeda continued Ojeda, Sin Limite as a radio show, on WKAQ-Radio. Currently In 2000, he returned to television, with a show named Ojeda, once again at WAPA-TV, which, by then, had the new name of Televicentro. Later on, he was offered a fifteen-minute space on Televicentro's midday variety show, Mediod√≠a Puerto Rico (Midday Puerto Rico), where he would accept calls from the public in a segment called \\"La Descarga\\" (Discharge). Recently, in this segment Don Eleuterio, comedian Sunshine Logro√±o's alter ego, calls and changes his name trying to pass as another person from the public. Ojeda of course recognizes his voice. Don Eleuterio then usually praises the American people and picks on Ojeda for being an \\"independista\\" (an advocate of P.R.'s independence). Ojeda now collaborates on a new radio station show as well. As of May 15, 2009, Ojeda broadcast his last \\"descarga\\" and on the air tendered his resignation in response to the cancellation of the remaining local programs (Club Sunshine and TV Ilegal) and the dismissal of Junior Alvarez over comments made of mistreatment in part of the vice-president of programming, Jimmy Arteaga, of Peruvian descent. In 2013 returned to television again in Dando Candela by Telemundo. Ojeda retired in March 2020.

Published by Scott, Foresman and Company of Chicago, Illinois, the readers, which described the activities of her fictional siblings, \\"Dick,\\" \\"Jane,\\" \\"Sally,\\" and other characters, were widely used in schools in the United States and many other English-speaking countries for nearly forty years. The series, which included such titles as We Look and See, We Come and Go, We Work and Play, and Fun with Dick and Jane, among others, was marketed until 1973 and used the look-say method of teaching reading. Early life and education Zerna Addis Sharp was born on August 12, 1889, to Charles and Lottie (Smith) Sharp in Hillisburg, Clinton County, Indiana, and was the eldest of the family's five children. Zerna's father owned a general store in Hillisburg. After graduating from high school she completed a year of teacher training at Marion Normal College (Indiana Wesleyan University) in Marion, Indiana, but never earned a degree, and later attended Columbia University in New York City. (via Google Books) Career Early years Sharp began her career as an educator. She taught first-grade students for nearly a decade at elementary schools in Hillisburg, Kirklin, and La Porte, Indiana. Sharp also served as an elementary school principal. Creator of the Dick and Jane readers Sharp created the characters and concept for the Dick and Jane readers, which were widely used in classrooms in the United States and in other English-speaking countries for nearly four decades before they were replaced with other reading texts. (Reprint edition) She came up with the idea for the beginning readers for elementary school children while working as a reading consultant and textbook editor for Scott, Foresman and Company, a publisher in Chicago, Illinois. William Scott Gray (1885‚Äì1960), director of the Curriculum Foundation Series at Scott Foresman and dean of the University of Chicago's college of education, hired Sharp to develop the characters for the readers and to combine her approach with his ideas for a process of learning to read. Sharp noted the reduced reading ability of children and urged the development of a new reading format for primers; Gray's research focused on methods to improve reading instruction using content that would be of interest to children and develop their word-recognition skills. Gary and Sharp wanted children who read the books to be able to readily identify with the characters. They also wanted the characters in the stories to participate in typical activities. Before the appearance of the Dick and Jane stories, reading primers \\"generally included Bible stories or fairy tales with complicated language and few pictures.\\" Sharp was not the author or illustrator of the texts. As the creator of the Dick and Jane beginning readers, Sharp designed the format and content. She also selected the storylines from ideas that others submitted. Gray co- authored with William H. Elson the Elson Basic Readers (renamed the Elson-Gray Basic Readers in 1936), which Scott Foresman published in Chicago, Illinois. The \\"Dick\\" and \\"Jane\\" characters, created by Sharp, made their debut in the series in 1930. After the Elson-Gray series ended in 1940, Sharp's characters continued in a subsequent series of primary readers that were better known as the \\"Dick and Jane\\" readers. Sharp worked with Gray to create the characters and primary readers that incorporated his input and used the whole-word or look-say method of word recognition (also called sight reading). The look-say method used a controlled vocabulary and taught readers to memorize the words through repetition, placing limited emphasis on teaching phonics. Teacher guides accompanying the texts also encouraged adoption of the whole-word (look-say) method of identifying the meaning of words from the illustrations and repeating words introduced in the text. Content developer Sharp felt that the watercolor illustrations and texts should work together to provide stories that young readers would relate to and help them learn to read more easily. The text introduced a repetitive pattern of words; the illustrations provided visual reinforcements to help students understand the meaning of the words. Sharp suggested that primers introduce to new readers only one new word on each page and only five new words in each individual story. The Dick and Jane primers adhered to this format. Sharp worked with illustrator Eleanor B. Campbell, who did most of the illustrations for the Dick and Jane readers, and others to produce and edit the content. In addition, Sharp named the characters in the stories and supervised the layout and illustrations. Sharp, who married, referred to the two main characters, \\"Dick\\" and \\"Jane,\\" as her children. These names were chosen because they were easy to sound out. To make sure language in the texts were authentic, Sharp also observed children playing and listened to their speech patterns. The Dick and Jane reading series taught reading as well as American middle-class values to school-aged children. The storylines that Sharp selected described the lives and experiences of a stereotypical American middle-class, white family in a two- parent suburban home that included three children and two pets. \\"Father\\" wore a suit, worked in an office, mowed the lawn, and washed the car. \\"Mother\\" stayed at home, did housework, and raised the children. \\"Dick,\\" the oldest of the family's three children, was active and well-behaved. \\"Jane,\\" the second oldest child, was pretty and carefree. She also helped care for the youngest sibling, a baby sister named \\"Sally.\\" The family dog was named \\"Spot;\\" their cat was named \\"Puff.\\" The fictional family's suburban home was surrounded with a white picket fence. Because the readers were made for nationwide distribution, the text and illustrations intentionally lacked references to specific regional geography such as mountains, rivers, lakes, plains, or the seashore. Response to criticisms The Dick and Jane readers, which included titles such as We Look and See, We Come and Go, We Work and Play, and Fun with Dick and Jane, among others, monopolized the market for several decades and reached the height of their popularity in the 1950s, when 80 percent of first-grade students in the United States were learning to read though the Dick and Jane stories. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, critics of the Dick and Jane readers began to point out its stereotypes; concerns about class, gender, and racial bias; and errors in content and illustrations. Increasing social changes, including the civil rights movement in the 1960s, also made the characters of \\"Dick and Jane seem increasingly irrelevant to some.\\" Sharp, who was proud of the series and objected to the harsh criticism, replied, \\"That's all an adult's viewpoint.\\" Later years Scott Foreman made changes in their readers in the 1960s in an effort to keep the stories relevant, updating the series every five years. The 1965 edition, the last of the Dick and Jane series, introduced the first African American family as characters in a first-grade reader. The family included two parents and their three children: a son, \\"Mike,\\" and twin daughters, \\"Pam\\" and \\"Penny.\\" Although the Dick and Jane series of primers continued to be sold until 1973, and were used in some classroom throughout the 1970s, they were replaced with other reading texts and gradually disappeared from use in schools. In her retirement Sharp traveled and remained active in the education field. She divided her time between California and Indiana, where she established a home in her later years at Frankfort. Death and legacy Sharp died at Wesley Manor nursing home in Frankfort, Indiana, on June 17, 1981, at the age of ninety-one. Her remains are interred at a local cemetery. Sharp's legacy was the Dick and Jane readers of the mid-twentieth century, the successors to the phonics-based McGuffey Readers that were popular from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. In 1967, two years after Scott Foresman retired the Dick and Jane series, the company introduced its Open Highways series, which included heavily illustrated classic children's stories and poems, as well as placing greater emphasis on multicultural content and phonics training in its subsequent readers. The Dick and Jane primers that Sharp edited, which were well known for their simple narrative text and watercolor illustrations, taught reading to millions of students for four decades. Despite the challenges and criticisms of these readers, their content, and the look-say format they used to teach reading, Sharp's characters of \\"Dick,\\" \\"Jane,\\" and \\"Sally\\" became household words and the primers became icons of mid-century American culture, as well as collectors' items.

She has published a dozen books of essays and memoirs, and she was an editor of and contributor to the literary quarterly \\"en-taxi \\". Her best-selling memoir Inochi (ÂëΩ, \\"Life\\") was made into a movie, also titled Inochi. Yu's first novel, a semiautobiographical work titled Ishi ni Oyogu Sakana (Áü≥„Å´Ê≥≥„ÅêÈ≠ö, \\"The Fish Swimming in the Stone\\") published in the September 1994 issue of the literary journal Shinch≈ç, became the focus of a legal and ethical controversy. The model for one of the novel's main characters--and the person referred to indirectly by the title--objected to her depiction in the story. The publication of the novel in book form was blocked by court order, and some libraries restricted access to the magazine version. After a prolonged legal fight and widespread debate over the rights of authors, readers, and publishers versus individuals' rights to privacy, a revised version of the novel was published in 2002. Yu has experienced racist backlash to her work because of her ethnic background, with some events at bookstores being canceled due to bomb threats. After the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami Yu began to travel to the affected areas often, and from March 16, 2012, she hosted a weekly radio show called \\"Yu Miri no Futari to Hitori\\" (Êü≥ÁæéÈáå„ÅÆ‰∫å‰∫∫„Å®‰∏Ä‰∫∫, \\"Yu Miri's Two People and One Person\\") on a temporary emergency broadcasting station called Minamis≈çma Hibari FM, based in Minamis≈çma, Fukushima. Her book \\"Tokyo Ueno Station\\" reflects her engagement with historical memory and margins by incorporating themes of a migrant laborer from northeastern Japan and his work on Olympic construction sites in Tokyo, as well as the March 11, 2011 disaster. Since April 2015, Yu has lived in Minamis≈çma, Fukushima. In 2018, she opened a bookstore called Full House and a theatre space called LaMaMa ODAKA at her home in Odaka District. She has one son.

He is also the father of Dai Qing (), a leading activist. Fu Daqing was born in 1900 in Linchuan, Jiangxi province. Having lost his father at an early age, the young Daqing was brought up by his mother, a school teacher. After graduating from a missionary-run high school with fluency in English, he travelled to Shanghai to continue his education. In Shanghai, he read the newspaper New Youth and met Chen Duxiu, co-founder of the Communist Party of China. Whilst learning Russian at the Institute of Foreign Languages, Fu joined the Socialist Youth Brigade of China in 1920. The next year he travelled by sea to study at the Eastern University in Moscow with Liu Shaoqi and others. In Moscow Fu took the Russian name Federov and later joined the Communist Party of China. In the summer of 1924, after returning from Moscow, Fu worked for Sun Yatsen's government in Guangdong as a translator for the Soviet agent Mikhail Borodin. He was active at the Whampoa Military Academy and first participated in military operations in 1925. The following year Fu joined the Northern Expedition. After the abortive Nanchang Uprising, Fu Daqing returned to his native Linchuan to engage in propaganda work among the people. In December 1927, he participated in a failed Communist uprising in Guangzhou, after which he fled to Hong Kong. Fu went on to visit Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Burma and the Philippines. On 29 April 1930 Fu Daqing co-founded the South Seas Communist Party (predecessor to the Communist parties of Indochina, Malaya and Siam) with Ho Chi Minh and eighteen others. Later he became a propaganda officer for the party, co-editing The Malayan Worker. The British authorities had him arrested and deported back to China, where he was imprisoned firstly at Guangzhou and then at Shanghai by the Kuomintang. At the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was released from gaol. Fu Daqing made his way to Wuhan where he worked for the Communist Eighth Route Army. After the fall of Wuhuan in 1938 he moved to Guiyang and Guilin to engage in anti-Japanese propaganda. Later he moved to Yan'an, where he translated Carl von Clausewitz's classic treatise On War into Chinese, receiving praise from Communist commanders Zhu De and Ye Jianying. In 1940 Fu Daqing met Yang Jie (), a female colleague in Chongqing, and the two began living together. The couple married on New Year's Day 1941. In June 1941 he was dispatched by the Central Committee to Beiping to engage in propaganda activities and underground communication with the Comintern. Two months later, Yang Jie gave birth to a daughter, Dai Qing. The family was reunited at the end of the year in Beiping. On July 23, 1944, both Fu and his wife were captured by the Imperial Japanese Army. He was executed sometime before the end of World War II. The Communist Party of China only learned of this from captured Japanese archives. Having held no official position in the Communist Party, Fu Daqing is best remembered for his expertise in linguistics. He spoke English, Russian, Malay as well as a number of Chinese dialects, including Cantonese and Hainanese. Fu's daughter Dai Qing was later adopted by his good friend Ye Jianying.

As of 2005, the term FSMO has been deprecated in favour of operations masters. FSMO is a specialized domain controller (DC) set of tasks, used where standard data transfer and update methods are inadequate. AD normally relies on multiple peer DCs, each with a copy of the AD database, being synchronized by multi-master replication. The tasks which are not suited to multi-master replication and are viable only with a single-master database are the FSMOs.  FSMO roles  Per-domain roles These roles are applicable at the domain level (i.e., there is one of each for every domain in a forest): * The PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller) - This role is the most used of all FSMO roles and has the widest range of functions. The domain controller that holds the PDC Emulator role is crucial in a mixed environment where Windows NT 4.0 BDCs are still present. This is because the PDC Emulator role emulates the functions of a Windows NT 4.0 PDC. Even if all Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers have been migrated to Windows 2000 or later, the domain controller that holds the PDC Emulator role still does a lot. The PDC Emulator is the domain source for time synchronization for all other domain controllers; in a multi-domain forest, the PDC Emulator in each domain synchronizes to the forest root PDC Emulator. All other domain member computers synchronize to their respective domain controllers. It is critically important that computer clocks are synchronized across the forest because excessive clock skew causes Kerberos authentication to fail. In addition, all password changes occur on the PDC Emulator and receive priority replication. * The RID Master - (Relative ID) This FSMO role owner is the single DC responsible for processing RID Pool requests from all DCs within a given domain. It is also responsible for moving an object from one domain to another during an interdomain object move. When a DC creates a security principal object such as a user or group, it attaches a unique SID to the object. This SID consists of a domain SID (the same for all SIDs created in a domain) and a relative ID (RID) that is unique for each security principal SID created in a domain. Each DC in a domain is allocated a pool of RIDs that it is allowed to assign to the security principals it creates. When a DC's allocated RID pool falls below a threshold, that DC issues a request for additional RIDs to the domain's RID Master FSMO role owner, the RID Master FSMO role owner responds to the request by retrieving RIDs from the domain's unallocated RID pool and assigns them to the pool of the requesting DC. * The Infrastructure Master - The purpose of this role is to ensure that cross- domain object references are correctly handled. For example, if a user from one domain is added to a security group from a different domain, the Infrastructure Master makes sure this is done properly. However, if the Active Directory deployment has only a single domain, then the Infrastructure Master role does no work at all, and even in a multi-domain environment it is rarely used except when complex user administration tasks are performed. This applies to the domain partition (default naming context) only. netdom query fsmo and ntdsutil will only query the domain partition. However, every application partition, including Forest and Domain-level DNS domain zones has its own Infrastructure Master. The holder of this role is stored in the fSMORoleOwner attribute of the Infrastructure object in the root of the partition, it can be modified with ADSIEdit, for example one can modify the fSMORoleOwner attribute of the CN=Infrastructure,DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=yourdomain,DC=tld object to CN=NTDSSettings,CN=Name_of_DC,CN=Servers,CN=DRSite,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=Yourdomain,DC=TLD. per-forest roles These roles are unique at the forest level (both are located in the forest root domain): * The Schema Master - The purpose of this role is to replicate schema changes to all other domain controllers in the forest. Since the schema of Active Directory is rarely changed, however, the Schema Master role will rarely do any work. This role is typically involved in the deployment of Exchange Server and Skype for Business Server, as well as domain controllers from one version to another version, as all of these situations involve making changes to the Active Directory schema. * The Domain Naming Master - The other forest-specific FSMO role is the Domain Naming Master, and this role also resides in the forest root domain. The Domain Naming Master role processes all changes to the namespace, for example adding the child domain vancouver.mycompany.com to the forest root domain mycompany.com requires that this role be available. Failure of this role to function correctly can prevent the addition of a new child domain or new domain tree.  Moving FSMO roles between domain controllers  By default AD assigns all operations master roles to the first DC created in a forest. To provide fault tolerance, there should be multiple domain controllers available within each domain of the Forest. If new domains are created in the forest, the first DC in a new domain holds all of the domain-wide FSMO roles. This is not a satisfactory position if the domain has a large number of domain controllers. Microsoft recommends the careful division of FSMO roles, with standby DCs ready to take over each role. The PDC emulator and the RID master should be on the same DC, if possible. The Schema Master and Domain Naming Master should also be on the same DC. When a FSMO role is transferred to a different DC, the original FSMO holder and the new FSMO holder communicate to ensure no data is lost during the transfer. If the original FSMO holder experienced an unrecoverable failure, another DC can be made to seize the lost roles; however, there is a risk of data loss because of the lack of communications. Seizing roles from a domain controller instead of transferring it prevents that domain controller from hosting that FSMO role again, except for the PDC Emulator and Infrastructure Master Operation roles. Corruption can occur within Active Directory. FSMO roles can be easily moved between DCs using the AD snap-ins to the MMC or using \`ntdsutil\`, which is a command line- based tool.  FSMO Roles and Global Catalog  Certain FSMO roles depend on the DC being a Global Catalog (GC) server as well. When a Forest is initially created, the first Domain Controller is a Global Catalog server by default. The Global Catalog provides several functions. The GC stores object data information, manages queries of these data objects and their attributes as well as provides data to allow network logon. Often all domain controllers are also global catalog servers. If this is not the case, the Infrastructure Master role must not be housed on a domain controller which also houses a copy of the global catalog in a multi-domain forest, as the combination of these two roles on the same host will cause unexpected (and potentially damaging) behaviour in a multi-domain environment. However, The Domain Naming Master role should be housed on a DC which is also a GC.

He was one of the best known Hungarian and Central European writers of his era. He has been called a \\"leading figure of 20th century Hungarian literature\\", his books being considered to be significant contributions to postwar literature. Biography Esterh√°zy was born in Budapest on 14 April 1950, the eldest son of M√°ty√°s Esterh√°zy de Gal√°ntha (1919‚Äì1998) (Count Esterh√°zy until 1947, when all titles and ranks were abolished)The Statute IV of 1947, which is still in force in Hungary, declares the abolition of hereditary noble ranks and related styles and titles, also putting a ban on their use. and Magdolna M√°nyoki (1916‚Äì1980). His paternal grandfather was Count M√≥ric Esterh√°zy (1881‚Äì1960), who briefly served as Prime Minister of Hungary in 1917. Through his paternal grandmother Countess Margit K√°rolyi (1896‚Äì1975), one of his ancestors was Count Gyula K√°rolyi (1871‚Äì1947), also Prime Minister from 1931 to 1932. P√©ter had three younger brothers, including international football player M√°rton Esterh√°zy (born 1956). Esterh√°zy was educated as a mathematician and began to write in the 1970s. He is perhaps best known outside of his native country for Celestial Harmonies (Harmonia Caelestis, 2000) which chronicles his forefathers' epic rise during the Austro-Hungarian empire to their dispossession under communism. His next novel, Revised Edition or Corrected Version (Jav√≠tott kiad√°s, 2002), which appeared as an appendix to the former work, deals with his realisation that his father was an informer for the secret police during the communist era. After the regime change in 1989, P√©ter Esterh√°zy refused to accept the return of any land or valuables nationalized by the communists. Many of his other works also deal with the experience of living under a communist regime and in a post-communist country. He wrote in a style that can be characterised as postmodernist and his prose was described by John Updike as \\"jumpy, allusive, and slangy. ...there is vividness, an electric crackle. The sentences are active and concrete. Physical details leap from the murk of emotional ambivalence\\". In an obituary published by Reuters, his literary technique is described as \\"Employing a stop-and-go rhythm, his writing concentrated on twists and surprises rather than straight narrative lines, combining personal experiences with references, quotes and all shades of jokes from sarcasm to toilet humor, sometimes including texts of other authors.\\" His works have been published in more than 20 languages. He was awarded several literary distinctions in Hungary, including the prestigious Kossuth Prize in 1996, and has received awards for his work in France, Austria, Germany, Slovenia and Poland. He was highly critical of the authoritarian tendencies of Viktor Orb√°n's administration, declaring that \\"Orb√°n is not a statesman\\" and that \\"the Orb√°n system is damaging to Hungary. Our Democracy is not liberal, freedom of the press is limited, and the division of power is inadequate.\\" He was married to Margit Re√©n, and had four children. In October 2015, it became public knowledge that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer. He died on 14 July 2016.

The term parking attendant is sometimes considered a synonym but sometimes used to refer to the different profession of parking lot attendant. In the United States, even where parking meters are no longer used, the term \\"meter maid\\" is often still used to refer to female PEOs.American Heritage DictionaryEntry for \\"meter maid\\" in the Random House Dictionary, 2011. Other duties On 9 December 2007, the mayor of Stockholm, Mikael S√∂derlund, announced that the tasks of the parking enforcement officers will be broadened to include fining graffiti vandals and litterers. Trade union representatives say these officers are not prepared to take on new tasks, already stretched by metering vehicles, and that they fear the risk of violence. Those authorities in England that invested in vehicles with onboard computer and camera equipment have also begun policing bus lanes. With the combination of the role of parking attendants in some areas of Great Britain into that of civil enforcement officers, many now routinely issue fixed penalties for such offences as littering, public drinking, anti-social behaviour and noise violations in addition to dealing with nuisance parking offences which previously escaped the attention of parking attendants as they contravened legislation other than the Road Traffic Act 1991. Nevertheless, the National Careers Service does not list any of these new tasks. Parking wardens in New Zealand are also empowered by law to enforce the use of special vehicle lanes, such as bus and transit lanes.http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1998/0110/latest/DLM3812421.html By country  Canada  In Canada, parking enforcement duties are frequently handled under the umbrella of bylaw enforcement by bylaw enforcement officers. No jurisdictions remain where persons employed for the purpose of enforcing traffic bylaws are referred to as \\"meter maids\\" and increasingly fewer offices of \\"parking enforcement officer\\" exist. Most officials once employed as PEOs are now utilized to perform a variety of bylaw enforcement duties, often including animal control or the enforcement of other bylaws. The position is increasingly upgraded to that of the more professional position of bylaw enforcement officer. Common duties of bylaw enforcement officers include parking enforcement, property and zoning regulation, and regulation of general conduct of persons in public. Bylaw officers, however, only have the power to issue civil citations as such as penalties for most municipal bylaw violations. The cities of Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver still employ officials with the title of parking enforcement officer. In the case of Montreal and Toronto, PEOs are a sub-division of their respective police force : the Montreal SPVM (where they are nicknamed \\"green onions\\" due to their formerly green uniforms) and the Toronto Police Service (where they have been nicknamed 'blue hornets' because of their blue uniform stripe, which is red on police officers' uniforms). In Vancouver's case, PEOs are employees of the municipal government, not affiliated with the Vancouver Police Department. Canadian parking enforcement officers are de facto peace officers while in the performance of their duties and inasmuch as that designation is required for the performance of their duties, even if they are not sworn officers or constables. Case law has upheld this legal interpretation. See bylaw enforcement officer for case-law excerpts. This means that assault on a Canadian parking enforcement officer or bylaw officer conducting traffic bylaw enforcement is punishable under the Criminal Code of Canada as assault on a peace officer and carries higher penalties than standard assault. In some areas in Canada, parking enforcement services are subcontracted to a private organization, such as the Canadian Corps of Commissionaires. However these facilities are usually privately owned parking lots and garage. Although some large municipalities have long standing agreements. Toronto is deploying traffic wardens to help with congestion at major intersections in the city beginning in early 2018.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-traffic- wardens-new-measures-john-tory-announcement-1.4294534 Their focus is to expedite flow of cars and pedestrians at problem intersections, where they will replace use of Toronto police officers in the same role. Indonesia An Indonesian Traffic Warden (Dishub) In Indonesia, traffic wardens or also known as parking enforcement officers are under the Ministry of Transportation and are known as Dinas Perhubungan abbreviated \\"Dishub\\" or Dinas Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan Raya abbreviated \\"LLAJR\\" (Road Traffic and Transportation Agency). Besides enforcing parking regulations, they also assist the traffic police in directing traffic and enforce law and regulations towards public transportation vehicles such as public buses, taxis, trucks, etc. which use yellow license plates. They are usually stationed in public transportation terminals and posted at various roadways of the country and wear light blue as their uniform.  Ireland  In the Republic of Ireland, parking enforcement officer are employed by councils to enforce laws relating to the parking and stopping of motor vehicles. They were introduced by the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975. Under the Road Traffic Acts, traffic wardens are empowered to issue on the spot parking tickets and fines for non-display for a tax disc. It is an offence to refuse to provide your name and address when demanded to do so by a traffic warden.  New Zealand  In New Zealand, a local authority may appoint a person to hold the office of parking warden. Parking wardens have jurisdiction on a public road within the local authority's region, and are warranted upon appointment to enforce parking offences and special vehicle lane offences. The fines for various parking offences are considerably lower than many other places around the world, with fines as low as $12 for minor offences. However, abuse and violence against officers is common, resulting in some councils adopting body worn cameras for them. Parking wardens may direct people to remove their vehicle off a public road if it causes an obstruction on the road or to any vehicle entrance, or if it is desirable in the interests of road safety or the interests of the Public. They can also (for the reasons just mentioned) authorize the towing of vehicles on a public road. Similar to Ireland, it is an offence in certain circumstances if the driver or person in charge of a vehicle refuses to provide their details when required to do so by a parking warden. The term 'parking warden' is considered to be a misnomer, as they deal with matters more than just parking, especially as the law also empowers them to enforce certain moving violations, such as unauthorised use of a special vehicle lane. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom (UK), traffic wardens have historically, since the 1960s,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34203585 been employed by the territorial police force to help with traffic management and parking regulations. Now 'Parking Attendants' and 'Civil Enforcement Officers' are used by local authorities to pursue decriminalised parking enforcement and thus almost everywhere replaced the \\"traffic warden\\", who was part of a police force. Public Perception Accusations of overzealousness on the part of parking attendants is likely due to high pressure management focused around delivering a certain number of tickets per day, leading to allegations of corruption and illegality. This brings accusations that their real purpose is to raise revenue for the local authority rather than keep the traffic moving. Those who receive fines argue that the \\"punishment does not fit the crime,\\" pointing to the size of fines levied for minor parking violations in comparison with fines generally issued for more serious motoring offences or other offences such as shoplifting. Public dislike of parking attendants in the UK is such that some parking attendants have been stabbed, received death threats, and been issued stab- proof vests and cotton swabs to take DNA samples when members of the public spit on them, for later prosecution. Enforcement of laws dealing with the parking of motor vehicles in the UK can be the responsibility of one or more of the following persons: Public *Civil enforcement officers (England, Wales, Scotland), including those previously known as parking attendants (whose duties might still be limited to parking contraventions or might now be extended to other road traffic contraventions where a local authority has chosen to do so),s.76 Traffic Management Act 2004 are employed by local authorities or a contractor providing their services to a local authority. Since the advent of decriminalised parking enforcement, they have largely replaced [police] traffic wardens as the primary enforcers of parking regulations. They have the power to issue penalty charge notices (PCNs) for parking contraventions dealt with by ss.63-79 Road Traffic Act 1991; in areas where their duties have been extended beyond that of a parking attendant they can also issue PCNs for parking offences coming under other legislation such as e.g. parking a vehicle entirely on a footway or the parking of a detached vehicle trailer or skip. *Traffic attendants (Northern Ireland) issue parking offence penalty charge notices (i.e. a civil penalty not a criminal penalty) for the Roads Service using powers under the Traffic Management (Northern Ireland) Order 2005. *Traffic wardens are employees of police forces and are primarily responsible for controlling traffic in general using powers available to authorised persons defined in the Road Traffic Act 1988. Their usage for parking enforcement is far less common since the advent of decriminalised parking enforcement which in many areas transferred the enforcement of offences concerning simple parking in controlled areas to local authorities; other parking offences such as any involving penalty points and/or those not involving the 1991 Act (or equivalent in Northern Ireland) remain enforceable by traffic wardens. Traffic wardens in the Metropolitan Police could be promoted to traffic warden supervisor, traffic warden controller, senior traffic warden controller, and area traffic warden controller. Most \\"traffic wardens\\" are now non-existent and have, in almost all areas, been replaced by local authority civil enforcement officers/parking wardens/parking attendants etc.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34203585 *Traffic officers of the former Highways Agency and current Highways England (England and Wales) operate under the Traffic Management Act 2004 and have various powers to deal with vehicles on a \\"relevant road\\" (chiefly motorways and trunk roads) which on other roads would be dealt with as parking offences by police or local authorities; this includes the power to remove such vehicles. The power to deal with a parking offence on a highway generally remains available to a police constable. Private *Private parking enforcement agents (England and Wales) - landowners and private car park owners within England are increasingly using private parking enforcement companies and individuals to impose 'Penalty Charge Notices' (Often abbreviated to PCN although not to be confused with Parking Charge Notices which are issued to Civil enforcement officers) for infringements such as parking outside marked bays or over staying limited duration. The British Parking Association (BPA) act as the industry body for parking operators. Landowners and agents who pursue private parking charges through the courts do so on the basis of trespass the BPA issue guidance to facilitate this through the use of onsite signage. The BPA's Approved Operator Scheme Code of Practice (a guide for its members who operate enforcement in private car parks), section 27.1, says that: In popular culture The term 'meter maid' was popularised in The Beatles' song \\"Lovely Rita\\", in which the male singer, smitten with a female traffic warden, recalls: :Standing by a parking meter, when I caught a glimpse of Rita :Filling in a ticket in her little white book. :In a cap, she looked much older, :And the bag across her shoulder :Made her look a little like a military man. : Lovely Rita meter maid, : May I inquire discreetly, : When are you free to take some tea with me? On the NBC television comedy series Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, cast member Barbara Sharma was often featured as an overzealous meter maid (spelled Metre Made) who would ticket anything from baby carriages to trash cans. The A&E; reality television show Parking Wars focuses on parking enforcement.

Between 798 and 802 the Franks established several positions in the zone: Bahlul Ibn Marzuq revolted in Zaragoza against the central government of Muslim Al-Andalus in 798, and in 800 conquered Huesca from the Banu Salama. General Amrus ibn Yusuf (born in Huesca), sent by the Amir, conquered Zaragoza and Huesca (c. 801). Bahlul fled to Pallars and was killed by his lieutenant Jalaf Ibn Rashid (802), who at the time held Barbitanya (Barbastro). With all this disturbances the Franks established control over Jaca and other castles and designated Aureolus as count of Arag√≥n. After Aureolus died in 809 the Frankish lobby secured succession for Aznar Gal√≠ndez I, but Amrus ibn Yusuf overran the county of Sobrarbe, which was not reconquered by Aznar until 814.

It is located in an undulating landscape traversed by the small streams of the River Bourne, set in a clay vale at the foot of the wooded Sevenoaks Greensand Ridge. The landscape is agricultural with dispersed groups of buildings that are almost entirely residential or used for farming purposes. The dominant characteristics of the historical landscape are thick woodland with smaller, broadleaf coppices with small to medium-sized fields enclosed by traditional boundaries of hedges or chestnut fencing. Earlier removal of some hedgerows has resulted in some larger arable fields; these are often separated by small woodland belts or shaws. The most distinctive landscape feature is The Common, also known as The Green, which is a large, open and dominant space in the centre of the village. To the south of the village, on each side of the A227 is Hoad Common. Before the last war Hoad Common was an attractive lightly treed open space popular with visitors but is now neglected and is rapidly deteriorating into scrubby woodland. The parish is situated in the Metropolitan Green Belt and is an area designated as a Special Landscape Area. The central village, including the pub, the church, the village school and The Common, is within a Conservation Area. Much of the village lies within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. St Giles' Church continues to serve as a place of worship, but nowadays also doubles up, every Thursday morning, as the venue for the local farmers' market. Conservation Bulletin, the English Heritage publication: issue 61, Summer 2009. The Fairlawne Estate The Fairlawne Estate is a 1,000 acre landed-estate which stretches from Shipbourne into neighbouring Plaxtol. It is currently owned by the Saudi Arabian horse-breeder, Prince Khalid Abdullah.Britten, Nick. \\"'Little village bumpkins‚Äô defeat Saudi prince in fight for Shipbourne footpath rights\\", The Daily Telegraph, 26 November 2011. Retrieved 22 March 2015. Vane Family: In Stuart times, the estate was the property of Sir Henry Vane the Elder, Secretary of State to Charles I. Sir Henry was created Lord-Lieutenant of Durham and the family later became one of the leading families in that county too. Sir Henry's eldest son, also called Harry and also knighted, became Governor of Massachusetts in 1635. Sir Henry Vane the Younger made valiant attempts to remain on the winning side during the difficult period of the English Civil War, but is probably noted for his inept handling of the aspiration: he had been a Royalist but then became a Roundhead, before switching back to being a Royalist under Charles I. He was executed in London after being reported as being 'too dangerous to live'. His body lies in the Vane family vault area of the crypt of Shipbourne church in an anthropoid (body shaped) lead shell coffin with many members of the Vane family. His ghost is said to wander the village. The son of one employee of the Vane family on the estate wrote a 700 verse blank poem about hop-growing. The poet Christopher Smart was born in 1722 at Fairlawne, where his father was steward.Eagle, Dorothy and Carnell, Hilary (editors), (1987) The Oxford Literary Guide to Great Britain & Ireland, p. 237. London: Spring Books, Cazalet Family: The Vane family were followed by the Cazalets. In 1880, Edward Cazalet built the church, dedicated to St Giles, plus a public house, originally named \\"The New Inn\\" and later renamed The Chaser, and several of the cottages which surround The Common. Major Peter Cazalet was the trainer of horses owned by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Many members of the Cazalet family are commemorated in the church. Shipbourne Cricket Club: Established in 1880, Shipbourne CC are one of the oldest village cricket clubs in the county. Playing upon the beautiful Fairlawne Estate, Shipbourne have 2 Saturday league sides and a friendly XI on Sundays. References External links *The Shipbourne village website.

He was known for his long residence in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and association with other literary figures there. Early life Bynner was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Thomas Edgarton Bynner and the former Annie Louise Brewer. His domineering mother separated from his alcoholic father in December 1888 and moved with her two sons to Connecticut. The father died in 1891, and in 1892 the family moved to Brookline, Massachusetts. Bynner attended Brookline High School and was editor of its literary magazine. He entered Harvard University in 1898, where he was the first member of his class invited to join the student literary magazine, The Harvard Advocate, by its editor Wallace Stevens. He was also published in another of Harvard's literary journals, The Harvard Monthly. His favorite professor was George Santayana. While a student he took on the nickname \\"Hal\\" by which his friends would know him for the rest of his life. He enjoyed theater, opera, and symphony performances in Boston, and he became involved in the suffrage movement. He graduated from Harvard with honors in 1902. His first book of poems, An Ode to Harvard (later changed to Young Harvard), came out in 1907. In 1911 he was the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Poet. New York and New Hampshire After a trip to Europe, he took a position at McClure's Magazine and worked there for four years. He had an opportunity to meet and socialize with many New York writers and artists. He next turned to independent writing and lecturing, living in Cornish, New Hampshire. In 1916 he and Arthur Davison Ficke, a friend from Harvard, were among the perpetrators of an elaborate literary hoax. They created a purported \\"Spectrist\\" school of poets, along the lines of the Imagists, but based in Pittsburgh. Spectra, a slim collection, was published under the pseudonyms of Anne Knish (Ficke) and Emanuel Morgan (Bynner). Marjorie Allen Seiffert, writing as Elijah Hay, was also part of the \\"movement\\".Smith, William Jay (1961). The Spectra Hoax. Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press. Bynner was friendly with Kahlil Gibran and introduced the writer to his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. The latter published Gibran's The Prophet in 1923, which has had a long popularity. Gibran drew a portrait of Bynner in 1919. In New York, Bynner was a member of The Players club, the Harvard Club, and the MacDowell Club. In San Francisco, he joined the Bohemian Club.Herringshaw, Thomas William. American Elite and Sociologist Bluebook, p. 127. American Blue Book Publishers, 1922.

He had a short spell in academia in 1918‚Äì1919 at the University of California, Berkeley. He was hired to teach Oral English to the Students' Army Training Corps as a form of conscientious objector alternative service. After World War I ended, Bynner was invited to stay on in the English department to teach poetry. His students included several who became published poets of some note, such as Stanton A. Coblentz, Hildegarde Flanner, Idella Purnell, and Genevieve Taggard. In celebration of the end of the war, he composed A Canticle of Praise, performed in the Hearst Greek Theatre before some 8,000 (eight thousand) people. At Berkeley he met Kiang Kang-hu, a professor of Chinese, and began an eleven-year collaboration with him on the translation of T'ang Dynasty poems. His teaching contract was not renewed, but his students continued to meet as a group and he occasionally joined them. An elaborate dinner honoring him was held at the Bohemian Club in San Francisco. A festschrift, a book of poems by students and friends, W.B. in California, was given to all who were present.\\"Hidden History of the Berkeley Campus\\" project, University of California web site.

Bynner returned to China, living there from June 1920 to April 1921 for intensive study of Chinese literature and culture. He met sculptor Beniamino Bufano en route. After returning to California, Bynner went to see family in New York. He embarked on another lecture tour, reaching Santa Fe, New Mexico in February 1922. Exhausted and suffering from a lingering cold, he decided to cancel the rest of his tour and rest there. Santa Fe and Mexico Finding the small city very appealing, in June 1922 Bynner moved permanently to Santa Fe. He first returned to Berkeley, where he recruited his former student Walter Willard 'Spud' Johnson to join him as his secretary (and lover). Mabel Dodge Luhan introduced the two men to D.H. Lawrence and his wife Frieda. Robert Hunt and Witter Bynner The following year, Bynner and Johnson joined the Lawrences on a trip through Mexico. Lawrence was inspired to write several essays related to the trip, and his novel The Plumed Serpent, includes characters based on Bynner and Johnson. Bynner also produced related writings: three poems about Lawrence, and his memoir Journey with Genius, published in 1951. Luhan was not pleased that the two couples had traveled together, as she wanted to be at the center of the community. She is said to have taken revenge on Bynner by hiring Johnson to be her own secretary. Bynner in turn wrote a play, Cake, satirizing her lifestyle. In 1930 Robert \\"Bob\\" Hunt (1906-1964) arrived in Santa Fe, originally for a visit while recuperating from an illness. He and Bynner began a relationship, and he stayed as the poet's lifelong companion. Together they entertained artists and literary figures such as Ansel Adams, W. H. Auden, Willa Cather, Robert Frost, Martha Graham, Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, D. H. Lawrence and his wife, Edna St. Vincent Millay, James Merrill, Georgia O'Keeffe, Carl Sandburg, Igor Stravinsky, Carl Van Vechten, and Thornton Wilder. They also made frequent visits to their second home in Chapala, Mexico. They bought it from Mexican architect Luis Barrag√°n. Bynner spent much of the 1940s and early 1950s in Chapala, until he began to lose his eyesight. He returned to the U.S., received treatment, and traveled to Europe with Hunt. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Hunt took increasing responsibility for the ailing poet. Hunt died of a heart attack in January 1964. On January 18, 1965, Bynner had a severe stroke. He never recovered, and required constant care until he died on June 1, 1968. Hunt and Bynner's ashes are buried beneath the carved stone weeping dog at the house where he lived on Atalaya Hill in Santa Fe, now used as the president's home for St. John's College. Legacy From 1921 to 1923, Bynner had served as president of the Poetry Society of America.\\"Witter Bynner,\\" Harvard Square Library To encourage young poets, he created the Witter Bynner Prize for Undergraduate Excellence in Poetry, administered by the Poetry Society in cooperation with Palms poetry magazine, of which he was associate editor. African-American poets received the award soon after it was established: Countee Cullen in 1925 and Langston Hughes in 1926. Witter Bynner House, Santa Fe Bynner's home in Santa Fe is now a bed and breakfast called the Inn of the Turquoise Bear. In 1972, the Witter Bynner Foundation for Poetry was founded through a bequest from Bynner. It makes grants to perpetuate the art of poetry, primarily by supporting individual poets, translations, and audience development. Since 1997, it has funded the Witter Bynner Fellowship, the recipient of which is selected by the U.S. Poet Laureate. A Witter Bynner Poetry Prize was established by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1980 to support young poets. It was discontinued in 2003.

Following their conquest in 1211‚Äì1212, the cities were granted as a fief to Otto de la Roche, Duke of Athens, by Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea. The lordship remained in the possession of the de la Roche and the Brienne Dukes of Athens even after the conquest of the Duchy of Athens by the Catalan Company in 1311, and the Brienne line continued to be recognized as Dukes of Athens there. Walter II of Brienne was largely an absentee lord, spending most of his life in his European domains, except for a failed attempt in 1331 to recover Athens from the Catalans. After his death in 1356 the lordship was inherited by his sixth son, Guy of Enghien. Guy took up residence in Greece, and in 1370‚Äì1371 Guy and his brothers launched another, also failed, invasion of the Catalan domains. When Guy died in 1376, the lordship then passed to his daughter Maria of Enghien and her Venetian husband Pietro Cornaro, who would also reside there until his death in 1388. The lordship became a de facto Venetian dependency during this period, and shortly after his death, Maria sold the two cities to Venice, where she retired. Before Venice could take possession, Argos was seized by the Despot Theodore I Palaiologos, while his ally, Nerio I Acciaioli seized Nauplia. The latter city was soon captured by Venice, but Argos remained in Byzantine hands until 1394, when it too was handed over to Venice.  History  Map of the Peloponnese or Morea peninsula with its principal locations during the late Middle Ages In the first years of the 13th century, already before the arrival of the Fourth Crusade in the Byzantine Empire, Argos and Nauplia became the centre of an independent domain under the Greek lord Leo Sgouros. Sgouros had exploited the feebleness of imperial authority, and like many other provincial magnates proceeded to carve out his own principality. From his hometown Nauplia, he seized Argos and Corinth, and attacked Athens, although he failed to take the Acropolis of Athens. By early 1205, Sgouros had advanced into Boeotia and Thessaly, but was forced to abandon his conquests in the face of the Crusaders under Boniface of Montferrat, who advanced south from Thessalonica. Boniface overran Thessaly, Boeotia and Attica, where he installed his followers as barons, and his men invaded the Morea. Sgouros and his men held out in the citadels of Argos, Nauplia and Corinth, however, even after both Boniface and Sgouros died, in 1207 and 1208 respectively. The three fortresses were kept under siege by the Crusaders until the fall of Acrocorinth in 1210, followed by Nauplia and finally by Argos in 1212. The Lord of Athens, Otto de la Roche (), played a major role in their capture, and as a reward the Prince of Achaea Geoffrey I of Villehardouin () gave him Argos and Nauplia as a fief, along with an income of 400 hyperpyra from Corinth. The area of Damala (Troezen) in the Argolid was also given to the de la Roche, but soon passed to a cadet branch of the family, which assumed the Barony of Veligosti. Despite the establishment of a Frankish lordship in the southern Argolid, however, the Franks were never numerous in the district. Much as happened elsewhere in the Morea, the local Greek magnates simply submitted to their new Frankish lords, but kept their possessions and Orthodox faith, as well as a typically Byzantine culture, as evidenced by the continued construction of Byzantine- style churches during the period.  Under the de la Roche family  After the death of Otto I, some time between 1225 and 1234, Argos and Nauplia were inherited by his son , while Athens went to Guy I de la Roche (). In April 1251, Otto II sold his Greek possessions to his brother Guy I in exchange of 15,000 gold hyperpyra and the latter's lands and claims in France. Following the fall of Boniface's Kingdom of Thessalonica to the Greek Despotate of Epirus in 1224, the Principality of Achaea emerged as the most powerful and pre-eminent among the Latin states of southern Greece. Inevitably, the other Latin lordships began to be drawn into the orbit of Achaea, which during the early reign of William II of Villehardouin () reached the height of its power and prosperity. Guy I de la Roche was one of William's feudatories, both for Argos and Nauplia, as well as for his possession of one half of Thebes As a result he participated in the siege and conquest of the last Greek stronghold in the Morea, the fortress city of Monemvasia (1246‚Äì1248), alongside William. At about the same time, William received from the Latin Emperor the suzerainty over the Duchy of Naxos, Negroponte (Euboea), and possibly over the Marquisate of Bodonitsa as well, while the County of Cephalonia also recognized his overlordship. William's hegemonic ambitions worried many of the other Latin rulers and barons, however, resulting in the War of the Euboeote Succession (1256‚Äì1258). Guy de la Roche fought against William in the conflict, but it ended in a complete victory for William and Guy's submission to the Prince of Achaea. Following the capture of William II by the Byzantines in the Battle of Pelagonia (1259), in 1261 the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos () received a number of fortresses in the southeastern Morea (Monemvasia, Mystras and Grand Magne, possibly also Geraki) as a ransom for the Prince's release. According to George Pachymeres, Argos and Nauplia were also demanded by Palaiologos, but in the event they remained in Latin hands. In the 1270s, with the rise of the Latin renegade Licario, who became a Byzantine admiral, the Argolid suffered repeated raids at the hands of Licario's corsairs.  Under the Brienne family  Larisa, the citadel of Argos, extensively refortified in the 13th‚Äì14th centuries In 1309, Walter I of Brienne succeeded to the Duchy of Athens, but he and many of the most important lords of Frankish Greece fell in the Battle of Halmyros in March 1311 against the Catalan Company. In its aftermath, the Catalans took over the Duchy of Athens and, with the military capacity of the remaining Latin states of Greece crippled, threatened to invade the Morea and take over Argos and Nauplia as well. After briefly holding Athens against the Catalans, Walter's widow, Joanna of Ch√¢tillon, went to France to solicit aid from her father, the Constable of France Gaucher V de Ch√¢tillon, whom she appointed bailli in her name on 22 November 1312. Over the next few years, with support from the Angevin Kingdom of Naples and the Papacy, Joanna dispatched men and provisions to the Argolid, which was administered in her name by the local Frankish brothers Walter and Francis of Foucherolles. The steadfast loyalty of the Foucherolles to the Briennist claimants was instrumental in keeping the lordship under their control over the next decade, when the Argolid was ravaged by Catalan raids. The lordship's maintenance necessitated continuous expense, however, which forced Joanna to undertake large debts. When Joanna's son Walter II of Brienne came of age in January 1321, he initially refused to take over his mother's debts. King Philip V of France adjudicated between them and decided that Walter had to pay off the sum of 7,000 livres tournois and his mother the rest. The Briennist claims were upheld by Pope Clement V and Pope John XXII, who took a firm stance against the Catalan Company: the Catalans were excommunicated, their attacks on fellow Christians excoriated, and attacks on them by the other Latin powers of Greece encouraged. Clement sought the intercession of King James II of Aragon to get the Catalans to abandon Athens, but the King's appeal to that effect was ignored. Clement further ordered the Knights Hospitaller to provide three or four galleys and men to defend the Brienne lands, and in 1314 commanded all Templar properties in the Duchy of Athens to be placed under the control of Gaucher V de Ch√¢tillon and to be used against the Catalans. The Briennist cause was undermined, however, by the persistent refusal of the Republic of Venice to support anti-Catalan ventures. Although the Venetians were often at odds with the Catalans over their claims to various fiefs in Euboea, in 1319 an accord was reached established generally peaceful relations between the two over the next few decades. After 1321, Walter II repeatedly announced his intention to campaign in Greece and recover the Duchy of Athens, but financial constraints and his obligations to the King of Naples kept him occupied in Italy. In 1328, he even briefly concluded a truce with the Catalans. Thus it was not until 1330 that a serious effort got under way. In June 1330, Pope John XXII issued a crusading bull for Walter, and ordered prelates in Italy and Greece to preach for a crusade against the Catalans; shortly after, King Robert of Naples also gave the crusade his support, and allowed his feudatories to join it. The Venetians, on the other hand, renewed their treaty with the Catalans in April 1331. Sailing from Brindisi in August, Walter attacked first the Latin County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, and the Greek Despotate of Epirus, forcing them to recognize the overlordship of King Robert. From there he proceeded to invade the Duchy of Athens through northern Boeotia, but his campaign was a failure as the Catalans avoided battle and withdrew behind the walls of Thebes and Athens. Walter had neither the troops to overwhelm the Catalans nor the money to sustain a prolonged war of sieges and attrition, and found no support among the native Greek population. By summer 1332, it was clear that the expedition had failed, and Walter returned to Brindisi. He had captured the island of Leucas and Vonitsa for himself and briefly restored Angevin suzerainty over western Greece, but the main objective had eluded him, and he had ended up with even more crippling debts. The effect of his expedition on Argos and Nauplia is unclear; he may not even have visited the territory during his stay in Greece. Walter did not abandon his plans for regaining his inheritance in Greece, and retained papal support, which materialized in repeated excommunications of the Catalans. With the Venetians firmly opposed to rendering any help, however, Walter's plans could not be fulfilled. After further ventures and adventures in Italy and France, Walter was killed at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. During this time, the Argolid suffered a raid by the Aydinid Turks under Umur Bey in 1332, which coincided with a prolonged famine that required food to be imported from Italy. At the same time, Argos and Nauplia also came within reach of the expanding Byzantine province in the Morea, which by had expanded from the southeast to include most of Arcadia and Cynuria. The increased threat to the lordship prompted Walter II to construct two new castles, which first appear in his will of 1347: at Kiveri (Chamires in French) across the Argolic Gulf from Nauplia and Thermisi (Tr√©mis) further east along the coast, across Hydra Island. Despite the depredations from raids, the Brienne fief was relatively prosperous: the area was fertile and supported agriculture, pastures for livestock, and vineyards, while the Argolic Gulf provided fisheries and salt flats near Thermisi. According to documents from later in the 14th century, carobs, raisins, resin and acorn dyes, as well as cotton and linen cloth, were exported.  Under the Enghien family  Walter II died without direct heirs, as his only son had died as a child during his 1331 campaign. He was succeeded in his titles and claims by his sister Isabella of Brienne and her husband Walter of Enghien, but these were immediately devolved on their numerous children. While the couple's second (and eldest surviving) son, Sohier of Enghien, received the County of Brienne and the rights to Athens, it was a younger son, Engelbert, who received Argos and Nauplia, as well as Walter's lands in Cyprus. Unwilling to undertake the considerable burden of defending the Greek fiefs, Engelbert exchanged them with his brother Guy, who had originally received the fief of Ramerupt in France. Guy thus became the new \\"Lord of Argos, Nauplia and Kiveri\\". Guy replaced Nicholas of Foucherolles, who had served as bailli during the last decade of Walter's reign, with two members of a branch of the Medici family who had settled in Greece: Piere Tantenes (\\"of Athens\\"), also known as \\"Yatro\\" (Greek for \\"physician\\", a hellenization of \\"Medici\\") in 1357‚Äì1360 and Arardo or Averardo de Medici in 1360‚Äì1363/4. Their rule proved unpopular, however, and in 1360 the local populace rebelled‚Äîaccording to historian Thanos Kondylis, perhaps with the encouragement of the Foucherolles‚Äîwhen Averardo de Medici increased taxation on figs and raisins, and blockaded Guy's soldiers in their castles. The situation was resolved when Guy in person came and settled in the lordship‚Äîhe is attested at Nauplia in December 1364, where he issued an act in favour of Jacomo, Lord of Tzoya and a son-in-law of Nicholas of Foucherolles. Guy strengthened his ties to the lordship by marrying into the local aristocracy. The identity of his wife is unclear: the early 15th-century Chronographia regum francorum records that she was the daughter of the Baron of Arcadia, probably Erard III le Maure, while the 17th-century Flemish historian Vredius records that she was a Greek named Bonne or Maria. The 19th-century historian of Frankish Greece, Karl Hopf, hypothesized that Bonne was a daughter of Nicholas of Foucherolles, but without any evidence; nevertheless, his version is commonly accepted in modern literature. Guy's reign was troubled by the threat of the Ottoman Turks, against whom, according to the Chronographia regum francorum, he proved a courageous leader. To strengthen the security of his domains, on 22 July 1362, Guy became a Venetian citizen, a development that heralded active Venetian involvement in the affairs of the area. Two years later, soon after his arrival in the Morea, he was involved in the civil war over possession of the Principality of Achaea between Philip II of Taranto and Maria of Bourbon, widow of Philip's older brother Robert, who died in September 1364 without a direct heir. Guy, along with the Despot of the Morea Manuel Kantakouzenos (), supported Maria and her son Hugh of Lusignan until 1370, when the latter sold their claims to Philip. Now the undisputed Prince of Achaea, Philip sent to the Morea as his bailli Guy's brother Louis, Count of Conversano. By this time, the Catalans of Athens had entered a period of decline and civil war, which only somewhat subsided with the appointment of Matthew of Peralta as vicar-general in 1370. The Enghiens saw a perfect opportunity to reclaim their ancestral inheritance: on 28 March 1370 a third brother, John of Enghien, Count of Lecce, received permission from Queen Joanna I of Naples to gather 1,000 foot and 500 horse for service in Greece, and began arranging for ships to ferry them along the southeastern coasts of Italy. Guy also arranged a truce with the Despot of the Morea so as to concentrate his forces against the Catalans. As Venetian citizens, the Enghiens also approached Venice for aid, which was politely but firmly declined, first in April 1370, and again in February 1371. Undeterred, the Enghiens launched an invasion of Attica in spring 1371, but the campaign failed as the Acropolis resisted and Louis fell ill. The Enghiens retreated, and Guy concluded a truce with the Catalans in August; a marriage between his daughter and heir Maria and Joan de Ll√∫ria (probably the son of the former Catalan vicar-general Roger de Ll√∫ria) was initially stipulated in the agreement, but never actually took place. This was to be the last effort by the claimants, for troubles in Italy occupied Guy's brothers, and the looming Ottoman threat forced the Papacy to shift to a policy of supporting the Catalans. Any prospects to regain the Athenian duchy were further impeded by the capture of Megara by the ambitious Nerio I Acciaioli in 1374/5, which barred the land route into Attica to the Enghiens. Guy of Engien died shortly after October 1376. As his daughter Maria was underage and unmarried, the Lordship was governed by his brother Louis as her guardian. Louis arranged Maria's marriage to the Venetian Pietro Cornaro in May 1377. Louis seems to have launched some raids against the Catalans in 1377, but this was overshadowed by the fall of the Duchy of Athens to the Navarrese Company in 1379.  Takeover by Venice  Venetian Lion of Saint Mark on the Akronauplia fortress The Cornaro family had been established in Latin Greece for some time, acting both as the Republic of Venice's officials and on their own account, and Pietro's father Federigo was accounted the richest man in Venice in 1379. The marriage of Maria of Enghien and Pietro Cornaro coincided with an increasing Venetian interest in the region, as the Republic faced new challenges and opportunities in the Aegean with the rise of the Ottomans. Possession of Nauplia would complete Venice's control of the shores of the Morea, which in turn controlled the routes from the Adriatic to the eastern Mediterranean; while Nauplia itself was valuable as an intermediate stop for the Black Sea commercial routes as well. Maria of Enghien and Pietro Cornaro were both still young when they became lords of Argos and Nauplia. In the first years of their reign, they resided in Venice, and Pietro's father Federigo acted on their behalf, securing permissions from the Venetian government to send supplies or arm a galley to defend the lordship. Following his father's death in 1382, Pietro secured permission by the Venetian government to go to Nauplia himself; by this time, in Anthony Luttrell's words, \\"the [Venetian] senate considered these places more or less as Venetian possessions\\". When Pietro Cornaro died in 1388, Maria, unable to defend her possessions, sold them to Venice on 12 December in exchange for an annual subsidy of 700 ducats. Before the Venetians could arrive to take over the two towns, however, the Byzantine Despot of the Morea Theodore I Palaiologos (), and his ally and father-in-law Nerio I Acciaioli seized them with the aid of an Ottoman army under Evrenos. Although the Venetians were quickly able to oust Nerio from Nauplia, Argos, Kiveri and Thermisi remained in Theodore's hands until 11 June 1394, when he ceded them to Venice. After Maria's death in 1393, her uncle Engelbert‚Äîwho had originally received the lordship in 1356‚Äîclaimed her inheritance, but when the Venetians provided the document of sale, and suggested that they would be willing to cede the castles if he could pay for their defence and reimburse Venice for the costs of their purchase and the ongoing siege of Argos, he dropped his claim. Argos remained in Venetian hands until conquered by the Ottomans at the outbreak of the First Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War in 1463, while of all Venetian territories in the Morea, Nauplia persisted longest in her possession, and was surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540 after the conclusion of the Third Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War.

Cadillac renamed its low-priced Series 62 in 1965 as the \\"Calais\\", after the French port city of Calais that overlooks the narrowest point in the English Channel. In Greek mythology, Calais was one of two winged sons of Boreas, god of the North Wind, and Oreithyea. With the exception of no convertible model, the Calais shared the same styling and mechanics as the better-equipped, more expensive Cadillac de Ville. 1965‚Äì1970 In 1965, Calais tailfins were canted slightly downward, and sharp, distinct body lines were featured. The rear bumper was straight and the rear lamp clusters were vertical. The headlight pairs were vertical, permitting a wide grille. Side windows were curved and frameless. Perimeter frame construction allowed positioning of the engine forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room. The Calais was available as a 2- or 4-door hardtop as well as a \\"formal-roof\\" 4-door sedan, which was a hybrid with frameless, hardtop-like windows, but with a pillar between them. The primary differences between the Calais and the De Ville were trim levels and standard equipment. While the De Ville was delivered with such amenities as power windows and 2-way power seats as standard equipment, hand-cranked windows and manual seat adjusters were standard on the Calais, with power windows a US$119 option in 1965.Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1960-1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.348. At the same time, however, AM radio was a US$165 extra, as was air conditioning (More than 90% of Cadillac buyers ordered air conditioning), at US$495, on either.Flory, p.348. Standard equipment included power brakes; power steering; automatic transmission; cornering lights; dual back-up lights; windshield washers and dual speed wipers; full wheel covers; remote controlled outside rear view mirror; visor vanity mirror; oil filter; five tubeless blackwall tires; heater; defroster; lamps for glove and rear passenger compartments and front and rear seat belts. Unlike the De Ville, the Calais did not offer leather seating areas and vinyl roof trim was not offered initially. A high-grade cloth and vinyl, similar to what was seen on top-line Buick Electras and Oldsmobile 98s, was standard. Another item not initially available on the Calais was the Cadillac-exclusive \\"firemist\\" paint, an extra-cost high gloss metallic paint. Both the high-end Buick and Oldsmobile models shared the GM C platform with Cadillac. Cadillac, always General Motors' technology leader, offered most De Ville options on the Calais, such as Twilight Sentinel and the GuideMatic headlight dimmer. In 1965, the new Turbo-Hydramatic, standard on the 1964 De Ville, but not the lower-priced Series 62, became standard throughout the Cadillac line, including the Calais. The V8 also remained the standard engine. Pricing of the Cadillac Calais started at nearly US$5,000, almost US$1,000 (or about 25%) more than the Electra 225 and Oldsmobile 98,Flory, pp.346, 389, 422, 425, & 467. and about US$500 more than the top-line Buick Riviera.Flory, pp.348, 349, 423, 425, 497, & 500. In 1966, changes included a somewhat coarser mesh for the radiator grille insert, which was now divided by a thick, bright metal horizontal center bar housing rectangular parking lamps at the outer ends. Separate rectangular side marker lamps replaced the integral grille extension designs. There was generally less chrome on all Cadillac models this year. Cadillac \\"firsts\\" this season included variable ratio steering and optional front seats with carbon cloth heating pads built into the cushions and seatbacks. Comfort and convenience innovations were headrests, reclining seats and an AM/FM stereo system. Automatic level control was available. Engineering improvements made to the perimeter frame increased ride and handling ease. Newly designed piston and oil rings and a new engine mounting system and patented quiet exhaust were used. Head rests became an option. 1967 Cadillac Calais 2-door hardtop The Calais was extensively restyled for 1967. Prominent styling features were given a powerful frontal appearance with \\"forward- leaning\\" front end, long sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had more than just a hint of tail fins in them. The full-width forward- thrust \\"eggcrate\\" grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. For 1967, power windows became standard on the Calais line, although power seats were still optional even in the 1970s models. Coupes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 New York World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. New standard Calais features included non-glare rear-view mirror, electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation. An energy absorbing steering column became optional. 1967 was the last model year for pillared sedans. For 1968, grilles had an insert with finer mesh and step down outer section which held the rectangular parking lights slightly higher than before. Rear end styling was modestly altered with the deck lid having more of a rake. The hood was re-designed to accommodate recessed windshield wiper-washers, which now came with three speeds standard. Of 20 exterior paint color combinations, 14 were totally new. On the inside, enriched appointments included molded inner door panels with illuminated reflectors and a selection of 147 upholstery combinations, 76 in cloth, 67 in leather and four in vinyl. New standard features included a Light Group, a Mirror Group, a trip odometer and an ignition key warning buzzer. Like all other Cadillacs, the Calais received the OHV V8 in 1968. 1968 was also the last year for the \\"stacked\\" dual headlights, which were replaced with horizontal dual headlights in 1969. 1968 was also the last year for vent windows. In 1969, the Calais was restyled. A new front fender treatment similar to the Eldorado helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. Dual horizontal headlamps were positioned in the outboard step down areas of the all-new grille. The roofline was squarer and the rear deck and bumper more sculptured. A new ventilation system eliminated the need for vent windows, which provided a longer sleeker look and improved visibility. New standard features included front center seat armrests. Front seat headrests were now mandatory and the ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, which locked both the steering wheel and transmission selector lever when the key was removed. In 1970, a facelift included a grille with 13 vertical blades set against a delicately cross-hatched rectangular opening. The bright metal headlamp surrounds were bordered with body color to give a more refined look. Narrow vertical taillamps were seen again and had smaller bottom lenses pointing downward in the bumper. Standard wheel covers and winged crest fender tip emblems were new. Exterior distinctions came from a Calais signature script above the rear end of the horizontal belt molding just ahead of the taillight dividers and from the use of small square back-up light lenses set into the lower bumper as opposed to the long rectangular lenses used on the De Ville. The traditional 'V' emblem beneath the Cadillac crest on the hood and decklid was removed from both the Calais and De Ville this year, not to return until 1972. 1971‚Äì1976 The Cadillac Calais was completely restyled, inside and out, for 1971. The new 1971 GM full-size bodies, at 64.3\\" front shoulder room (62.1\\" on Cadillac) and 63.4\\" rear shoulder room (64.0\\" on Cadillac) set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed round headlamps were wider apart, with a winged Cadillac crest set between each pair. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and recessed windshield wipers was used0. A larger Cadillac crest decorated the hood face and new fiber-optic lamp indicators appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again covered by fender skirts. Taillamps were new and no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. The Calais wheelbase was extended to . Inside, interiors were redesigned featuring a new curved instrument panel with brushed aluminum trim and revised seating areas, available in either standard cloth or optional vinyl upholstery. In 1972, a modest frontal revision placed more emphasis on horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid. New standard features included a bumper impact system, automatic parking brake release, passenger assist straps and flow through ventilation system. Externally the Calais was identified by front fender model script; thin horizontal belt moldings and a script on the right side of the trunk lid. New energy absorbing bumpers were seen on all GM cars in 1973. Styling refinements to the Calais included a wider grille with an intricate eggcrate design. Larger vertical rectangles housed the parking lamps between wide spaced headlamps which had square bezels but round lenses. Bumpers ran fully across the front and wrapped around each end. Vertical guards were spaced much further apart at a point outboard of the grille. The rear end had a bumper with a flatter upper section housing an angled license plate recess. Border outline moldings vertically \\"veed\\" paralleled the fender edge shape at the rear bodysides. Single horizontally mounted rectangular rear side marker lamps were placed over and under the rear tip of the thin beltline trim. Cadillac script was seen on the front fender sides below the belt molding behind the wheel opening. Interior seating was new this year, with revised seat patterns featuring standard cloth or optional vinyl upholstery. Also new were \\"soft-pillow\\" door panels with larger, sturdier pull-straps. In 1974, a wider eggcrate grille was used. Dual round headlamps were mounted close together in square bezels. Further outboard were double deck wraparound turn signal/parking lamps. Shorter vertical grille guards appeared in about the same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical chrome bumper ends with integrated side-marker lights. New taillamps were positioned horizontally beneath the trunk lid. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Coupes were no longer hardtops, instead sporting large wide \\"coach\\" windows giving a thick center pillar look. A new, two-tiered, \\"space- aged\\" curved instrument panel housed a new standard quartz controlled digital clock. Other standard features included a removable litter receptacle and bias belted blackwall tires. 1974 also saw the introduction of the first airbag system, the optional \\"Air Cushion Restraint System\\". This option provided protection for front seat occupants in the case of a frontal collision. One airbag was located in the steering wheel hub, while the other sat in place of the glove compartment on the lower passenger side of the dashboard. The glove box was replaced with a rectangular storage compartment, complete with a lockable wood-tone hinged front panel, centrally located under the dashboard. Additionally, there was a driver's side knee bolster panel with an ashtray to the right of the steering column and a small hinged-door storage compartment on the left side. Although the \\"ACRS\\" system (also available on top of the line Buick and Oldsmobile models) saved lives, the option was quite expensive and therefore unpopular with customers. It was discontinued after 1976, and Cadillac would not offer airbags again until the 1990 model year. Styling changes for 1975 brought a more unified front end appearance with a new hood with sharper lines. Dual rectangular headlamps flanked by rectangular turn signal/parking lights wrapped around squared-off front fenders. A new cross hatched grille also appeared with Cadillac script on the header. Sedans now featured slim fixed triangular quarter windows. New standard equipment included front fender lamp monitors, power door locks, high energy ignition and steel-belted radial tires. The big engine used exclusively in the Eldorado since 1970, was now standard in all Cadillacs except the new, smaller Seville. Vinyl seating areas were of the same configuration since 1973; Cloth upholstery was available in more colors. In 1976, the grille saw a new finer crosshatching pattern. Cornering lamps received new horizontal silver trim, while taillamps bezels also gained chrome-like trim. Eight different color accent stripes were available. Optional padded vinyl roof coverings were now stamped with an Elk grain pattern. Vinyl seats were continued and new interior trim included sporty plaids, plush velours and knits. Coupe models equipped with the available cabriolet vinyl top, covering the rear-half of the roof, were trimmed with a lower molding that served as a continuation of the door \\"belt\\" molding. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrent system was available. A new Delco Freedom battery never needed water. Simulated wire wheel covers were newly available. Other new options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio, plus power passenger and manual driver seatback recliners for 50/50 front seats. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. New standard features included Soft-Ray tinted glass, spare tire cover, trunk mat, washer fluid level indicator, and steel belted radial whitewall tires. 1976 was the 11th and final year for the Cadillac Calais. Sales of the Calais had never been strong and had been declining steadily for years; the difference in cost between the entry-level Calais and the base De Ville had become basically negligible, and Cadillac customers saw little reason to purchase a Calais, when a better equipped De Ville cost only slightly more. For 1977, the Cadillac De Ville and Fleetwood would be extensively restyled and downsized; prices would also increase significantly, leaving the slow-selling, lowly Calais unnecessary in the Cadillac lineup. The base Coupe De Ville became Cadillac's least expensive automobile for 1977.

Originating in South America in the Peruvian and middle Amazon, the Guianas and Venezuela, it grows to about 2.5 inches (6.5 cm). The fish gets its name from its relatively large protruding belly which resembles a hatchet. Hatchetfish will often jump out of the water when alarmed, propelled by their large, winglike pectoral fins. They also jump to catch small aerial insects. In the aquarium The river hatchetfish is a schooling species best kept in groups of five or more that spends most of its time in the top-level of the water where it searches for food. These fish are peaceful towards other fishes, but frequently bicker among themselves. Typical lifespan in captivity is around five years, but can live longer. They come from streams in a tropical climate and prefer water at pH 6‚Äì7, a water hardness of up to 15.0 dGH, and an ideal temperature range of (23-27 ¬∞C (73-81 ¬∞F) . As carnivores, they will readily eat many types of small annelid worms, insects, and crustaceans, and they will also eat standard flake foods. They have a reputation for being greedy fish. Because of their natural tendency to jump when alarmed, they may jump out of aquarium tanks. To prevent this, the top must either be completely sealed, or the water level lowered so the edges of the tank extend further upwards than the fish are capable of jumping. This is also less common with the addition of floating plants, to provide cover. It is also advised to keep them in a planted aquarium.

Zile lies to the south of Amasya and the west of Tokat in north-central Turkey. The city has a long history, including as former bishopric and the site of the Battle of Zela, which prompted the phrase \\"Veni, vidi, vici.\\"Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Zela Today the city is a center for agricultural marketing and tourism.  History  Veni Vidi Vici Historically, Zile has been known as Zela (), Zelitis (), Zelid, Anzila, Gƒ±rgƒ±rƒ±ye (Karkariye), Zƒ´leh, Zilleli, Zeyli, and Silas (). Zile castle, the only solid castle in Anatolia, was built by Roman commander Lucius Cornelius Sulla. The castle contains the Amanos temple, and is called silla, meaning \\"respected\\". In Semra Meral's Her Y√∂n√ºyle Zile, she claims that the name \\"Zile\\" came from \\"Zela\\", stemming from \\"Silla\\". Ancient City According to recent archaeological research, there is evidence of human habitation since Neolithic times in Zile. In his book Geographica, Strabo claimed that Zela was founded by Semiramis, a legendary Assyrian queen. By 548 BC, Zela and greater Anatolia were under the rule of Achaemenid Persian Empire. Persian rule saw construction of a portion of the Royal Road in the area, and of temples to the Persian gods Anahita, Vohu-Mano, and Anadates in the city itself. Darius I of Persia divided the largest Anatolian state of that time, Cappadocia, into two, with Zela remaining in Pontus Cappadocia, the northern region. Classical Era After roughly 200 years of Persian rule, Alexander the Great captured Zela from Darius III of Persia as a result of the Battle of the Granicus (334 BC). Following Alexander's death in 323 BC and the collapse of his empire, Zela passed to the Seleucid Empire, a Hellenistic successor state of Alexander the Great's dominion. It controlled the area for 200 years, but by 100 BC, its power in the region started to collapse. As a consequence, King Mithridates VI of Pontus attacked and took Zela in 88 BC, and ordered the killing of all Romans living there. This led the nearby Cappadocians to call on Rome for help. The Roman army, under Sulla's command, fought and defeated Mithradates in the First Mithridatic War. Mithridates attacked Zela again in 67 BC with the help of his Armenian ally Tigranes the Great, king of Greater Armenia, initiating the Third Mithridatic War, which ended with victory by the Romans under Pompeius Magnus and the suicide of Mithridates in 63 BC. In Pompey's settlement of Pontus, Zela received a civic constitution and a sizable territory thus transforming from its previous status as a temple domain to a city. In 49 BC, civil war broke out between Julius Caesar and Pompey. While the Romans were distracted by this, Pharnaces II of Pontus, son of Mithridates, decided to seize the opportunity and take revenge for his father. His attack on Zela was halted by Julius Caesar in the bloody Battle of Zela (47 BC). While Caesar's army suffered great losses, Pharnaces's was completely destroyed in five hours. After this victory, Caesar sent his famous message to the Roman Senate: \\"Veni Vidi Vici\\", meaning \\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\". Caesar's words were written on a cylindrical marble column and placed in the city castle. According to Strabo, Zela had the temple of Ana√Øtis (), who was also revered by the Armenians.STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XII, Chapter 3, 37 Middle Ages In 241, the Sassanid king Shapur I, attacked the Romans and defeated Roman Emperor Valerian, thus capturing Zela. From 241 to 1071, Zile was conquered many times by the Byzantines and Sasanids. Under Byzantine rule, Zile became a (now Titular Latin) bishopric of Asia Minor, suffragan of Amasya in the former Roman province of Helenopontus (see below). Zela was conquered by Danishmend Melik Ahmet Gazi in 1071 and, since, has belonged to the Turks, who suppressed the bishopric. In 1174, Anatolian Seljuks captured the city from Danishmends under Izzettin II Kƒ±lƒ±√ßaslan. After the collapse of the Anatolian Seljuks, the Eretna Emirate was founded in Zile's district in 1335. The Ottomans defeated Ertans in 1397 under the rule of Sultan Bayezid I, integrating Zile into their empire. Modern History During the course of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922 (also known as Turkish War of Independence), some supporters of Sharia (strict Islamic law) seized power in Zile and attacked the barracks of new Turkish Republic's army. The soldiers were forced to retreat to the city castle and consequently asked for help from the √áorum battalion. The battalion reached the city in four days and upon their arrival they started bombing the city so as to force the rebels to surrender. As a result of heavy bombardment, Zile suffered a great fire which led to the loss of two thirds of its infrastructure and most of its forest cover. Finally, the army managed to put down the rebellion and regained control. Since then, Zile has been a rural district in Tokat province of the Republic of Turkey.  Ecclesiastical history  Zela, in the Roman province of Helenopontus (civil diocese of Pontus), was a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Amasea, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The following Suffragan Bishops of Zela are historically documented : * Heraclius took part in the Council of Ancyra in 314 and in the ecumenical First Council of Nicaea in 325 **‚Äô‚Äô Bitinicusus, an Arian (heretic), participated in the synod of Gangra in 340 and intervened at the Arian 'conciliabolum' at Philippopolis in 343/344 * Atticus attended the Council of Chalcedon in 451 * Hyperechius signed in 458 the letter of the episcopate of Helenopontus to Byzantine emperor Leo I the Thracian after Coptic mobs lynched Patriarch Proterius of Alexandria * Georgius was at the ‚ÄòRobber‚Äô Council in Trullo in 692 * Constantinus took part in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 * Paulus attended the Council of Constantinople in 869-870 and the Council of Constantinople of 879-880 which rehabilitated Patriarch Photius of Constantinople.

However, the population of Zile has been decreasing as a result of emigration due to the high unemployment rate. According to 2007 census, Zile has a population of 68,937; just 36,154 in the city centre and remaining 32,783 live in the surrounding villages.  Attractions  There are several columns in the center of the castle, but some researchers claim that the actual column with Caesar's famous words was stolen, and the thieves have not been found yet. There are many other historical buildings and artifacts from Hittites, Lycians, Persians, Greeks, Romans and Turks in Zile. Among these, Zile castle, the Roman theatre, Ulu Camii and √áifte Hamam are the most famous. Kaya Mezarƒ±, Kusyuva, √áay Pƒ±narƒ±, Imam Melikiddin Tomb, Seyh Musa Fakih Tomb, Elba≈üƒ± Mosque, Mast Tumulus, Namlƒ± Hisar Kale, Anzavur Caves, Hacƒ± Boz Bridge, Ko√ß Ta≈üƒ± and Manastry in Kuru√ßay are also popular. The remains of the Roman theatre are visible to the east of the citadel hill, together with some rock tombs. Two Ottoman baths, the Yeni Hamam and the √áifte Hamam, date from the 16th and 17th century and the Hasan Aga Madrasah was built in 1497. The Boyaci Hasan Aga Mosque with its stalactiform prayer niche dates from 1479 and the Seyh Musa Fakih Tomb is also very old with 1106 or 1305 given as possible construction dates. Mast Tumulus, an ancient site located in Zile, is of special importance since it hosts the palace of a Hittitite ruler, earthenware utensils and Hittite hieroglyphics.  Geography  Zile covers an area of within its city limits and has an elevation of . Turhal, √áekerek, Artova, Kadƒ±≈üehri, and Amasya are all towns located near Zile. The city is mostly surrounded by a fertile plain called Zile Ovasƒ± crossed by the Ye≈üil River and can produce harvests twice a year. South of the city, however, are the Deveci Mountains (1,892 m / 6,207 ft high), G√ºvercin √áalƒ±, and H√ºseyin Gazi Hill. Zile once had a great forest covering most of the plain, but during the 1950s, the city lost much of its forest because of the excessive breeding of goats and the use of wood for heating purposes. However, there is a recent study to plan reforestation in the area. The city's water supply is provided by the √áekerek River, flowing from Zile to √áekerek and the B√ºy√ºkak√∂z dam which was constructed on the √áatak river. The S√ºreyyabey Dam and hydroelectric plant is under construction and will provide electricity and water for irrigation in the area. Climate Zile's weather is influenced by the narrow coast land of the Black Sea Region to the north, bringing humidity, and by the Central Anatolia inland plateau to the south, with its low rainfall and cold winters. Summers are hot and dry, while the winters are snowy and cold. The weather is hot throughout the months of June to September, as the average summer maximum is 28 ¬∞C (83 ¬∞F), and the average minimum is 13 ¬∞C (56 ¬∞F), and is cold throughout the months of December to February as the average winter maximum is 7 ¬∞C (45 ¬∞F), and the average minimum is as low as -3 ¬∞C (27 ¬∞F). Northerly winds are responsible for humid climate from April to June. It is usually rainy during the months of April, May, June, November and December.  Economy  Historically, coal was mined in Zile. Agriculture, trade, and livestock are the main economic activities of Zile. Zile is a center of cereal production such that she is one of the biggest exporters of wheat, barley, lentil and common vetch in the Black Sea region. Zile is famous for its grapes, leblebi, cherry, and fruit gardens. The annual Cherry Festival is very famous in Tokat, Sivas and Yozgat. People of Zile don't use their grapes to produce wine, but pekmez - a syrup-like liquid mixed from different kinds of fruit-juices. The students of Zile Din√ßerler School of Tourism and Hotel Management of Gaziosmanpasha University play an important role in city's economic activities. The industry of Zile is developing rapidly. Since 1996, there has been a major movement from agriculture to industry. Anatolian Tigers constructed 55 factories whose major products include textiles, sugar beet, furniture, tomato sauce, leblebi, marble and shoes. The municipality and the European Union have had a joint project to increase the tourism potential of Zile and to transform the city into a tourism destination. The project is funded by the EU and includes advertisements as well as education of local people about tourism.  Education  Ku≈üyuva The city boasts 100% literacy in the city centre and over 90% in surrounding villages, with public and Imam Hatip schools, and a roughly 1:27 student-teacher ratio. There are 126 primary and secondary schools with 14,373 students and 540 teachers. Zile Din√ßerler Lisesi, Din√ßerler 75th Year Anatolian High School and Anadolu √ñƒüretmen Lisesi provide high school education in Zile. There are also four professional high schools providing technical education.Gaziosmanpasa University' s Zile Din√ßerler School of Tourism and Hotel Management is also located in Zile. By the end of 2008, with the donations of Serafettin and Cemalettin Dincer, schooling will gain totally new educational premises including a modern and luxurious hotel building which will be also used for practical education by students.  Media and social life  In Zile, theatres and concerts are conducted at a movie theatre whose capacity is 850 people. Along with national TV channels and radios, there is one local TV channel and two radio stations that keep Zile people up to date on current events. Zile has three local daily newspapers (√ñzhaber, Zile Postasƒ±, G√ºndem) and daily newspapers sell around 4000 copies per day.

Prelude After the defeat of the Ptolemaic forces at the Battle of the Nile, Caesar left Egypt and travelled through Syria, Cilicia and Cappadocia to fight Pharnaces, son of Mithridates VI. Pharnaces had defeated Caesar's Legate Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus, and his small Roman and allied army at the Battle of Nicopolis. He then committed atrocities against the Roman prisoners and against any Roman civilians he found in the region. When Pharnaces received word of Caesar's approach, he sent envoys to seek peace, which Caesar refused outright. Order of battle Caesar had two cohorts of the veteran VI Legion, the full XXII Legion, an allied force of Galatians and Vexillations from the XXXVI Legion. He also had a small contingent of cavalry. Pharnaces had an army approximately 20,000 strong, mostly consisting of tribal and levied infantry but also containing a core of professional phalangites, legionnaires, and cavalry. Pharnaces also had scythed chariots. The battle The battle took place near Zela (modern Zile), which is now a small hilltop town in the Tokat province of northern Turkey. The Pontic army positioned itself on a hill near the town, but as Caesar's men were entrenching their own camp on nearby high ground. The Pontic force suddenly attacked. This action was unexpected as it defied logic to give up the solid position at Zela and to attack uphill. The assault achieved momentary surprise and at first gained some ground amidst the confusion, but the veteran Roman legionaries soon recovered and quickly organised a defensive line. Caesar then went on the counter-offensive and drove the Pontic army back down the hill, where it was completely routed.Goldsworthy, A. Caesar, pp. 446-447 Aftermath It was a decisive point in Caesar's military career - his five-day campaign against Pharnaces was evidently so swift and complete that, according to Plutarch (writing about 150 years after the battle) he commemorated it with the now famous Latin words reportedly written to Amantius in Rome Veni, vidi, vici (\\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\").Plutarch Caesar 50 Suetonius says that the same three words were displayed prominently in the triumph for the victory at Zela.Suetonius Divus Iulius 37 Pharnaces escaped from the rout back to his Bosporan Kingdom but was killed by one of his former governors in a skirmish.

He was an MP from 1984 to 1999, representing the National Party, and a Government Minister until 1996. His Ministerial career ended when he resigned about six months after the release of the Commission of Inquiry report into the Cave Creek Disaster, and a year after the accident itself in which 14 people died and a further four were seriously injured, and during which time he was Minister of Conservation. He had been under pressure to resign since the report's release. Early life Born in Marton on 23 September 1943, Marshall was educated at Norwood School, Gisborne, Hereworth School, Havelock North, Christ's College, Christchurch and Lincoln College as part of the Kellogg New Zealand Rural Leadership Programme and was a Nuffield Farming Scholar to the United Kingdom 1983. In 1965, he married Mary Annette Kilmister, and the couple went on to have three children. Member of Parliament Marshall was a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1984 to 1999. Having joined the National Party in the 1970s, he was first elected to Parliament for Rangitikei in the 1984 election, defeating Social Credit Party leader Bruce Beetham. He held the seat against Beetham in the 1987 election, and retained it until his retirement at the 1999 election. Cabinet minister Marshall served in a number of Ministerial roles, beginning in 1993 and ending in 1996. He was Minister of Lands, Valuation, Department of Survey Land & Information from 1993 to 1996, and Minister of Forestry in 1996. Other notable positions between 1997 and 1999 include Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Transport and Environment Committee, Chairman of Special Select Committee on Dairy Industry Restructuring, and Producer Boarder Reform. As Minister of Conservation Denis Marshall's best known post was as Minister of Conservation from 1990 to 1996 during which he also acted as Associate Minister of Agriculture and Associate Minister of Employment. He resigned from his role as a Minister in May 1996, roughly a year following the April 1995 Cave Creek disaster in which 14 people died. A Commission of Inquiry found that whilst many individual mistakes contributed to the accident, a root cause was that the Department of Conservation had been under-funded and under-resourced for the role it was expected to achieve, and from the time of its creation in 1987 it had remained disorganised internally with few consistently used project and safety management systems, or formally qualified staff for much of the required work. Intense scrutiny of the Minister followed, as well as scrutiny of the government's funding priorities. He did not resign immediately following the release of the report, claiming that his resignation would not remedy the situation, and citing a quotation of Sir Geoffrey Palmer which stated that Ministers weren't personally responsible for everything done in their name, as they couldn't be expected to know or authorise everything that occurred.Parliamentary Debate‚ÄîDenis Marshall (Minister of Conservation), Wednesday, 22 November 1995 Criticism that he had been the Minister of Conservation for five years during which time it had remained in a disorganised state, however, eventually ended with him resigning about six months later. Life after politics Marshall retired from Parliament in 1999, and moved to London. He took up a full-time post as Secretary-General at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Associationhttp://www.cpahq.org/cpahq/Main/Secretary- General/Former_Secretaries- General/Main/About/Organisation/Secretary_General/Former_Secretary- Generals.aspx (CPA) from January 2002 to December 2006. He has been consulting to the UNDP and the WBI over the past four years. He now lives in Queenstown, Central Otago, New Zealand where he is a vigneron of his own vineyard Hawkshead Wine and producer of pinot noir, pinot gris, riesling and sauvignon blanc. Community In 2000 he founded the NZ National Parks and Conservation Foundation following his strong belief that there needed to be an opportunity for the private sector and corporate world to contribute more to conservation in New Zealand. He was the foundation's inaugural chairman from 2000 to 2001. He was the chairman of the New Zealand Rural Communities Trust from 2000 to 2001. He is a member in numerous community organisations in NZ such NZ Historic Places Trust and Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. Honours In 1990, Marshall was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2000 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services.

Distribution and habitat Freshwater hatchetfish originate from Panama and South America (though they are absent from Chile). They tend to be an upper-level fish, often swimming directly below the surface of the water, biding their time patiently. Size When fully grown, freshwater hatchetfish range in size from 1 inch up to 2 1/2 inches. One exception is the Giant Hatchetfish Thoracocharax securis which can grow up to 3 1/2 inches. The smallest being the Dwarf Hatchetfish Carnegiella schereri which only grows to about 1 inch.https://petfishplace.com/profile/hatchets/ Flight The most obvious trait of the freshwater hatchetfish is their enormously enlarged sternal region. This is accompanied by large pectoral fins and \\"extraordinarily powerful\\" associated muscles which account for up to one- quarter of their total body weight. \\"Quick beats of the pectoral fins\\" allow hatchetfish to \\"lift themselves half out of the water and glide along the surface ...

Noonuccal was best known for her poetry, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse.\\"Oodgeroo Noonuccal.\\" Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement, Vol. 27. Gale, 2007 Life as a poet, artist, writer and activist Oodgeroo Noonuccal joined the Australian Women‚Äôs Army Service in 1942, after her two brothers were captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore. Serving as a signaller in Brisbane she met many black American soldiers, as well as European Australians. These contacts helped to lay the foundations for her later advocacy of Aboriginal rights. During the 1940s, she joined the Communist Party of Australia because it was the only party which opposed the White Australia policy. During the 1960s Kath Walker emerged as a prominent political activist and writer. She was Queensland state secretary of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI),Cochrane, (1994), p. 67; Elaine Darling, They spoke out pretty good: politics and gender in the Brisbane Aboriginal Rights Movement 1958‚Äì1962 (St Kilda, Vic.: Janoan Media Exchange, c1998.), p. 189. and was involved in a number of other political organisations. She was a key figure in the campaign for the reform of the Australian constitution to allow Aboriginal people full citizenship, lobbying Prime Minister Robert Menzies in 1965, and his successor Harold Holt in 1966.Cochrane, (1994), p. 63. At one deputation in 1963, she taught Robert Menzies a lesson in the realities of Aboriginal life. After the Prime Minister offered the deputation an alcoholic drink, he was startled to learn from her that in Queensland he could be jailed for this. She wrote many books, beginning with We Are Going (1964), the first book to be published by an Aboriginal woman. The title poem concludes: > The scrubs are gone, the hunting and the laughter. The eagle is gone, the > emu and the kangaroo are gone from this place. The bora ring is gone. The > corroboree is gone. And we are going. This first book of poetry was extraordinarily successful, selling out in several editions, and setting Oodgeroo well on the way to be Australia's highest-selling poet alongside C. J. Dennis.Mitchell, (1987), pp. 200‚Äì2. Critics' responses were mixed, with some questioning whether Oodgeroo, as an Aboriginal person, could really have written it herself. Others were disturbed by the activism of the poems, and found that they were \\"propaganda\\" rather than what they considered to be real poetry.Rooney, Brigid, Literary activists: writer-intellectuals and Australian public life (St Lucia, Qld.) : University of Queensland Press, 2009, pp. 68‚Äì9 Oodgeroo embraced the idea of her poetry as propaganda, and described her own style as \\"sloganistic, civil- writerish, plain and simple.\\"Kath Walker, \\"Aboriginal Literature\\" Identity 2.3 (1975) pp. 39‚Äì40 She wanted to convey pride in her Aboriginality to the broadest possible audience, and to popularise equality and Aboriginal rights through her writing.Cochrane, (1994), p. 37 In 1972 she bought a property on North Stradbroke Island (also known as Minjerribah) which she called Moongalba (\\"sitting-down place\\"), and established the Noonuccal-Nughie Education and Cultural Centre. And in 1977, a documentary about her, called Shadow Sister, was released. It was directed and produced by Frank Heimans and photographed by Geoff Burton. It describes her return to Moongalba and her life there. In a 1987 interview, she described her education program at Moongalba, saying that over \\"the last seventeen years I've had 26,500 children on the island. White kids as well as black. And if there were green ones, I'd like them too ... I'm colour blind, you see. I teach them about Aboriginal culture. I teach them about the balance of nature.\\"Mitchell, (1987), p. 206. Oodgeroo was committed to education at all levels, and collaborated with universities in creating programs for teacher education that would lead to better teaching in Australian schools.Rhonda Craven, \\"The role of teachers in the Year of Indigenous people: Oodgeroo of the Tribe Noonuccal (Kath Walker)\\", Aboriginal Studies Association Journal, No. 3 (1994), p. 55-56. On 13 June 1970, Noonuccal (as Kathleen Jean Mary Walker) received the award of Member of the Order of the British Empire (Civil) (MBE) for her services to the community. In 1974 Noonuccal was aboard a British Airways flight that was hijacked by terrorists campaigning for Palestinian liberation. The hijackers shot a crew member and a passenger and forced the plane to fly to several different African destinations. During her three days in captivity, she used a blunt pencil and an airline sickbag from the seat pocket to write two poems, \\"Commonplace\\" and \\"Yusuf (Hijacker)\\". In 1983 Noonuccal ran in the Queensland state election for the Australian Democrats political party in the Electoral district of Redlands. Her campaign focused around policies promoting the environment and Aboriginal rights.Floyd, B., Inside Story, p. 71, Boolarong Press, Salisbury. Receiving 6.4% of the primary vote, she was not elected. In 1986 she played the part of Eva in Bruce Beresford's film, The Fringe Dwellers. In December 1987, she announced she would return her MBE in protest over the Australian Government's intention to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary which she described as \\"200 years of sheer unadulterated humiliation\\" of Aboriginal people. She also announced she would change her name to Oodgeroo Noonuccal, with Oodgeroo meaning \\"paperbark tree\\" and Noonuccal (also spelt Nunukul) being her people's name.  Personal life  Noonuccal was born Kathleen Jean Mary Ruska on 3 November 1920 on North Stradbroke Island. She attended Dunwich State School and then became a domestic servant. On May 8, 1943 she married childhood friend and Brisbane waterside worker Bruce Walker at the Methodist Church, West End, Brisbane. The couple had one son Denis, but the couple later separated. She worked for Raphael and Phyllis Cilento and had a second son Vivian with the Cilentos' son Ralph junior. Denis later adopted the Indigenous name Bejam Kunmunara Jarlow Nunukel Kaboo, and Vivian adopted the Indigenous name Kabul Noonuccal, Kabul meaning carpet snake. She died from cancer on 16 September 1993 at the Repatriation General Hospital at Greenslopes, Brisbane aged 72 years and was buried at Moongalba on North Stradbroke Island. In culture A play has been written by Sam Watson entitled Oodgeroo: Bloodline to Country, based on Oodgeroo Noonuccal's real-life experience as an Aboriginal woman on board a flight hijacked by Palestinian terrorists on her way home from a committee meeting in Nigeria for the World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture Noonuccal's poetry has been set to music by numerous composers, including Christopher Gordon, Clare Maclean, Stephen Leek, Andrew Ford, Paul Stanhope, Mary Mageau, and Joseph Twist. Recognition Oodgeroo won several literary awards, including the Mary Gilmore Medal (1970), the Jessie Litchfield Award (1975), and the Fellowship of Australian Writers' Award. She received an honorary doctorate Doctorate of Letters from Macquarie University for her contribution to Australian literature. She was also made an honorary Doctor of the University by Griffith University. In 1992 Oodgeroo Noonuccal received an honorary Doctorate from the Faculty of Education Queensland University of Technology for both her contribution to literature and in recognition of her work in the field of education. In 1979, she was awarded the Sixth Annual Oscar at the Micheaux Awards Ceremony, hosted by the US Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame and in the same year received the International Acting Award for the film Shadow Sisters. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1970, but returned the award in 1987 in protest at the Australian Bicentenary celebrations in order to make a political statement about the condition of her people. In 1985, she was named Aborigine of the Year, an honour bestowed by Indigenous people. In 1991, the commemorative plaque with her name on it was one of the first installed on Sydney Writers Walk. In 1992 Queensand University of Technology (QUT) awarded her an honorary Doctorate from the Faculty of Education recognising her contributions to literature and education. In 2006 the university renamed their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Support Unit as the Oodgeroo Unit in her honour. The university also has the Oodgeroo Scholarship Program which provides undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, she was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for her role as an \\"Influential Artist\\". In 2016 the Queensland Poetry Festival introduced an indigenous program which included the inaugural Oodgeroo Noonuccal Indigenous Poetry Prize. The electoral district of Oodgeroo created in the 2017 Queensland state electoral redistribution was named after her.

She was the subject of a ¬£1.8 million National Lottery Heritage Memorial Fund grant to restore her hull. By 2014, her hull had been reconstructed and she is berthed at Gillingham Pier on the River Medway as at 2020. History PS Medway Queen was built by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company at Troon, Scotland, in 1924 for service on the River Medway and in the Thames Estuary. Trialled on the River Clyde, she was delivered to be part of the \\"Queen Line\\" fleet of the New Medway Steam Packet Company based at Rochester, Kent. She steamed on routes from Strood and Chatham, to Sheerness, Herne Bay and Margate in Kent, and to Clacton and Southend in Essex. On 3 August 1929, Medway Queen collided with Southend Pier, Essex, and suffered extensive damage to her bows. After attending the Coronation Fleet Review for King George VI at Spithead, Medway Queen was converted to oil-fired steaming by Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company in 1937. World War II Requisitioned by the Royal Navy on 9 September 1939, her first task was evacuating Kent children from Gravesend to East Anglia. She was refitted at the shipyard of the General Steam Navigation Company in Deptford Creek as a minesweeper, her stern being modified to take sweeping gear, and allocated pennant number J 48 (N 48). She served for the duration of World War II in the 10th Minesweeping Flotilla, patrolling the Strait of Dover and the English Channel. In May 1940 Operation Dynamo was launched to rescue the retreating British Army soldiers from Dunkirk in northern France. HMS Medway Queen became part of the flotilla of little ships. Medway Queen was fitted with a 12-pounder gun and two machine guns. She left with paddle steamers Sandown, Thames Queen, Gracie Fields, Queen of Thanet, Princess Elizabeth, Laguna Belle and Brighton Belle. She made seven crossings. On her first trip, soldiers were taken off the beaches in lifeboats and ferried to the ship. On her return to Dover, her arrival coincided with an air raid. She shot down a German aircraft outside the harbour. The Brighton Belle ran over sunken wreckage and began to sink. All of her passengers and crew were rescued by the Medway Queen without loss of life and, heavily overloaded, she made the harbour. On her second trip she took the soldiers directly off the beach; this required more skill, but was much faster. Soldiers used a technique with oily bags to conceal their distinctive wash from patrolling aircraft. On later trips, the Medway Queen penetrated the damaged Dunkerque port and took off men from a concrete jetty or mole. Men were discharged at Ramsgate rather than Dover, where the vessel was fuelled and reprovisioned. On Monday 3 June Vice Admiral Ramsey gave the order that all ships were to leave Dunkirk by 2.30 the following morning. This was the Medway Queens seventh trip. She was at the mole in Dunkirk when a destroyer moored astern of her was driven forwards by an explosion and smashed her starboard paddle box, she sustained considerable damage. Medway Queen limped back to Dover with 400 French soldiers on board. She gained four awards for gallantry, having shot down three enemy aircraft, made seven crossings and rescued 7000 men. In view of this remarkable achievement in rescuing so many Allied troops from France, she earned the title of \\"The Heroine of Dunkirk\\". In 1942 she was converted to a minesweeping training ship, served out the war in this capacity, and was returned to her owners in January 1946. Return to service Rebuilt by Thornycrofts of Southampton in 1946, she returned to civilian service with New Medway Steam Packet Company for the 1947 season. When Elizabeth II was crowned, Medway Queen attended the 1953 Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead. She made her last sailing on 8 September 1963, and was scheduled to be scrapped in Belgium. The Belgian ship-breaker, upon discovering that the vessel he was expecting to break up was none other than \\"The Heroine of Dunkirk\\", declined to continue (it is reported that he felt that no one should dare to destroy such a gallant and important little ship). The Daily Mail newspaper campaigned to save her. Use as nightclub Having been saved from scrapping, Medway Queen was eventually sold for use as a nightclub and marina clubhouse, and was moored at the Medway Queen Marina (now known as the Island Harbour Marina) on the Isle of Wight. The club opened in 1966. In 1970, a larger ship, PS Ryde, renamed as Ryde Queen, joined Medway Queen at the marina site, also operating as a nightclub. The two premises operated alongside one another for a period, until the Medway Queen was eventually closed and fell into disrepair.Medway Queen Preservation Society Preservation In 1994, the PS Medway Queen in Damhead Creek, Kingsnorth. The PS Medway Queen in the Albion Dry Dock, Bristol on the occasion of her rededication on 27 July 2013, during the Bristol Harbour Festival In 1978 the Medway Queen was bought by private owners with the aim of preserving her. She was moved out of the marina to the adjacent River Medina, but sank in the river when the hull sprang a leak. There she remained, in a state of increasing deterioration, until in 1984 she was salvaged, moved to Cowes at the river‚Äôs mouth, and thence towed back to Chatham in Kent on a salvage barge. In 1985 the Medway Queen Preservation Society formed, with the intention of preserving the historic ship. In 1987 she was moved to Damhead Creek, Kingsnorth on the Hoo Peninsula, but the trust lacked funds to bring her back to service, and struggled to preserve the structure. After a series of near disasters, in 2006 the National Lottery Heritage Memorial Fund agreed a ¬£1.8 million funding package to restore her structure, subject to the society raising ¬£225,000. Having completed the fund raising, the trust was disappointed that neither the insurance company or marine engineers were confident that her hull was seaworthy and able of sustaining lifting on to a pontoon. In October 2006, the Trust agreed to the deconstruction of the hull, and salvageable pieces were moved to Gillingham Pier (and a National Lottery funded warehouse) in Chatham Dockyard, in preparation of the hull being professionally restored to seaworthy condition. In October 2008, the society signed a contract with David Abels Shipbuilders to restore the hull at the Albion Dry Dock in Bristol. This to be done using plate rivetting by a team of 10, and was envisaged to take two years. Work began in April 2009 and was due to be completed in the summer of 2010. On 27 July 2013 the ship was rededicated. Plans were to float her out of the Albion Dock during the summer of 2013 and tow her back to Gillingham for a reception on 2 November. The tow home to Gillingham using the tug Christine started from Bristol on 24 October 2013, but due to weather conditions they were held up at Avonmouth until 15 November when the wind abated sufficiently, and the tow around Land's End and through the English Channel could continue in safety. At around 3pm on Friday 15 November 2013 the Medway Queen departed Avonmouth towed by the tug Christine. Benefiting from the good weather the tow continued throughout the weekend with her arriving back on her home territory on the River Medway. Despite earlier delays in commencing the tow the weather remained kind to the 'Heroine of Dunkirk' as she made the entire journey around Lands End and along the South Coast of England in one go without the need to seek shelter along the way. The tug and tow finally arrived on the River Medway on Monday 18 November 2013. Due mainly to tidal restriction the Medway Queen was buoyed in Saltpan Reach until high tide the following day. The crowds were gathered, the TV crews were in position and around 1.30pm the Medway Queen was finally in sight as she made her final leg of her journey to her new home at Gillingham Pier. Under the guidance of tug master Alan Pratt the historic vessel was brought gently into the pier at high tide.

It has been placed among the arachnomorpha, a group of arthropods that includes the chelicerates and possibly the trilobites. Their sizes range from 7 to 23 mm. Yohoia is one of the \\"great appendage\\" arthropods. All taxa have a single pair of large pre-oral jointed limbs with branched spiny ends for grasping, impaling, or filtering food items. \\"Great appendage\\" arthropods have been seen as a polyphyletic group where the appendage was independently evolved, or as a Class Megacheira including Yohoia (with Leanchoilia, Alalcomenaeus, Oestokerkus, Fortiforceps, Jianfengia, Yawunik and Isoxys) defined as euarthropods, plus the anomalocaridids, defined as a sister group to arthropods. Yohoia-like genera are small and have biramous limbs with a walking segment, while anamolocarids are larger animals without limbs except for the great appendage. However, biramous limbs have been described in the Devonian anamolocarid Schinderhannes. While Yohoia and similar-appearing taxa may be paraphyletic, the \\"great appendage\\" arthropods may all be stem-group chelicerates, with the \\"great appendage\\" parallel to the chelicerae of spiders. Specimens of Yohoia have a head shield which is followed by 13 trunk tergites, or plates. On both sides, the bottom side of the first 10 of these ended in backward-pointing, triangular points or projections. The last three plates were complete tubes, circling the entire trunk. At the end of the trunk was a paddle-like tail. There were also a pair of large extensions at the front of the head shield. They had a pronounced \\"elbow\\" and ended in four long spines, looking rather like fingers. There were three appendages on the bottom of the head shield on each side, and these are assumed to have supported the creature on the sandy or silty sea bottom. There were also single appendages hanging down under the body plates which were flap-like and fringed with setae, probably used for swimming and respiration. Specimens also show some bulbous formations at the front of the head shield that may have served as eyes.Fossils of the Burgess Shale Yohoia is assumed to have been a mainly benthic (bottom-dwelling) creature that swam just above the muddy ocean floor, using its appendages to scavenge or capture prey.

Historically the expression was sometimes used to describe devices used to power battery-driven equipment from mains electricity. This is still the case in many products offered in retail electronic supply stores.  Radio-controlled (R/C) models  In an electric-powered radio controlled model, the BEC is typically part of the electronic speed control (ESC). BEC allows such a model to carry only one battery (the motive power battery) instead of two (motive power, and a separate battery to operate the R/C equipment). A BEC-equipped ESC meant for airplane use often incorporates a low-voltage-cutoff (LVC) circuit which can sense the voltage drop caused when the battery has little charge left. It then cuts the power to the 'drive' motor in order to provide the 'steering' servo(s) with enough power to be able to bring the model safely back to the operator. The power to the propeller is cut but the operation of the control surfaces would be maintained in order to perform a dead-stick landing. Without this feature, all control would be lost when the battery expired, probably resulting in the destruction of the model. In some cases, the BEC is part of the radio control receiver, instead of being part of the ESC. R/C BECs in their simplest form use a linear fixed voltage regulator with its standard circuit suggested in the manufacturer's datasheet ‚Äì usually the power supply of the receiver needs 5 V. Low-drop types are preferred ‚Äì especially for batteries with only a few cells. For small models, 1.5 to 2 A are enough; for mid-size models a 3 A type needs to be considered. BECs for large models have to provide current of 5 A or more. In this case, a more complicated switching mode regulator should be used, as the switching mode BECs are more electrically efficient than linear regulator BECs. The power dissipation losses in a linear regulator BEC are a product of the difference between the target voltage of 5 volts and the voltage of the main battery multiplied by the required current. For example, take a 10-cell NiMh accumulator with a normal voltage of 12 volts. With a peak current of 5 A, the BEC will have losses of (12 V ‚àí 5 V) √ó 5 A = 35 W. With a linear regulator, these 35 W will be converted to heat and so require a large heat sink. This is an efficiency of (5 V / 12 V) = 41.7%. However, a switching mode regulator with a buck step-down supply can achieve over 90% efficiency.Basic Concepts of Linear Regulator and Switching Mode Power Supplies - http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/application-note/AN140fa.pdf In all cases, it is a good idea to mount some large capacitors to buffer the regulated output. In large plane or ship models, another possibility is to buffer the power supply with a further capacitor near the actuators (servos). More recent uses for R/C BECs are converting higher voltage lithium polymer battery packs to 12 V. This has occurred due to the increased popularity of camera equipment for FPV use. Several BEC manufacturers offer a BEC (voltage regulator) for this purpose and people may become confused as this is 'out of the ordinary' to use a BEC for a 12 V application. BECs also come in several forms, SBEC & UBEC being the main variety. See Voltage regulator  Vehicles  BECs are also used in some motorcycle and ATV applications to reduce the weight penalty involved in carrying a battery. The battery is typically replaced by one or more large but light-weight capacitors which smooth out the fluctuating electrical pulses coming from the alternator, without themselves generating power. As there is no electrical power source, electrical starters cannot be used.

Most of its first two dozen chapters were granted to schools in New England and Pennsylvania; therefore its early development was strongly Eastern in character, eventually operating chapters at six of the eight Ivy League schools as well as more egalitarian state schools. It later expanded to the South and West. According to its Constitution, Phi Sigma Kappa is devoted to the promotion of its three Cardinal Principles: the \\"Promotion of Brotherhood\\", the \\"Stimulation of Scholarship\\", and the \\"Development of Character\\". Phi Sigma Kappa began on March 15, 1873 at Massachusetts Agricultural College in Amherst (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst) by six sophomores (referred to as The Founders). Phi Sigma Epsilon merged with Phi Sigma Kappa in 1985, which was the largest merger of Greek-letter fraternities. History Founding UMass. Present structure was built in 1914 and fully renovated at the building's centennial in 2014 Massachusetts Agricultural College in Amherst, now the University of Massachusetts Amherst, was the setting for the founding of Phi Sigma Kappa. Among its other students in the early 1870s, it had attracted six men of varied backgrounds, ages, abilities, and goals in life who saw the need for a new and different kind of society on campus. Early members recalled that it was Henry Hague who suggested that, since the six were close and were not interested in either of the two local fraternities on campus, they create their own. The six sophomores, meeting in Old North Hall, banded together during the summer of 1873 to form a \\"society to promote morality, learning and social culture.\\" The six Founders of Phi Sigma Kappa were: * Jabez William Clay * Joseph Francis Barrett * Henry Hague * Xenos Young Clark * Frederick George Campbell * William Penn Brooks The six were active college students, members of literary and academic societies and athletic groups, and editors of campus publications. Three were military lieutenants and Brooks was a captain. Hague and Brooks even ran the college store. Academic leaders as well, \\"it cannot be too strongly stressed that these men were the best students in [the] college.\\" On March 15, 1873, the Founders met in secret. Brooks already had prepared a constitution and symbolism, and Hague had designed a ritual. The first meeting seemed destined to succeed, for the individuals all had done their work well. The ritual has been changed only six times since, and never drastically. The symbolism and esoteric structure have never been altered. Clay was elected president of the group‚Äîwhich for its first five years had no name. Its cryptic characters could not be pronounced, either, though Brooks recalled that outsiders referred to them as \\"T, double T, T upside-down.\\" The Kinney Coat of Arms was suggested early in Phi Sigma Kappa's development as an official crest. It was not adopted, but remains in occasional, informal use as an artistic favorite. Grand Chapter The Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa was organized in 1878, five years after the founding of Alpha Chapter, to tie alumni and undergraduates in a continuing relationship. Charles Sumner Howe, an 1876 initiate, was elected its first Grand President (at the age of 20). Phi Sigma Kappa was adopted as the group's official name that same year after four years of debate and the work of seven committees. Expansion Originally, only one chapter was contemplated by the founders. And although the germ of expansion arrived early, its period of gestation consumed 13 years. As early as 1875 an inquiry had been received from a group at Maine Agricultural College, and a few years later there was an unexpected letter from the University of New Mexico-but nothing came of either \\"feeler.\\" In 1878, John A. Cutter was inducted into the group, a man destined to have much to do with the preservation of the order's early records and with its expansion beyond the confines of the Massachusetts campus. Graduating from Aggie he went on to attend Albany Medical College (which in 1873 had become a unit of Union College), and established a group which became Beta Chapter (1888). Home of Œ¶Œ£Œö's Beta chapter, at Union College, 1910Cutter was also instrumental in the establishment of Gamma at Cornell (1889). The transition to a national order was accomplished. These same early years saw the pin (or badge) adopted essentially as it is today; an induction ritual, which embodied the concept of universal brotherhood and expanded the order's horizons beyond Massachusetts, was written in 1890; the establishment of the Fraternity's magazine, The Signet, and the first chapter out of the Northeast came into being at West Virginia University (1891). Home of Œ¶Œ£Œö's Gamma Chapter, at Cornell University, circa 1903, fully renovated today \\"Bigness was never one of our ideas,\\" Big Chief Barrett said in later years, admonishing a convention that was getting starry-eyed over dozens of new expansion possibilities. And the principle has held; though Phi Sigma Kappa stands high among national orders, size alone has never been a major consideration or goal. Œ¶Œ£Œö's Phi Chapter, at Swarthmore College in 1914 Phi Sig's value to other campuses was as an organization offering something special and valuable to persons of varying backgrounds. Massachusetts Agricultural ‚àí Aggie ‚àí was more egalitarian, open to men of average means but high potential, and not filled with the class-conscious scions of Boston and New York society. In many ways it has kept this ethic throughout its expansion. It never was simply another fraternity to be invited. Founder Brooks, four years before his death in 1938, put it this way: \\"We believe that our fraternity exerts a powerful influence for good in national college life. The thought which lay in the minds of the Founders was good. May our brothers never forget that the foundation for a useful and satisfying life must be thought -- thought resulting in the visualization of a high ideal; and the determination to use all of one's strength of body, mind and soul for its realization.\\" During the final decade of the 19th Century, careful expansion nevertheless led to solid chapters at Yale (Sachem Hall), Columbia, Maryland, Penn State and Penn, among other storied schools. Dartmouth, Brown, and MIT followed soon after. Eventually Phi Sig was present at six of the eight Ivy League schools; even Canadian campuses were not excluded in the thinking of those who carried new chapters in all directions shortly after the turn of the century. Rho Chapter was organized at Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario in 1903, and seventeen other units were added during the decade. Under Cutter's and Barrett's leadership, the national organization was strengthened, and work was begun among the alumni to support their continued interest in the Fraternity after graduation. The Greek system's uniqueness among American organizations is based partly on this principle ‚Äì the idea of continued involvement for members after undergraduate days. Phi Sigma Kappa was one of the early leaders in such efforts and remains one of the strongest alumni-oriented groups. If Founder Brooks' assessment of its purpose is true, then there would be no end to the Fraternity's influence on its members, and its role in their lives‚Äîanother vital part of Phi Sig's heritage. Home of Œ¶Œ£Œö's Epsilon chapter, Sachem Hall, at Yale, 124 Prospect Street, in 1907Though the admonition against \\"bigness for bigness' sake\\" was always there, the demand to serve campuses wherever they might be was equally loud. In 1909, for example (after the Grand Council had earlier refused to put a chapter on the West Coast because of the distance involved and because it feared such a chapter would be denied the visits and services of a nearby headquarters), the Fraternity spanned the continent. The Ridge Road Club of the University of California, Berkeley became Omega Chapter‚Äîfittingly utilizing the last letter of the Greek alphabet and preparing the way for the first of the Deuteron or second-series units. This national aspect did not escape the notice of the mid-continent; within six months, petitions were received from Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa State. In all, fourteen new chapters were established in the first decade of the new century. Some who were there tell that the induction ceremonies at the early Deuteron units often included a reminder in the form of Founder Hague's benediction on the night of March 15, 1873, words that still ring of idealism and true worth:UMass Amherst > Let us ... keep on growing till our beloved fraternity shall become full > grown ..., having the strength to help and protect its members, wisdom to > guide them to helpful and good things as to college life, and love so warm > that its members shall feel its kindly glow, that brotherly love may indeed > be a reality and not an idea. Phi Sigma Kappa became a founding member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, or NIC, in 1910. To honor the Founders, on May 12, 1923, members unveiled \\"The Shrine\\" on the wall of Old North College, the site of the first meetings of the Fraternity. This memorial was moved to the entrance of Machmer Hall in 1957 when Old North was razed.A website at UMass showing the Machmer Hall entrance, and the Shrine , accessed 23 April 2014 In the 1920s the fraternity continued to grow, especially into the land grant institutions, with establishment of chapters at Oregon State, Stanford, Tennessee, Alabama, Ohio State, Kentucky, Washington, Oregon, South Carolina and others, twenty- five in all. The Crash of 1929 Home of Œ¶Œ£Œö's Beta Deuteron chapter, at Minnesota, circa 1933Phi Sig did not escape the Great Depression; no fraternal order did. But like many of them, she came out of it wiser and stronger for the experience, filled with the knowledge that brotherhood based on a heritage of helpfulness and value cannot be submerged by a flood of economic hardship. Nationally, chapters of all fraternities existing at the start of the new century were wooed into increasingly expansive building projects in the boom years leading up to the Great Depression. The economic downturn became the great leveler; chapters who had extended themselves beyond their means were felled by sharply reduced revenues and growing debt. Within Phi Sig, closely tied as it was to its graduates, alumni were called in to support weakened balance sheets on buildings the undergraduate population alone could no longer afford. In one famous but probably not unique case, chapter advisor Sam Gale went door to door in 1931, successfully seeking alumni backing against the mortgage of Minnesota's newly built Tudor masterpiece. Not only was this impulse acted on at the alumni level: The Fraternity's undergraduate delegates, moved by the plight of their brethren, had fathered a plan at the 1930 Convention that channeled 25 cents each month from each active member (about $10 per month, per man, in 2013 dollars) into a fund to assist chapters stricken by the Depression; the principal of mutual helpfulness could not have been better illustrated. Low manpower, too, had brought about fraternal belt- tightening where possible, while still investing in tactical, significant national services - training in rushing techniques, a pledge manual, better accounting systems and visits by field representatives. Chapter growth slowed, as the fraternity sought to shore up its existing chapters. However, in its sixth decade Phi Sigma Kappa nevertheless established chapters at Purdue, American University, and Montana State. Perhaps the most significant development of these years came out of the 1934 Convention in Ann Arbor. Brother Stewart W. Herman of Gettysburg wrote and presented the Phi Sigma Kappa Creed, and Brother Ralph Watts of Massachusetts drafted and presented the fraternity's Cardinal Principles. More than half-century later they stand as Phi Sigma Kappa's heritage personified, as much a part of the Fraternity's individuality as any of its more ancient rituals and symbolism. World War II The 1938 Convention adopted the six-degree membership structure to honor the six Founders, especially as a tribute to Founder Brooks, who had died only a few weeks earlier. The first professional manager of the Fraternity was hired that same year, marking still another organizational response to growing needs in a critical period. For the hardships of World War I and the Great Depression were scarcely overcome when World War II arrived. The extraordinary efforts by which the Fraternity survived are another and longer story; the important fact is that Phi Sig did survive. The 1948 Convention in Boston marked the 75th anniversary of the founding. There were 52 active chapters; the Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation had been established, primarily to reward good scholarship among brothers; and The Signet was guaranteed to all members for life under a plan that had few parallels in the Greek world at that time.

(Spec) Collins of Iowa, one of the Fraternity's most dynamic leaders of the post-World War II years, reaffirmed the heritage in more modern terms: Home of Œ¶Œ£Œö's Delta chapter, at West Virginia, circa 1941. A recent addition extends to the back.\\"The Founders very wisely developed the ritual and philosophy of the fraternity on the basis of service to its members. The Cardinal Principles of Phi Sigma Kappa are the development of brotherhood, scholarship and character ... There is nothing in our Cardinal Principles about prestige, the most beautiful house, the best social program, [being] 'number one on campus' in intramurals, activities, etc. These are all frosting on the cake. A fraternity chapter which truly serves its purpose helps its members in their own personal development. Thus I do not believe a chapter, which pledges students who are already top scholars and which wins a scholarship cup year-in and year-out, performs any distinctive service. That chapter which pledges average students, however, and encourages them in developing their own academic capabilities to the utmost, deserves the scholarship cup. The same is true of character. If we pledge only the most polished and mature individuals, there is little left for the chapter to do for these people. The fraternity can and should take average college students and help them develop their own character, and help them learn to live together in brotherhood.\\" Home of Œ¶Œ£Œö's Nu chapter, at Lehigh, circa 1948 \\"My fraternity did something for me when I was in school. It helped me to learn to live with others and to develop my own personal, moral, and social attributes, so that I could fit better into the society which I found when I left the University. The services of fraternity supplemented those of my family, my church and my teachers. For this reason I am willing to continue to work for my fraternity -- so long as my fraternity is working to serve its individual members.\\" Post-war restoration The massive post-war influx of GIs to collegiate campuses brought with it a class of men of maturity, and literally, battle-tested experiences of fraternal bonding. For a time, a significant percentage of Phi Sigma Kappa's active members were married. The fraternal magazine was expanded to celebrate marriages and births as counterpoint to the solemn roster of Gold Stars - servicemen brothers who had been killed in action - or the lists of those still serving. The Signet carried popular interest stories about member wartime experiences, first hand accounts by seasoned correspondents, and even geopolitical essays. Demand led to aggressive growth and an expansion of chapters once again; Now, where so many members had served overseas or traveled extensively, awareness and interest in the doings of chapters in distant states became more apparent. Sporting heroes were celebrated. Lists of national collegiate football, basketball and baseball \\"All Phi Sig\\" teams were published and scrutinized. Local programs grew quickly into national events. One example is Phi Sigma Kappa's \\"Moonlight Girl\\", a chapter sweetheart contest that rivaled the \\"Sweetheart of Sigma Chi\\" as the premier sweetheart pageant of the fraternity world. For a dozen years, The Signet printed photos of many of the winners of local chapter contests for a popular write-in election for the national Moonlight Girl. The winner would travel, with her escort, to the national convention, there to entertain the delegates with songs and conversation. This popular appearance would be underwritten by the Fraternity and served to increase attendance. Moonlight Girl continues as a local tradition at a handful of chapters, including Minnesota. The popular Moonlight Girl song was heard around pianos at chapters across the nation: :When we find a girl with golden hair, :And eyes of shining blue, :With lips so rare, and a skin so fair, :And a heart that shall ever be true. : :Then we'll love her and cherish her through the years, :Singing this old refrain, :She's the beautiful sweetheart of old Phi Sig, :In our hearts she will e'er remain. The Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation (PSKF) was formed as a separate legal entity in 1947 to provide scholarships to undergraduates and program support. It has proven to be the financial backbone of the fraternity due to its support of member development and leadership programming and publications. Home of Œ¶Œ£Œö's Kappa chapter, at Penn State, circa 1950 Post World War II Following World War II the fraternity (along with other Greek organizations) faced issues related to segregation, hazing, and academics. During the 1950s, Phi Sigma Kappa removed racial restrictions on membership, worked with other NIC fraternities to eliminate hazing, and revising its membership education program to reflect such changes. During this time membership in Greek organizations declined significantly and some chapters were again lost. Civil rights Phi Sigma Kappa, like almost all fraternities and sororities formed prior to the Civil Rights Movement, had previously not taken in minorities in any scale except for the occasional foreign student. At the 1952 Bedford Springs Convention some chapters, mainly outside of New England and the East, wanted an understanding that no chapter would pledge \\"negroes,\\" and offered legislation to this end called \\"The Bedford Resolution.\\" The Bedford Resolution read, \\"That the fraternity's tradition be maintained in the sense that there be no pledging or initiating of Negro men until such time as they are acceptable to all chapters.\\" The Bedford Resolution narrowly passed. Immediately after, Phi Sigma Kappa lost several chapters due to negative reaction to the resolution. The Alpha Triton Chapter at Wesleyan University disaffiliated itself rather than de-pledge a black student it had pledged in good faith, and reformed itself as a local, Gamma Psi. Chapters at Boston University, Hartwick College and Knox College were expelled from the Grand Chapter in 1953-55 for each pledging an African-American student, reverting to their former local status. Tau Chapter at Dartmouth College disaffiliated from Phi Sigma Kappa, citing \\"racist membership policies\\" of the fraternity as its motivation. Tau became a local fraternity, and eventually the co-ed organization of Phi Tau, in May 1956. Of the chapters that left during the debate, only Tau still operates. In a letter dated June 28, 1954, D.R. \\"Spec\\" Collins, the then-President of Phi Sigma Kappa, announced that from his point of view, \\"the entire fraternity system-which is truly an American institution engaged in the service of building good American citizens‚Äìis being challenged. Challenged by those subversive elements who, by encouraging us to quarrel among ourselves may cause us to destroy ourselves. The 'divide and conquer strategy' that might well eliminate a great American institution.\\" President Collins warned that the anti-discrimination issue would be raised at the next Phi Sigma Kappa convention. The Bedford Resolution was a policy and was more easily changed than a constitutional measure or bylaw. Two years after its passage, at the 1954 Convention the Bedford Resolution was repealed in favor of a non-legislative \\"Gentlemen's Agreement\\" to ban non-whites. This much weaker, short-lived, informal agreement also encouraged local chapters not to admit minorities to membership. Home of Œ¶Œ£Œö's Phi Chapter, at Swarthmore, circa 1944 Two years later, at the 1956 Convention the Gentlemen's Agreement was also dropped leaving no race restrictions. Immediately following the 1956 Convention, Phi Chapter at Swarthmore, in Pennsylvania, pledged a black man from the Gold Coast. The Grand President simply took the stance that he would not suspend the chapter, since neither the Bedford Resolution, nor any other agreement was in place. At the 1958 Convention there was little discussion of the matter. In 2009 some delegates to that year's convention felt that a definitive statement on the issue of discrimination should be incorporated into the Constitution itself. Phi Sigma Kappa amended its constitution to include the following nondiscrimination clause, largely intended as a formality: > \\"No chapter shall discriminate in recruitment or in membership based on > race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, ethnic background, > sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, parental status, or > political affiliation.\\" Merger Phi Sigma Kappa first discussed mergers at the onset of World War II when most fraternities were in danger of falling apart as students went to war. The issue was not discussed seriously again on a national level for decades. In 1980, a Phi Sigma Kappa Council meeting included the subject of mergers on its agenda. The outcome of the discussion was the conclusion that Phi Sigma Kappa would only participate in a merger if it was the continuing fraternity: Phi Sigma Kappa was open to absorbing a smaller fraternity. In 1984, a chapter of Phi Sigma Epsilon placed a call to the national headquarters of Phi Sigma Kappa to discuss the fact that several Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters were unhappy with the services of their national organization and that they were interested in Phi Sigma Kappa's expansion efforts. These chapters were considering a change in national affiliation which is not possible under rules of the NIC. A call was made between the presidents of both national organizations but a merger was not explored. Later on in the fall of 1984, the two fraternities were placed next to each other at a table during the NIC conference. Discussions commenced and the members at the conference discovered that they had more in common than the first two letters of their respective fraternity's names. Phi Sigma Epsilon's beliefs in justice, wisdom, and honor closely paralleled Phi Sigma Kappa's cardinal principles of brotherhood, scholarship, and character. Phi Sigma Epsilon was in the midst of difficult administrative and financial circumstances and most chapters were in the interior of the contiguous United States. Phi Sigma Kappa, although relatively strong both administratively and financially, was concentrated on the east and west coasts of the country. It was found that both organizations had similar rituals upon the report of a brother of Phi Sigma Epsilon who had become an adviser of a Phi Sigma Kappa chapter. That chapter had allowed the faculty adviser to view the rituals of Phi Sigma Kappa. This was an error on the part of the Phi Sigma Kappa chapter but it allowed the two national organizations to otherwise resolve the awkward question of how similar their secrets were. Chapter questionnaires, meetings, and communications regarding a merger would occupy both fraternities over the course of several months. Phi Sigma Epsilon narrowly voted in favor of the merger in June 1985. Phi Sigma Kappa's convention was not until August but initial responses were overwhelmingly positive. On August 14, 1985, the merger was approved and formalized. In a stroke of good fortune for the two national bodies there was only one school, Cornell University, which had active chapters of both fraternities. Younger, and smaller, the Phi Sigma Epsilon chapter was released to affiliate with another national fraternity. Phi Sigma Kappa's Court of Honor was expanded to include all past presidents of Phi Sigma Epsilon. Shannon Flowers of PSE agreed to serve as the new Recorder for that entity. The Grand Council was expanded to include PSE's past president James Whitfield and former vice-president Larry Beck. The Ritual of Association was rewritten to include significant portions of the Phi Sigma Epsilon ritual, and the PSE ritual itself was cast into the form of a special lecture to be added to the ritual book of all chapters for use on particular occasions. The co-author of Phi Sigma Epsilon's ritual, Fred Schwengel, a strong supporter of the Merger, assisted in the incorporation of the two rituals. At the Convention in 1987 in Long Beach, California, two years following the merger, the crest, Associate Member (pledge) pin and flag were changed in order to incorporate the symbolism of Phi Sigma Epsilon.The Signet Ring of Phi Sigma Kappa Alumni of PSE chapters that merged into Phi Sigma Kappa are accorded the same rank or honors as they held in PSE. The PSE badge is honored as equivalent to a PSK badge for those alumni who choose to wear it. Where Phi Sigma Kappa HQ has accurate mailing addresses, they also receive Fraternity mailings and chapter news. Dissension Almost all Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters and all Phi Sigma Kappa chapters participated in the merger, which was noted as the largest and most successful collegiate fraternal merger ever. Leaders of both fraternities made great attempts to be sensitive to the pain of change and emotions of loss that any such merger would naturally entail. There were pockets of dissent, and not all chapters nor all alumni of Phi Sigma Epsilon participated. Soon after the merger, unable or unwilling to commit to another national, the former PSE chapter at Cornell was released, and its building was sold to Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Other PSE chapters were found to be non-viable or had simply vanished in the time since a PSE officer had last visited or corresponded, and these were formally closed. Eventually, following several disaffected alumni leaders of Phi Sigma Epsilon, seven PSE groups would go on to form Phi Sigma Phi in 1988. Today, both fraternities seek to focus on their own futures, and maintain a posture of civility and cooperation on those occasions where they cross paths. Considering their shared history and the economic difficulties of supporting full-time operations with a small base of chapter revenue, Phi Sigma Kappa has consistently maintained it would welcome future inquiries toward cooperation from Phi Sigma Phi and her chapters, as a homecoming. Phi Sigma Kappa continues to teach new members its enlarged historical record, marking milestones of both original fraternities. Present More recently, expansion efforts have been increased, and now somewhat outpace chapter closures, bringing in schools where Phi Sigma Kappa has not had an historical presence, as well as revitalizing troubled groups or dormant groups. This period of expansion has been entwined with an assertive effort to ensure the many surviving former Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters were fully integrated into the larger Fraternity, and fully served. Several have had to be re-colonized, an effort that continues today. Aggressive risk management training has allowed Phi Sig to avoid, for the most part, headline-making news about hazing incidents. Key expansion targets, and the return to long-established campuses where chapters have been lost has been another focus. While the Fraternity has not lost sight of the attitude of its Founders to not seek bigness for its own sake, Phi Sigma Kappa's Grand Council affirmed a desire for purposeful expansion in the 1980s and 90s which has enhanced its ability to provide the programs and services expected of a strong international fraternity. Since the merger, Phi Sigma Kappa has grown at a rate of at least two chapters per year. On many campuses, provision of suitable housing remains the biggest challenge for a new colony. Phi Sigma Kappa Properties (PSKP), a separate legal entity, was created in 2002 to address this issue in areas of management, finding and funding buildings, dissemination of best practices for alumni holding companies, and building improvements for Phi Sig chapters nationwide.PSKP website, accessed 20 April 2019 See also the list of Active and Dormant Chapters and Colonies. Naming system Old North Hall, site of Œ¶Œ£Œö's founding in 1873, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.Chapters are individually designated by a Chapter Name. The original 24 chapters are called, in order, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc., thru to Omega. Following this, the \\"Deuteron\\" series began with Alpha Deuteron, then Beta Deuteron, Gamma Deuteron, and continuing through to Omega Deuteron. As of 2010, eight naming series have been established. Several other fraternities and sororities use a similar naming system. The Greek-based designations used by Phi Sigma Kappa include: :Original Series, Alpha through Omega :Deuteron Series, or second series, beginning with Alpha Deuteron :Triton Series, or third series :Tetarton Series, or fourth series :Pentaton Series, or fifth series :Hexaton Series, or sixth series :Septaton Series, or seventh series :Octaton Series, or eighth series Phi Sigma Epsilon brought its own naming system to the Fraternity. In respect to the sensitivity of the merger in general, it was quickly decided that incoming PSE chapters could with pride maintain either their original chapter names or a chapter name that evoked their source in PSE. These naming series are: :Epsilon Series, original oldest 24 PSE chapters :Phi Series, second PSE series :Sigma Series, third PSE series Additionally, the three founding chapters of Phi Sigma Epsilon were honored by reversing in their names the letters \\"Epsilon Alpha\\" into Alpha Epsilon, \\"Epsilon Beta\\" into Beta Epsilon, and \\"Epsilon Gamma\\" into Gamma Epsilon, signifying their role in the formation of Phi Sigma Epsilon. The fourth oldest PSE chapter is Epsilon Delta, with the naming convention remaining more or less consistent, depending on the age of the chapter, and with some exceptions to match most closely the original names of those chapters. Chapter lists are rendered in order of the original date of chapter founding. Re-colonizations where both groups existed but where they both are dormant usually take on the name of the older dormant chapter, although some exceptions have been made if the alumni base has a clear preference. New chapters where there has been neither a PSK nor PSE chapter will continue the Octaton series, or further series, as needed. Organization and legal status Phi Sigma Kappa is divided into three distinct entities: Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation, and Phi Sigma Kappa Properties. The Phi Sigma Kappa International Headquarters is staffed by administrators who handle many of the day-to-day operations in the fraternity as well as coordinate and plan many events, meetings, and other programs held by the Grand Chapter and the Foundation. Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity Management of the Fraternity (PSK) on a day- to-day basis is vested in the executive director, Nick Zuniga. He and twelve full-time staff members support all aspects of chapter operations, expansion, alumni relations, program development, risk management and event coordination. Phi Sigma Kappa's Grand Council operates as its volunteer Board of Directors, composed of one grand president and six directors who guide the Fraternity's future and ensure the implementation of its policies. Regional Advisers are a liaison between the Fraternity's national officers and undergraduates. Local Chapter Advisors often serve as another key point of contact between Regional and National staff or volunteers, to the local chapter. Some individual Phi Sigma Kappa chapters may work with local alumni- or parent-led housing corporations of their own to manage chapter housing, or may work with Phi Sigma Kappa Properties to achieve this same purpose. Local chapter house corporations are separate legal entities from the national structure. Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation The Foundation (PSKF), incorporated as an entity separate from the Grand Chapter in 1947, serves as the financial backbone of the fraternity. It is facilitated by a Board of Trustees which appropriates funds for various programs and scholarships administered by the Grand Council. The money for this comes from member dues, pledges, and donations. The Foundation is immensely important to the growth and maintenance of the Fraternity. Some of the programs it funds are the Leadership School, Undergraduate Scholarships, the Grand Chapter website, and Regional Conclaves. Phi Sigma Kappa Properties Phi Sigma Kappa Properties (PSKP) is the newest of the three Phi Sigma Kappa entities but plans to become a full service real estate management and development corporation. PSKP held a long- range planning meeting in August 2005, which was facilitated by Grand Council Director Tim Vojtasko. The organization developed a set of five long-range goals for the next five years and beyond. Those goals include: * To become the largest (assets owned and managed) property management organization in the Fraternity world * To double the number of houses owned by a PSK related entity; also 40 houses (owned and managed) in 5 years * To hire an executive director/CFO with a complete staff of 5 within 5 years * To develop a world- class model for owning, managing and financing fraternity properties * To be able to offer all PSK related properties the opportunity to be owned and/or managed by PSKP Emblems and operational structure Pin The official pin consists of the three Greek letters (Œ¶Œ£Œö). The letter Œ¶ may be plain gold or crown set with fifteen whole pearls and is superimposed upon a rose engraved and rose finished chased gold Œ£ to the left and Œö to the right. As a mark of distinction, Council members may wear a ruby instead of a pearl as the center jewel and national presidents are presented with a badge set with diamonds instead of pearls, and with a ruby as the center jewel. Appointive officers may wear an emerald instead of a pearl as their center jewel. The pledge pin used to be a red button approximately 3/8 inch in diameter. That pin was surrounded by a silver band in which the original Three T characters of the society were inset in silver. After the adoption of the merger symbolism, the circle and Triple T's characters were circumscribed by a slightly larger triangle of silver. Phi Sigma Kappa continues to recognize the Phi Sigma Epsilon badge for those brothers who received it prior to the merger of the two fraternities. Flag A fake Phi Sigma Kappa Flag, as sold by an unlicensed vendor. Note the incorrect placement of the triangle at top. The official flag is 7x5 feet in dimension and includes three horizontal bars of equal height. The bottom bar is red and symbolizes First and Second Degree members, the foundation of the fraternity. The middle bar is silver for Third and Fourth Degree members, indicative of the field of fraternal service. The Greek letters Œ¶Œ£Œö are located in the center of this bar. The top bar, also red, commemorates Fifth and Sixth Degree members, indicative of Grand Chapter recognition. The silver and red tumbling T's logo inscribed in a triangle of silver is located at the left end of the upper bar. This flag was adopted at the 1987 Convention, prior to this, Phi Sigma Kappa's flag bore the Triple T's set alone in a round border, without the triangle, and used the old colors of silver and magenta in an otherwise identical layout. Flowers The original flower of Phi Sigma Kappa was the red carnation. With the Merger, the Fraternity added a second flower, the White Tea Rose, which had been honored by Phi Sigma Epsilon. Phi Sigma Kappa now recognizes both flowers with equal deference. Membership Membership in Phi Sigma Kappa is available to male students attending a college, university, technical institute, or community college with a Phi Sigma Kappa chapter, provided the man is not a member of a nationally recognized social collegiate fraternity. This opportunity extends not only to undergraduates but also faculty, graduate students, and former students. Membership is also possible at a chapter elsewhere than the man's place of higher education if his school lacks a chapter. Additionally, honorary membership is provided for in the Constitution and Bylaws of the Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa. Specific requirements for membership may vary between places of higher education and chapters but minimum requirements are nationally legislated. Membership in Phi Sigma Kappa can be dissolved only by death or expulsion. Degrees of membership * First Degree: members of undergraduate chapters * Second Degree: members elected to symbolic offices * Third Degree: alumni and those initiated as graduates, former students, faculty, or honorary members * Fourth Degree: members appointed to an office by the Grand Council or Grand President, past or present * Fifth Degree: members elected to the Grand Council, past or present * Sixth Degree: members who have been elected Grand President, past or present Local chapter executive boards Each chapter's executive board is composed of six officers according to the ritual of Phi Sigma Kappa: * President - Presides over the entire chapter and other executive board members * Vice President - Manages chapter committees * Secretary - Records the minutes and handles correspondence * Treasurer - Works with the chapter's finances * Sentinel - Guards and presides over chapter rituals and also manages risk * Inductor - Presides over the current class of associates Other officers and committee chairman Depending on their specific size and needs, many chapters have a number of chairmen assigned to a variety of tasks. The specific titles, duties, and organization of these chairmen are suggested by the Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa, but are not regulated and differ greatly between chapters. Examples include: * House Manager - Responsible for maintenance of chapter housing facilities, * Rush Chairman - Manages recruitment * Alumni Relations Chairman - Designated contact person for alumni. Often Presidents have this role. * Social Chairman - Manages social events * Philanthropy Chairman - Manages chapter charitable endeavors * IFC Representative - Attends inter- Greek coordinating meetings as chapter liaison. Often Presidents have this role.

The victims, 13 of whom were Tai Poutini Polytechnic students, fell onto rocks below. The tragedy resulted in wide criticism of the government and its policies towards funding and management of the conservation estate. Denis Marshall, New Zealand's Minister of Conservation, eventually resigned, after the Commission of Inquiry's report came out. It also resulted in major changes to procedures used by the New Zealand Department of Conservation after it was revealed that serious systemic failures had led to the building of the unstable platform. Eventual changes in New Zealand Law, following a change of government, allowed for government departments to be held criminally liable for inadequate building practices, in the same way as non-government organisations.  Background  Cave Creek is a small stream in Paparoa National Park. The viewing platform was erected by the Department of Conservation (DOC) in April 1994, and looked out over a 40-metre chasm with a view of where the creek emerges from a cave system below. The builders of the platform did not have appropriate qualifications for the job. Twelve major problems or oversights occurred during the platform's construction, including nails being used to connect the bearers to the piles instead of bolts as no drill was brought. The platform was highly unsafe, especially with large numbers of people on it.  The platform collapse  On the day of the incident, a group of students from Tai Poutini Polytechnic in Greymouth visited the park. En route through the bush, a small group consisting of the polytechnic tutor, a Department of Conservation (DOC) officer and three students split off while the larger group of 17 students and another DOC officer continued towards the platform. The larger group reached the platform first, and walked to the edge together at about 11:25 a.m. Several students started shaking the platform and it toppled forward into the chasm. The DOC officer and 13 of the students were killed. Four students survived the collapse with serious injuries. The second group reached the location shortly after the collapse. Having realised what happened, the remaining DOC officer and one of the students ran back to the start of the track for help, but on arriving they found that the keys were not in the group's vehicles. At this point, the DOC officer returned to the scene of the accident while the student ran along the road with a note containing information about the location of the accident. By 12:15 p.m., he had managed to phone the police at Greymouth. The remoteness of the site made it difficult for medical services to assist the survivors. The first person to reach the scene was a Greymouth police constable, who arrived on foot two hours after the accident. Ambulances from Greymouth and Westport and helicopters from Christchurch arrived only later.  The Commission of Inquiry  A Commission of Inquiry into the accident, headed by District Judge Graeme Noble, highlighted a number of serious concerns with the Department of Conservation's construction of the platform. Specific concerns that were raised included: * The platform had not been designed or approved by a qualified engineer. * None of the people involved in building the platform were qualified engineers. * Nails were used to secure the platform instead of bolts (as intended by the design), because an appropriate drill had not been taken to the building site. * The steps to the platform, which were supposed to be attached as a counterweight, had not been properly attached. * A Building Consent had never been obtained for the platform. By the time this was realised, the plans had been lost and replacement (and incorrect) schematics were hastily drawn by an unqualified volunteer exchange student so as to lodge a retrospective application. Further confusion about the Building Act then resulted in the consent never being lodged. * The platform was not listed in any register that would have resulted in regular inspections. * A warning sign for the platform, suggesting a maximum limit of five people, had been ordered but was never installed at the site. Besides the specific flaws in the actual platform and methods of its construction, the Commission said the \\"root causes\\" of the collapse were systemic problems in the Department as a whole, noting that the Department was seriously under-funded and under-resourced. The Commission found that the Department had not been given sufficient resources to meet its requirements without \\"cutting corners\\", and was frequently forced to accept poor quality standards due to its lack of funding. The report of the Commission concluded that given the department's state, \\"a tragedy such as Cave Creek was almost bound to happen\\". Ten years after the accident, survivor Stacy Mitchell said that he and some other students were shaking the platform hard when it collapsed, which he had not reported at the time through fear of being blamed. Evidence at the inquiry indicated that the platform should have been designed and built to tolerate use that could reasonably be expected.  Repercussions  Soon after the accident, the Department of Conservation inspected more than 520 structures, and 65 were closed for repairs. The review led to the removal of a large number of structures on public land, and many safety notices appeared on the remainder around New Zealand. Indeed, some felt the response was excessive, for example in cases where bridges and platforms were labelled with signs such as \\"1 person maximum\\". Although DOC took responsibility for the accident, there were no prosecutions as New Zealand law at the time did not permit the Crown to prosecute itself. $2.6 million was still paid to the victims' families, however. Since the accident, New Zealand law has been adjusted to ensure that the Building Act covers government departments, and to allow government departments to be held liable for such negligence in future. Prime Minister Jim Bolger initially attacked the report produced by the Commission of Inquiry, arguing that the platform failed \\"essentially because it lacked about $20 worth of bolts to hold it together\\". The Minister of Conservation, Denis Marshall, was criticised in the media for his management of the Department. Many people blamed Marshall, although there was also wide criticism of the whole government's policies on management of the conservation estate. Marshall eventually resigned in May 1996, just over a year after the accident occurred. A new Minister, Nick Smith, was appointed, and a full review of the Department was conducted by the State Services Commission. A memorial plaque was unveiled in April 1996. In 1998 the track re-opened to the public, new stairs replaced the old ones, but the viewing platform was not rebuilt. The platform space has a fence around it and warning signs. In 1996 New Zealand composer John Dylan wrote an orchestral piece, \\"Cave Creek 95 - An Elegy\\" in recognition of the event.

Cuba has had several constitutions since winning its independence. The first constitution since the Cuban Revolution was drafted in 1976 and has since been amended. In 2018, Cuba became engaged in a major revision of its Constitution, which was widely discussed by the people and by academics.

In 1808, both King Ferdinand VII and his predecessor and father, Charles IV, resigned their claims to the throne in favor of Napoleon Bonaparte, who in turn passed the crown to his brother Joseph. In the ensuing Peninsular War, the Spanish waged a war of independence against the French Empire. On 19 March 1812, the Cortes Generales in refuge in C√°diz adopted the Spanish Constitution of 1812, which established a constitutional monarchy and eliminated many basic institutions that privileged some groups over others. The Cortes included representatives from throughout the Spanish Empire, including Cuba. Several models of constitutional government were proposed for Cuba. offered \\"a charter for Cuban autonomy under Spanish rule\\" in Diario de la Habana in 1810, elaborated as the Project for an Autonomous Government in Cuba in 1811. Available in English as The next year, Bayamo attorney Joaqu√≠n Infante living in Caracas wrote his Constitutional Project for the Island of Cuba. He reconciled his liberal political principles with slavery in Cuba, noting that slavery existed in the United States alongside republican government. Spanish authorities imprisoned him for his writings. In 1821, F√©lix Varela represented Cuba in the Cortes Generales of Spain during a short period when the Constitution of 1812 was revived. He joined in a petition to the Crown for the independence of Spain's Latin American colonies, supported by his Project of Instruction for the Politically and Economically Autonomous Government of the Overseas Provinces. Gu√°imaro Constitution The Gu√°imaro Constitution was the governing document written by the idealistic and politically liberal faction in the insurgency that contested Spanish colonial rule in Cuba and imposed on Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes, the conservative who claimed leadership of the independence movement. It was nominally in effect from 1869 to 1878 during the Ten Years' War against Spain. Jimaguay√∫ Constitution Two ad hoc constitutions were adopted in the course of Cuba's last fight for independence from Spain (1895‚Äì1898). On 16 September 1895, delegates representing the rebel forces adopted a constitution in Jimaguayu, the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba in Arms, and set it to be reviewed in two years by a representative assembly. It described relations between civil and military authority. It named key officials and outlined the requirements of a peace treaty with Spain. In September 1897, the assembly met in , adopted a new document on 30 October, and named a new president and vice-president. La Yaya Constitution La Yaya Constitution written in 1897 was the last Constitution before the defeat of the Spanish. The principal notable passages of this Constitution on equal civil rights, the right of suffrage and the rights governing equal education for all Cubans were written by General Jos√© Braulio Alem√°n Urqu√≠a. This Constitution was used as template for the 1901 Constitution. 1901 Constitution The 1901 Constitution, was Cuba's first as an independent state. It incorporated eight principles set out in the Platt Amendment without which U.S. troops would not have been withdrawn from Cuba, including the clause that the United States has the right to intervene in Cuba's affairs to protect its independence and guarantee the stability of its government. All but one of the Platt Amendment principles remained in force until a treaty between Cuba and the United States, negotiated as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy toward Latin America, took effect on 9 June 1934, leaving U.S. only its right to a permanent lease to its Guantanamo Naval Station. 1940 Constitution During the presidency of Federico Laredo Br√∫, a Constitutional Assembly was elected in November 1939 to write a new constitution. The Assembly debated publicly for six months and adopted the constitution at the Capitol in Havana. It was signed by the delegates on 1 July 1940, and took effect on 10 October 1940. It provided for land reform, public education, universal healthcare, minimum wage and other progressive ideas, many of which were not implemented in practice. The Constitution abolished capital punishment and established as national policy restrictions on the size of land holdings and an end to common ownership of sugar plantations and sugar mills, but these principles were never translated into legislation. The constitution ordained a presidency and a bicameral congress, both with a four-year tenure, with a ban on direct re-elections to the office of president (though non-consecutive re-election would be tolerated; similar to the current constitution of Chile) with executive power shared with a new, separate office of Prime Minister of Cuba, to be nominated by the president. Fulgencio Batista suspended parts of this constitution after seizing power in 1952. It was completely suspended after the Cuban revolution. 1976 Constitution Granma reading \\"Everybody to vote tomorrow for the socialist constitution.\\" After 16 years of non-constitutional government from 1959 to 1975, the revolutionary government of Cuba sought to institutionalize the revolution by putting a new constitution to a popular vote. The Constitution of 1976, modeled after the 1936 Soviet Constitution, was adopted by referendum on 15 February 1976, in which it was approved by 99.02% of voters, in a 98% turnout.Nohlen, p197 It took effect on 24 February 1976. This constitution called for a centralized control of the market and re- committed the state to providing its citizens with access to free education and health care, as in the 1940 constitution. Article 53 gave citizens freedom of speech, and Article 54 gave citizens the right to assemble. In practice, the state paid little attention to these rights. The state was further granted the power to regulate the activities of religious institutions and the private ownership of media was prohibited. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc plunged Cuba into an era of economic crisis known as the Special Period in Time of Peace. In response, the constitution was amended in 1992 to remove certain limitations on foreign investment and grant foreign corporations a limited right to own property on the island if they established joint ventures with the government. Another amendment established that Cuba is a secular state rather than an atheist state, prompting an expansion of local participation in religious observance, increased social service work on the part of sectarian international charities, and public recognition of religious pluralism. In 2002, the constitution was amended to stipulate that the socialistic system was permanent and irrevocable.  2019 Constitution  On 14 July 2018, a Communist Party task force drafted a new constitutional text, then given to a National Assembly commission headed by Party First Secretary Ra√∫l Castro to assess, refine, and forward the new draft constitution to the National Assembly plenary. The reforms were seen as part of the attempt to modernize the Cuban government. The draft contained 87 new articles, increasing the total from 137 to 229. Among the reforms were: * The recognition of private property, and the creation of a free market; * The restoration of the positions of President and Prime Minister of Cuba as posts separate from President of the Council of State and of Ministers; * The transfer of head of Council of State to the President of the National Assembly * The position of mayor being added to that of president of a municipal assembly * The creation of a requirement for Presidential-appointed Provincial Governors and Deputy Governors to be ratified by local municipal governments * The acknowledgement of climate change and its threat * The establishment of provincial councils made up of municipal leaders * The creation of a two consecutive five-year term limit imposed on the president; * Defining marriage as ‚Äúa social and legal institution‚Äù and ‚Äúone form of family organization.‚Äù (formerly included legalization of same-sex marriage) * Extending the terms of municipal council delegates to five years; * Banning discrimination based on gender, race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability; * The restoration of a presumption of innocence in the justice system, last provided for in the 1940 constitution. The new constitution, which also omits the aim of building a communist society and instead works towards the construction of socialism, was presented to the National Assembly of People's Power by secretary of the Council of State Homero Acosta for approval on 21 July 2018 before being slated to a national referendum. The National Assembly then approved the new Constitution on 22 July 2018, a day ahead of schedule. It was announced that a popular consultation which allows citizen input for potential amendments to the text of the proposed Constitution would start on 13 August and conclude on 15 November. It was announced that 135,000 meetings would be held during the popular consultation. Each of these would be run by 7,600 two-person teams who would receive specialized training. Cuban exiles were invited to take part in the meetings. Following consideration of amendments, a referendum was held to pass the Constitution on February 24, 2019, succeeding with 86.85% of the popular vote. The popular consultation began as scheduled on 13 August 2018, in tandem with the 92nd birthday of the late Cuban President Fidel Castro. The popular consultation concluded as scheduled on 15 November 2018. On 1 December 2018, Granma Newspaper reported that the Cuban Parliament would be summoned to vote on proposed amendments to the new Constitution on 21 December. The new Constitution was debated at the 8th Plenum of the Communist Party of Cuba‚Äôs Central Committee which took place between 12 and 13 December 2018. At the meeting, the amended draft of the proposed constitution was drawn up by a group commissioned by the National Assembly of People's Power. However, details of what was amended would not be made public until it was approved by the National Assembly. On 18 December 2018, it was revealed that one of the changes to the new constitution which would have paved the way for same sex marriage was dropped. On 20 December 2018, another change to the new Cuban Constitution was dropped and its language once again reinserts direction to building a communist society. On 21 December 2018, the Cuba National Assembly approved the amended Constitution, thus completing the final step for a referendum. On 24 February 2019, the new constitution was approved by 90.15% of voters, with a turnout of 84%. On 7 March, it was announced that the National Assembly would meet 10 April 2019 to determine the timeframe of when the new constitution would go into effect.https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/nation/cuba-to-outline-new- constitution-s-timeframe-on- april/article_af804601-6797-5e06-9019-0ae2352794a6.htmlhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns- tns-bc-cuba-constitution-20190308-story.html On 28 March, it was announced the Council of State had held a meeting on 25 March and decided that the Constitution would be proclaimed by the National Assembly on April 10.http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2019-03-28/new-constitution-of-the-republic-of- cuba-to-be-proclaimed-april-10http://www.cmhw.cu/en/national/18828-new- constitution-of-the-republic-of-cuba-to-be-proclaimed-april-10 Upon being proclaimed, the Constitution would be adopted.http://www.cubanews.acn.cu/cuba/9168-cuba-will-adopt-new-constitution- of-the-republic-on-april-10http://www.ahora.cu/en/cuba-en/4725-cuba-to-adopt- new-constitution-of-the-republic-on- april-10http://cubasi.com/cuba/item/17489-cuba-will-adopt-new-constitution-of- the-republic-on-april-10http://www.radiorebelde.cu/english/news/cuba-will- adopt-new-constitution-of-the-republic-on-april-10-20190328/ The Constitution was proclaimed as scheduled on 10 April 2019.

His birth name was Simon Hunt, but he changed his name by deed poll so that he would appear on the electoral ballot as \\"Pauline Pantsdown\\"; he later changed back to \\"Simon Hunt\\". He is the son of the late David Hunt, who was a Chief Judge at Common Law of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.Hanson stung by the peril of Pauline, by Robert Milliken, at the Independent; published 3 October 1998. Retrieved 11 July 2014 As Pantsdown, he is a drag queen whose taste in fashion parodies Hanson's, and is best known for the songs \\"Backdoor Man\\" and \\"I Don't Like It\\". The song \\"Backdoor Man\\" was a huge hit on the youth radio network Triple J after its release in 1997, being played almost hourly due to a massive number of requests, making it into the 1997 Hottest 100 list at number 5. However, less than a week after its release, Hanson obtained a court injunction against the song, claiming it was defamatory. In September 2004, after Hanson launched a campaign for the Australian Senate, the ABC was reported to be planning a challenge to the injunction. However, after public criticism from Hanson, the ABC backed down. Early life and activism Born in Sydney, Hunt began playing in bands when he was 12 years old.http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/08/30/i-dont-like-it-the-pauline- pantsdown-story/ (~1.00 timestamp in the video) Hunt became influenced by arts-activism work around the world as a young adult, particularly the group ACT UP.http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/08/30/i-dont-like-it-the-pauline- pantsdown-story/ (~1.59 timestamp in the video) Prior to parodying Hanson, Hunt had successfully lobbied the Office of Film and Literature Classification to remove homosexuality from its list of \\"adult themes\\", and produced a parody track collage of Fred Nile's voice. Hunt is currently a head lecturer at the University of New South Wales.http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/08/30/i-dont-like-it-the-pauline- pantsdown-story/ (~4.04 timestamp in the video) Homebake appearance The resulting controversy resulted in Pauline Pantsdown making an appearance at the 1998 Homebake live music festival, complete with apparently gay half-naked Asian dancers. He was booed and pelted with objects and later claimed \\"Homophobia is alive and well in Sydney\\". Songs * \\"Backdoor Man\\"http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/10296/20010907/www.dot.net.au/_galconv/back%20door%20man.mp3 was originally conceived of as a lipsynch performance by Hunt for performance at a dance party. Another organiser of the party gave a recording of the song to the ABC to promote the dance party, and as a result, \\"Backdoor Man\\" became the most-requested song on Triple J over a period of 11 days. \\"Backdoor Man\\" consists of a series of samples of Hanson's speeches stuck together to form sentences such as \\"I'm a backdoor man. I'm homosexual. I'm very proud of it\\", and \\"I'm a backdoor man for the Ku Klux Klan with very horrendous plans. I'm a very caring potato\\", parodying Hanson's conservative politics. Hanson vehemently condemned the track, claiming that the song portrayed her as a prostitute and a transsexual. * After the injunction over \\"Backdoor Man\\", Pantsdown released the follow-up single \\"I Don't Like It\\" in response. Once again the song used segments of Hanson's voice to parody her, this time with equally ridiculous but less personal lyrics such as \\"Why can't my blood be coloured white? I should talk to some medical doctors; coloured blood is just not right\\". Once again the song was a hit on Triple J and peaked in the ARIA Charts at number 10 during the 1998 federal election campaign. \\"I Don't Like It\\" was nominated for Best Comedy Release at the 1999 ARIA Awards. * In 2004, on the Rock Against Howard compilation, Hunt released the song \\"I'm Sorry\\" under the pseudonym Little Johnny, which had appeared as a download on his website earlier in 2000 with a video. This song used the same techniques to parody John Howard's refusal to apologise to the Aboriginal people of Australia over the Stolen Generations. Senate run Hunt changed his name by deed poll so that he would appear on the electoral ballot for the 1998 senate elections as \\"Pauline Pantsdown\\";https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hanson- wins-pantsdown-song-case-1201329.html he later changed back to \\"Simon Hunt\\".http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/08/30/i-dont-like-it-the-pauline- pantsdown-story/ (~9.10 timestamp in the video) On the night of the federal election, Pantsdown performed at the Mardi Gras Sleaze Ball, and a Pauline Hanson Mardi Gras float was exploded. 2010s Pantsdown performed a remixed version of \\"I Don't Like It\\" at the 2011 Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras Party during Bob Downe's 'Retro-Gras' DJ set just days before Hanson announced her candidacy in the 2011 NSW state election. Pantsdown also performed a remixed version of \\"I Don't Like It\\" on Channel Seven's The Morning Show on 22 May 2012. Nearing the end of the performance, Hunt undid a rainbow-coloured button-up shirt and revealed a T-shirt with the slogan \\"ABBOTT is INSIDE me\\" written on it, with a caricature of Tony Abbott's head beneath it. In an interview following his performance, he claimed that he was partly inspired by the \\"hurt and pain\\" that, in particular, the communities Hanson targeted at the time felt, and \\"wanted to give them an opportunity to laugh back\\". Kylie Gillies also noted that Hunt now lectures at a university (Media Arts, at the University of New South Wales College of Fine Arts, or COFA). Hunt also campaigned against opera singer Tamar Iveri, who was released from a performance of Othello after making homophobic comments on social media. After Hanson won a place in the senate in 2016, Hunt considered a return as Pantsdown.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-03/election-2016:-pauline- pantsdown-creator-considering-comeback/7565890?WT.tsrc=Facebook Hunt maintains a Facebook page as Pauline Pantsdown. In 2016, he was campaigning against the same-sex marriage plebiscite and the Australian Christian Lobby. During the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Pantsdown ran a parody Twitter account spoofing the Coalition for Marriage.

In a career which lasted from 1996 and 1999, he raced in five different countries and won seven Group 1/Grade I races. His 1999 performances earned him the United States' Eclipse Award for Outstanding Male Turf Horse and the Cartier Racing Award for European Horse of the Year. Background Daylami, a \\"powerful\\" grey horse, standing 17 hands high, was bred in Ireland by his original owner, the Aga Khan, who also bred both of his parents. Daylami's sire, Doyoun, won the 2,000 Guineas and finished third in the Derby, before a stud career in which he produced the winners of over two hundred races. His most notable offspring, apart from Daylami, was the Breeders' Cup Turf winner Kalanisi. Daltawa, from whom Daylami inherited his grey coat, was also the dam of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Dalakhani. She was a member of one of the families established by Marcel Boussac and eventually acquired by the Aga Khan. He was first sent into training with Alain de Royer- Dupr√© at Chantilly. At the end of his three-year-old season he was bought by Godolphin and transferred the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. His two most frequent jockeys were Gerald Mosse, and, after the move to Godolphin, Frankie Dettori. Like many grey horses, Daylami changed in appearance as he aged. In his earliest races he had a dark, iron-grey appearance but looked almost white by the time of his retirement. Racing career 1996: Two-year-old season Daylami did not appear on the racecourse until the September of his two-year-old season, when he won a minor stakes race at Longchamp. Three weeks later, he was moved up in class and won the Listed Prix Herod at √âvry. On his final start of the year he was moved up to the highest class to contest the Group One Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud. Starting favourite as part of a two-horse Aga Khan entry, Daylami was sent into the lead in the straight, but was caught in the closing stages and beaten three quartes of a length by Shaka. The Aga Khan's colours, carried by Daylami in 1996 and 1997 1997: Three-year-old season As a three-year-old, Daylami was campaigned exclusively over one mile. He began by winning his first Group race, beating Loup Sauvage by two lengths in the Prix de Fontainebleau at Longchamp in April. Three weeks later, he beat the same horse, by the same margin, over the same course and distance to win the Group One Poule d'Essai des Poulains on soft ground, with Godolphin's Bahamian Bounty, winner of the Prix Morny and Middle Park Stakes, finishing last of the six runners. Although he had been entered in the Derby, Daylami's connections made it clear that the colt would be kept to shorter distances. The colt was then sent abroad for the first time to contest the Group One St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Daylami's striking appearance impressed observers and he was well fancied at 7/2, but in the race he seemed to be outpaced in the closing stages and finished a well-beaten third to Starborough. For his two remaining starts, Daylami returned to France, and continued to be tried over one mile. In both of these races, he proved the best of the three-year-old runners. He reversed the Ascot form with Starborough in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, but was beaten decisively by the four-year-old Spinning World. On his final start of the year, he finished third in a strong renewal of the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp behind Spinning World and Helissio. The Godolphin colours, carried by Daylami in 1998 and 1999 1998: Four-year-old season Daylami's move to Godolphin in the winter of 1997/8 brought more than a change of location, as his new connections changed the focus of the horse's campaign to middle-distance events.(In Europe the term \\"middle distance\\" covers races that would be considered \\"long distance\\" in North America). He began promisingly, carrying topweight of 9‚Äì4 (130 lbs) to victory at the Curragh in the Tattersalls Gold Cup (then a Group Two race). He was a beaten favourite on his next run at Royal Ascot, when he finished third to his stable companion Faithful Son in the Group Two Prince of Wales's Stakes, but there were excuses for his defeat, as Dettori had been unable to find space for a clear run at a crucial stage in a race that was described as \\"one big bump\\". In addition, Daylami, as a Group One winner, had to carry five pounds more than the winner. He reversed the form with Faithful Son at level weights to record his most valuable win so far in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown two and a half weeks later. The form of the race was not particularly strong however, with Daylami being the only runner to have previously won a Group One event in Britain, France or Ireland. Most of the attention was drawn by the fact that Saeed bin Suroor was responsible for training Daylami, Faithful Son and Central Park, giving the Godolphin team first, second and third places in a Group One race. For his next start, he was moved up to the mile and a half distance for the first time in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in which he was ridden by Mick Kinane, Dettori having opted to ride Swain. Daylami started at 6/1 and ran up to expectations finishing fourth of the eight runners behind Swain, High-Rise and Royal Anthem. In September 1998, Daylami was sent to the US for the Man o' War Stakes at Belmont Park. He raced close behind the leaders for most of the way, before being switched to the outside in the straight. He produced a strong late run to catch Buck's Boy in the closing stages and win by one and a quarter lengths. On his final European start of the year, Daylami was brought back to a mile and a quarter and was slightly disappointing, finishing third to the filly Alborada as the 6/5 favourite for the Champion Stakes. The horse was again sent in November 1999 to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs but was withdrawn after becoming unwell on the morning of the race. The race was won by Buck's Boy. 1999: Five-year-old season Spring It is often assumed that thoroughbred racehorses reach their peak at the age of four a belief supported by the weight-for-age scale, which does not allow for any further improvement beyond that age. Daylami however, was still improving (see official ratings below) and in 1999 he had his best season in terms of wins and prize money. This vindicated the decision of his owners to keep him in training after they had decided that the horse had \\"more to give and... more to prove.\\" It was also seen as part of a growing trend to keep top class flat racers in training for longer than had been the fashion in the 1970s and 1980s. His season did not start particularly well. In the Dubai World Cup he was badly hampered, and although staying on strongly, he could finish only fifth to Almutawakel. He was then made favourite for the Tattersalls Gold Cup, which had been promoted to Group One level, but after taking the lead in the straight, he was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten two and a half lengths by the Japanese-bred filly Shiva. Summer It was from this point on that, Daylami (ridden in all his remaining races by Dettori) showed his best form. At Epsom he was third choice in the betting for the Coronation Cup behind Royal Anthem and the 1998 European Horse of the Year Dream Well, but produced a sustained run in the last quarter-mile to beat those rivals by three quarters of a length and half a length. This was Daylami's first win over a mile and a half, but the lack of early pace and slow time of 2:40.26 meant that the race did not conclusively prove his stamina. He had been expected to run in the Eclipse Stakes but was withdrawn from the race when his trainer decided that Daylami \\"needed more time\\". He continued to attract attention however, when beating the Group One winner Central Park by eight lengths in a \\"sparkling\\" exercise trial. In July, he was an easy and \\"impressive\\" winner of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, taking the lead over a furlong out and pulling away to win by five lengths. Although Daylami's connections were pleased, with Dettori talking enthusiastically about the \\"ultimate champion\\", some observers, including the Independent's correspondent, were less convinced, pointing out that the field for the King George had been well below its usual standard. Autumn Daylami ran next in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in which he produced what was probably his best performance. Despite his win at Ascot, Daylami started only second favourite behind Royal Anthem, who had recently won the Group One International Stakes at York by eight lengths. The two horses so dominated the build-up to the race that one prominent bookmaker announced that they would treat the race as a match for betting purposes. After tracking the leaders in the early stages, Daylami moved through \\"easily\\" on the inside to take the lead in the straight and drew right away to win by nine lengths from the filly Dazzling Park, with Dream Well third and Royal Anthem fifth. His performance was given a figure of 136 by the official handicapper, the third highest recorded in Europe in the 1990s, behind only Generous and Peintre Celebre. Daylami was sent to Paris for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October, although his connections made it clear that the heavy ground would not suit their horse and even considered withdrawing him. He made no impression in the race and was eased down by Dettori in the straight, eventually finishing ninth behind Montjeu. In his final race, Daylami was sent to Florida for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Gulfstream Park. The venue, with its warm climate and tight, seven-furlong turf circuit was believed to be particularly challenging for European horses, with none of them having won when the Breeders' Cup was run there in 1989 and 1992. Dettori's ability on American tracks had also been questioned after he had ridden a \\"bizarre\\" race on Swain in the previous year's Classic. Buck's Boy led early, and exerted pressure from the front, running 1:10.60 for the first six furlongs. Daylami was always running prominently, and was moved up to third behind Buck's Boy and Royal Anthem entering the straight. He produced a powerful late run to take the lead inside the finl furlong and stayed on strongly to win by two and a half lengths from Royal Anthem with Buck's Boy third. As he returned on Daylami after the race Dettori shouted \\"What about Swain now!\\" in reference to the criticism he had received. Daylami was then retired to stud. Assessment In the International Classification (the forerunner of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings), for 1998 Daylami was rated on 123, eight pounds behind the top-weighted Skip Away In the Classification for 1999 Daylami was rated the best horse in the world, equal with Montjeu on a rating of 135. In January 2000, Daylami was awarded the titles of Horse of the Year and Top Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards. In the same month he was named American Champion Male Turf Horse at the Eclipse Awards and finished runner up to Charismatic in the vote for American Horse of the Year, despite having run only once in the United States in the qualifying period. Daylami earned his owners a $1,000,000 prize as the winner of the inaugural World Series Racing Championship, a competition in which points were awarded for performances in nine major international middle-distance races. Daylami was given a Timeform rating of 138, making him the equal of Nijinsky and Cigar. Zaynar, by Daylami, winner of the 2009 Triumph Hurdle Stud career Through a joint ownership between his breeder, the Aga Khan IV, and Darley Stud, he stood as a sire at the Aga Khan's Gilltown Stud near Kilcullen, County Kildare, Ireland until 2006 when he was sent to his Haras de Bonneval stud at Le Mesnil-Mauger in France. At the end of November 2006, Daylami was sold to Riethuiskrael Stud of South Africa owned by Altus Joubert, Chairman of the South Africa Thoroughbred Breeders' Association Chairman. In 2010 Daylami returned to Ireland to join Coolagown Stud, near Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland. Daylami has sired the winners of more than four hundred races. The best of his progeny to date has been Grey Swallow, winner of the 2004 Irish Derby and 2005 Tattersalls Gold Cup. His other notable offspring have included Voila Ici (Premio Roma, Gran Premio di Milano), Indian Days (Bosphorus Cup x2) and the hurdler Zaynar (Triumph Hurdle).

Also living in Willesden, London, is Archie's best friend Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim from Bangladesh; the two men spend much of their time at the O'Connell's pub. Archie and Samad met in 1945 when they were part of a tank crew inching through Europe in the final days of World War II, though they missed out on the action. Following the war, Samad emigrated to Britain and married Alsana Iqbal, n√©e Alsana Begum, or \\"Miss Alsana,\\" in a traditional arranged marriage. Samad is a downtrodden waiter in a West End curry house, and is obsessed by the history of his supposed but unlikely great-grandfather, Mangal Pandey, a Hindu soldier from Uttar Pradesh, not Bengal, who is famous for firing the first shot of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (though he missed). Samad and Alsana have twin boys, Magid and Millat, who are the same age as Irie. Samad in particular finds it difficult to maintain his devotion to Islam in an English life; he is continually tormented by what he sees as the effects of this cultural conflict upon his own moral character‚Äîhis Muslim values are corrupted by his masturbation, drinking, and his affair with his children's music teacher, Poppy Burt-Jones. In an attempt to preserve his traditional beliefs, he sends 10-year-old Magid to Bangladesh in the hope that he will grow up properly under the teachings of Islam. From then on, the lives of the two boys follow very different paths. To Samad's fury, Magid becomes an Anglicised atheist and devotes his life to science. Millat, meanwhile, pursues a rebellious path of womanising and drinking‚Äîas well as harbouring a love of mob movies such as The Godfather and Goodfellas. Angry at his people's marginalisation in English society Millat demonstrates against Salman Rushdie in 1989 and eventually pledges himself to a militant Muslim fundamentalist brotherhood known as \\"Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation\\" (KEVIN). The lives of the Joneses and Iqbals intertwine with that of the white, middle-class Chalfens, a Jewish-Catholic family of Oxbridge-educated intellectuals who typify a distinctive strain of North London liberal trendiness. The father, Marcus Chalfen, is a university lecturer and geneticist working on a controversial 'FutureMouse' project in which he introduces chemical carcinogens into the body of a mouse and is thus able to observe the progression of a tumour in living tissue. By re-engineering the actual genome and watching cancers progress at pre-determined times, Marcus believes he is eliminating the random. The mother, Joyce Chalfen, is a horticulturist and part-time housewife with an often entirely misguided desire to mother and 'heal' Millat as if he were one of her plants. To some extent, the Chalfen family provides a safe haven as they (believe themselves to) accept and understand the turbulent lives of Irie, Magid, and Millat. However, this sympathy comes at the expense of their own son, Joshua, whose difficulties are ignored by his parents. Originally a well-moulded \\"Chalfenist\\", Joshua later rebels against his father and his background by joining the radical animal rights group \\"Fighting Animal Torture and Exploitation\\" (FATE). Meanwhile, after his return from Bangladesh, Magid works as Marcus's research assistant on the FutureMouse project, while Millat becomes further involved in KEVIN. Irie, who has been working for Marcus, briefly succeeds in her long-hidden attraction to Millat but is rejected under his KEVIN-inspired beliefs. Irie believes that Millat cannot love her, for he has always been \\"the second son\\" both symbolically and literally; Millat was born two minutes after Magid. Irie makes Magid the \\"second son\\" for a change by sleeping with him right after her romantic encounter of Millat. This causes her to become pregnant, and she is left unsure of the father of her child, as the brothers are identical twins. The strands of the narrative grow closer as Millat and KEVIN, Joshua and FATE, and Clara's mother Hortense and the Jehovah's Witnesses all plan to demonstrate their opposition to Marcus's FutureMouse‚Äîwhich they view as an evil interference with their own beliefs‚Äîat its exhibition on New Year's Eve 1992. At the Perret Institute, Hortense and the other Jehovah's Witnesses sing loudly in the hallway. Samad goes out to hush them, but when he arrives, doesn't have the heart to make them stop. When he returns, it suddenly strikes him that the founder of the Perret Institute and the oldest scientist on Marcus Chalfen's panel is Dr Perret, the Nazi he captured during World War II. Enraged that Archie did not kill him all those years ago, Samad runs over and begins cursing Archie. Just then, Millat advances on the table of scientists with a gun. Without thinking, Archie jumps in front of him and takes a bullet in the thigh. As he falls, he knocks over the mouse's glass cage, and it escapes. At the novel's end, the narrator presents us with different \\"end games\\" in the style of television. Magid and Millat both serve community service for Millat's crime, since witnesses identify both as the culprit. Joshua and Irie end up together and join Hortense in Jamaica in the year 2000. Mickey opens up the previously men-only O'Connell's pub to women, and Archie and Samad finally invite their wives along with them. Major characters Alfred Archibald Jones Archie is mediocre and indecisive, preferring to make his most important decisions with the flip of a coin. Archie's ex-wife is Ophelia Diagilo, whom he supposedly drove insane with his mediocrity. He later marries Clara, a Jamaican woman less than half his age, with whom he has a daughter, Irie. Archie's best friend is Samad Iqbal. The two men served together in World War II in the British Army and frequently visit O'Connell's pub. Samad Miah Iqbal Archie's best friend, a middle-aged World War II veteran with a crippled right hand. Samad was born in Bangladesh and met Archie when they were soldiers in Eastern Europe. He works as a waiter at an Indian restaurant, where he receives few tips. His wife is Alsana Begum, and his twin sons are Magid and Millat. More than anything, Samad wants his sons to grow into religious, traditional Bengali Muslim men. To ensure this, he goes to great lengths, even sending Magid to be raised in Bangladesh (for all intents and purposes, this was a kidnapping). Clara Jones Clara Jones, n√©e Bowden, was an awkward, unpopular Jehovah's Witness who spent her adolescence canvassing door-to-door. When she meets the equally unappealing Ryan Topps, she abandons her religion and takes up his rebellious ways, though Ryan becomes a staunch Jehovah's Witness himself. When Ryan and Clara crash into a tree on Ryan's scooter, Clara's top teeth are knocked out. She meets Archie Jones and marries him, even though she finds him unimpressive and he is more than twice her age. Archie and Clara have a daughter named Irie. Alsana Begum Alsana Iqbal, n√©e Begum, is the young wife of Samad Iqbal, to whom she was promised before her birth. They have twin sons, Magid and Millat. To help pay bills, she sews clothing on her home sewing machine for an S&M; shop called Domination in Soho. Although charismatic and judgemental by nature, she thinks marriage is best handled with silence. However, she has a volcanic temper and generally wins fights with Samad by injuring him. Irie Ambrosia Jones Irie‚Äîwhose name means \\"OK, cool, peaceful\\" in Patois‚Äîis the daughter of Clara and Archie Jones. Irie has been friends with Magid and Millat Iqbal since birth. After struggling with her sexuality and racial identity, Irie finds answers in her grandmother, Hortense Bowden. She resolves to go into the field of dentistry and, despite her best efforts to prevent it, ends up with Joshua Chalfen. Having slept with both Magid and Millat, Irie gives birth to a daughter whose father can never be known, as the twins have exactly the same DNA. Millat Zulfikar Iqbal Millat, born 2 minutes later than his twin brother Magid, is the younger son of Samad and Alsana. After Magid is sent to Bangladesh, Millat comes into his own as a trouble-making, pot-smoking, womanising rebel. However, Millat eventually rejects this lifestyle in favour of fundamentalist Islam, becoming a major driving force of KEVIN. At the FutureMouse conference, he tries to shoot Dr Perret, but instead shoots Archie in the thigh. Millat may or may not be the father of Irie's baby. Magid Mahfooz Murshed Mubtasim Iqbal Magid is the elder son of Samad and Alsana, and twin brother of Millat. Magid is intellectually precocious and insists on dressing and acting like an adult, even at a very young age. Samad essentially kidnaps Magid and sends him to be raised traditionally in Bangladesh. When he finally returns to London, he joins Marcus Chalfen's FutureMouse programme. Magid is fascinated by the certainty of fate genetic engineering offers, and by having the power to choose another creature's path, as his was chosen for him. Magid may or may not be the father of Irie's baby. Marcus Chalfen Marcus Chalfen is a Jewish genetic engineer and husband of Joyce Chalfen. His controversial FutureMouse experiment involves genetically altering a mouse so that it develops cancers at specific times and sites. Marcus loses interest in mentoring Irie when he begins corresponding with Magid. Joyce Chalfen Joyce is a horticulturalist, writer, and the wife of Marcus Chalfen. She has four sons, all of whom adore her fiercely. Joyce is a natural nurturer and constantly feels the need to care for things and people. From the moment they meet, Millat entrances Joyce, and she feels the need to mother him and pander to his needs. Joshua Chalfen Joshua is the son of Joyce and Marcus Chalfen. Originally interested in his studies at Glenard Oak School, Joshua rebels against the Chalfens (particularly his father) by joining the animal- rights groups FATE. Joshua has a long-standing crush on Irie and, later, on Joely. He stays in FATE largely as an excuse to remain close to her. Reception Though, generally, the book was critically acclaimed, the critic James Wood was largely hostile, while reserving a few moments for praise. He coined the term 'hysterical realism' to describe the 'big contemporary novel is a perpetual-motion machine that appears to have been embarrassed into velocity. It seems to want to abolish stillness, as if ashamed of silence‚Äîas it were, a criminal running endless charity marathons. Stories and sub-stories sprout on every page, as these novels continually flourish their glamorous congestion. Inseparable from this culture of permanent storytelling is the pursuit of vitality at all costs. Indeed, vitality is storytelling, as far as these books are concerned.' He claimed that the boundaries of realism were not being broken down but 'exhausted, and overworked.' He wrote a parody of hysterical realism in his review in order to demonstrate the type of writing he meant: He later defended it, saying that he was not exaggerating, citing examples of such bizarre plot devices from real novels, like, In 2019, the novel was ranked 39th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. On 5 November 2019 BBC News included White Teeth on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Adaptations A four-part television adaptation of the novel was made and broadcast on Channel 4 in 2002. It was directed by Julian Jarrold, starring Om Puri as Samad and Phil Davis as Archie. Each episode focuses on a major male character as he encounters a turning point in his life: \\"The Peculiar Second Marriage of Archie Jones\\", \\"The Temptation of Samad Iqbal\\", \\"The Trouble With Millat\\", and \\"The Return of Magid Iqbal\\".White Teeth on Hulu.Dominic Casciani, \\"White Teeth sparkles on TV\\", BBC News. In 2018 London's Kiln Theatre announced the world premiere of Stephen Sharkey's stage adaptation of the novel. Directed by the venue's Artistic Director Indhu Rubasingham, the production features thirteen original songs by Paul Englishby and stars Tony Jayawardena as Samad, Richard Lumsden as Archie and Ayesha Antoine as Irie.

Tyrian was programmed by Jason Emery, illustrated by Daniel Cook, and its music composed by Alexander Brandon and Andras Molnar. The game was re-released as freeware in 2004. A free and open- source port of the game started in April 2007. Plot The game is set in the year 20,031. The player takes on the role of Trent Hawkins, a skilled spaceship pilot. While on the planet Tyrian, a hostile drone shoots his best friend, Buce Quesillac. Before dying Buce warns Trent that the drone belonged to the militaristic MicroSol megacorporation. MicroSol has discovered Gravitium (the game's brand of Unobtainium) on Tyrian and seeks to keep it a secret. Now on MicroSol's hit list, Trent manages to secure a small, armed spacecraft and set out the free world of Savara. Gameplay Tyrian is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter. It was developed chiefly as a homage to the works of Compile, particularly their Zanac series. The player controls a space ship fitted with different weapons (front and back, linked to the same button, and up to two external pods with their own buttons) and other equipment. The game presents a variety of enemies (some flying, some fixed, some on rails) and bosses, with many occurrences of fixed and/or indestructible obstacles. Before the player's starship is destroyed it must take enough damage to exhaust several points of shields (which regenerate over time) and armor. Tyrian's full game mode features a credit and equipment- buying system, and the shield/armor hit points which are similar to game mechanics in Raptor: Call of the Shadows, another PC game from the same period. The arcade mode has characteristics from coin-op arcade shooters, such as in-game powerups and extra lives. Difficulty There are three levels of difficulty to choose from: Easy, Medium, and Hard, as well as the hidden options of Impossible, Suicide, and Lord of the Game. Hard difficulty and above employ enemies with more health as well as fire more bullets per second. Certain hidden levels are only available at hard difficulty, which provide ample opportunities for unique powerups and upgrades. In certain levels, the Hard setting also prevents the player from seeing enemies outside a conical line-of-sight. Upon completion of the game, the player receives a password for one of the several hidden ships, as well as the options for replaying the game at a higher difficulty setting. Full story mode left The \\"full story mode\\" is a single player mode that features a story-based campaign and ship customization. The story is told through the message cubes that can be collected within and read between levels. Some of these messages cubes are readily available while others need to be obtained by destroying certain enemies in the preceding level. At certain points in the game, the storyline branches and the player is required to pick one branch. The player's craft is customizable. It can accommodate a front weapon and a rear weapon. Shops can supply can supply a variety of kinetic guns, rayguns, missiles, and bombs for these two slots. While the front weapons are mostly limited to forward arcs, \\"rear\\" weapons often come with wider coverage including side and rear shots. Some rear weapons have two selectable fire modes, focusing either mostly forward, or mostly sideways or rearward. Weapons can be upgraded up to 10 times. Higher levels cost exponentially more and require a more powerful generator to support them. Other upgrades include increased shields, more powerful generators to allow for stronger weapons and shields, more armor, and higher maneuverability. Shop differ in terms of the ships, generators, and weapons that have for sale. However, shops can upgrade any component, even those that they don't sell. The player can also purchase up to two \\"sidekicks\\" which fly alongside the ship. Some simply act as a complementary weapon that fire whenever the ship fires; others are powerful weapons with limited ammunition that need to manually activated. Sidekicks may not be upgradable. Arcade mode In arcade mode, the player starts with a moderate ship and picks up the front guns, rear guns, and sidekicks along the way, instead of purchasing them. Front weapons are upgraded by picking up purple bubbles from destroyed enemies. The number of purple orbs required increases exponentially to advance to higher power levels. Front and rear guns can also be upgraded to the next level by picking up power-up pods, which are found by destroying a specific enemy. The ship, shields, and generators are not upgradeable. The arcade mode can be played with one or two ships, by one or two players. The ships are called the \\"Dragonhead\\" and \\"Dragonwing\\". Both players can combine their ships into one, forming the \\"Steel Dragon\\", with the first player controlling the combined ship, and the second player controlling a turret. Tyrian enables the two players to be connected via modem. The Dragonhead has front gun powerups (with more variety than the Dragonwing's rear gun pickups), has better maneuverability, and a smaller profile making it easier to dodge enemy fire. It also controls the \\"special\\" power-up weapons such as the Soul of Zinglon or Repulsor. The Dragonwing is larger and slower but more heavily armored. It picks up the rear up power-ups, although unlike the equivalent single-player rear gun, the Dragonwing fires it mostly forward instead of the side or rear. The Dragonwing also controls the sidekick weapons. The player can also increase the power of the Dragonwing's weapon by not firing them for short time, letting them to accumulate extra charges. There are five charge levels for each weapon, and collecting the spherical purple powerups gives the Dragonwing the ability to charge-up faster. Timed battle In this mode, available in Tyrian 2000 only, the player chooses from three levels to play in (Deliani, Space station, and Savara). The player is given a set time to complete the level, while collecting power-ups, fighting off enemies and killing the boss. When the level is complete, the score is calculated depending on time spent, ship's integrity, destruction caused, and enemies killed. Super arcade The game also features 7 (9 in Tyrian 2000) hidden \\"super arcade\\" modes with specialized ships, requiring the user to type in certain codewords which are shown after beating the game. (The first code is given by beating the regular game, and each consecutive code is given after beating the mode which comes before it.) Super Tyrian This mode, which is enabled by typing \\"engage\\" at the title screen, disables all cheat codes and command parameters and sets the difficulty to Lord of Game (or Suicide if the Scroll Lock key is held down). The player possesses a Stalker 21.126 ship, along with a small shield and only one weapon, the Atomic Rail Gun. No other weapons are available; however the ship is able to generate many different weapons when the player performs particular sequences of movements and weapon- firing. The \\"headlight effect\\" is always turned on in Super Tyrian, which can obscure objects that are not within a 90-degree field of view in front of the player's ship. Mini-games Destruct is a minigame concealed inside Tyrian, reminiscent of Scorched Earth, with human-vs-human and human-vs- computer modes of play. It can be played by typing \\"destruct\\" at the main menu screen. In the Zinglon's Ale mini-game, players must try to gather as much ale as possible, while dodging wave after wave of bouncing enemies, and clearing the screen of enemies fully before advancing to the next level. If not cleared, the game continues infinitely while growing ever harder. Zinglon's Squadrons is a mini-game similar to Galaxian or Galaga. Large formations of ships fly down to attack. Individual ships in the groups break off to fly down in various ways. Players must destroy the whole fleet to advance to the next fleet. In the mini-game Zinglon's Revenge a giant ship projects a horizontal field of energy. Small enemies fall down from above and bounce around the edges of the screen and against the energy field. Touching the field or one of the small enemies could be deadly. Players must shoot all the small enemies to advance to the next level. Development Tyrian was developed by a credited total of 11 people, with \\"three main drivers\\" ‚Äî Alexander Brandon (composer and writer), Jason Emery (programmer and level designer), and Daniel Cook (artist and interface designer). For the aforementioned developers, Tyrian was their first commercial video game.Lost Garden: Free game graphics: Tyrian ships and tilesClub Silicon: Tyrian Jukebox The origins of Tyrian began as an experiment in 1991, with a young Jason Emery showing his friend Alexander Brandon the preliminary workings of a scrolling background. The two continued developing, and eventually decided the work could be shown to a game company. Brandon wrote a proposal document and sent it to the two leading shareware game publishers of the time, Epic MegaGames and Apogee. However, the game lacked any sound or music, and the graphics were \\"definitely not professional\\". As such, \\"neither got overly excited\\", but both showed interest. The two developers thought they would never find a publisher. However, after a long wait, Robert Allen‚Äîhead of Safari Software‚Äîconsidered Tyrian to fit perfectly with their company, which handled smaller scale projects. Robert Allen had word from Cliff Bleszinski that Tyrian was very similar to Zanac, thinking that it should be followed up. Robert Allen gave leads to sound coders and artists, the first being Bruce Hsu who created interface graphics and character faces. Artist Daniel Cook was hired after composer Alexander Brandon showed interest in his artwork, which was‚Äîunbeknown to Cook‚Äî\\"sent around\\" by a friend. After he was sent a short list of levels, Cook created sample artwork on an Amiga 1200. It was met with praise by the other developers, who asked him to \\"make some more!\\". The artwork was completed in a 4-month period.Lost Garden: The joyful life of the lapsed game developer After work began on graphics, the popularity of Tyrian rose at Epic MegaGames. Arturo Sinclair from Storm Front Studios joined to create rendered artwork for planets and character faces. The developers wanted a \\"simple and fun\\" interface, and changed it at least three times before deciding on a final design. At this point, Tyrian was almost complete; with the \\"Loudness\\" sound system, near-completed sound effects, and a marketing plan head by Mark Rein. At this time, Tim Sweeney approached the team and informed them Tyrian was to be published as a full-fledged Epic MegaGames product. It was later released in 1995. The data cubes found in the game's Full Mode contain various references to its parent publishers, including One Must Fall 2097, Jazz Jackrabbit, and Pretzel Pete (Tyrian 2000). The Pretzel Pete Truck and its weapon is a reference to the Pretzel Pete video game. Versions and re- releases Tyrian Version 1.0 of the game was originally released as shareware, consisting of episode 1 of the game. Version 1.1 was the first published registered version, consists of the first three episodes, and includes various bugfixes. The registered version also includes the ship editor, which was later available as separate download. Version 2.0 added Episode 4 (An End to Fate) and several new game modes, like the two-player mode. Version 2.01/2.1 fixed some keyboard bugs and includes the \\"Christmas mode\\", triggered by starting the game in December. Tyrian 2000 (3.0) In 1999, Tyrian was re-released as Tyrian 2000, which includes an additional fifth episode and bug fixes. Additional ships include Phoenix II, Storm, Red Dragon, Pretzel Pete Truck (from the Pretzel Pete video game published by XSIV Games). The datacube \\"TRANSMISSION SOURCE: Epic MegaGames\\" game and was renamed \\"TRANSMISSION SOURCE: XSIV Games\\" with a Pretzel Pete game ad (however, other references to Epic MegaGames titles remain). Although it claims Windows compatibility, this is achieved using a .PIF file, not by building a native Windows application. Game Boy releases World Tree Games developed versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. After the publisher Symmetry Entertainment closed down, the European publisher Stealth Productions, Inc. (Stealth Media Group, Inc.) obtained the publication rights, but the game was cancelled. Both Game Boy versions were eventually released in compiled format in 2007 as freeware by World Tree Games. In the Game Boy Color version, the Full Game incorporates a shorter story (from Episodes 1-4) than the original DOS game, but planet Ixmucane core always gets destroyed at the end, and the levels were redesigned. The rear weapon from the DOS game is not available. The player can carry two Sidekick weapons at once, but only one is usable at a time. New game modes and items can be unlocked by purchasing Extras using credits obtained by completing a stage. The Game Boy Advance version incorporates graphics from the DOS game, but the level layout and game play are based on the Game Boy Color game. Two Sidekick weapons can be fired at the same time. Super Arcade and audio are not included. New to this game is Challenge mode, where additional levels are unlocked by completing existing Challenge levels.

The town is about north east of the Bulawayo. The town sits in an extremely iron-rich area and has relied on steel production as a source of revenue since it was founded in the early part of the 20th century. The Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO, formerly RISCO founded in 1942), which is based in Redcliff, was the town's largest employer until it closed down in 2008. History  Education  The only school in Redcliff in the 1980s was Redcliff Primary School which offered rich education to children aged around 5 to 13. The school had three classes per grade classified by colours: Red, Blue and Green. Around 1987, as the population of Redcliff increased, an additional class was added in most streams. School sports played at the school included hockey, swimming, Rugby, Cricket, Rounders, Netball and soccer. Due to the current economic crisis in Zimbabwe, the town's infrastructure has suffered deterioration from low investment. The municipality of Redcliff governs Rutendo, Torwood and Simbi Park. A former pupil of Redcliff Primary School, Ed Chihambakwe, \\"completed a memorable whitewash in the November 1996 A-Level examinations by scoring a record 20 points in the four subjects he sat for\\". He went on to qualify as an actuary and is currently based in Cape Town, South Africa. Some of the notable former residents include preacher and author Leslie Borerwe, who travels the globe preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. As of 4 April 2014 this is current status in Redcliff much has changed since then. A secondary school was built, even though times were tough in zim, just after Independence there were many changes. Now the town has three high schools, Zisco high school formerly known as drake secondary school, Batanai high school and Rutendo high school, since the shutdown of a major firm (ziscosteel) the standard of living of the majority became so tough, now people are relying on buying and selling, gold panning, selling scrap metal and coal. Sports The town has had sport success stories mainly in soccer, rugby, basketball and athletics, due to the good infrastructure built by Zisco mainly Zisco Club and Torwood \\"Mugomba\\" Stadium. Cricket was later introduced to the town as well. From the 1970s through to the mid-1990s, Ziscosteel F.C. was one of the country's best soccer teams. It had George Chieza of the Chieza family, Ephraim Moloi-Pikanegore, Abdul Njonga and the late Dr. Muganhiri. Ephraim Moloi-Pikanegore played for the national team and went on to be named in Zimbabwe‚Äôs best XI as he was known as ‚Äúa player with the Midas touch‚Äù. This because each and every club he played for won the league and other trophies/cups. He played for Zimbabwean giants Highlanders FC and Zimbabwe Saints FC before he moved to play for Ziscosteel FC. Moloi-Pikanegore then went on to coach Ziscosteel FC and under his tutelage the team produced talented players such as Issa Phiri, Santo Phiri, Herbert Chilembo, Ephraim Dzimbiri, Paul Gundani, Kennedy Nagoli, Abraham Senda, Ronny Jowa and Thamsanqa Thambo to name but a few of the players who represented the Zim national team. Another notable Football mentor from Redcliff is Benedict Moyo who coached the ladies national team and also ran a Football academy in the town. Other notable players to be produced in Redcliff include Clarkson Dzimbiri, Addluck Dzimbiri, Akim Dzimbiri, Kevin Nhodza, Nakai ‚ÄúCheche‚Äù & Tryan ‚ÄúPonki‚Äù Vakavisser. Zisco Rugby club also enjoyed success in the national league. It enjoyed success from players like Chunky Lewis, Christopher Bishi, Simon Mushaninga, Charlton Sibanda and Sabelo Mangena. Later on a new generation of younger players enjoyed short lived success due to financial difficulties. This young generation of players included Arnold Mutemeri, Zivai and Tafadzwa Mukuruva, David and Amon Bishi, Takesure Masanga, Prince Humbira, Phillip Tafirenyika, Robert Silubonde and many more. Basketball has also been a success on the domestic level. 'Iron Shooters' which was formed by Ricardo Chieza and Benjamin Karigambe, included Terence Machando, Jones Masikito, Nsoro Mzemba, Henry Kupakuwana, Tawanda Tangwanda, Tinashe Masawi and Andrew Sibili. What made it remarkable was that even though they were in their early teens, in high school education and didn't have any sponsorship, they still managed to play club 'giants' of the time like the Thornhill Air Force team etc. The team later changed its name to Redcliff 'Steelers' from Ziscosteel. Steelers would get spornsorship from Afdis and were named 'Nicoli Kinicks' for two seasons. With the departure of Ricardo Chieza, Benjamin Karigambe, Terence Machando and Jones Masikito in 1997,the team remodelled and took its old name of Redcliff Steelers . They then dominated Midlands Basketball with players like Tinashe Masawi, Greaterman Mudzengi, Lazarus ‚ÄúKC‚Äù Kaizare and Trynos Moyo. Steelers went on to qualify for the Sprite National Basketball League in 2000 as Midlands Basketball Champions. Steelers ladies were also formed and won a number of accolades with ladies Mavis Saladi, Tafadzwa Makunike and Lynda Muzemba representing the Midlands Province. Zisco Athletics teams produced many talented athletes, Christopher Madzokere, Stanley Mandebele,Melusi Ndlela,Tinos Maridza,Patson Muderedzi, Sam Madzinga and Mark Fanucci all of whom were members of Zisco's 4√ó100 and 4√ó400-metre relay team.

From the outset, Eldridge considered the Tacoma Narrows Bridge \\"his bridge\\". The Washington State Highway Department had challenged him to find money to help build it, and he did.

His latest book, Away from Chaos. The Middle East and the Challenge to the West (Columbia University Press, 2020) was reviewed by The New York Times as ‚Äúan excellent primer for anyone wanting to get up to speed on the region‚Äù. Biography Originally trained as a classicist, he started to study Arabic after a journey to the Levant in 1974. He first graduated in Philosophy and English, then completed his Arabic language studies at the French Institute in Damascus (1977‚Äì78), and received his degree in Political Science from Sciences Po in Paris in 1980. He specialized in contemporary Islamist movements, and spent three years at the Centre d'√©tudes et de documentation √©conomiques, juridiques et sociales (CEDEJ) where he did the fieldwork for his PhD (defended in 1983) on ‚ÄúIslamist movements in Egypt‚Äù, which would be translated and published in the UK in 1985 in English as The Prophet and Pharaoh (US: Muslim Extremism in Egypt, 1986). This was the first book in any language to analyze contemporary Islamist militants, and it remains a standard reader to this day in universities worldwide. After his return to France, where he became a researcher at CNRS (France National Research Faculty) he investigated the developments of Islam as a social and political phenomenon there, which led to his Banlieues de l‚ÄôIslam (not translated) book (1987), a primer on studies of Islam in the West. He then turned to the compared study of political-religious movements in Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and published in 1991 The Revenge of God, a best-selling book which was translated into 19 languages. As a visiting professor at New York University in 1993, he also did fieldwork among black Muslims in the U.S., which would be compared with phenomena pertaining to the Rushdie affair in the UK and the Hijab affairs in France, and lead to his Allah in the West (1996). He received his Habilitation √† Diriger des Recherches (Habilitation to be a PhD supervisor) in 1993 ‚Äì from a Committee presided by Pr Ren√© R√©mond, President of Sciences Po, and including Professors Ernest Gellner, R√©my Leveau, Alain Touraine, and Andr√© Miquel. He was promoted to research director at CNRS in 1995, and spent academic year 1995‚Äì1996 in the US as New York Consortium Professor (a joint position at Columbia and New York Universities and the New School for Social Research). He used the library facilities at NYU and Columbia to explore the scholarly sources for his best- selling book Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam based on two years of fieldwork in the Muslim World from Indonesia to Africa, which came out in English in 2001, and was translated into a dozen languages. Though the book was hailed due to its scope and perspective, it was criticized after 9/11 because it documented the failure of political Islamist mobilization in the late 1990s. Kepel answered his critics with his travelogue Bad Moon Rising in 2002. He then analyzed in retrospect that failure as the end of a first phase of what he would later designate as the ‚Äúdialectics of Jihadism‚Äù. It epitomized the struggle against the ‚Äúnearby enemy‚Äù, followed by a second phase (Al Qaeda) that learned the lessons of such failure and focused on the ‚Äúfaraway enemy‚Äù, which in turn failed to mobilize Muslim masses under the banner of Jihadists. It was ultimately followed by a third phase consisting of network-based Jihadi cells in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, that of ISIS. That Jihad trilogy was further developed in The War for Muslim Minds (2006) and Beyond Terror and Martyrdom (2008). With his students, Kepel also co-edited Al Qaeda in its Own Words (2006) ‚Äì a translation and analysis of chosen texts by Jihadi ideologues Abdallah Azzam, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al- Zawahiri and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. In 2001, he was appointed as a tenured professor of political science at Sciences Po, where he created the Middle East and Mediterranean Program, and the EuroGolfe Forum. He supervised more than 40 PhD dissertations, and created the ‚ÄúProche Orient‚Äù series, of which he was the general editor, at Presses Universitaires de France, for his PhD graduates to publish their first book after their dissertation. The series comprised 23 volumes from 2004 to 2017 ‚Äì many of them finding their way into English translations. In 2008, accused of assaulting Pascal Menoret at the Middle East Studies Association in Washington, after the latter had circulated online slanderous material, Gilles Kepel was expelled from the association.Coup de poing, dorures et ‚Äú‚Äòislamo-gauchistes‚Äù: enqu√™te sur Gilles Kepel, Les Inrocks, 7 d√©cembre 2016. In December 2010, the month of Mohammad Bouazizi's self immolation at Sidi Bouzid, in Tunisia, that sparked the Arab Spring, Sciences Po closed the Middle East and Mediterranean Program. Kepel was elected a senior fellow at Institut Universitaire de France for five years (2010‚Äì2015),Institut Universitaire de France Appointment which allowed him to refocus on fieldwork. He was also offered the visiting ‚ÄúPhilippe Roman Professorship in History and International Relations‚Äù at the London School of Economics‚Äù in 2009‚Äì2010. In 2012, he published Banlieue de la R√©publique, a survey of the 2005 French Banlieues riots in the Clichy-Montfermeil area, north of Paris, whence the events sparked. The study was based on one-year participant observation on the premises with a team of students, in cooperation with Institut Montaigne think-tank. A sequel, Quatre-vingt treize (or ‚Äú93‚Äù from the postal code of the Seine Saint Denis district north of Paris) designed a more general perspective on Islam in France, 25 years after Kepel's seminal Les banlieues de l‚ÄôIslam. In 2013, he documented the Arab upheavals with the travelogue Passion Arabe, a best-selling book that was awarded the ‚ÄúP√©trarque Prize‚Äù by France Culture radio and Le Monde daily as best book of the year. In 2014, Passion Fran√ßaise, a survey cum travelogue that documented the first generation of candidates to the Parliamentary elections of June 2012 who were from Muslim descent, and focused on Marseille and Roubaix, was the third book in a tetralogy that would culminate with Terror in France] / The Rise of Jihad in the West (2017 ‚Äì original French 2015) that dealt with the terror attacks by Jihadists in France and put them in perspective. In 2016, La Fracture, based on radio chronicles on France Culture in 2015‚Äì16, analyzed the impact of Jihadi terror in the wake of the massive attacks on French and European soil. It puts them in perspective with the rise of extreme-right parties in Europe and questions the very fracture of politics in the Old Continent. Kepel serves on several advisory boards such as the High Council of the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris and, since 2016, Kepel is a member of the advisory board of the Berlin-based Middle East think tank Candid Foundation. In February 2016 he was appointed chairman of the newly founded Program of Excellence on the Mediterranean and the Middle East at Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) University, based at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure. He is in charge of the monthly seminar on ‚ÄúViolence and Dogma: Territories and representations of contemporary Islam‚Äù. Since January 2018, Gilles Kepel is professor at the Paris Sciences & Lettres University. He is also director of the Middle Eastern Mediterranean Freethinking Platform at the Universit√† della Svizzera italiana in Lugano, Switzerland. The MEM Summer Summit is held every August, gathering young change-makers from the Middle East Mediterranean region. In October 2018, he published Sortir du Chaos, Les crises en M√©diterran√©e et au Moyen Orient. The book was translated into English by Henry Randolph and published in the US in 2020 by Columbia University Press as : Away from Chaos. The Middle East and the Challenge to the West. It is a sweeping political history of four decades of Middle East conflict and its worldwide ramifications. In the months following the publication, Gilles Kepel participated in webinars organized on both sides of the Atlantic and the English Channel, such as the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Al Monitor, the Center on National Security at Fordham University, Cambridge University‚Ä¶ The New York Times recommended the book in its 12 new books weekly selection. Ideas and analyses According to Kepel, jihadi terrorism is caused by fundamentalist Islam, an ideology which clashes with the values of Western democracies. In 2017, Kepel criticized Olivier Roy's assertion that jihadi terrorism is only loosely connected to Islamic fundamentalism as Roy neither speaks Arabic nor looks into the Salafi doctrine behind the jihadism. Kepel also referred to London as \\"Londonistan\\": \\"[the United Kingdom] gave shelter to radical Islamist leaders from around the world as a sort of insurance policy against jihadi terrorism. But you know, when you go for dinner with the devil...\\". Roy has said \\"I have been accused of disregarding the link between terrorist violence and the religious radicalisation of Islam through Salafism, the ultra-conservative interpretation of the faith. I am fully aware of all of these dimensions; I am simply saying that they are inadequate to account for the phenomena we study, because no causal link can be found on the basis of the empirical data we have available.\\" Bibliography (Books translated into English) *Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh, University of California Press, 1986. *The revenge of God: The resurgence of Islam, Christianity and Judaism in the modern world, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994. *Allah in the West: Islamic movements in America and Europe, Polity Press, 1997. *Bad moon rising: A chronicle of the Middle East today, London, Saqi, 2003. *Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam, Harvard University Press, 2003. *The War for Muslim Minds: Islam and the West, Harvard University Press, 2004. *Al Qaeda in its own words, G.

Together with the river Sarthe and its tributary the Loir it forms the Maine, which is a tributary to the Loire. Geography Its source is in the department of Orne near the commune of Lalacelle, between Pr√©-en-Pail and Alen√ßon. The source is in the foothills of Mont des Avaloirs at an altitude of 961 feet (293m); from there the river runs from east to west until it reaches Sept-Forges, at which point it turns to the south. After being joined by the Oudon, the Mayenne forms a confluence with the Sarthe north of Angers. The confluence of these two rivers is called the Maine, which is the local pronunciation of Mayenne. The waters of the Maine then empty into the Loire south of Angers. Departments and towns along the river include: * Orne * Mayenne: Mayenne, Laval, Ch√¢teau-Gontier * Maine-et- Loire: Chenill√©-Chang√©, Chambellay, Montreuil-sur-Maine, Le Lion-d'Angers, Grez-Neuville, Pruill√©, La Membrolle-sur-Longuen√©e, Feneu, Montreuil-Juign√©, Cantenay-Epinard, Angers. It is featured prominently in the video game Call of Duty 3. Navigation The Mayenne was navigable in its natural state up to Ch√¢teau-Gontier. Works were undertaken in the 16th century to make the river navigable upstream from here to Laval; royal decrees by Fran√ßois I in 1536 and 1537 authorised the necessary works, including flash locks. Economic expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries justified engineering with locks and weirs not only to Laval but also upstream to Mayenne. This extension, with 20 locks and weirs, was built at the same time as about 40 flash locks were replaced by 25 weirs and locks, some in short lock-cuts, between 1853 et 1878. The river was used by barges carrying up to 130 tonnes, and the principal traffics were construction materials (wood and stone), coal from the mines of L'Huisserie, grain, fruit and vegetables. At this time it was planned to build a watershed canal north from Mayenne to the tidal river Orne at Caen, but the project was abandoned as railways became the preferred carrier of freight. The navigation was abandoned after World War II, but restored from the 1970s as a cruising waterway. The upstream section was completed in the early 1990s. Flow In spite of abundant precipitation, the flow of the Mayenne is irregular because of the impermeability of the sandstone, granite, and schist which form its drainage basin. Thus, for an average flow of before the Mayenne's confluence with the Oudon, the yearly minimum flow can range from very low ( at Laval) to very high (flash floods with flows of at Laval and more than at Chambellay). The flow of the Mayenne has been observed for a period of 44 years (1965-2008) at Chambellay, situated upstream of the confluence with the Sarthe, and just upstream from where the Oudon joins the Mayenne. At this location, the drainage basin of the river is out of a total of , which is less than three- quarters of the entire drainage basin (71.5%), and also does not include the flow of the Oudon, the Mayenne's principal tributary. The average yearly flow at Chambellay is , which corresponds to over if the rest of the drainage basin were included.

History The Swiss became aware that their current machine, a commercial Enigma (the Swiss K), had been broken by both Allied and German cryptanalysts. A new design was begun between 1941 and 1943 by Captain Arthur Alder, a professor of mathematics at the University of Bern. The team which designed the machine also included Professors Hugo Hadwiger and Heinrich Emil Weber.Walter Schmid: Die Chiffriermaschine NEMA, p. 75, third edition, February 2005, Hombrechtikon ZH, Switzerland:de:Heinrich Emil Weber In the spring of 1944, the first prototype had become available. After some modifications, the design was accepted in March 1945, and production of 640 machines began the following month by Zellweger AG. The first machine entered service in 1947. NEMA was declassified on 9 July 1992, and machines were offered for sale to the public on 4 May 1994.

Full Thrust, Polish edition cover Full Thrust is a science fiction strategy wargame written by Jon Tuffley and published by Ground Zero Games of England. It is usually played with miniature figurines representing imaginary starships, although cardboard chits representing the vessels can also be used. Unlike many games, the publishers encourage the use of any miniatures rather than only \\"official\\" ones, though Ground Zero Games does also sell an extensive miniature range. Full Thrust is one of the most popular games representing starship battles.Winner of SFSFW Awards for Best SF Wargames Rules 1992/93, 1993/94, 1994/95,1995/96, 1997/98, 2002/03, 2003/04 The game has its own military science fiction/space opera universe. However, the rulebook states that this background is entirely optional; the game is intentionally designed to allow players a high degree of creativity within the rule set.Tuffley, J. M, Full Thrust: Second Edition (Ground Zero Games, Suffolk: 1992) p. 40 There are also many unofficial conversions to other sci-fi universes like Star Trek (sometimes called Full Trek), Star Wars and Honor Harrington. History The most current Full Thrust rules set is generally known as version 2.5, though this is not the title of any official release; it refers to the rules from Full Thrust, Second Edition (1992) as extensively amended by the two Fleet Book volumes (published in 1998 and 2000). Version 2.5 is often played with some rules from More Thrust, the most common being fighter morale. The plain Second Edition rules set is known as version 2, and itself incorporated several changes from the previous, now out of print, First Edition published in 1991. A Version 3.0 is planned for some time in the future, but no date has been set. However, the Second Edition and the Fleet Books are all available as free downloads in PDF form on the Ground Zero Games online store. Plot and universe Although the authors of the game stated that their universe is of second importance to the rules, nonetheless the universe as developed in the rulebooks has been adopted and expanded by many fans. The official universe is an example of a military space opera with numerous stellar factions fighting for control of the known space. The main political entities include four major human powers, dozens of smaller human powers and three alien races. The game is set around the year 2188. Major human empires:Full Thrust: Fleet Book Vol. 1 *NAC ‚Äî The \\"New Anglian Confederation\\" was formed in 2057. The NAC colonies fall under a constitutional monarchy. Their Royal Space Navy descended from the British Royal Navy, and is an amalgam of former British, Canadian and United States forces. Their official language is English and their capital is on the planet Albion. Their symbol is a stylized \\"A\\" shape with three bars of red, white and blue in the center. *NSL ‚Äî The \\"Neu Swabian League\\" was formed in 2101 after the split of the European Space Force. Their official language is German and their navy is known as the Kriegsraumflotte. Their capital is located on the planet Neu Salzburg. Their symbol is a stylized black eagle with spread wings on a field of red. *FSE ‚Äî The \\"Federal Stats Europa\\" (aka \\"Federated States of Europe\\") was formed in 2101 after the split of the European Space Force. Their colonies fall under a democratic council core government. Their official language is French and their space navy is known as L'Astromarine des FSE. Their symbol is stylized gold bull's head with a gold star between the horns upon a field of blue. *ESU ‚Äî The \\"Eurasian Solar Union\\" was formed in 2079. Their colonies fall under a primarily communist republic government made up of an amalgam of former Russian and Chinese societies. Their naval fleet, literally Military Space Fleet is known as Voyenno-Kosmicheskiy Flot in Russian and Taikong Jiann Dwee in Chinese. Their capital world is Nova Moskva. Their symbol is a red star with a gold edge on a red field. *IJSN ‚Äî The \\"Imperial Japanese Star Navy\\" was formed in 2108 with the threat of war from the ESU and the need to expand territory in search for resources. Their official language is Japanese and their writing is the Kanji script. Their naval command structure has fallen from the long-standing corporate structure back to the military doctrine. The capital world is Nihhon Prime. Their symbol of a rising red sun with red sun beams over a white background. Minor human powers ‚Äî There are also many smaller powers, such as Free Cal-Tex, the Pan- African Union, the League of Latin American Republics, etc. Other human powers also include various mercenary units allied to the highest bidder and numerous smuggling and pirate gangs operating within and outside the territories. Alien species:Full Thrust: Fleet Book Vol. 2 \\"The Xeno Files\\" *Kra'Vak ‚Äî The Kra'Vak, (their name translated as \\"People of the Sorrow Killer\\"), are clan- based bipedal anthropoids with a mix of reptilian and insectoid features. They communicate with a guttural language that is hard for humans to comprehend thus making relations with them very difficult. Relations are complicated further by the fact that Kra'vak pass through several gender and behavioral stages as they age which make them somewhat unpredictable as members of one stage are more aggressive and territorial than those in another stage. Kra'vak technology is similar to humans, but in some cases they are not as advanced. They favor powerful non-energy based weaponry such as railguns and missiles, and they also lack shield technology. *Sa'Vasku ‚Äî The Sa'Vasku are extremely long-lived semi-aquatic lifeforms resembling giant nearly-immobile jellyfish. They are an ancient race that has seen many space-faring species rise and fall. Little is known of their race except for the fact that they seem obsessed with balance and are fearful of change. They believe young space- faring races like humans are too naive to be left unchecked and they ruthlessly oppose their expansion into space. Sa'Vasku technology is biosynthetic and their spaceships are alive, genetically created and grown for specific purposes. Their construct ships are equipped with various \\"weapon organs\\" that generate energy beams or launch spore projectiles. *Phalon ‚Äî The Phalons are a carbon-based, oxygen-breathing species, somewhat humanoid in physique however they have multi-jointed limbs, exoskeletal hides and flat triangular-shaped heads dominated by single tri-lensed eye. They have three sexes, fertile males and females, and a more numerous asexual group that comprises most of their military force. Like the Sa'Vasku, Phalon technology is bio-synthetic in nature however they use genetically grown materials like humans use metal and plastic, building snail-like spaceships that are made from organic components but are not \\"alive\\" in their own right. The Phalon thinking-process is similar to humans, and the two species can carry on meaningful conversations, however Phalons are completely amoral. They take what they want without considering payment, and do what they wish without any regard to consequence. Overview of game mechanics Full Thrust: Second Edition Full Thrust (FT) uses six-sided dice, or d6, for all combat resolutions. Typically, a game of FT requires many six-sided dice. In the version 2.5 rule set, measurements in FT are based on Movement Units (MU), which can be equal to whatever measurements the players wish to use. Usually they are either inches or centimeters, but this depends on the sizes of the models used and the size of the battle board. Normally, rulers or tape measures are used to measure distances between models, as in most traditional figure-based wargames; FT can also be played on a hex-printed battle board where each 1 inch hex represents one MU, but the rules do not explicitly support this. FT is a turn-based game: each player secretly writes down their movement orders, then all players move their ships simultaneously or one after another, in accordance with those orders. Combat is played in several phases (missile movement, fighter attacks, direct-fire weapons, etc.). A game may be played until one side is wiped out, or for a set number of turns, but most commonly an explicit objective is set for each side, with victory determined both by this and by the remaining forces at the end of the game, or when one side has taken heavy damage and the player decides to retract their fleet from the game play. Point values For a pick-up game rather than part of a more extended campaign, players build fleets of warships based on point values. Opposing forces decide how many points they will be using before play; larger and more powerful ships cost more points, so this is a reasonable guide to the length and complexity of a battle. Mass factors Each ship has a Mass Factor which represents the size of its hull; all systems (weapons, drives, defences, etc.) must fit inside this. As the ship gets larger, its classification could change. The smallest ships are usually Scouts, Frigates, and Corvettes (9 - 28 mass); medium mass ships are Destroyers and Cruisers (30 - 90 mass); and the heaviest ships are Battleships, Dreadnoughts, and Carriers (up to about 270 mass). The game is capable of handling \\"Superships\\" which have Mass Factors over 300. Adding weapons and systems costs points as well as mass. Thrust rating All ships need sublight engines with a Thrust Rating. This number represents how many Movement Units (MU) on the battle map a ship can change its speed per turn. Speed is incremental, so for instance a ship with a Thrust Factor of 3 can increase its speed up +3 MUs per turn: from a speed of 3 one turn, to 6 the next, then to 9 the next, and so on. It can also slow down its thrust rating per turn as well. If it were at speed 9, it would take it 3 turns to slow to a dead stop. Two movement systems are available: the default \\"cinematic\\" system, in which ships move and turn in the style of wet navy vessels as seen in space opera film and television, and the \\"vector\\" system which is a rather more realistic representation of movement in space but is somewhat more complex. All movement of ships is planned ahead of time, before the miniatures are physically moved. These movements are written down on a Movement Orders sheet and kept secret from other players until the turn begins. Players must move their ships as they have written them down on their orders sheet. Movement orders must also include the launching of any missiles and fighters. FTL Most ships also have FTL (faster-than-light) drives; the only ones that don't are in-system defence ships, orbital stations, or \\"battle riders\\" brought into combat via an FTL tug. The FTL is normally used not for tactical but for strategic purposes, allowing a damaged ship or an outnumbered fleet to flee from battle and preserve its remaining strength. Due to the physical nature of the FTL system, it can (in desperation), be used as a weapon itself although it has as much a chance of destroying the ship that deploys it as it does an enemy vessel. Variant settings, such as the one based in the Star Trek universe (Full Trek), may have different technology rules. In Full Trek, the nature of the Warp drive allows ship-to-ship combat while in warp. Weapons There are several weapon systems available in the Full Thrust game: Beam weapons The most common ship weapons are Beam Batteries which have a power level such as 1, 2, 3 (or higher). The larger the number, the farther the battery can fire, and the more damage dice the weapon inflicts. For every power level of the battery, the beams can fire out 12 Movement Units (MUs) from the ship on the table. A Level 1 battery can fire at a maximum range of 12MU. A Level 2 can fire a maximum of 24MU, and so on. For every 12MU the beam fires, it loses 1 die of damaging power. For instance: A Level 2 battery inflicts 2 dice of damage within 12MU, and only 1 die of damage after that. Under the Second Edition (Ver. 2.0) of the FT rules, batteries had a letter designation, with Class C batteries being equivalent to Level 1 batteries. Class A was the most powerful until Mega AA batteries were added. Mega AAs could fire the farthest, but had a chance of burning out. In Ver. 2.5 the beam weapon system was refined, and the former class A became class 3, the former class B became class 2 and so on. In theory, there is now no limit to how powerful a beam weapon can be; for instance, a massive super ship could have a beam weapon of class 10 (or higher), although such an application would be impractical due to the increases of mass and point cost. The ship would have a better chance of inflicting more damage with several smaller weapons instead of one super weapon. Other systems Other kinds of offensive weapons include Pulse Torpedoes, Needle Beams (which can target a specific system on an enemy ship and disable it), Submunition Packs, Missiles, Minelayers and \\"mega-damage\\" weapons, such as the Nova Cannon and Wave Gun. Ships can be protected by Point-Defense Systems (PDSs), which are clusters of smaller weapons used to shoot down missiles and enemy fighters. There are also Screen systems to use against beam attacks, though not all weapons are impeded by them; missiles and mass driver projectiles can pass through to the hull, which are why PDSs can be an asset. Some other miscellaneous systems include Reflex Fields (which have a chance of deflecting a beam back at an attacker), Cloaking Fields, and Enhanced Sensors. Ships are required to include Fire Control sensors in their designs. Without firecons a ship cannot select targets; the more firecons incorporated into the design, the more targets the ship can fire at per turn. A specialised firecon, the Area Defence Fire Control, allows a ship's PDS to attack missiles and fighters aimed at other targets, in the manner of an Aegis ship. Fleet Book Vol. 2: The Xeno Files added even more weapons including mass drivers, strange alien weapons, and living ships hulls. Fighters If players include carriers in their fleets, they may dispatch groups of fighters into battle. There are many kinds of specialized fighter for different tactical attacks. Interceptors, for instance, have better chances of destroying enemy fighters but have no anti-ship strike ability, while Torpedo Fighters have a heavy one-shot anti-ship punch but are vulnerable to other fighters.

The musical is based on the Book of Genesis, with Act I telling the story of Adam and Eve, Cain, and Abel, while Act II deals with Noah and the Flood. Though commercially the musical has had very little success, it is popular in community and regional theatres worldwide, due to its ability to accommodate a large or small cast, religious subject, and its universal themes of family and love. The show's publisher, Music Theater International, reports that Children of Eden is one of its top 20 most frequently licensed properties. Production history Children of Eden was originally written in 1986 as Family Tree for a production by Youth Sing Praise, a religious-oriented high school theatre camp performed at the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows in Belleville, Illinois. Stephen Schwartz adapted the script and music of Family Tree into a full-length musical, giving it the title it uses today. The original cast production of Children of Eden was developed as a Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) workshop, directed by John Caird, and starring Ken Page as Father, Richard Lloyd-King as Snake, Martin Smith as Adam, Shezwae Powell as Eve, Adrian Beaumont as Cain, Kevin Colson as Noah, Earlene Bentley as Mama Noah, Frances Ruffelle as Yonah, Anthony Barclay as Japheth, Craig Pinder as Shem, Ray Shell as Ham, Hiromi Itoh as Aysha and Ruthie Henshall as Aphra. After the RSC's budget was cut, it opened at the Prince Edward Theatre in London's West End on January 8, 1991. The show closed on April 6, 1991 to poor reviews and after the Persian Gulf War put a damper on tourism worldwide. The show's poor reviews and quick closing meant that any hope of a Broadway transfer was abandoned. The original London cast album was released on LP and CD, but quickly went out of print. The CD release was marred by manufacturing defects that caused most of the discs to \\"bronze\\", becoming unplayable. Consequently, a playable copy of the disc is highly prized by musical theatre collectors. Schwartz believes the show has not played on Broadway because of the expense required to produce it in an Actor's Equity house, due to the cast of characters. The rarest recording of the show is concept recording released after changes were made following the 1991 London production. The tracks feature Stephen Schwartz himself playing the piano. The recording was made before the Papermill Playhouse production in an effort to review the rewrites and revisions. The album was made available only for a limited time on Stephen Schwartz's website via RealAudio streaming. This recording is considered to be the rarest version of the show that exists. There are only a handful of copies of this recording in existence. Throughout the 1990s, the show received numerous productions at both the amateur and professional levels; it was also reworked and edited, with songs and scenes being added and cut. In 1997, a major production was mounted at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey, featuring Stephanie Mills. A cast recording of this production was produced by Schwartz himself. This revised version, commonly known as the \\"American version\\" or \\"Paper Mill version\\", is substantially what is currently licensed for production in the United States. The New York City premiere of the piece was as the inaugural World AIDS Day Concert presented by Jamie McGonnigal and Kate Shindle for The York Theatre Company. The concert featured Julia Murney, Norm Lewis, Darius de Haas, and Jai Rodriguez and raised funds for The National AIDS Fund. A Gala charity concert adaptation ran for one night only at the Prince of Wales theatre in London on 29 January 2012. The concert was produced to support Crohn's and Colitis UK and featured performers from London's West End theatre community and from UK television. In 2013 Children of Eden was presented in Melbourne, Australia by award-winning production company Magnormos, as the finale of their Stephen Schwartz Celebration Triptych. The triptych also featured Godspell and Pippin and enjoyed the company of composer Stephen Schwartz in attendance. A one-night only concert was presented at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on May 19, 2014. The concert featured Ron Bohmer, Ashley Brown, Charl Brown, Rebecca Naomi Jones, and Jeremy Jordan.

Synopsis (American version) Act I The musical opens with the creation story from the Book of Genesis (\\"Let There Be\\") and the Storytellers, who narrate the piece, help Father (the God-character, who is always addressed as \\"Father\\") bring the universe and life into existence, including Father's new children, Adam and Eve. Eve finds herself drawn to the tree of knowledge, though Father makes it clear to her that she must stay away from \\"that tree,\\" with no clear explanation (\\"The Tree of Knowledge\\"). Father then attempts to distract Adam and Eve by playing a game where they name all the animals in the garden (\\"The Naming\\"). With his children distracted for the time being, everything is right with the newly created world and Adam and Eve fall in love with one another (\\"Grateful Children\\", \\"Father's Day\\", and \\"Perfect\\"). Eve, however, still hungers for something more; she wants to see what lies beyond the garden (\\"The Spark of Creation\\"). She meets a snake that tempts her with the fruit from the forbidden tree and the possibilities that open up for her if she eats it. (\\"In Pursuit of Excellence\\"). Eve eats the fruit and is awakened to the possibility and the world that lies beyond. (\\"The End of a Perfect Day\\" and \\"Childhood's End\\"). Eve attempts to trick Adam into eating the apple in several apple-related dishes, though she stops him before he consumes any of them. Eve tells Adam that she ate of the Tree of Knowledge and, as Father calls from the distance, the two hide in the garden. Father finds his children and, after discovering Eve has eaten the apple, tells her that she must leave the garden as she is no longer innocent. And, in a twist from the Genesis tale, Adam is then torn between these two choices: he can either stay with Father in Eden, or he can eat the fruit and be banished with Eve. Adam decides that, even though it means leaving the garden that he loves with all his heart forever, he must be with Eve (\\"A World Without You\\"). Adam and Eve are driven out of the garden by Father into the wasteland surrounding the garden and have two children, Cain and Abel (\\"The Expulsion\\" and \\"The Wasteland\\"). Several years later, Adam and Eve, along with their children, continue with their lives, hoping and praying that Father will one day return and bring them home to Eden. Eve realizes that the same fire that led to her eating the fruit is present in her son, Cain (\\"The Spark of Creation (Reprise 1)\\"). Cain, like his mother, longs to see the world, but out of fear for their children's safety, Adam and Eve have set their glen as the boundary, with no chance of their children going beyond the waterfall. Cain, upset that his parents have trapped them and that they let themselves get kicked out of Eden, complains to Abel about the problems that their parents created for them and his desire to see what lies beyond (\\"Lost in the Wilderness\\"). He begs Abel to leave to find the glen with him, as Father appears. Both boys, having never seen Father, are shocked and assume that he has arrived to take them back to the garden. Father shows his love and affection and promises the brothers their very own wives. However, it quickly becomes clear that Father has no intention of seeing their parents or taking any of them back to Eden. Cain, embittered, packs his things, tells Father and Abel that he is going to go find his future out in the wasteland, and leaves the glen (\\"Lost in the Wilderness (Reprise)\\"). Father tells Abel to keep his visit secret from his parents, but that he will return to them. Adam and Eve, deeply worried about Cain's safety out in the Wasteland, find some comfort in the fact that they have been able to create a life and family for themselves outside of Eden (\\"Close to Home\\"), but this peacefulness is once again shattered when Cain, back from his journey, tells the family that he has found a ring of giant stones, seemingly providing evidence of other humans. Cain takes the family to see the stones in the wasteland, with Eve and Abel just as excited as Cain. Adam, however, admits to his family that he had seen the ring of stones and those who live there years before, but never told them as he was afraid of the potential consequences (\\"A Ring of Stones\\" and \\"Clash of the Generations\\"). Adam's betrayal quickly leads to a family-wide fight, culminating in Cain threatening to leave forever and taking Abel with him. Abel, fighting through his heartbreak, decides to stay with his parents. Cain, beginning to leave, is forcibly stopped by Adam, who slaps Cain, which sends him to the ground. Cain tells Adam that he will kill him and the two attempt to fight, but when Abel intervenes, he is thrown off Cain, who, in his rage, beats him to death with a stone (\\"The Death of Abel\\"). Cain leaves the remaining members of his family, telling Adam that it should have been him that should be dead. Father, in his anger, decrees that Cain's descendants will always bear a mark for the sin of their ancestor (\\"The Mark of Cain\\"). Many years after Abel's death and Cain's departure, Eve lives with her children and grandchildren and prepares herself for death. She attempts to speak to Father about Cain's departure from the family, Adam's grief over the loss of both his sons, the birth of another son, Seth, who has since had children of his own, and Adam's recent death. She prays that her children and her grandchildren will regain the garden that was lost, as Father allows her into heaven (\\"Children of Eden\\"). Act II The storytellers reconvene and continue their story, following the lineage of both Seth and Cain, eventually tracing all the way down to Noah and his family, whose story comprises the second act‚Äôs plot (\\"Generations\\"). Father, after centuries of facing the race of Cain, tells Noah that a storm is coming to wipe them all away, save Noah's family, as they remain the few who are untainted by Cain's lineage. Noah begs Father to reconsider, but Father leaves him with the command to build an ark for both his family and two of every animal (\\"The Gathering Storm\\"). Noah has three sons, and the eldest two, Shem and Ham, have wives, but his youngest son, Japheth, is unhappy with the wives Noah has tried to obtain for him. Instead, he wishes to marry the servant- girl, Yonah, a descendant of the race of Cain, and Japheth tells this to his surprised family (\\"A Piece of Eight\\"); however, Noah will not allow Yonah on the ark, due to her being a part of the race of Cain. All the animals, played by the Storytellers, come to the ark so that they can board and be saved from the flood (\\"The Return of the Animals\\" and \\"Noah's Lullaby\\"). Later, Noah finds Yonah outside and explains to her that she cannot board the ark, though he wishes she could and he leaves to board. She understands her plight and continues to face her problems with an open heart and mind, as she always has (\\"Stranger to the Rain\\"). Japheth finds Yonah as she's leaving and attempts to convince her to sneak on to the ark with him. Japheth tells Yonah that he doesn't care about the repercussions of his actions, as long as he can be with her. The two vow to spend whatever time they have left with one another and board the ark (\\"In Whatever Time We Have\\"), just as Father unleashes his wrath on the earth and the race of Cain (\\"The Flood\\"). For forty days and forty nights, the rain continues, never ceasing, and tensions on the ark are high, with couples fighting and discussions on how to stay alive in these desperate conditions, including killing animals on the ark for food (\\"What is He Waiting For?\\"). Yonah, having stayed undiscovered, releases a dove to find dry land and save the residents of the ark (\\"Sailor of the Skies\\"). The family discovers Yonah, and Shem and Ham wish to throw her overboard, but Japheth intervenes. It escalates into a fight, directly mirroring the one between Adam and Cain generations ago, and it is only because Yonah intervenes that one of the brothers is not killed. Noah is unsure as to what he must do, sends the family away from him and attempts to talk to Father. His wife asks him if Father speaks to him anymore, and when Noah answers \\"No\\", she tells him, \\"You must be the father now;\\" that Noah has to live without God telling him what to do (\\"The Spark of Creation (Reprise 2)\\"). Noah sings of the difficulties that he has faced in being a father, while at the same time Father sings of the problems he has faced in being a father, but both come to terms with the fact that if you love something, you must let it go (\\"The Hardest Part of Love\\"). Noah calls the family together once more, all of them desperate for guidance and hope (\\"Words of Doom\\"). He decides to give Japheth and Yonah his blessing as the family gathers together to spend whatever time they have left as a happy, loving family (\\"The Hour of Darkness\\"). Then the dove Yonah released returns with an olive branch in its mouth, signifying nearby land, and the family again sees the light of the stars. The family rejoices as Mama leads the family in the gospel song (\\"Ain't It Good?\\"). Father gives humanity the power to control its fate and gives his blessing to find their future without his direct influence (\\"Precious Children\\"). As the family lands and leaves the ark, they separate, taking various animals to their new homes across the world. As they say their final goodbyes, the family sings of the problems they will face and their desire to return someday to the Garden of Eden (\\"In the Beginning\\").

He employed some Marxian concepts on political economy, but rejected Marx's stages of history, and economic history generally. Biography Frank was born in Germany to Jewish parents, pacifist writer Leonhard Frank and his second wife Elena Maqenne Penswehr, but his family fled the country when Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor. Frank received schooling in several places in Switzerland, where his family settled, until they emigrated to the United States in 1941. Frank's undergraduate studies were at Swarthmore College, from which he gained an Economics degree in 1950. He earned his Ph.D. in economics in 1957 at the University of Chicago. His doctorate was a study of Soviet agriculture entitled Growth and Productivity in Ukrainian Agriculture from 1928 to 1955. Ironically, his dissertation supervisor was Milton Friedman, a man whose laissez faire approach to economics Frank would later harshly criticize. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s Frank taught at American universities. In 1962 he moved to Latin America, inaugurating a remarkable period of travel that confirmed his peripatetic tendencies. His most notable work during this time was his stint as Professor of Sociology and Economics at the University of Chile, where he was involved in reforms under the socialist government of Salvador Allende. After Allende's government was toppled by a coup d'√©tat in 1973, Frank fled to Europe, where he occupied a series of university positions. From 1981 until his retirement in 1994 he was professor in developmental economy at the University of Amsterdam. He was married to Marta Fuentes, with whom he wrote several studies about social movements, and with Marta he had two sons. Marta died in Amsterdam in June 1993. His second wife was sociologist Nancy Howell, a friend for forty years: while married to her, they lived in Toronto. Frank died in 2005 of complications related to his cancer while under the care of his third wife, Alison Candela. Works and ideas During his career, Frank taught and did research in departments of anthropology, economics, geography, history, international relations, political science, and sociology. He worked at nine universities in North America, three in Latin America, and five in Europe. He gave countless lectures and seminars at dozens of universities and other institutions all around the world in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German and Dutch. Frank wrote widely on the economic, social and political history and contemporary development of the world system, the industrially developed countries, and especially of the Third World and Latin America. He produced over 1,000 publications in 30 languages. His last major article, \\"East and West\\", appeared in the volume: \\"Dar al Islam. The Mediterranean, the World System and the Wider Europe: The \\"Cultural Enlargement\\" of the EU and Europe's Identity\\" edited by Peter Herrmann (University College Cork) and Arno Tausch (Innsbruck University), published by Nova Science Publishers, New York. His work in the 1990s focused on world history. He returned to his analysis of global political economy in the new millennium inspired by a lecture he gave at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga (SSE Riga). In 2006 SSE Riga received Andre Gunder Frank's personal library collection and set-up the Andre Gunder Frank Memorial Library in his honor, with the support of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. Frank was a prolific author, writing 40 books. He published widely on political economy, economic history, international relations, historical sociology, and world history. Perhaps his most notable work is Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America. Published in 1967, it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory. In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age and, with Barry Gills, The World System: Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand. Frank's theories center on the idea that a nation's economic strength, largely determined by historical circumstances‚Äîespecially geography‚Äîdictates its global power. He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries. Frank has made significant contributions to the world-systems theory (which, according to him, should be rather called the World System one). He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the \\"long 16th century\\" (a position held, for example, by Immanuel Wallerstein). Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous \\"world-systems\\" did not make much sense (indeed, if there are many \\"world-systems\\" in the world, then they simply do not deserve to be called \\"world-systems\\"), and we should rather speak about one single World System.

He starred in the title role of the 2010 film Trollhunter. Biography At the age of 19 Jespersen became a Marxist- Leninist, and was briefly a member of the Communist organization Red Youth. Working in a local radio station, Radio Nova in Oslo, in 1988 Jespersen and collaborators Stig Holmer and Charlo Halvorsen launched the magazine programme Revolvermagasinet on Norwegian national radio. This night-time show featured unusual interviews. In 1992, the three again teamed up for The Show - storbymoro for enslige i Utkant-Norge on national television. The Show became the Norwegian candidate for the Rose d'Or in 1993, but several judges left the theatre before the programme was over. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Jespersen was hired as stunt reporter for Norwegian national television. This led to the first of the four O.J. series, in which Jespersen interviewed celebrities and later created such characters as T√•rnfrid, Wirrum, Den ensomme rytter, Baron Blod, Nazi-Per, and Birger as well as Friskusen. He has also made two seasons of Trotto Libre with Trond Kirkvaag. In 2002 he joined fellow comedians Silje Stang and Thomas Gjertsen to host the weekly comedy show Torsdagsklubben, gaining a reputation for his scathing closing monologue. Stang and Giertsen had formerly run the same show concept under the name Mandagsklubben. In the autumn of 2002, Jespersen's closing monologue targeted the Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, ridiculing the man's medication use and his unpopularity. He finished the programme by encouraging \\"all good forces'\\" to invite Christer Pettersson, a suspect in the murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, to Oslo. Bondevik denounced the monologue in an interview calling it cowardly and distasteful, sparking debate about the monologue in Norway. In the wake of the controversy, Jespersen received a number of death threats.Comedian hit with death threats Aftenposten November 1, 2002 He burned an American flag live on television in protest against the coming 2003 invasion of Iraq.\\"Comedian burns Bible as cameras roll\\", Aftenposten, March 28, 2006 His television show Rikets R√∏st premiered in early 2005. Among the show's recurring contributors are and were Zahid Ali, a Norwegian-Pakistani comedian; Pia Haraldsen; and Espen Eckbo, an actor. In spring 2006, while shooting a stunt for the show in the city of √Ölesund, Jespersen and Mayor Arve Tonning lit a bonfire in the centre of town and burned some Norwegian books and paper money. To the mayor's consternation, Jespersen then added several pages from the Bible's Old Testament, leading to national press coverage. In 2008, when Jespersen mourned the fleas and lice on Holocaust victims, a Jerusalem Post opinion article decried Norwegian television channel TV 2's defence of this incident, using it as an example of growing anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiments in Norway.Norway a Paradigm for Antisemitism Jerusalem Post, December 13, 2008 References External links Picture of burning American flag Category:1954 births Category:Norwegian comedians Category:Norwegian male film actors Category:Norwegian television personalities Category:Living people ","title":"Otto Jespersen (comedian)"},{"id":"1114876","title":"Richard Schweiker"},{"id":"1114880","text":"Akelarre is a Basque term meaning Witches' Sabbath.

He was played by Eriq La Salle. Benton was often portrayed as arrogant and irritable, but is nevertheless an exceptionally talented surgeon who is passionate about medicine. It is also revealed that he and fellow emergency room physician Mark Greene had attended medical school together. Benton's last appearance as a series regular was in the Season 8 episode \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\". La Salle's removal from the opening credits as an ongoing regular was in the 11th episode of season 8; however, Benton appeared in the credits of the 15th episode of season 8, in which he is shown talking to Elizabeth Corday, and the 21st episode, in which he appears at Mark Greene's funeral. He also appears later in season 15. Casting Although Benton was an original character, according to an interview La Salle gave in 1997, he was cast late in the role, after the first season had already started filming. He recalled, \\"I was surprisingly calm. When casting waits that long, they're basically waiting for someone to come in and take the role. I was ready and completely focused. I came into the office with a stethoscope and surgical greens I had left over from [a previous role in] The Human Factor. When I left, I wanted them to say 'That's Dr. Benton'\\". Within three days of his audition, La Salle was offered the role of Dr. Benton. Development The name of the character was inspired by The Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now part of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts) which was a teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School, where series originator Michael Crichton studied medicine, although (perhaps coincidentally) the birth name of Crichton's wife at the time, Anne-Marie Martin, was also Benton. Several relationships were scripted into the character's narrative. In Season 4 he began dating Dr. Elizabeth Corday, played by Alex Kingston. Both surgeons, the characters competed with each other professionally and failed to be adequately supportive of each other in their personal crises, so Corday ends the relationship in Season 5. According to an article published in Jet in 1999, Eriq La Salle was the reason why the romance dissolved. He was unhappy that Benton's interracial romance with Corday was being shown as less problematic than his prior romances with black characters, such as Jeanie Boulet (played by Gloria Reuben) and Carla Reese (played by Lisa Nicole Carson). In an interview La Salle stated, \\"As an African-American man, it becomes a bit offensive if the negative things are all you're showing. Because in real life we romance and get on each other's nerves and laugh and do all the things that any other race of people do. So if the only time you show a balanced relationship is in an interracial relationship, whether it's conscious or sub-conscious, it sends a message I'm not comfortable with.\\" Mindful of the image that he was portraying on television, La Salle asked producers to end Benton's interracial romance. While being interviewed by Johnnie Cochran on Johnnie Cochran Tonight, La Salle commented, \\"We have to take care of the message that we're sending as African-Americans or any other group of minorities, that we have the exact same type of exchanges with our mates that we get to see our White counterparts have.\\" In a subsequent episode, Benton was shown being compassionate to his former girlfriend, Jeanie.  Early days  Benton was first introduced in the pilot as a second year surgical resident. When all the attending surgeons are occupied in other surgeries, Benton decides to operate without supervision to control a bleeding aneurysm and keep a man alive until a qualified surgeon is available. Although he does this technically against regulations, he is supported after the fact by attending physician (and ER chief) David Morgenstern.  Family and Friends   Jackie and Peter's mother  In Season 1, we learn that Dr. Benton's mother has had a stroke and is mostly being cared for by his sister Jackie, who wants to move her into an assisted living facility, an option to which Peter is strongly opposed. One night when Benton is watching his mother in Jackie's home, she falls down the stairs and breaks her hip.  Jeanie Boulet  Benton meets Jeanie Boulet, a married Physician Assistant, at the hospital. Impressed, he hires her to work with his mother as a physical therapist. Benton's mother dies, devastating him, and when Jeanie comforts him, they end up having an affair. In Season 2, Benton's affair with Jeanie ends. Jeanie separates from her husband Al and learns that he contracted HIV from an affair, and furthermore that he passed the disease on to her; however, Jeanie does not pass the virus to Peter.  Carla Reese  In Season 3, Peter becomes involved with a former girlfriend, Carla Reese, who soon becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a son, Reese Benton, who is born prematurely. It is later discovered that, possibly from complications from Reese's prematurity or his NICU treatment, the boy is deaf. Peter at first has difficulty accepting that his son is deaf and looks into surgeries to restore his ability to hear, but he later makes his peace with who Reese is, and he and Carla teach him to communicate through sign language. Later, Carla begins a new relationship with a man named Roger McGrath (which she clumsily, and unsuccessfully, tried to keep a secret from a non-plussed Peter) and eventually marries him. At the end of Season 5, Carla more or less tells Peter that her new marriage to Roger means she will be taking Reese with them to Roger's new job in Germany, and responds to Peter's shocked and angry response by saying \\"this WILL happen\\". At the start of Season 6, legal proceedings have begun over Peter's refusal to agree to Carla's demands. Carla once again angers Peter by whining that he should just step aside and agree with her, and then shocks Peter by telling him that he may not be Reese's father, saying that she needed him to be a father at the time but Roger can fill that role in the future (back in Season 3, Carla hypocritically was angry when Peter asked if she was sure he was the father, implying he was a jerk for suggesting what turned out to be entirely true). Peter takes a DNA test to determine whether or not Carla's suspicions are true, but he chooses not to receive the results and decides he will be Reese's father regardless of biology. Carla does not respond to Peter's pleas to end the legal fight, but on Christmas Eve shows up angrily at the hospital with Reese and bitterly tells him \\"you win\\" and sarcastically thanks him for ruining her and Roger's lives, as Roger's boss booted him from the Germany-based promotion over the time he spent in court and they will have to remain in Chicago; Peter bluntly says he is sorry about the job but completely NOT sorry that his son will remain in the same city as him. In Season 7, Carla shows up anew to openly flirt with Peter, cause problems between him and new girlfriend Cleo Finch, and lie to Roger about Peter hitting on her to the point where Roger and Peter have an altercation in the ER. In the 2nd episode of Season 8, Carla is killed in a car accident. Peter takes Reese into his full custody, but when Roger continues to appeal for time with his stepson, Peter insists that Roger move on with his life and stay away. Roger sues Peter for custody of Reese, and his lawyers force Peter to address the fact that he may not be Reese's biological father. Peter takes another paternity test and this time learns the truth‚Äîhe is not Reese's biological father. Roger's lawyer makes issue of the long hours Peter's job demands, whereas Roger works from home and commands his own schedule. During court, Peter perjures himself on the witness stand and proclaims that he has been given a new schedule with reduced working hours at County General Hospital. A furious Roger confronts Peter about lying, but quickly turns into an asshole when he dares Peter to hit him and then says Peter \\"can't give your sister a new kid!\\" (Katherine Benton's son Jesse was murdered in Season 7 by gang members). Peter later goes to his supervisor, Dr. Robert Romano, and asks for such a schedule, but Romano cannot offer only daytime hours. Peter hands in his resignation, and he goes to the out-of-town clinic where girlfriend Cleo Finch now works to try to get a job there. He is successful and gets the hours he had promised the judge, and he is awarded sole custody of Reese with Roger receiving visitation rights. When a saddened Roger brings Reese's Christmas presents to the hospital later that day, Peter, knowing that Roger is important to Reese, tells Roger to come to his and Cleo's home on Christmas Day and give the presents to Reese himself. He does tell Roger he is doing this not for Roger's sake but for Reese and both men tacitly acknowledge Peter has won.  Elizabeth Corday  When British surgeon Dr. Elizabeth Corday starts work at County General Hospital, she is quickly attracted to Benton, though he initially disregards her attentions. At length, Elizabeth tells him she believes that he does not want to pursue a relationship with her because of their racial difference, and Benton finally grudgingly admits to her that \\"I do have a problem dating white women.\\" Professionally, Benton and Corday attempt to outdo each other several times, and both are eventually given the opportunity to work with Dr. Robert Romano. Later in the year, Benton assists on a surgery performed by his mentor Dr. David Morgenstern. Morgenstern (who has been somewhat hesitant about surgery following his heart attack) makes a serious mistake that endangers the patient's life. Benton shoves him out of the way to take over the operation, with Elizabeth walking in too late to see Morgenstern's mistake but witnessing Benton's actions toward Morgenstern. Benton is suspended and comes close to losing his job before Morgenstern finally comes forward with the videotape of the operation, which exonerates his former student. Morgenstern then resigns from the hospital, and a distraught Peter begins an affair with Elizabeth. They remain together through much of the following two years, although their relationship eventually begins to suffer due to Peter's needing to spend more time attending to Reese. Elizabeth helps him realize that their romance isn't going anywhere, and they end their affair, though they remain close friends and colleagues. Their friendship is troubled, however, when Elizabeth approaches the hospital staff with the idea of a trauma surgical fellowship. Benton withdraws his tentative commitment to Romano's cardiothoracic fellowship (which would be extremely time-consuming) and campaigns for and is granted the trauma fellowship. Elizabeth feels betrayed by Peter and, wishing to stay at County, takes Romano's cardiothoracic fellowship offer. Americans were reportedly disturbed by Benton and Corday's interracial relationship, many simply assuming Corday was black in order to cope. Alex Kingston, who played Corday, later said: \\"[Y]ou see interracial relationships all over the place [outside America]. I kind of naively thought it would be even more liberal in America. And it couldn't have been further from the truth. In fact, I'm trying to think if there's a television show right now [in 2013] where there's an African American and Caucasian relationship. They're few and far between.\\"  Cleo Finch  In Season 6, Benton began dating Dr. Cleo Finch, an ER pediatrician. Their relationship was stormy because of Peter's ex- girlfriend Carla, but in Season 8 they leave Chicago along with Benton's son Reese to start a new life. Peter Benton and Cleo Finch transfer to a different hospital. In the season 15 episode \\"Old Times,\\" Benton is seen wearing a wedding ring, and it is assumed he and Cleo are now married. Later in the episode, as Carter awakes from surgery, he asks Benton who is watching Reese; Peter matter-of-factly answers \\"he's at home with Cleo\\".  John Carter  In the pilot episode, John Carter is introduced as a third-year medical student on his ER rotation. He is assigned to Benton, who proceeds to give Carter a hard time. They seldom get along and their personalities clash on many occasions. Benton is more ambitious and focused on surgery whereas Carter is more compassionate and willing to spend time with patients, a trait that \\"drove [Benton] crazy\\" as he put it to Cleo, although he considered Carter to be a talented and smart doctor. In Season 3, Benton develops appendicitis and Carter operates on him. However, Carter eventually decided to leave surgery for emergency medicine, a decision that caused him to clash with Benton. Nonetheless, the two have reconciled and, despite the fact that they have interacted less since Carter's transition to emergency medicine, formed a deep friendship. In Season 6, Benton was visibly concerned about Carter after he was stabbed by a schizophrenic patient, and eventually operates on him along with Dr. Anspaugh. During the surgery, Benton has become protective of Carter, and expresses reluctance to leave his former prot√©g√© for another patient. Soon after, upon hearing Carter becoming addicted to painkillers, he refuses to watch Carter self-destruct and convinces Carter to enter rehab. In Season 8, before Dr. Benton departs County General, his final farewell is to Carter. As a going-away present, Carter hands Benton a train token; it is the same one Benton had given him shortly after he started in the ER. Carter was left exhausted and distraught after a shift where the ER had handled a mass casualty, and when he admitted the night had devastated him Benton simply gave him the token and said that if he was serious about being a good doctor, he would use it to come back to work the next day. Carter did return for his scheduled shift but kept that token as a reminder of what the job entailed. In Season 15, he reunited with Carter when he was in need of a kidney transplant. Benton supervises the operation at the hospital where he works and makes sure that his old friend and colleague gets the best medical support. As Benton knew that Carter has gone to Africa for the past 4 years, it is likely that both doctors kept in limited contact with each other while working at different hospitals.  Career  Dr. Romano eventually offers Benton an attending trauma surgeon position, but when a Medicare patient needs a surgery that Romano refuses to allow to be performed, Benton calls social services and informs them of the refusal of care. Romano intercepts the patient as social services arrives and performs the surgery, but he is enraged at Peter for calling them. Romano then retracts the idea of an attending trauma surgeon, explaining to Peter that the fines social services and Medicare inflicted on the hospital roughly equal what Peter's yearly salary would have been. Romano then offers Benton a per diem surgical position with reduced benefits and more difficult scheduling, but Benton refuses. Romano also uses his considerable influence to blacklist Benton throughout the medical community, making it impossible for Benton to find a job in Chicago. Corday finds a new job for him in Philadelphia, but Carla will not continue joint custody of Reese if Peter leaves town (citing Peter's resistance to her and her husband Roger's plans to move the year before). Peter is then forced to go to Romano and accept the per diem position. After the court battle between Roger and himself, Benton is forced to move away from County to work better hours in another hospital, in order to gain custody of Reese. In his last surgery at County, Benton miraculously saves a six-year-old victim of a shooting accident.  After County General  After leaving the series, Benton was seen a few more times. The first time was when he was passing the torch to Dr. Corday and she told him that her marriage to Benton's friend and colleague Dr. Mark Greene was in trouble. His next appearance was at the funeral of Greene. Benton appears in a photo as part of a slideshow at Dr. Carter's farewell party, and Benton is heard in a voiceover memory as Carter leaves the ER for the last time in the 11th-season finale. Eriq La Salle made an uncredited appearance in the opening of \\"Heal Thyself\\" to tell the audience of the death of the show's creator Michael Crichton.  Season 15 During the 15th and final season of ER, at the end of the episode \\"The Book of Abby\\", long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Among them, the tag \\"Benton\\" can be seen. Benton returns in the 19th episode of the 15th (final) season of ER in the episode \\"Old Times\\" which first was broadcast on 12 March 2009. In the episode he visits old friend and former student John Carter who is awaiting a kidney transplant, and it is revealed that Benton has left private practice for a surgical attending position at Northwestern University Hospital now that Reese is thirteen. He is seen wearing a wedding ring, so it is assumed he has married Cleo Finch who Benton states is at home watching Reese. Benton decides to observe Carter's transplant and Benton's insistence on being thorough, which annoys the surgeon, allows a complication to be resolved and the surgery to be a success. In the series finale, Benton goes to Carter's opening of his new hospital with Reese. He also goes to the afterparty with Carter, Susan Lewis, and Kerry Weaver and meets Elizabeth Corday and Rachel Greene.  Reception  Dr. Peter Benton was named the #10 Top TV Dad by SocialTechPop in 2011. Entertainment Weekly included him in their list of the \\"21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever\\".

On its banks is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest which stretches from Sittingbourne to Whitstable in Kent. It is also a Ramsar internationally important wetland site and a Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. Parts of it are a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I, National Nature Reserves, a Kent Wildlife Trust nature reserve and a Local Nature Reserve.  History  A distance shot of the two Swale crossings. The name \\"Swale\\" is Old English in origin, and is believed to mean \\"swirling, rushing river\\", or \\"rushing water\\".. . While Ekwall takes the origin of this name to be identical with that of the Yorkshire river, Mills says it is \\"probably identical\\". The Swale was originally part of a river. Prior to the formation of the English Channel in about 6500 BC, the eastern coast of Great Britain extended much further into the area of the present-day North Sea, and the Isle of Sheppey formed part of mainland Britain. The channel now occupied by the Swale comprised a river valley facing eastwards. As sea-levels rose, water occupied the whole length of the valley, dividing today's Isle of Sheppey from the mainland. When the Romans arrived in Britain, the Swale extended much wider than it does today, with one part of the Isle of Sheppey -- now called the Isle of Harty -- a separate island. Two ferry services also crossed the Swale, one between Oare and Harty, and the other between Murston (near Sittingbourne) and Elmley (another former hamlet on the Isle of Sheppey). The Isle of Harty is no longer separate but the marshlands now gradually filling the channel delineate it. The channel needs constant dredging to allow use of the busy waterway. The Swale is crossed at its western end by two bridges: the Kingsferry Bridge and the later Sheppey Crossing.  Nature  hide on the Kent Wildlife Trust reserve at Oare Marshes Sunset over the Swale The Swale forms both a National Nature Reserve and a Special Protection Area: the eel grass, Ray's knotgrass, white seakale, glassworts and golden samphire support rare and uncommon migrant butterflies and moths, including the Essex emerald, the ground lackey, the clouded yellow butterfly and rare hawk-moths. Since 1968, it has also been a Site of Special Scientific Interest.  Birds  The Swale provides habitats for the following birds: * Avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta) at least 17 percent of Great Britain's breeding population * Marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) at least 15 percent of Great Britain's breeding population * Mediterranean gull (Larus melanocephalus) * Bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica) * Eurasian golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) * Hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) * Ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) * Black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa islandica) * Grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola) * knot (Calidris canutus) * pintail (Anas acuta) * Common redshank (Tringa totanus) * Shoveller (Anas clypeata) See also *Swale (local government district) References  External links  *English Nature page *Description of Special Protection Area *Map sources for Category:Thames Estuary Category:Channels of England Category:Special Protection Areas in England Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Kent Category:Nature Conservation Review sites The Swale Category:Ramsar sites in England Category:Straits of England Category:National nature reserves in England ","title":"The Swale"},{"id":"1114897","text":"El Libertario (English: The Libertarian) is the title of several Spanish- language anarchist journals.

Valentine. Lewis Edward Valentine (1 June 1893 ‚Äì March 1986) was a Welsh politician, Baptist pastor, author, editor, and Welsh-language activist. Early life Valentine was born in Llanddulas, Conwy, the son of Samuel Valentine, a limestone quarryman, and his wife Mary. He began studying to go into the ministry of the Baptist church at the University College of North Wales, Bangor but his studies were curtailed due to the First World War. Founding Plaid Cymru His experiences in World War I, and his sympathy for the cause of Irish independence, brought him to Welsh nationalism, and in 1925 he met with Saunders Lewis, H. R. Jones, and others at a 1925 National Eisteddfod meeting, held in Pwllheli, Gwynedd, with the aim of establishing a Welsh party. Discussions for the need of a \\"Welsh party\\" had been circulating since the 19th century. With the generation or so before 1922 there \\"had been a marked growth in the constitutional recognition of the Welsh nation,\\" wrote historian Dr. John Davies. By 1924 there were people in Wales \\"eager to make their nationality the focus of Welsh politics\\". The principal aim of the new party would be to foster a Welsh speaking Wales. To this end it was agreed that party business be conducted in Welsh, and that members sever all links with other British parties. Valentine, Lewis and others insisted on these principles before they would agree to the Pwllheli conference. According to the 1911 census, out of a population of just under 2.5 million, 43.5% of the total population of Wales spoke Welsh as a primary language.BBC Wales History, 1911, extracted 12-03-07 This was a decrease from the 1891 census with 54.4% speaking Welsh out of a population of 1.5 million.BBCWales history, 1891, extracted 12-03-07 With these prerequisites Lewis condemned \\"'Welsh nationalism' as it had hitherto existed, a nationalism characterized by inter- party conferences, an obsession with Westminster and a willingness to accept a subservient position for the Welsh language,\\" wrote Dr. Davies. It may be because of these strict positions that the party failed to attract politicians of experience in its early years. However, the party's members believed its founding was an achievement in itself; \\"merely by existing, the party was a declaration of the distinctiveness of Wales,\\" wrote Dr. Davies. During the inter-war years, Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru was most successful as a social and educational pressure group rather than as a political party. T√¢n yn Ll≈∑n 1936 Welsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK government settled on establishing a bombing school at Penyberth on the Ll≈∑n peninsula in Gwynedd. The events surrounding the protest, known as T√¢n yn Ll≈∑n (Fire in Ll≈∑n), helped define Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru. The UK government settled on Ll≈∑n as the site for its new bombing school after similar locations Northumberland and Dorset were met with protests. However, UK Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin refused to hear the case against the bombing school in Wales, despite a deputation representing half a million Welsh protesters. Protest against the bombing school was summed up by Lewis when he wrote that the UK government was intent upon turning one of the 'essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature' into a place for promoting a barbaric method of warfare. Construction of the bombing school building began exactly 400 years after the first Act of Union annexing Wales into England. On 8 September 1936 the bombing school building was set on fire and in the investigations which followed Saunders Lewis, Lewis Valentine, and D.J. Williams claimed responsibility. The trial at Caernarfon failed to agree on a verdict and the case was sent to the Old Bailey in London. The \\"Three\\" were sentenced to nine months imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs, and on their release they were greeted as heroes by fifteen thousand Welsh at the Pavilion Caernarfon. Many Welsh were angered by the Judge's scornful treatment of the Welsh language, by the decision to move the trial to London, and by the decision of University College, Swansea, to dismiss Saunders Lewis from his post before he had been found guilty. Dafydd Glyn Jones wrote of the fire that it was \\"the first time in five centuries that Wales struck back at England with a measure of violence... To the Welsh people, who had long ceased to believe that they had it in them, it was a profound shock.\\" Second World War Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru members were free to choose for themselves their level of support for the war effort. Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru was officially neutral regarding involvement the Second World War, which Valentine, Lewis and other leaders considered a continuation of the First World War. Central to the neutrality policy was the idea that Wales, as a nation, had the right to decide independently on its attitude towards war, and the rejection of other nations to force Welshmen to serve in their armed forces. With this policy party leaders hoped a significant number of Welshmen would refuse to join the British Army. Lewis and other party members were attempting to strengthen loyalty to the Welsh nation \\"over the loyalty to the British State.\\" Lewis argued \\"The only proof that the Welsh nation exists is that there are some who act as if it did exist.\\" However, most party members who claimed conscientious objection status did so in the context of their moral and religious beliefs, rather than on political policy. Of these almost all were exempt from military service. About 24 party members made politics their sole grounds for exemption, of which twelve received prison sentences. For Lewis, those who objected proved that the assimilation of Wales was \\"being withstood, even under the most extreme pressures\\". Pastor, author, and editor As a pastor he served church in north Wales and edited the Baptist quarterly magazine, Seren Gomer, from 1951 to 1975. He also wrote of his experience in the war in Dyddiadur milwr (=A soldier's diary), 1988. Valentine is also famed as the writer of the hymn Gweddi dros Gymru (\\"A prayer for Wales\\"), usually sung to the tune of Jean Sibelius's Finlandia Hymn. This is considered by some to be the second Welsh national anthem, and has been recorded and widely performed by Dafydd Iwan. Further reading *Valentine, Lewis (1893‚Äì1986). In Meic Stephens (Ed.)

In this story, set in 1946, Oswald has amorous designs on his Syrian host's wife and teenage daughter, with unfortunate and unexpected consequences. Plot Oswald becomes stranded for a night near Cairo at the desert mansion of a wealthy businessman, Abdul Aziz, whose wife and adult daughter are both very beautiful. Oswald plots to seduce either the wife or daughter, and believes he has succeeded after a woman slips into his bedroom under cover of darkness and spends several passionate hours with him, although he cannot see her face and she refuses to converse with him. The next day, Oswald leaves the house none the wiser as to which of the two women he has slept with. The story ends with a twist as Mr. Aziz reveals to Oswald that he has a second daughter who lives in seclusion in another part of the house ‚Äì because she has incurable leprosy. Publication history \\"The Visitor\\" was first published in the May 1965 issue of Playboy. It was later included in the 1974 collection Switch Bitch. Norton H. Moses states that Dahl's story was expanded from an anecdote found in George \\"Dod\\" Orsborne's Master of the Girl Pat, published in 1949. In other media Television In his later years, Alfred Hitchcock occasionally told this story as a black joke during his appearances on American talk shows, most notably during an appearance on The Tomorrow Show on 29 May 1973. Akhbar's Daughter, a 1987 television pilot associated with Tales from the Darkside, bears many similarities to the Dahl and Orsborne stories.

He played as a forward or attacking midfielder and spent the majority of his playing career at MTK Hung√°ria FC. During the 1950s he was also a key member of the Hungarian National Team team known as the Golden Team. Other members of the team included Ferenc Pusk√°s, Zolt√°n Czibor, S√°ndor Kocsis and J√≥zsef Bozsik. In 1953, playing as a deep lying centre-forward, he scored a hat-trick for Hungary when they beat England 6‚Äì3 at Wembley Stadium. Playing from deep, Hidegkuti was able to distribute the ball to the other attackers and cause considerable confusion to defences. This was an innovation at the time and revolutionised the way the game was played. Hidegkuti died on 14 February 2002 after suffering from heart and lung problems for some time before his death. MTK Hung√°ria FC renamed their stadium, Hidegkuti N√°ndor Stadium in his honour. Club career Hidegkuti started his career in Elektromos FC and Herminamezei AC. MTK Budapest Hidegkuti began playing for MTK in 1947. In 1949 when Hungary became a communist state, MTK were taken over by the secret police, the √ÅVH and subsequently the club changed their name several times. Initially they became Textiles SE, then B√°stya SE, then V√∂r√∂s Lobog√≥ SE and then finally back to MTK. Despite this turmoil, the 1950s proved a successful era for club and it was while at MTK that Hidegkuti, together with P√©ter Palot√°s and coach M√°rton Bukovi, pioneered the deep lying centre-forward position. With a team that also included Mih√°ly Lantos and J√≥zsef Zakari√°s, MTK and Hidegkuti won three Hungarian League titles, a Hungarian Cup and a Mitropa Cup. In 1955, as V√∂r√∂s Lobog√≥ SE, they also played in the first ever European Cup. Hidegkuti scored twice as they beat RSC Anderlecht 10‚Äì4 on aggregate in the first round. After retiring as a player, Hidegkuti also had two spells as a coach at MTK. International career Hidegkuti and Ferenc Pusk√°s in 1954. Between 1945 and 1958 Hidegkuti earned 69 appearances and scored 39 goals for Hungary. He scored twice on his debut on 30 September 1945 in a 7‚Äì2 win against Romania. Two years later, on 17 August 1947, he made his second international appearance and scored a hat-trick against Bulgaria. On 18 November 1951 he scored another hat trick against Finland. He became a central player in the Golden Team of the early and mid-1950s; during this time, Ferenc Pusk√°s, S√°ndor Kocsis and Hidegkuti provided the Hungarians a total of 198 goals. Hidegkuti was used by the Golden Team as a deep lying centre-forward. In the 1950s, the majority of international sides still used the WM formation, where the defending centre half would traditionally mark the opposition's centre forward ‚Äì usually whoever was wearing the number 9 shirt. When a defending centre half attempted to mark Hidegkuti, they were drawn out of position, allowing the rest of the Hungarian team to exploit the space. At the time this was a revolutionary tactic, requiring the player in the deep lying centre-forward position to have excellent ball control, distribution skills and positional awareness. Former England and Leeds United manager, Don Revie paid tribute to the influence of Hidegkuti in his autobiography: \\"In the summer of 1954 England and Scotland were knocked out of the World Cup series in Switzerland. That competition was won by Germany, but dominated by Hungary, who played with a deep-lying centre forward, Nandor Hidegkuti. Alongside him; Sandor Koscis and Ferenc Puskas, two of the greatest inside-forwards in the world. But whatever people claim of Koscis and Puskas, it was the man Hidegkuti who tore the England defence to shreds at Wembley in November 1953. It was Hidegkuti, again playing his hide- and-seek centre-forward game, who shattered England in the return match in Budapest in May 1954, when we were thrashed 7‚Äì1.\\" Sepp Herberger, manager of the West German team that would defeat Hungary in the 1954 World Cup final, identified Hidegkuti as the most important player in the Hungarian team (despite Puskas drawing a lot more public attention) and adjusted his tactics for the final to prevent him from playing out his game. Managerial career As a manager Hidegkuti coached clubs in Hungary, Italy, Poland and Egypt. In 1961 he guided Fiorentina to victory in the first ever European Cup Winners' Cup, beating Rangers 4‚Äì1 on aggregate in the final. With Gy≈ëri ETO he won the Hungarian League in 1963 and then took them to the semi-final of the 1964‚Äì65 European Cup where they lost to eventual runners-up, Benfica. In Egypt, Hidegkuti coached Al Ahly, introducing a 5‚Äì3‚Äì2 formation. For his model behaviour as a player and coach, he was awarded the 1993 FIFA Fair Play Award.

The Foundation The SSVOBB is a non-profit- foundation of students in Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology in Delft, Netherlands dedicated to building aircraft with historic or scientific value. Main objective is to apply the knowledge acquired as an engineering student to real aircraft. Volunteers learn that practice quite often differs substantially from the theoretical ideal situation. The organisation was founded on January 19, 1990 when the students organised the building of their first aircraft the Lambach HL II. Lambach HL II Lambach HL II replica in-flight The original The original Lambach HL was commissioned by Dutch aviation enthusiasts to try to beat the far superior German aerobatics pilots and aircraft in aerobatics contests. She was completely designed and build within six months by the Dutch engineer and Delft University of Technology graduate Hugo Lambach. The biplane had a steel tube, cloth-covered fuselage, wooden wings and tail and was powered by a Gipsy Major Mk. 1. After test flights she was successful at several air shows where she proved to be a unique aerobatics aircraft, however not quite the quality of the German aircraft. The aircraft was destroyed during a German bombing raid on the Ypenburg airfield near The Hague on May 10, 1940. Hugo Lambach Hugo Lambach was a Delft graduate in applied physics. During his study he already designed and built his first aircraft, the Lambach HL.I. After graduation he worked with Koolhoven Vliegtuigfabrieken. With the commissioning of the Lambach HL II he started his own aircraft factory, Lambach Vliegtuigfabrieken, which ultimately only produced one aircraft. After the war he worked with Fokker for several years and had his own engineering company. Hugo Lambach died July 8, 1972. Replica The replica started out as a student's joke in 1989 to organise a stunt in honour of the 45th anniversary of the Society of Aerospace Students 'Leonardo da Vinci'. Thanks to a complete set of drawings found in the Aviodrome museum and the help of Hugo Lambach's main engineer Willem de Koo, the students managed to complete the aircraft in six years. Her first flight took place on September 18, 1995. The aircraft was demonstrated at several air shows in the Netherlands and Belgium during 1996. In 1997 inspection showed the need for heavy maintenance which has grounded her since. Currently (2014), maintenance continues on the replica while it is being stored at the Dutch aviation museum Aviodrome. Current maintenance that is being done on the aircraft is to reinforce the bracket such that it can better handle engine vibrations and updating the panel. The panel needs to be updated to comply with modern regulation, as such the replica will, unlike the original, be equipped with radio and transponder. The Impuls A 2004 artist impression of The Impuls (PH-VXM) In 1994 the society started working on their second project: the Impuls (Dutch for momentum, registration PH-VXM (velocity times mass)), which was designed by the society's students only. The design started in 1994, but by the summer of 2010 the society decided to freeze the project. The Impuls concept consisted of a 2-seat FAR-23 certified aircraft, propelled by an engine in a pusher configuration. Other distinctive characteristics were the two tail booms and the large windows ensuring a broad view. Materials characterising the Impuls, were the in the beginning 1990s state of the art glass fibre composite used in wings, tail booms and outer fuselage shell. The inner fuselage however, still consisted of a load carrying steel inner frame as monocoque composite constructions were still very rare back in the ‚Äò90‚Äôs. The S-Vision S-Vision preliminary design In December 2009, SSVOBB Lambach Aircraft decided to freeze the Impuls-project and the remaining time of that academic year was used to make a thorough evaluation of the project. By the summer of 2010, after having conducted a feasibility study, the society decided to make a second attempt at building an own designed aircraft, which would later be named: S-Vision Unlike the design of the Impuls, that of the S-Vision is substantially more conventional. The S- Vision will have a low wing, fixed gear and single tail boom. The aircraft will be certified according to CS-VLA, which was introduced in 2003. Power will be generated by a four-cylinder opposing engine providing 130Hp driving the pull-prop. As the society gained experience in the manufacturing of composites and aluminium during the Impuls- project, these will be the main materials used in the S-Vision. Design on the S-Vision started in September 2010 and work has now been progressing for nearly four years, during which the conceptual and preliminary design were fully completed. By the spring of 2014 volunteers started working on material testing. Currently (June 2014) volunteers are working on the detailed design.

Following the adoption of the 1995 constitution, the Region was created from the westernmost portion of the Gojjam province (the part north of the Abay River), and the northwestern portion of the Welega Province (the part south of the Abay). The name of the region comes from two local ethnic groups ‚Äì Berta (also called as Benishangul) and Gumuz.

The Abay River (Blue Nile) divides Benishangul-Gumuz, and there was no bridge crossing it until 2012. The major road that connects the Metekel Zone and the Assosa Zone was built by the China Construction Company in 2012. The road has a 365-meter bridge that crosses the Abay. Nowadays it is simple to travel between the regional capital of Assosa and Gilgil Beles, the capital of the Metekel Zone.

The Accords ended the 1954‚Äì1962 Algerian War with a formal cease-fire proclaimed for 19 March and formalized the idea of a cooperative exchange between the two countries, as well as the full independence of Algeria from France. Content of √âvian Accords The √âvian Accords consisted of 93 pages of detailed agreements and arrangements. In essence these covered cease-fire arrangements, prisoner releases, the recognition of full sovereignty and right to self-determination of Algeria, in addition to guarantees of protection, non-discrimination and property rights for all Algerian citizens. A section dealing with military issues provided for the withdrawal of French forces over a period of two years, with the exception of those garrisoning the French military base of Mers El K√©bir (see below). Other provisions pledged that there would be no sanctions for any acts committed prior to the ceasefire. French President Charles de Gaulle wanted to maintain French interests in the area, including industrial and commercial primacy and control over Saharan oil reserves. In addition, the European French community (the colon population), the pieds- noirs and indigenous Sephardi Jews in Algeria were guaranteed religious freedom and property rights as well as French citizenship with the option to choose between French and Algerian citizenship after three years. In exchange, Algeria received access to technical assistance and financial aid from the French government. Algerians were permitted to continue freely circulating between their country and France for work, although they would not have political rights equal to French citizens. The OAS right-wing movement opposed the negotiations through a series of bombings and an assassination attempt against De Gaulle at Clamart in Paris in August 1962. The agreements included an article which stated that \\"Algeria concedes to France the use of certain air bases, terrains, sites and military installations which are necessary to it [France].\\" The agreement specifically permitted France to maintain its naval base at Mers El K√©bir for another fifteen years and facilities for underground nuclear testing in the Sahara); France chose to withdraw from the base in 1967, however, only five years after the agreement.Alistair Horne, A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962 The vote In a referendum held on 8 April 1962, the French electorate approved the Accords, with almost 91% in favour.

The Linux kernel and the LinuxTV CVS include a fair number of drivers for commonly available PCI cards and USB devices, but the DVB subsystem core is also targeted towards set-top boxes which run some (embedded) Linux. The LinuxTV project was originally initiated by the Berlin, Germany based company Convergence Integrated Media GmbH with the goal to distribute free and open source software for the production, distribution and reception of digital television. In 1998, the Convergence founders claimed that \\"Only the access to the source code of our future television sets will guarantee the independence of content and technology\\". After some financial troubles, in 2002 Convergence had been taken over by the German set top box manufacturer Galaxis AG, and renamed to Convergence GmbH. Although both Convergence GmbH and Galaxis AG went bankrupt in 2005, the LinuxTV project lives on independently, being supported by the large developer community that had gathered around the project over the years. Another significant Convergence development is DirectFB, a thin library that provides hardware graphics acceleration and windowing features for GTK+-based and other graphical Linux applications without the use of X.Org Server, and which its developers claim \\"adds graphical power to embedded systems\\".

Lawsuit   Bankruptcy fraud  Paul John, Paul Michael and his brother Daniel are named in a 2007 lawsuit alleging fraudulent transfer, brought on behalf of Turner Construction.http://www.thrnewmedia.com/assets/occhop.pdf This dates back to 2003 and a ruling in favor of Turner in 2005 concerning the original OC Iron Works company. It is alleged that assets were stripped from the OC Ironworks, transferring the viable assets, contracts and personnel to a new company OC Ironworks LLC, before bankrupting the former. This involved transferring the ownership to Paul Jr. and allegedly selling the assets to the new company with unfair compensation. Trustee Tom Genova filed fraud complaints in 2007 with the Bankruptcy Court and in complaint sought to have the transfers from the old company to the new company judged fraudulent and set aside. He also sought to make the new company liable for the old company's debts. A proposed settlement was reached with Orange County LLC paying out $500,000 to Genova to be distributed to the creditors.  Teutul v Teutul  On February 16, 2011, the New York State Unified Court System's website, showed that the Teutul v Teutul civil action was no longer active. The case had been \\"Disposed\\", meaning the case was out of the court system.

The land continued to pass by inheritance until it was sold in 1928. The village had an alternative name of Ashlington, which was in common use until the 19th century. The village grew along both sides of a street, with the church near the middle; after houses in the central section fell into disuse, by 1885 that part of the street had been reduced to a footpath, and today the village continues as two distinct settlements. Manor Farmhouse, a Grade II* listed two-storey timber framed building, is from the early 16th century. Etchilhampton House, 1773, is a two- storey three-bay house in brick and stone. Etchilhampton stood on the Devizes- Upavon road until, in 1768, a new road (now the A342) was built on the southern slope of Etchilhampton Hill, avoiding the steep gradients of the earlier route. A few years later a monument ‚Äì a stone plinth bearing a seated lion ‚Äì was erected by the turning for Etchilhampton in memory of James Long of Wedhampton, who had promoted the new road. A school was built in the centre of the village in 1831, and rebuilt in 1875. Children of all ages attended until 1929, when older pupils were transferred to Devizes. The school closed in 1970 owing to low numbers of pupils. The population of the parish peaked in the mid 19th century, with 282 recorded at the 1841 census. Numbers fell to 170 by 1881 and have continued at or below that level.  Parish church  The Church of England parish church of St Andrew dates from the 14th century and has a late 12th century font; other furnishings include 17th century box pews. The chancel was rebuilt in the 1860s. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1962. It has always been a chapelry of All Saints' Church at All Cannings; today it is served by the Cannings and Redhorn team ministry, which covers a large area of the Vale of Pewsey. Local government Etchilhampton is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most significant local government functions.

He is remembered for his role in the development of the national capital Canberra, as well as his advocacy for the creation of a national bank. O'Malley was of American origin and arrived in Australia in 1888. He worked as an insurance salesman before entering politics, in both professions making use of his knack for oratory and publicity stunts. He served a single term in the South Australian House of Assembly (1896‚Äì1899), before moving to Tasmania and winning election to the House of Representatives at the inaugural 1901 federal election. O'Malley was a political radical, and joined the Labor Party upon its creation despite his status as one of the wealthiest members of parliament. He was a keen proponent of banking reform, especially the creation of a national bank, and successfully lobbied for its inclusion in the Labor platform. He was dissatisfied with the initial form of the Commonwealth Bank, but later proclaimed himself as its \\"father\\"; the amount of credit he deserves for its creation has been debated. After Labor won the 1910 federal election, O'Malley was elected to cabinet by the party caucus over the objections of Prime Minister Andrew Fisher. As home affairs minister, he oversaw the construction of the Trans-Australian Railway and the early development of the new national capital, including the design competition won by Walter Burley Griffin. He banned alcohol in the Australian Capital Territory. O'Malley's second term as home affairs minister was troublesome, marked by conflict with Prime Minister Billy Hughes among others. He remained loyal to the ALP during the 1916 party split, but lost his seat at the 1917 election. O'Malley was the last surviving member of the first federal parliament and spent his retirement defending his legacy. His political views combined with his personal background and personality traits made him a controversial figure during his career, and his life has continued to attract public interest. Early life Birth and parentage Uncertainty exists about the details of O'Malley's birth and upbringing, largely due to the inconsistent accounts he provided throughout his life. He was probably born on 2 July 1858 in the American state of Kansas. Numerous sources during his lifetime recorded his year of birth as 1858, but after about 1940 he began to exaggerate his age, claiming a birth year of 1854. At some point, he also began to celebrate his birthday on 4 July, coinciding with Independence Day in the United States. His private diaries record that he personally celebrated his birthday on 2 July until 1947, but then apparently shifted the date by two days to emphasise his American origins. As a result, O'Malley's obituaries listed his date of birth as 4 July 1854. During his political career, O'Malley claimed to have been born in Quebec, at a location called \\"Stanford Farm\\" close to the U.S. border. He stated that no birth certificate existed, as registration of births was not yet standard in frontier regions. This account of his birth differed from those he related at other periods of his life. In an 1893 letter to the editor of the Adelaide Advertiser, he proclaimed himself \\"a humble sovereign citizen of that supreme nation, the United States\\". Towards the end of his life he wrote \\"I am an American [...] that is the truth\\". O‚ÄôMalley's place of birth had implications for his status as a member of parliament. If he was born in Canada, as he claimed, he was a British subject and faced no eligibility restrictions. If he was born in the United States, his election to federal parliament was in violation of section 44(i) of the constitution; similar provisions applied in South Australia and Tasmania, where he also ran for parliament. O‚ÄôMalley's claim of Canadian birth was received with skepticism during his lifetime, and has generally been regarded as unreliable. Although he was unable to provide any proof beyond a sworn affidavit, political opponents were also unable to conclusively prove that he was born an American. On his 1910 marriage certificate, O‚ÄôMalley listed his parents as Ellen (n√©e King) and William O‚ÄôMalley, and his father's occupation as rancher. His unusual given name was supposedly taken from his mother's family name, a common practice in the United States. His parents‚Äô identities have not been corroborated, and other information that he gave on the certificate was of dubious accuracy. In 1913, O‚ÄôMalley stated that his father was born in Ballymena, in the north of Ireland. The following year, he said that his parents were British subjects born in the United Kingdom (which included Ireland at the time). However, in old age he referred to his ‚ÄúAmerican-born parents‚Äù. O'Malley claimed to have a brother and sister, and apparently stayed with his brother Walter in the small community of Kelly, Kansas, when he returned to the U.S. in 1917. Childhood O'Malley grew up in Kansas, possibly in Pawnee County. He likely had little formal education, as his writing was \\"usually deficient in style, grammar and spelling\\". According to O'Malley's own account, his father was killed in the American Civil War when he was a young boy. He was then sent to live in New York City with his aunt and uncle, Edward and Caroline O'Malley, where his uncle ran a small bank near Wall Street. He began working there at the age of 14, and was promoted to teller at 16 and handling loans by 19. After a disagreement with his uncle, he left the bank at the age of 22 and took a job selling insurance. regards the basic facts of O'Malley's account to be accurate, as he had a detailed knowledge of American banking practices and of New York City. However, he expresses doubt over the details. describes it as \\"at least partially true\\", but notes \\"there is no evidence to suggest that he ever lived in New York\\". Adult life in the United States Before he moved to Australia, O'Malley lived a transient lifestyle as an insurance salesman and real estate agent on the west coast of the United States. There are contemporary references to him in California, Oregon, and Washington Territory, as well as in his presumptive home state of Kansas. At various times O'Malley sold policies for the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, the Home Life Insurance Company of New York, and the Equitable Life Insurance Company. In April 1887, the Chicago Inter Ocean reported that he had forwarded policies amounting to $200,000 from Oregon, an immense sum at the time. He may have also made money engaging in land speculation, as he was wealthy enough to invest in property in Seattle which he retained for several decades. Surviving records indicate that he had \\"somewhat dubious\\" business practices ‚Äì in 1887 he made a series of large deposits at a bank in Corvallis, Oregon, then abruptly withdrew his entire account. As a young man, O'Malley became a devotee of the temperance movement; his apparent home state of Kansas had been one of the first to enact statewide prohibition. He gave fiery public speeches in the towns where he sold insurance, warning against the dangers of what he called \\"stagger juice\\". O'Malley supported the pro-temperance Republican Party, and in 1884 stumped for the presidential campaign of James Blaine. He later claimed that he would have been appointed ambassador to Chile if Blaine won. While in Texas O'Malley founded a church, taking the title of \\"First Bishop of the Waterlily Rock Bound Church, the Red Skin Temple of the Cayuse Nation\\" in order to take advantage of a government land grant then being offered to churches. In 1881 O'Malley married Rosy Wilmot, who died from tuberculosis shortly before she was due to give birth in 1886. O'Malley claimed he had contracted the disease from her and in 1888, having been given six months to live, he sailed for Queensland, Australia. Move to Australia Photo of O'Malley from the official album of the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, 1888 In April 1888, the Oregon City Courier published an article titled \\"King O‚ÄôMalley Exposed\\". The newspaper reported that he and a partner had \\"placed policies to the amount of tens of thousands of dollars by misrepresentation\\", and that the Home Life Insurance Company was actively warning customers not to take any money from him. O'Malley left for Australia a few months later, arriving in Sydney in late July 1888. He travelled from San Francisco via Hawaii aboard the SS Mariposa. He then went south to attend the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition; his photograph appears in the exhibition's official albums, where he is listed as a representative of an American glass manufacturer. O'Malley had a different version of his arrival in Australia. According to his account, he moved to Australia for health reasons, as he was suffering from tuberculosis. He supposedly arrived in the country at Port Alma, Queensland, then took up residence in a cave at Emu Park where an Aboriginal man named Coowonga nursed him back to health. He subsequently walked overland to Sydney and Melbourne before eventually reaching Adelaide. Of this account, states \\"whatever its merits as a story, it has absolutely none as a statement of fact\\". O'Malley fabricated a dramatic arrival story to hide his real reason for leaving the United States ‚Äì to escape embezzlement allegations. Given the documentary evidence placing him in Sydney and Melbourne in 1888, it would have required a rapid recovery from tuberculosis followed by a walking journey of hundreds of miles, conducted within a timespan of several months. South Australian politics Undated photo In 1895 he settled in Gawler, South Australia, and at the 1896 election he was elected as a member for Encounter Bay in the South Australian House of Assembly as a radical democrat, opposed to the wealthy landowners who then dominated colonial politics. Calling himself a follower of Christian Socialism, his most popular platform among conservatives was to rid hotels of barmaids \\"hired for their physical attributes rather than their prowess in drawing ale\\". Although O'Malley was unsuccessful at the time, laws were passed in 1909 to require registration of barmaids, who had to be a member of the owner's family. O'Malley's narrow win in 1896 has been credited to his popularity among religious leaders and conservatives for his extreme puritan views, but it seems his popularity with women voters was a bigger factor. Women were much taken by his appearance and O'Malley's \\"oratorial buffoonery\\" was the popular topic of discussion throughout South Australia. He called hotels \\"drunkeries\\", alcohol was \\"stagger juice\\", opponents were \\"diabolical rapscallions\\" and he referred to himself as the \\"bald headed Eagle from the Rocky Mountains\\". Federal politics O'Malley in 1908 O'Malley was defeated at the 1899 election, and the following year he moved to Tasmania, the smallest of the Australian colonies. There, a tall, fashionably-dressed American preaching the Gospel and radical democracy drew immediate attention, and he was elected at the 1901 federal election as a member for Tasmania, along with four others. In 1903 he was elected as the member for Darwin. Although there was no Labour Party in Tasmania at this time, he joined the Labour Party Caucus when the Parliament assembled in Melbourne. Historian Gavin Souter describes O'Malley at this time: > O'Malley's monstrously overgrown persona seemed to be inhabited > simultaneously by a spruiker from Barnum's three-ring circus, a hell-and- > tarnation revivalist, and a four-flushing Yankee Congressman. He was a > moderately big man, auburn-haired with watchful grey eyes and a red-brown > beard, wearing a wide-brimmed felt hat, blue-grey suit with huge lapels and > a low-cut vest, loose cravat with a diamond collar stud, and in the centre > of his cream silk shirt-front a fiery opal. O'Malley was clearly one of the more prominent and colourful members of the Parliament, but his radical ideas were not widely accepted, and many regarded him as a charlatan. He became a prominent advocate of a national bank as a means of providing cheap credit for farmers and small businessmen. He was not a member of Chris Watson's first Labour ministry in 1904, or of Andrew Fisher's first ministry in 1908. But in April 1910 the Caucus elected him to the ministry of Fisher's second government. Ross McMullin, who wrote an official history of the ALP, suggested \\"his election as minister was probably attributable in part to the fact that several caucus colleagues owed him money\\". O'Malley drives in first peg of Canberra O'Malley at the naming of Canberra ceremony Canberra O'Malley became Minister for Home Affairs, and played a prominent role in selecting the site of the future capital of Australia, Canberra. He declared American architect Walter Burley Griffin winner of the town planning competition. On 20 February 1913, O'Malley drove in the first peg marking the start of the development of the city. He was also present at the ceremony for the naming of Canberra on 12 March 1913. As a teetotaler he was responsible for the highly unpopular ban on alcohol in the Australian Capital Territory. He could also claim credit for beginning the building of the Trans-Australian Railway from Port Augusta to Perth. Commonwealth Bank O'Malley also agitated for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a state-owned savings and investment bank although, contrary to his later claims, he was not the bank's sole creator. He later wrote that he had led a \\"torpedo squad\\" in Caucus to force a reluctant Cabinet to establish the bank, but historians do not accept this. Prime Minister Fisher was the bank's principal architect. Partly to allay fears of \\"funny money\\" aroused by O'Malley's populist rhetoric, Fisher ensured that the bank would be run on firmly \\"sound money\\" principles, and the bank as established did not provide the easy credit for farmers that the radicals desired. Final years in parliament Caricature of O'Malley by Will Dyson Labor was defeated at the 1913 federal election, and when it returned to office at the 1914 federal election, O'Malley was not re-elected to the Cabinet. In October 1915, however, Fisher retired and O'Malley returned to office in the first ministry of Billy Hughes, again as Minister for Home Affairs. But a year later the government split over the determination of Hughes to introduce conscription to fill the ranks of Australia's armed forces in World War I. Although he was not an active anti-conscriptionist, O'Malley was pressured by Hughes to resign his portfolio but he refused to do so. He finally lost office on 13 November 1916 when Hughes and twenty-four other Labor members walked out of the Caucus and formed the National Labor ministry. Hughes called the 1917 federal election, and O'Malley was heavily defeated in his northern Tasmanian seat of Darwin by former Labor colleague Charles Howroyd, a conscriptionist who was running for Hughes' Nationalist Party. O'Malley suffered a swing of almost 15 percent, and was one of many Labor figures swept out in that year's massive Nationalist landslide. He stood unsuccessfully in the seat of Denison in 1919, and in Bass in 1922, but he was never again returned to elected office. Later life Although he was only 63 at the time of his defeat, he retired to Melbourne and devoted his time to building up his own legend, particularly in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, and to polemical journalism on a variety of pet causes. He lived to be about 95, outliving his nemesis Hughes by 14 months. At the time of his death he was the last surviving member of the first Australian Parliament and last surviving MP who served when Edmund Barton was Prime Minister. Furthermore, he was the last surviving member of Andrew Fisher's second Cabinet. Legacy O'Malley's importance in developing the national capital is remembered in Canberra with the suburb of O'Malley being named after him. A pub in Canberra, King O'Malley's Irish Pub in Civic, is also named after him ‚Äì a tongue-in- cheek reference to his sponsorship of the unpopular alcohol ban in the Australian Capital Territory during Canberra's early years. O'Malley is the subject of a 1970 musical play The Legend of King O'Malley by Michael Boddy and Bob Ellis.

Steeplechase Park was created by entrepreneur George C. Tilyou in 1897 and operated until 1964. It was the first of the three original iconic large parks built on Coney Island, the other two being Luna Park (1903) and Dreamland (1904). Of the three parks, Steeplechase was the longest-lasting, running for 67 years. The first rides in Steeplechase Park were standalone attractions, scattered around Coney Island, that Tilyou had purchased in the early 1890s. Steeplechase itself opened in 1897 to unite these formerly- separate attractions, and quickly gained popularity as a family-friendly destination with exhibitionist and risque undertones. It was destroyed by fire in 1907, but was quickly rebuilt. Steeplechase kept itself financially profitable, as the Tilyou family continuously brought in new rides and new amusements to the park, such as the Parachute Jump. However, by the 1960s, Steeplechase Park was becoming unprofitable due to high crime, the growth of suburban getaways, and the area's general trend toward residential development. After the park closed in 1964, developer Fred Trump purchased the land and intended to develop it for residential use, but this never came to pass, and the site was used for seasonal amusement rides during the 1970s. A dispute ensued over the proposed use of the Steeplechase Park site in the 1980s and 1990s, as two developers disagreed over whether to rebuild the amusement park or build a sports complex on the site. Eventually, a minor- league baseball stadium called Keyspan Park (now MCU Park) was built in 2001. Steeplechase Plaza, a portion of Luna Park (2010) that contains the B&B; Carousell, is a homage to the former Steeplechase Park. Today, the Parachute Jump is the only remaining portion of the former amusement park, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation maintains the land under MCU Park as part of a greenspace called Steeplechase Park.  Tilyou's early ventures  Steeplechase was created by George C. Tilyou (1862‚Äì1914). He had become familiar with Coney Island's economy from an early age: when he was three years old, his family started operating a popular Coney Island restaurant called the Surf House. Tilyou's first business venture was in 1876, at the age of fourteen, when he sold boxes of Coney Island sand and salt water to unwitting tourists for 25 cents each, earning $13.45 in the process. Tilyou later invested in stagecoaches and real estate before opening Tilyou's Surf Theater, Coney Island's first theater, with his father in 1882. The area outside the theater became known as \\"Bowery Street\\", after the Bowery, a notorious neighborhood in Manhattan. By 1887, Tilyou was dealing primarily in real estate; at the time, crime and corruption in Coney Island were prevalent. When Tilyou testified against John Y. McKane, one of the leaders of the corruption, he faced constant harassment until McKane was arrested in 1894.The steeplechase rideTilyou married Mary O'Donnell in 1893 and they went to visit the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago for their honeymoon. Upon seeing the fair's Ferris wheel, which contained 36 cars each with a 60-passenger capacity, Tilyou wished to buy it. However, since the wheel had been sold already, Tilyou decided to build his own half-size version at Surf Avenue, on Coney Island. Tilyou's Ferris wheel, erroneously dubbed the \\"World's Largest Ferris Wheel\\", contained 12 cars each with a capacity of 18 passengers, and soon became Coney Island's biggest attraction. After noting that the nearby Sheepshead Bay, Gravesend and Brighton Beach horse-racing tracks were very popular, Tilyou added other rides and attractions on the Coney Island peninsula. Tilyou came to own several rides including the Aerial Slide, the Bicycle Railroad, and the Double Dip Chutes, However, none of these rides were part of any single park, and Tilyou did not think to combine these rides into one park until the opening of Paul Boyton's Sea Lion Park nearby in 1895. The eventual creation of Steeplechase Park came after Tilyou bought and improved the Steeplechase Horses ride, an attraction by J.W. Cawdry that featured gravity-pulled mechanical horses racing along metal tracks.  Operation  left  1897‚Äì1907: Creation and early years  Steeplechase Park opened in 1897 with the completion of the Steeplechase Horses attraction. The park covered , an area of which Tilyou owned two-thirds outright; the other third was leased from the Huber family. It was located at the western end of Bowery Street. Steeplechase was approached by a grand stone archway on Surf Avenue to the north, the top of the archway decorated by four stone horses. The inclusion of a gateway, along with a new 25-cent admission charge, were intended to exclude the \\"seedier elements\\" and make the park a family destination. Drinking was prohibited, as was gambling and prostitution. The park included over 50 attractions on its midway alone. Attractions included novelties such as the Human Niagara, a Venetian gondola-style ride, the Aerial Racing Slide, the Double-Dip Chutes, the Bicycle Railway, a \\"French Voyage\\" panorama, and a Wild West sideshow. Tilyou also operated a small steam railroad, a saltwater pool, a ballroom, and the Scenic Railroad coaster by LaMarcus Thompson. Completing the park were scale models of world landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and The Palace of Westminster's clocktower, containing Big Ben. Steeplechase Pier, a pier jutting into the ocean, was built to the south of the park in 1904. Tilyou adopted a \\"Funny Face\\" mascot depicting a smiling man with several dozen teeth, nicknamed \\"the Tilly\\", as the icon for his park. The mascot, which became a symbol of Coney Island, represented the area's wholesomeness and neoclassical architecture combined with its veneer of hidden sexuality. In 1901, Tilyou visited the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, New York, to find additional rides for Steeplechase Park. He approached Frederic Thompson and Elmer \\"Skip\\" Dundy, the creators of the popular \\"A Trip To The Moon\\" ride, to ask if they would bring their ride to Steeplechase. The ride, an indoor dark ride that simulated a space flight, had been popular within the exposition, and Thompson and Dundy signed an agreement to relocate the attraction to Steeplechase for a year. However, a rainy 1902 season reduced the profits of amusement park operators at Coney Island that year, and forced the closure of the adjacent Sea Lion Park. Thompson and Dundy elected not to keep \\"A Trip To The Moon\\" at Steeplechase; instead, they spent $700,000 rebuilding Sea Lion and moved the attraction to the newly expanded park, now called Luna Park, in 1903. Following Luna Park's success, another amusement park on Coney Island, Dreamland, opened in 1904. At Coney Island's peak in the middle of the 20th century's first decade, the three amusement parks competed with each other and with many independent amusements. This was attributed partially to the variety of transit options available: by 1904, there were five railroads to Coney Island. Both Luna Park and Dreamland had more expensive attractions than Steeplechase Park. Tilyou countered this by modifying and adding contraptions for his customers, most of which carried an exhibitionist and risque undertone but were nonetheless popular despite their vulgarity. The entrance contained the Barrel of Love, a revolving drum that threw visitors onto each other. Other contraptions included the Human Roulette Wheel, Earthquake Stairway, Dew Drop, Whichway, and Wedding Ring. All of these rides tossed riders around, often on top of each other, as they were designed under the assumption that men and women wanted any excuses to grab onto each other. The success of Steeplechase and other parks in Coney Island inspired Tilyou to create additional amusement parks in the New York City area and elsewhere. In November 1904, Tilyou announced that he would sell Steeplechase Park to a syndicate of investors for $1.25 million, since he wanted to operate another amusement park in Rockaway, Queens. However, the sale of Steeplechase was annulled in February 1905 after $50,000 had been paid, since \\"defective titles\\" prevented the syndicate from purchasing some of the land under the park. From 1905 to 1907, Tilyou refined Steeplechase Park with attractions such as a miniature railroad, an orchestra stand, the Cave of the Winds, a Fads and Fantasy Building, the Limit Building, and a children's pony track. The Limit Building was short-lived, being replaced by the Monte Carlo Building in 1907.  1907 fire and rebuilding  In the early morning of July 29, 1907, a fire started within the Cave of the Winds attraction. It spread quickly, destroying most of the wooden pavilions and hotels around Bowery Street; however, firefighters fought to save Tilyou's house at the corner of Steeplechase Park. The three-alarm fire was extinguished after two hours, but about of Coney Island was destroyed by the fire. Steeplechase bore much of the damage, which was estimated at $1.5 million, but several hotels were also ruined. Even though the fire destroyed nearly everything within Steeplechase Park, Tilyou reportedly remained calm throughout, even promising to host events that had been planned within the park before the fire. The morning after the fire, Tilyou posted a sign outside the park, which read: > To enquiring friends: I have troubles today that I had not yesterday. I had > troubles yesterday which I have not today. On this site will be built a > bigger, better, Steeplechase Park. Admission to the burning ruins ‚Äî Ten > cents.

Tilyou stated that the park would be restored to a \\"grander than ever\\" condition, but in the meantime, would erect temporary tent shows. The remaining attractions opened one week after the fire. Ultimately, the park was rebuilt with fireproof steel-and-concrete structures, because after the fire, the municipality passed a law restricting the construction of combustible wooden structures. The reconstruction of the park was funded through a $2 million stock measure issued by the Steeplechase Park Company, a business established in 1908. At the start of the 1908 season, The New York Times described the construction as being \\"scarcely finished\\", but also reported that large crowds \\"flocked\\" to the attractions that had been rebuilt. The reconstruction of Steeplechase Park was completed in 1909. Its main attraction was a \\"Pavilion of Fun\\", an indoor enclosure covered by steel and glass that measured , with a total area of . The Pavilion of Fun was designed with several indoor rides so patrons seldom had to go outdoors. It contained tawdry, exhibitionist attractions reminiscent of the previous iteration of Steeplechase Park, such as the Human Wheel, Human Niagara, the Mixer, and the Grinder. The Ferris wheel was salvaged from the original park and was placed outdoors. A new Steeplechase Horses attraction was built around the pavilion, but was designed such that riders had to exit through the Pavilion of Fun. Steeplechase also included two new entrances, a plaza overlooking a sunken garden, the Palace of Pleasure, a ballroom, and various sideshows. Other attractions included airships, Venetian gondolas, and an Automobile ride similar to that in the first Steeplechase Park. There were eight roller coasters inside the rebuilt park as well. Similar to before the fire, admission was 25 cents. A \\"Combo\\" admission ticket entitled the holder one experience on each of the 25 attractions at Steeplechase Park.  1910s and 1920s  Tilyou continued to add attractions to Steeplechase in the late 1900s and early 1910s. He added the first of several carousels to the park in 1908, and the \\"World's Largest Swimming Pool\\" was completed the following year. Tilyou opened a hall with an indoor swimming pool to the west of the pavilion in 1911, at which point he declared that he wanted to add one new ride per week. Several additional attractions were opened in 1912, including the El Dorado Carousel and other structures salvaged from Dreamland after it was destroyed in a 1911 fire. In 1914, Tilyou died, leaving the care of the park to his children; Thomas F. McGowan then became general manager of the park. Steeplechase would remain within the Tilyou family until it closed a half-century later. George's oldest son Edward, an 18-year-old at the time of his father's death, constructed a skating rink at Steeplechase in 1915. A Racing Derby Carousel by master carousel builder Marcus Illions was added in 1920, and it featured 16 rows of four horses cycling up-and-down on small tracks within the carousel. Shortly afterward, Edward Tilyou also added \\"Babyland\\", a children's play area near the southeast corner of the park. Other attractions built in the early 1920s included the Frolic spinning ride, bumper cars, the Witchway swing, and a Caterpillar flat ride. By the early 1920s, the crowds at Steeplechase and other Coney Island parks had become more mellow and orderly, though the beachfront in general was described as rundown. Steeplechase Park started hosting several beauty contests near its outdoor pool, providing more entertainment for park patrons. These included the \\"Modern Venus\\" Bathing Beauty Contest, first held in 1922, and Grandma's Beauty Contest, which started in 1932. This period also saw the destruction of some structures, such as the Upside-Down House burning down in 1911. Additionally, Steeplechase lost its private beach during the early 1910s. Following a 1912 lawsuit by New York State against Tilyou and other amusement owners for taking private ownership of Coney Island's beach, a judge ruled in 1913 that the beach actually belonged to the state. An appellate court affirmed this decision in 1916, with an exception made for part of Steeplechase Park, a plot of land granted by the state prior to the creation of the park itself. All obstructions on the beachfront, including a concrete walk within Steeplechase, were demolished in accordance with the ruling. The Riegelmann Boardwalk was opened on the waterfront in 1922. In conjunction with the boardwalk's opening, the city slightly relocated West 16th and West 19th Streets at Steeplechase Park's eastern and western borders, respectively, which resulted in a slight expansion to Steeplechase's area. The boardwalk's opening resulted in increases to real estate valuations at nearby areas, such as Steeplechase Park, though some lots were also taken from the park to make way for new streets leading to the boardwalk. As a result, a former Brooklyn engineer alleged that the Tilyous lost money from the relocation of West 16th and West 19th Streets. The boardwalk's completion and a subsequent widening of Surf Avenue in 1924 prompted Edward Tilyou to make additional improvements to Steeplechase Park. The mid-1920s were described as the \\"golden age\\" of roller coasters on Coney Island: two gravity rides called the Zip and the Limit were constructed in Steeplechase Park, and immediately to the east, independent ride operator George Moran built the Thunderbolt roller coaster. Also built were a water ride called the \\"Old Mill tunnel of love\\" and a Noah's Ark-style attraction. Thomas McGowan died unexpectedly in 1927 and was replaced by James J. Onorato. The following year, one of the pools was demolished and replaced with an attraction called Hey Day, while a gas-powered Custer Cars attraction was installed on the boardwalk.  1930s: Great Depression through World War II  The Great Depression resulted in significantly decreased attendance at Steeplechase Park. Before money ran out, a one-ring circus was constructed between the Limit coaster and an adjacent pool, while a children's wading pool was constructed. In addition, a carousel was constructed at West 16th Street in 1930, and the Whale and the Whip replaced Noah's Ark the following year. People still came to see the beauty contests at Steeplechase Park. In 1934, when finances slowly started to improve, a bobsled roller coaster model called Flying Turns was installed at Steeplechase. Several accidents and fires continued to occur at Steeplechase. A fire in July 1932 caused $1.5 million in damage and injured six people, and left at least a thousand people homeless. However, Steeplechase Park and Luna Park were not as heavily damaged since the fire was mostly concentrated to the west. There were other incidents as well: in 1933, fifty-seven people were hurt in a balcony collapse caused by overcrowding, and three years later, a barge crashed into the Steeplechase Pier. In addition, patrons frequently received minor injuries such as friction burns, though some people were thrown or fell from rides, and one child died after falling off the Steeplechase Horses in 1935. A conflagration in September 1939 caused $200,000 in damage and injured 18 people. The concessions on the boardwalk were destroyed, as was the entrance to the park from the boardwalk, and several attractions within the park itself. The following year, a new brick concession structure was built on the site of the old concessions, and an Express Train ride was erected in front of the pavilion.alt=The Parachute Jump ride The 1939 New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, several miles to the northeast of Coney Island, had created competition for Coney Island amusement parks, which saw sharply reduced attendance. Steeplechase's situation was exacerbated by the September 1939 fire, which had destroyed many of the larger attractions, including Flying Turns. After the World's Fair closed in 1940, the Tilyous purchased the fair's Parachute Jump, a parachute tower ride, and moved it to the former site of Flying Turns. The ride, inspired by a training device for paratroopers, opened in 1941 and contained 12 parachutes descending from a tower. The Parachute Jump's installation was part of a reconstruction of an stretch of the Riegelmann Boardwalk. Other rides were added at Steeplechase in 1941, including rocket cars, a Whip ride, and the Silver Streak. However, the draft during World War II resulted in a shortage of qualified staff, and in 1945, Onorato closed the Pavilion of Fun until the end of the war due to the staff shortage. That year, only 70 people worked at Steeplechase, as opposed to the 300 staff in a normal operating year. The park returned to normal staffing levels in 1946, with Onorato vetting all employees two months before the park opened each year.  1940s and 1950s: downfall  Despite the park's popularity with New Yorkers, many factors after the end of World War II would eventually lead to its decline, including frequent fires, low patronage, and white flight. Steeplechase's closest competitor, Luna Park, was heavily damaged by a pair of fires in 1944. Luna Park closed in 1946, leaving Steeplechase as the only major amusement park on Coney Island. Moreover, after Edward Tilyou died in 1944, control of the park was transferred to his siblings George Jr., Frank, Marie, and Eileen, who each owned a quarter share in the Steeplechase Corporation. The relationship between the siblings was fractious, and they often argued about Steeplechase's management. In 1945, the Tilyou siblings leased out the boardwalk carousel to their cousin James J. McCullough. The next year, they rented out the pool, which then instituted a season pass scheme that effectively locked out African Americans from using the pool, despite the fact that an increasing proportion of Steeplechase visitors was African-American. The ballroom was also split in half to create a TV studio in 1947. The same year, the Tilyou siblings discontinued the combination ticket and started offering a pass where patrons could go on any 15 rides for one dollar. In practice, not many people bought the 15-ride pass, since various special-interest groups such as social, political, and religious organizations had designated days where they could visit Steeplechase Park for free. Steeplechase also saw its 20-millionth visitor that year. The Tilyous added extra rides for the 1948 season, including the Scrambler, the C-Cruise, and several children's rides. Steeplechase Park continued its downward trajectory with the demolition of several rides and structures, and the neglect of others. In December 1951 the skating rink, now used only for the Tilyou's private functions, was demolished. The following year, several structures on West 19th Street were demolished, as was the little-used Old Mill boat ride that ran under one of these structures; the site was filled by a parking lot in 1954. Other impediments included a 1953 flood and fire, which destroyed machinery; the death of the Tilyou siblings' mother in 1954, which caused further acrimony among the siblings; and the underpayment of employees, which was one of the main reasons Steeplechases' employees were mostly elderly citizens who could afford to take such a low wage. However, the park started becoming profitable again when Arthur Godfrey and His Friends started broadcasting from Steeplechase in 1955. After Steeplechase Pier was destroyed by fire in 1957, a larger replacement opened the next year. George Tilyou Jr. died in 1958, and his sister Marie took over as Steeplechase Corporation president the next year, demoting James Onorato to general manager. Marie, who had long wanted to change Steeplechase's image against the wishes of her brothers, began adding rides for the 1959 and 1960 seasons, such as a Tilt-a- Whirl, a Round Up ride, and a Paratrooper ride.  Demise  New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses was a longtime critic of Coney Island, likening the crowds that flocked there during the summer months to a coffin. As early as 1937, he had published a report about the possible redevelopment of Coney Island. Moses, who was also a New York City housing commissioner, rezoned the area for high-rise housing in the late 1940s. Subsequently, in 1953, Moses proposed that most of the peninsula be rezoned for various uses, claiming that it would be an \\"upgrade\\" over the various business and unrestricted zones that existed at the time. Steeplechase Park would be allowed to remain open, but much of the shorefront amusements and concessions would be replaced by residential developments. At the time, Coney Island was seeing fewer visitors year-over-year. Crime increases, insufficient parking facilities, bad weather, and the post-World War II automotive boom were cited as contributing factors in the decrease of visitors to Coney Island. The start of the 1964 New York World's Fair, also in Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, was another factor. Ironically, prior to the World's Fair, Steeplechase Park was seeing record high patronage; the highest single-day visitor count, over 18,000 customers, was recorded in 1961. Nevertheless, it also faced problems of its own: a severe assault of an employee in 1961 forced the closure of the Insanitorium, while Marie Tilyou was opposed to her nephew Frank II's proposal to bring rides from the Century 21 Exposition to the park. Further, Steeplechase had been leasing one-third of its land from the Huber family, which decided to sell that land in 1962. More attractions were destroyed in a 1963 fire, which razed two blocks on Steeplechase's west side. High crime was also rampant; for instance, a mass shooting nearby in 1962 resulted in three people being killed, and visitors were generally afraid of being attacked by residents of nearby public housing projects. By 1964, the area had seen its lowest number of patrons in a quarter-century. By the early 1960s, the children of George C. Tilyou began themselves to grow old; his last surviving son, Frank, died in 1964. The shares of Steeplechase Park were now held by four women‚ÄîMarie, Eileen, and the respective widows of Frank and George Jr.‚Äîall of whom had differing visions for the park. Steeplechase Park closed for the season on September 20, 1964, for what would be the last time. Though no official closure announcement was made initially, rumors of a sale started circulating in February 1965. On July 2, 1965, the property was sold to developer Fred Trump and he subsequently announced his intention to build luxury apartments on the old Steeplechase property. Though the sale was opposed by the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce, it was consistent with the area's gradual conversion into a residential community.  Later use of the site   Trump ownership and Kaufman operation  A 1973 photo of an abandoned \\"Giant Slide\\" that had been set up for a few years on the old Steeplechase site On the site of Steeplechase Park, Fred Trump proposed building a enclosed dome with recreational facilities and a convention center, a plan which was supported by Brooklyn borough president Abe Stark. Trump demolished Steeplechase Park's Pavilion of Fun during a highly publicized ceremony in September 1966. At the demolition, he was said to have sold bricks to ceremony guests to smash the remaining glass windows on the Pavilion of Fun. Trump supposedly destroyed the pavilion to circumvent a landmark law being proposed by the city following the demolition of the old Pennsylvania Station in 1963. In October 1966, the city announced its plans to acquire the of the former Steeplechase Park so that the land could be reserved for recreational use. Although residents supported the city's action, Trump called the city's proposal \\"wasteful\\". In January 1968, New York City parks commissioner August Heckscher II proposed that the New York state government build an \\"open-space\\" state park on the Steeplechase site, and that May, the New York City Board of Estimate voted in favor of funding to buy the land from Trump. Condemnation of the site started in 1969. The city ultimately purchased the proposed park's site for $4 million, with partial funding from the federal government. As a condition of the deal, the sale or lease of the future parkland required permission from the New York State Legislature, thus blocking Trump from developing the site as apartments. Trump filed a series of court cases related to the proposed residential rezoning, and ultimately won a $1.3 million judgment. The Steeplechase Park site laid empty for several years. Trump started subleasing the property to Norman Kaufman, who ran a small collection of fairground amusements on a corner of the site, calling his amusement park \\"Steeplechase Park\\". The city also leased the boardwalk and parking lot sites at extremely low rates, which resulted in a $1 million loss of revenue over the following seven years. Since the city wanted to build the state park on the site of Kaufman's Steeplechase Park, it attempted to evict him by refusing to grant a lease extension. The city continued to pursue litigation over the site occupied by Norman Kaufman. For over ten years, the city was unsuccessful in its efforts. It had no plan for the proposed state park, and in 1975 the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development nearly withdrew a proposed grant of $2 million to fund the proposed park. The city ultimately accepted the grant. However, in June 1977, the city's parks commissioner suggested that the city would redevelop the original Steeplechase Park's site as an amusement area instead of an open- space state park, and proposed that the city return the grant. This move was opposed by the chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, who wanted to use the grant to pay for pedestrian walkways at the Steeplechase site. In 1977 and 1978, Kaufman withheld rent payments to the city because of the ongoing litigation, and he sued the city for $1.7 million. By 1979, Kaufman had expanded his park and had plans to eventually rebuild the historic Steeplechase Park. He had also bought back the original Steeplechase horse ride with plans to install it the following season. Kaufman continued to operate the site until the end of summer 1980. In June 1981, the city paid Kaufman a million dollars for the rides, even though the amusements were estimated to be worth much less than that. However, the city had finally succeeded in evicting Kaufman from the property.  Development as stadium  In the mid-1980s, restaurant mogul Horace Bullard proposed rebuilding Steeplechase Park. He had already bought several acres of property just east of the Steeplechase Park site, including the site of the defunct Thunderbolt coaster and the lots west of the Abe Stark rink, and planned to spend $20 million just on cleaning up the neighborhood. His plans called for using the property, bounded by West 15th and 19th Streets between Surf Avenue and the Boardwalk, to build a $55 million theme park based on the original. The city agreed, and the project was approved in 1985. Bullard planned to open the park by mid-1986 to coincide with the Statue of Liberty's centennial celebration. However, the project was delayed while the New York City Planning Commission compiled an environmental impact report. By early 1987, the cost of the amusement park nearly doubled, to $100 million. MCU Park, a minor-league baseball stadium built on the Steeplechase site in 2001 Concurrently, in December 1986, the New York State Urban Development Corporation formally proposed the construction of a $58 million, 17,000-seat minor-league baseball stadium near the site. State senator Thomas Bartosiewics attempted to block Bullard from building on the Steeplechase site, as he was part of an organization that had promised another developer, Sportsplex, the right to build an amateur sports arena on the site. Construction was held up for another four years as Bullard and Sportsplex fought over the site. After Rudy Giuliani took office as mayor of New York in 1994, he negated the Bullard deal by approving the construction of a minor-league baseball stadium on the site allotted for Steeplechase Park. In 1998, Giuliani had canceled Sportsplex and the entertainment complex, and instead unveiled another plan where only the parking lot would be built. The minor league team was called the Brooklyn Cyclones. Bullard, now no longer rebuilding Steeplechase Park, had wanted to restore the Thunderbolt as part of a scaled-down amusement park. Giuliani had the coaster demolished on the grounds that the Thunderbolt was about to collapse, though the coaster's destruction took weeks. In 2000, the city approved the $31 million project to construct Keyspan Park (now MCU Park) using the funds from the canceled Sportsplex, and the minor-league baseball stadium opened the following year.  Current status  B&B; Carousell under construction at new Steeplechase Plaza Much of the former Steeplechase Park site is occupied by MCU Park. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation owns the land under MCU Park and maintains it as \\"Steeplechase Park\\". A public plaza on the boardwalk is located to the south of MCU Park and operated by NYC Parks. In November 2011, work started on a site around the Parachute Jump, to be called Steeplechase Plaza. The city also announced that the historic B&B; Carousell, which had been stored at the Brooklyn Army Terminal since 2005, would be relocated to Steeplechase Plaza within Luna Park. The carousel opened in 2013 at the Steeplechase Plaza section of Luna Park, near the former site of Steeplechase Park. The carousel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. The plaza is adjacent to Thunderbolt, a steel coaster that opened in 2014 on the site of the original wooden Thunderbolt. The only structure still standing that was once part of Steeplechase is the tall tower of the Parachute Jump. It had been proposed for demolition in the mid-20th century. However, due to the expense involved in destruction, the ride outlived the remainder of the park, operating until 1964. Still too expensive to tear down, the tower was made a New York City designated landmark in 1977. Three months later the New York City Board of Estimate overturned the landmark designation, citing doubts about the tower's structural integrity. In 1980, the Parachute Jump was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1989, the Parachute Jump was once again recognized as a city landmark.

Created for the Miami-based advertising firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B) by The Barbarian Group, the program featured a viral marketing website, television and print campaigns and a one-time pay-per-view program. The program was similar to other marketing campaigns created by CP+B for Burger King, including the Coq Roq, Ugoff, and Sith Sense. History The TenderCrisp sandwich was first advertised using the Subservient Chicken character in a commercial called the Subservient Chicken Vest. The commercial was the first in a series of ads for the sandwich utilizing a line of viral marketing promotions by Crispin Porter + Bogusky for Burger King. In the ad, a man is sitting in his living room directing a person in a chicken suit to behave in any way he wants. The tag line was \\"Chicken the way you like it.\\" According to Jeff Benjamin, an Executive Creative Director at CP+B, the campaign evolved from a television idea into an interactive one. After the success of the Subservient Chicken, Burger King used the character in several subsequent advertising campaigns. Other advertising programs *;Fantasy Ranch :The TenderCrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch sandwich was promoted in the United States by a 2005 television advertising campaign directed by David LaChapelle and featuring recording artist Darius Rucker (of Hootie and the Blowfish) singing a country-style jingle to the tune of \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain.\\" The ad also starred television presenter Brooke Burke, model Vida Guerra, and members of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. *;ChickenFight.com :With the introduction of the Spicy TenderCrisp Sandwich, CP+B created the Chicken Fight ad program. The ads featured a forthcoming boxing match billed as The two \\"cockfighting chickens\\" between two people in chicken suits, one as \\"TC\\" and the other as \\"Spicy\\", a second chicken with orange \\"plumage\\". The actual \\"fight\\" was broadcast as one time short on DirecTV. *;Big Buckin' Chicken/Big Huckin' Chicken :In March 2006, Big Buckin' Chicken commercial for Tendercrisp Cheesy Bacon Chicken Sandwich featured the Subservient Chicken again. The TV ad showed 8 mm-style footage of a cowboy riding the chicken in a rodeo while people on the sideline cheer on. An accompanying jingle states, \\"Big buckin' chicken/you are big, you are chicken.\\" The voice over concludes that \\"the only way to beat it, is to eat it.\\" The character was reused in another TenderCrisp ad riding a dirt bike, titled Big Huckin' Chicken. *;Chicken BIG KING :In April 2014, Burger King celebrated the 10·µó ∞ anniversary of the Subservient Chicken in promotion of the Chicken BIG KING Sandwich. Subservient Chicken celebrated his anniversary in a short film where he trained for his return to fame after his fall into irrelevancy over the years. Internet In addition to the commercials, there was \\"The Subservient Chicken\\" web page. On the page, a man in a chicken costume performed a wide range of actions based on a user's input, showing pre-recorded footage and appearing like an interactive webcam. The site takes literally the advertising slogan \\"Get chicken just the way you like it\\". The site launched on April 8, 2004.

Until 1974 the village lay in the historic county boundaries of the East Riding of Yorkshire. There is a church dedicated to St John the Evangelist. Folkton House, the former rectory is located on Filey Road. Towards Flixton is the former village school which is now closed, built in 1832. According to the 2011 UK Census, Folkton parish had a population of 535, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 461.  Geography  Folkton Carr, north of Folkton; as with neighbouring Flixton Carr, once this was fenland and earlier still lay below Lake Pickering To the south are the Wolds and further north, across the Carrs and up the hills at the other side of the Vale is Scarborough, beyond which to the north-west are the Yorkshire Moors.  History   Prehistoric features  The area has been settled for many thousands of years. Above the village, at the top of Folkton Hill, was where the Folkton Drums were discovered. They are a set of chalk (the predominant stone in the area) carvings from the Stone Age. Bowl-shaped, they have been called drums as the carvings would be upside down were they to be used as bowls. They were discovered by William Greenwell in 1889. They were buried in a tumulus that sits at the intersection of several natural pathways through the Dales. This tumulus has now been identified as one of a network that acted as a guide through the maze of hills and valleys that make up the Dales which would have been heavily forested at the time. They can now be seen on display at the British Museum.\\"The Folkton drums\\", The British Museum Prehistoric Folkton Drums as currently displayed in the British Museum  Modern history  The Carr would have historically been lake or marsh depending on which climatic era is being discussed. Its natural state today would be as marsh land but it was drained in the 19th century to make room for agriculture. The village was also the site of a Roman military base. Not much is known of this stage as subsequent building works have destroyed any archaeology; however, the regular finds of Roman artefacts such as coins and arrow heads indicate a substantial presence. The village as it stands today was established with a small number of farm houses around 400 years ago. Later building added to and expanded these existing structures into larger houses and farms with attached barns. Many barns were then demolished during the 1800s to avoid the 'Roof Tax'. In 1823 the Folkton parish was in the Wapentake of Dickering. Population at the time was 144. Occupations included three farmers, and the landlady of The Bell public house. Two miles to the west of the village, in the Folkton parish, and separated by one mile, were the settlements of East and West Flotmanby, each listed with a gentleman.

It is located on the Allier River. Among its many tourist attractions are the Maison Mantin, the Anne de Beaujeu Museum and The National Center of Costume and Scenography. Geography Moulins is located on the banks of the Allier River. History Before the French Revolution, Moulins was the capital of the province of Bourbonnais and the seat of the Dukes of Bourbon. It appears in documented records at least as far back as the year 990. In 1232, Archambaud VIII, Sire de Bourbon granted a franchise to the village's inhabitants. The town achieved greater prominence in 1327, when Charles IV elevated Louis I de Clermont to Duke of Bourbon. Either Louis or the later Peter II, Duke of Bourbon and of Auvergne moved the capital of the province from Bourbon-l'Archambault to Moulins. :Note: This article in French suggests Pierre II moved the capital, while the local tourism website (also in French) suggests it was Louis I. In February 1566 it became eponymous to the Edict of Moulins, an important royal ordinance dealing with many aspects of the administration of justice and feudal and ecclesiastical privilege, including limitations on the appanages held by French princes, abrogation of the levy of rights of tallage claimed by seigneurs over their dependants, and provisions for a system of concessions on rivers. This was the birthplace of the great 19th-century operatic baritone and art collector Jean-Baptiste Faure. In the 20th century, Coco Chanel went to school in Moulins as an orphan, before moving to Paris, where she became a fashion designer and major innovator in women's clothing.

One of the most famous child actors of all time, he became very popular in 1930s Hollywood films. His most famous starring roles are in Captains Courageous (1937) and Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936). He was born in London, and for the title role of MGM's David Copperfield (1935), he immigrated to the United States at the age of 10 in 1934, living there the rest of his life.Behlmer, Rudy (ed).

June 11, 1943.\\"People: Fortunes of War\\". Time. June 21, 1943. Despite his great success and acclaim following David Copperfield, his childhood film stardom was marred by nearly constant legal battles and payouts, which eventually took a huge toll on both his finances and his career. In adulthood, after World War II service, his film career dwindled rapidly, and he switched from performing to directing and producing in the medium of television.

His parents were Cecil Llewellyn Bartholomew, a wounded World War I veteran who became a minor civil servant after the war, and Lilian May Clarke Bartholomew.Cecil Llewellyn Bartholomew and Lilian May Clarke. Genes Renunited.Soldiers of the First World War - CEF: Cecil Llewellyn Bartholomew By the age of three, Freddie was living in Warminster, a town in Wiltshire in southwest England, in his paternal grandparents' home. He lived under the care of his aunt \\"Cissie\\", Millicent Mary Bartholomew, who raised him and became his surrogate mother.Aunt Cissie's full birth name is listed as Millicent Emily Mary Bartholomew here: ; she was born in Bangalore, India on October 27, 1888 (her father was a British Army man on service there). Bartholomew was educated at Lord Weymouth's Grammar School in Warminster, and by his Aunt Cissie.Howell, Danny. Yesterday's Warminster. Barracuda Books, 1987. p. 97. Child star From England to Hollywood In Warminster, Bartholomew was a precocious actor and was reciting and performing from age three.Hoerle, Chapter 2. By age five he was a popular Warminster celebrity, the \\"boy wonder elocutionist\\", reciting poems, prose, and selections from various plays, including Shakespeare.Freddie's Warminster appearances included the Palace Cinema and Theatre, and St. John's Church Parish Hall. (Howell, Danny. Yesterday's Warminster. Barracuda Books, 1987.) He did singing and dancing as well.Hoerle, Chapter 3. His first film role came by the age of six, in 1930. He also pursued acting studies at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London,Orme, Michael. \\"The World of the Kinema\\". Illustrated London News. March 23, 1935. Issue 5005. p. 486. and appeared in a total of four minor British films. American filmmakers George Cukor and David O. Selznick saw him on a 1934 scouting trip to London and chose him for the young title role in their MGM film David Copperfield (1935).Haver, Ronald. David O. Selznick's Hollywood.

July 30, 1994. p. 57. He was subsequently cast in a succession of film productions with some of the most popular stars of the day. Among his successes of the 1930s were Anna Karenina (1935) with Greta Garbo and Fredric March; Professional Soldier (1935) with Victor McLaglen and Gloria Stuart; Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936) with Dolores Costello and C. Aubrey Smith; Lloyd's of London (1937) with Madeleine Carroll and Tyrone Power; The Devil is a Sissy (1936) with Mickey Rooney and Jackie Cooper; and Captains Courageous (1937) with Spencer Tracy. Captains Courageous was the movie he most enjoyed working on. The film took an entire year to make, and much of it was shot off the coasts of Florida and Catalina Island, California. He later recalled, \\"For a kid, it was like one long outing. Spencer Tracy, Lionel Barrymore, Mickey Rooney, Melvyn Douglas and I ‚Äì we all grew very close toward one another in those 12 months. When the shooting was finished, we cried like a bunch of babies as we said our goodbyes.\\"\\"'30s Child Actor Freddie Bartholomew.\\" Chicago Tribune. January 26, 1992. His acting skills, open and personable presence, emotional range, refined English diction, and angelic looks made him a box-office favorite. He quickly became the second-highest-paid child movie star after Shirley Temple. Ring Lardner Jr. had high praise for him, saying of his performance as the star of Little Lord Fauntleroy, \\"He is on the screen almost constantly, and his performance is a valid characterization, which is almost unique in a child actor, and, indeed, in three fourths of adult motion-picture stars.\\"Lardner, Jr., Ring W. \\"Will Hollywood Spoil Freddie Bartholomew?\\" Liberty.

A legal battle of nearly seven years ensued, resulting in nearly all the wealth that Bartholomew amassed being spent on attorneys' and court fees, and payouts to his birth parents and two sisters.Bartholomew v.

February 16, 1943.Graham, Sheilah. \\"All Around Hollywood Town.\\" Milwaukee Journal. September 30, 1945. MGM contract troubles The extreme financial drain of his birth parents' ongoing custody battles prompted Bartholomew's aunt to demand a raise in his salary from MGM in July 1937, leveraged by the huge success of Captains Courageous. She threatened to break his MGM contract in order to find a better-paying studio. The contract battle kept him out of work for a year, causing among other things the postponement and eventual loss of his planned lead in a film of Rudyard Kipling's Kim, and the loss of his planned lead in Thoroughbreds Don't Cry with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney.\\"Freddie's Strike Loses Him Place in New Picture.\\" Associated Press. July 31, 1937. He eventually resumed acting through 1942, in mostly lesser-quality films and roles, only three out of 11 of which were with MGM, and after 1938 he was less popular than in his heyday. This fall in popularity stemmed not only from the quality of the roles and his conflicts with MGM, but also from the fact that by late 1938 he was a tall, nearly 6-foot teenager, and the fact that the world was focusing on the growing problems of World War II and therefore the literary classics and costume dramas Bartholomew excelled at were less in fashion. In 1938, Twentieth Century Fox hired him for the lead in their film of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped. MGM then re-teamed him for the fourth and fifth times with Mickey Rooney in Lord Jeff (1938) and A Yank at Eton (1942), and he co- starred with Judy Garland in the lightweight MGM musical Listen, Darling in 1938. In 1939 Universal re-teamed him for the third and fourth times with Jackie Cooper in The Spirit of Culver and Two Bright Boys. For RKO distribution, he performed in Swiss Family Robinson and Tom Brown's School Days in 1940. And as World War II deepened, Columbia had him star in three military-related films: Naval Academy (1941), Cadets on Parade (1942), and Junior Army (1942). World War II and beyond Enlistment and aftermath World War II military service interrupted Bartholomew's career even further. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces on January 13, 1943, at the age of 18, and worked in aircraft maintenance. During training he fell and injured his back, was hospitalized for seven months, and was discharged on January 12, 1944.\\"Freddie Bartholomew Returned to Civilian Life: Injured in Service\\". United Press. January 13, 1944. He had one film role in 1944, in the low-budget comedy The Town Went Wild. The film reunited him with Jimmy Lydon, with whom he had starred in Tom Brown's School Days, Naval Academy, and Cadets on Parade. This ended up being Bartholomew's penultimate film performance, and his last for seven years. His efforts to revive his film career were unsuccessful; and efforts performing in regional theaters and vaudeville did not spark a comeback either. After distressing experiences including a devastating auto accident and performing unsuccessfully in a play in Los Angeles, in 1946 Bartholomew married publicist Maely Daniele. Daniele, six years his senior, was a twice-divorced woman, and his marriage to her caused a serious and permanent rift with his aunt, who moved back to England. The marriage was not a happy one.LeBow, Guy. \\"Station Break: Freddie B.\\" In Watch Your Cleavage, Check Your Zipper! Everything You Were Never Supposed to Know About TV. SP Books, 1994. p 248. In 1946 he was in a radio play in an episode of Inner Sanctum Mystery. In 1947, he appeared as himself in a five-minute cameo in the otherwise all-black musical film Sepia Cinderella, relating his post-war efforts to have a successful vaudeville routine and telling a few gags onscreen. He spent most of 1948 touring small American theaters, and in November 1948 left without his wife for an Australian tour as a night-club singing, patter, and piano act.\\"Freddie once had a million\\". The Mail. November 20, 1948. Switch to television and off-camera work Upon his return to the United States in 1949, and in rather desperate circumstances, he switched to the new and burgeoning medium of television. He shifted from performer to television host and director to television producer and executive. Preferring to be known as Fred C. Bartholomew, he became the television director of independent television station WPIX in New York City from 1949 through 1954.Nuccio, Sal. \\"Advertising: Role for Freddie Bartholomew\\", The New York Times, November 6, 1964. Accessed March 30, 2011. His final acting role was as a priest in the 1951 film St. Benny the Dip. He divorced his first wife in 1953, and in December of that year he married television chef and author Aileen Paul, whom he had met at WPIX.\\"Video Romance Culminates Today.\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Bartholomew, born in 1958. The family, including stepdaughter Celia Ann Paul, lived in Leonia, New Jersey. This was an era in which advertising firms created and produced radio and television shows. In 1954, Bartholomew began working for Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, as a television producer and director. At Benton & Bowles, he produced shows such as The Andy Griffith Show, and produced or directed several television soap operas including As the World Turns, The Edge of Night and Search for Tomorrow.Poll, Julie (1996). \\"As The World Turns - 40th Anniversary Special\\", p 290.

In 1964 he was made a vice president of radio and television at the company. Bartholomew and his second wife divorced by early 1977. He eventually remarried, and remained married to his third wife, Elizabeth, for the rest of his life. Suffering from emphysema, he retired from television by the late 1980s.Lamparski, Richard.

The village is also known as East Everleigh, to distinguish it from the hamlet of Lower Everleigh which lies about further west on the A342 road that connects Andover and Devizes. The village is surrounded by land known as Everleigh Dropping Zone, owned by the Ministry of Defence that is used for military training as part of the Salisbury Plain Training Area. History The partly-forested area was known for recreational hunting. By the 13th century there was a deer park and a rabbit warren, and later activities included hare coursing, falconry and racehorse training. East Everleigh developed at a crossroads where the old Marlborough-Salisbury road (now only a track in the south of the parish) met the Devizes-Andover road (now the A342). In the 18th and 19th centuries, several inns provided refreshment and lodging. The Everleigh estate was bought by Sir John Astley in 1765, and inherited in 1771 by his cousin Francis Dugdale Astley; it continued as the seat of the Astley baronets until the middle of the next century. Sir Francis made changes to the village layout around 1811, removing buildings which stood close to the manor house and diverting the road away from it. Those demolished included the old church (rebuilt by Sir Francis further west) and the Rose and Crown inn.  Manor house  Everleigh Manor was built in the 18th century, possibly on the site of an earlier house, and extended with east and west wings later in the century. In 1882 the central block was virtually reconstructed following a fire. It is a two-storey country house in brick and stone, originally five bays, extended to nine. The Manor House was once a holding area for the prisoners during the Bloody Assizes with trials held by Judge Jeffreys in 1685. It was connected to a public house nearby, known as \\"The Crown\\", by a tunnel where prisoners would be led to and from the court house and manor. The tunnel is now blocked up on either end of both the manor and public house, but the tunnel still exists to this day. The manor house was bought by the National Deposit Friendly Society in 1921, for use as a convalescent home. The house was requisitioned in 1939 and, with new buildings added in its grounds, became a military hospital used by the US Army; there was also a vaccine laboratory. In 1951 the west wing was named the David Bruce Laboratory, and by this time the site was used by the Royal Army Medical Corps; the house and grounds were bought by the War Office in 1954. The Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map of 1958 shows many small buildings in the grounds to the northwest of the manor house. The Army left the site c. 1990 and the house returned to use as a private residence. As of 2016, the west wing is operated as a hotel. Parish church Everleigh had a parish church by 1228, when it was granted to the Benedictine Wherwell Abbey in Hampshire. However, the mediaeval parish church was demolished in 1814 when the present Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was consecrated on a site about northwest of it. The present church was designed by the architect John Morlidge in a Georgian Gothic Revival style.Pevsner & Cherry, 1975, page 242 It includes the original Norman font from the old church. The Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre holds the parish registers for 1598 to 1971 (baptisms), 1598-1974 (marriages), and 1598-1984 (burials). The population in 1831 was 352, but by 1951 it had fallen to 264.Everleigh, Wiltshire, England at Genuki Rev.

Voiced by Jen Taylor, she appears in Halo: Combat Evolved and its sequels, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, and Halo 5: Guardians. She also briefly appears in the prequel Halo: Reach, as well as in several of the franchise's novels, comics, and merchandise. During gameplay, Cortana provides backstory and tactical information to the player, who often assumes the role of Master Chief Petty Officer John-117. In the story, she is instrumental in preventing the activation of the Halo installations, which would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy. Cortana's original design was based on the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character's holographic representation always takes the form of a woman. Game developer Bungie first introduced Cortana‚Äîand Halo‚Äîthrough the Cortana Letters, emails sent during Combat Evolveds production in 1999. The relationship between Cortana and Master Chief has been highlighted by reviewers as one of the most important parts of the Halo games' story. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth as well as her sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant of the same name. Description Cortana is an artificial intelligence found in the Halo franchise. In the video games, Cortana often serves as an advisor and assistant to the player character, hacking alien computer systems and decoding transmissions. She speaks most of the first game's dialogue, and serves as a talkative foil for the quieter Master Chief, as well as a way of relaying information and objectives to the player. According to her backstory, Cortana was constructed from the cloned brain of Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, the creator of the SPARTAN-II supersoldier project; Halsey's synapses became the basis for Cortana's processors. Cortana and other AIs are subject to a seven-year lifespan, after which they begin to dissemble and think themselves to death in a process known as rampancy. As an artificial construct, Cortana has no physical form or being. Cortana speaks with a smooth female voice, and projects a holographic image of herself as a woman. Cortana is said to resemble Halsey, with a similar attitude \\"unchecked by military and social protocol\\". In Halo: The Fall of Reach, Cortana is described as slender, with close-cropped hair and a skin hue that varies from navy blue to lavender, depending on her mood. Numbers and symbols flash across her form when she is thinking. Halsey sees Cortana as a teenage version of herself: smarter than her parents, always \\"talking, learning, and eager to share her knowledge\\". Cortana is described as having a sardonic sense of humor and often cracks jokes or wryly comments, even during combat. Appearances In video games Cortana's first game appearance is in 2001's Halo: Combat Evolved. Humanity is locked in a losing war with the alien Covenant. When the Covenant attack and overwhelm the human planet Reach, Cortana plots a course for the human ship Pillar of Autumn derived on coordinates found in an ancient alien artifact. Her course leads Autumn to the massive ringworld Halo, built by a mysterious race known as the Forerunners. Cortana defends the ship from the Covenant until she is given to the supersoldier Master Chief to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Cortana helps direct human survivors scattered across the ring and assists the Master Chief in his missions. Inserted into Halo's Control Room, Cortana looks for a way to use Halo as a weapon against the Covenant, but realizes that the ring serves as a prison for the parasitic Flood; activating Halo would mean destroying all sentient life in the galaxy to prevent the Flood's spread. Cortana assists Master Chief in destroying the ring and escaping. In Halo 2, a Covenant fleet arrives above Earth, and Cortana takes control of an orbital coilgun to repel the invaders. Cortana, Chief and human forces travel to another Halo ring, Delta Halo, where Master Chief and Cortana encounter the Flood intelligence Gravemind. The Gravemind sends Chief and Cortana to the Covenant city-ship of High Charity to stop the Covenant from activating Halo; Cortana infiltrates High Charitys computer systems to assist Chief, ultimately staying behind to destroy the city and Halo should Master Chief fail in his mission to stop the Covenant leadership. High Charity is assimilated by the Flood, and Cortana is left behind. In Halo 3, Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions. Cortana sends a message to the Master Chief on Earth through a Flood-infected ship, revealing that she has a solution to the Flood threat. On the Forerunner installation known as the Ark, the Master Chief travels through the ruins of High Charity to rescue Cortana from the Gravemind's clutches. Cortana reveals her plan to activate the Halo ring stationed above the Ark, destroying the local Flood while sparing the galaxy. Chief and Cortana are successful, but become stranded in deep space aboard the human ship Forward Unto Dawn. Cortana activates a distress beacon, but she knows that years could pass before rescue comes. As Master Chief prepares to go into cryonic sleep to await rescue, Cortana confides to him that she will miss him. At the beginning of Halo 4 Cortana wakes the Chief as Forward Unto Dawn drifts towards a Forerunner installation called Requiem. Over the course of the game, Cortana begins displaying aberrant glitches and behavior; Cortana reveals that she is suffering from rampancy as she approaches the end of her seven-year lifespan. She assists in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans. Cortana sacrifices herself to save the Chief and stop the Didact's plan. Cortana's survival is revealed in Halo 5, when she calls Master Chief and his fellow Spartans of Blue Team to the Forerunner world Genesis. Cortana explains she survived the destruction of the Didact's ship and her own rampancy by entering the Domain, an ancient repository of knowledge. Granted an infinite life span by the Domain, Cortana believes that she and other AI (the \\"Created\\") should enforce peace through the galaxy. Cortana begins using ancient Forerunner constructs known as Guardians to enforce the Created's will throughout the galaxy. Cortana makes a small appearance in the last levels of 2010's Halo: Reach, set shortly before the events of Combat Evolved on the planet Reach. In the midst of the Covenant invasion of the planet, Halsey entrusts a fragment of Cortana to a Spartan team for safekeeping off the planet. The fragment contains crucial information gleaned from a Forerunner artifact. The fragment was successfully reunited with Cortana's main self on Pillar of Autumn before the ship escapes the planet, leading to the events of Combat Evolved. In other media Cortana's first appearance in the Halo franchise is in the novel Halo: The Fall of Reach, a prequel to the first Halo game. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which SPARTAN-II soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the Master Chief, whom she believes is her best match. Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief's armor. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence in the files of Colonel Ackerson, the operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge. Cortana also appears in the novelization of Combat Evolved, Halo: The Flood, and the following novels Halo: First Strike and Halo: Ghosts of Onyx, as well as the animated series Halo Legends and live-action television series Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn. She is also a main character in \\"Human Weakness\\", a short story written by Karen Traviss for the Halo Evolutions anthology that details Cortana's time in the clutches of the Gravemind. Character design Cortana was developed to provide Combat Evolved with a way of guiding players while keeping missions open-ended, and avoiding players feeling they were being herded through the game. Said story writer Joseph Staten, \\"we needed a character who could consistently guide the player through the game, and an onboard AI was something that could always credibly accompany [them].\\" Cortana's role grew from pure gameplay considerations to serving as a way of characterizing and humanizing the Master Chief, and in subsequent games the Chief-Cortana relationship became a focus of characterization. The character was designed and modeled by Bungie artist Chris Hughes, with the model's face based on a sculpture of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti. Cortana's name is a variant of Curtana, the sword used by the legendary Ogier the Dane, just as the titular AI character of Bungie's previous game Marathon 2: Durandal is named after the legendary sword Durendal. Curtana's inscription reveals that the sword has the same \\"temper as Joyeuse and Durendal\\". Franchise development coordinator Frank O'Connor commented that Cortana is not nude, as a digital representation has no clothes or privates. 343 Industries decided to explain her established appearance as a reflection of her personality; \\"So one of the reasons she [appears as she does] is to attract and demand attention. And she does it to put people off so that they're on their guard when talking to her and she has the upper hand in those conversations,\\" he explained. Cortana and the Master Chief's relationship was a core part of Halo 4, part of a desire to feature a more human story. Creative director Josh Holmes noted that Cortana was in ways more human than Master Chief, and the idea that Chief would grapple with his humanity at the same time he was losing Cortana spoke to him. Holmes' mother was diagnosed with dementia during development, and his real- life struggles informed the characterization of Cortana's descent into rampancy and the Chief-Cortana relationship. Holmes and the team drew inspiration from the relationship in the game Ico, where the main characters share a strong bond, as well as the many layers to the two characters' relationship; \\"In some ways they‚Äôre friends, in some ways she‚Äôs almost like a mother, in others they‚Äôre skirting that line of lovers, and so all these different elements come into the relationship, making it complex and interesting to explore.\\" Cortana's new appearance for Halo 4 was one of the game's most dramatic changes. Early in production, concept artists created a variety of \\"crazy ideas\\" and explorations for how Cortana might look. Promising 2D designs were turned into simple 3D maquettes to prototype them in the game engine. Character artist Matt Aldridge recalled that Cortana was one of the hardest characters to envision in the game because of how beloved the character is by players; one of Aldridge's goals was to create a character where scrolling lines of code would flow uninterrupted from her feet to her head. Art director Kenneth Scott was responsible for Cortana's final design. The character's motion capture was performed by Mackenzie Mason. For Halo 5, Cortana's appearance changes significantly. Describing her previous appearance as soft and \\"deceptively vulnerable\\", 343 Industries took the story opportunity provided to change her look to reflect her new role as self- declared ruler of the galaxy. \\"In the first draft of the ending she was going to wear a flowing gown, have long hair, etc. She'd be very regal, very ‚Äúpowerful high queen.\\" Very obviously different than she was,\\" writer Brian Reed recalled. Her final design incorporated elements of the Spartans and Forerunners on top of her previous look, including a Forerunner glyph. \\"Having her wear [the Mantle] was a nice way of having her own it too, from a symbolic standpoint,\\" Reed said. The character was modeled and animated using motion capture and talent at 343 Industries and Axis Animation. 343 Industries intended the character's normal role in gameplay to be filled by Blue Team. Voice acting alt=A young caucasian woman with blond hair and a red turtleneck sweater smiles at the camera Voice actress Jen Taylor voices Cortana in the majority of the character's appearances. Despite her role in voicing other video game characters, including Princess Peach, she is not a gamer. Taylor was a college acquaintance of Joseph Staten, and he recommended her as a possible voice for Cortana to audio director Martin O'Donnell. When choosing a voice actor for the character, Bungie originally wanted Cortana to have a British accent.‚ÄîStaten: \\"Because originally you wanted Cortana to have a British accent.\\" / Jones: \\"What?\\" / O'Donnell: \\"That's actually true because when we cast Cortana we asked every woman to do an English accent for us.\\" O'Donnell recalled that Taylor's British accent was good, but felt it was too similar to her work for No One Lives Forever. The accent was dropped, but British colloquialisms remained in the character's dialogue. Taylor recalled that a key directive from Bungie about the character was that she not come off as nagging, despite her role as the player's guide and aid. \\"They wanted her to be like the girl next door, your best friend that you want to hang out with,\\" she said. She felt that portraying Cortana was occasionally challenging because the character lacks a physical form. For years after the first game was released Taylor remained distanced from the character. She attended only one fan convention in six years after the release of Halo: Combat Evolved, and never saw many of the finished cutscenes with the character until a Halo 3 launch party. Interviewed about Cortana in Halo 3, Taylor said that \\"There's a lot more drama and a lot less technical jargon this time around. I actually just finished a couple of lines that nearly had me in tears.\\" Over time, Taylor's relationship with Cortana changed; \\"At first I was just excited to have a job and then I became more and more familiar, comfortable with and interested in her as she was developed,\\" she recalled. \\"And I've sort of fallen for Cortana as far as characters go. She's remarkable.\\" For Halo 4, Taylor performed her lines in the same room as Steve Downes, the voice of Master Chief, for the first time in the series. She credited the change for making the dialogue feel more authentic and real. Promotion Bungie introduced the Halo series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, a series of cryptic email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie's previous series, the Marathon Trilogy. The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in I Love Bees, a promotion for Halo 2. Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks many of the same lines in Halo 3. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics, the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story. Cortana is featured in a variety of Halo merchandise. The character's first action figure was a seven-inch (178 mm) miniature released as part of the Halo: Combat Evolved series of action figures. In an interview, McLees noted that the first action figure was supposed to convey an older appearance than was depicted in the games. This was accomplished by making the figure look a little buxom, despite McLees' direct request to reduce the mass of the figure. She explains that the sculptor appeared reluctant to make the change and that time constraints ultimately left the design intact. The character is also featured in the first series of Halo 3 action figures, distributed by McFarlane Toys,\\"McFarlane Halo Figures,\\" GameInformer 180 (April 2008): 34. Funko vinyl figurines, and in a limited-edition silver-plated statue by Weta Workshop. IGN noted that Cortana toys are lacking among Halos merchandising. Windows digital assistant Microsoft developed its virtual assistant for the Windows Phone operating system under the codename \\"Cortana\\" in reference to the Halo character. Though other final gender-neutral names for the final product were considered, positive developer and fan response to the leaked codename led to it becoming permanent. Deborah Harrison, one of Cortana's 'personality designers', met with 343 Industries and added more confidence to the personality. \\"As a result of the meetings we ended up coming back and baking this into the DNA of the digital assistant speech pattern, her approach to jokes and her approach to chit chat, and we decided to dial up her sense of self possession,\\" Harrison recalled. Jen Taylor provides the voice for the virtual assistant. Microsoft released a beta for Cortana in April 2014 with the developer release of Windows Phone 8.1. Microsoft also released Cortana virtual assistant on the Xbox One, Windows 10, iOS, and Android platforms. Reception Cortana is one of Halos most beloved characters, and has appeared in numerous lists of video game's best sidekicks. Tom's Hardware named the character one of the 50 greatest female characters for the character's determination and fearlessness, which meshed perfectly with the game's protagonist. Den of Geeks Megan Crouse called Cortana one of the Halo series' most important characters, and her relationship with her mother figure Halsey a relationship that was under-appreciated in much of the franchise. Cortana has also been recognized for her sex appeal; the character has featured on numerous lists of attractive video game characters and \\"babes\\" from publications such as Team Xbox, GameDaily, Games.net, Thanh Ni√™n, and Complex. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian argues that Cortana had gotten \\"more and more sexualized in every new installment\\"; 1UP.com noted that as Cortana's sanity waned in the video games, her clothing appeared to decrease as well. Times Matt Peckham described Cortana's character as a controversial figure, with a tension between being well-rounded character and being trapped as \\"[an] adolescent male's fantasy notion of a Campbellian hero figure,\\" and that this tension had increased commensurately with the game series' graphical fidelity. Media critic Maddy Myers suggested that O'Connor's explanation for Cortana's look implies that the Halo universe's futuristic setting still grapples with systemic sexism. Mike Rougeau of Complex noted that Halo 3 balanced a large conflict with a more personal one‚Äîthat while the galaxy was imperiled by aliens, \\"more important to fans was the rescue of Cortana.\\" While Cortana's role was greatly expanded in the game, Stuff.co.nz noted that the character \\"has inexplicably had a sexy makeover\\". Despite mixed opinions of Halo 4s campaign as a whole, Cortana and her story was often considered a strong point of the game. IGN called Halo 4 \\"really Cortana's story\\", as saving the galaxy is of lesser importance to the Master Chief than saving Cortana, and Cortana's humanity is ultimately the game's focus. The Daily Telegraphs Tom Hoggins agreed, calling Cortana \\"the flickering blue heart of the game's plot\\", and Hoggins and reviewers for The Globe and Mail and Eurogamer singled out the character's writing and performance as high points of the game's campaign. Justin Clouse wrote that the interactions between Chief and Cortana as the latter loses her hold on sanity were \\"perhaps the best it's ever been\\". Complexs review praised the use of motion capture for Cortana, as they were given \\"new life\\" and new depth from the technology and performance. David Their wrote that the choice for Cortana to return in Halo 5 and turn her into an antagonist provided the game \\"with a well earned sense of drive\\" and that her appearance in Halo 5 gave players another side of the character to see. \\"There's something unknowable about Cortana in her new role as AI God, but we've spent enough time with her throughout the series that we stick with her through the reinvention.\\" Similarly, Patrick Dane of Bleeding Cool defended the game's divisive campaign and Cortana's turn to antagonist as an \\"inspired choice\\", driving a wedge between the most important character relationship in the games. Conversely, Matt Peckham felt that the plot twist of Cortana's actions \\"feels strangely underwhelming\\", while Ars Technica and Kotaku considered Cortana's return, and her plans to use alien technology to remake the galaxy, unbelievable and unearned. Responding to criticism that 343 had turned Cortana \\"evil\\", franchise director Frank O'Connor said, \\"my question back to them is, 'What makes you say they‚Äôre evil?' Certainly a lot of our younger players are going to struggle with that subtlety, that nuance, because they‚Äôre expecting Darth Vader.\\" References External links * The Cortana Letters * Cortana's profile at Halowaypoint.com Category:Halo (franchise) characters Category:Anthropomorphic characters in video games Category:Artificial intelligence characters in video games Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional artificial intelligences Category:Fictional gynoids Category:Microsoft protagonists Category:Video game characters in comics Category:Video game characters in literature Category:Video game characters introduced in 2001 Category:Video game sidekicks ","title":"Cortana (Halo)"},{"id":"1115035","text":"Ibrahim al-Makadmeh () (1952 ‚Äì 8 March 2003) was a Palestinian and Hamas senior leader in the Gaza Strip who was killed by Israeli forces. Makadmeh, one of Hamas' founders and a leader of the group's military wing, was accused of engineering several attacks that killed 28 Israelis.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/09/world/main543282.shtml Biography Al-Makadmeh, age 52, was the father of seven children. He was a devoted preacher and political activist opposed to the Israeli occupation of Palestine. He was born in 1952, four years after his family was expelled from the village of Yibna, south-west of Jerusalem, when Israel was created. Al- Makadmeh's family fled to the refugee camps at Bureij and later moved to Jabalia. After graduating from secondary school in Jabalia, al-Makadmeh studied dentistry in Egypt where he adopted the Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood. When he returned to Gaza, al-Makadmeh began organizing th Palestinian Islamist movement and a few years later, he and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin founded Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic resistance movement. In 1984, the Israelis arrested, charged and convicted al-Makadmeh with possessing and supplying arms to Palestinian militants. During his eight years in Israeli prisons he allegedly was subjected to physical and psychological torture. In 1992, he was released from prison and began working as dentist at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza while continuing his Hamas activities. His harsh criticisms of Palestinian Authority corruption and the Oslo Accords, as well as vocal support for Hamas attacks on Israel, led the Palestinian Authority to arrest him several times. He was detained for three years without charge or trial and allegedly was tortured in custody, this time by Palestinian authorities. Killing Israeli Air Force AH-64D Saraph Al-Makadmeh and three of his aides were killed when three Israeli Apache helicopter gunships fired up to five missiles at the car he was in as it drove down a street in downtown Gaza City. Makadmeh's killing came after Hamas claimed responsibility for an attack Friday on a Jewish settlement that left two dead, and a Haifa bus 37 massacre which killed 17 civilians. According to family members, al-Makadmeh anticipated his killing by Israel for his leadership role in Hamas. A few days before his death, he said, \\"Our homeland will not be liberated and our people will not be freed from Jewish enslavement and occupation without sacrifices. Freedom has a price, and the price is blood.\\" The Israel Defense Forces announced the killing saying that al-Makadmeh \\"deserved liquidation\\", for \\"masterminding terrorist activities against Israeli civilians and soldiers.\\" A Hamas spokesman in Gaza dismissed the Israeli allegations as \\"cheap lies\\", claiming that al-Makadmeh was a political leader. Israeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz said that Israel would go after \\"other leaders\\" from Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

It is located in the Bole district, southeast of the city centre and north of Debre Zeyit. The airport was formerly known as Haile Selassie I International Airport. It is the main hub of Ethiopian Airlines, the national airline that serves destinations in Ethiopia and throughout the African continent, as well as nonstop service to Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The airport is also the base of the Ethiopian Aviation Academy. As of June 2018, nearly 450 flights per day were departing from and arriving at the airport. History In 1960, Ethiopian Airlines realized the runway at Lidetta was too short for its new jet aircraft, the Boeing 720. Thus a new airport was built at Bole. By December 1962 the new runway and control tower were operational. In 1997, an expansion plan was announced for the airport. This expansion was done in three phases: * Phase One: Adding a parallel runway and expanding the old runway. * Phase Two: Construction of a brand new terminal with a large parking area, a shopping complex and restaurants. * Phase Three: Construction of the 38 m control tower (double the height of the previous one) and installation of new electrical and fire- fighting equipment. The expanded old runway and the new runway are capable of handling the Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 aircraft. The new parallel runway is connected by five entrances and exits to the old runway, which serves as a taxiway. The terminal houses a high tech security and baggage handling system built on more than 43,000 square meters of land. The terminal also has banks and duty-free shops. The new control tower was built in between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, replacing the old control tower. In 2003, the new international passenger terminal was opened, making it one of Africa's largest airport passenger terminals. The new terminal is capable of handling about 3,000 passengers an hour. This project was worth a total of 1.05 billion birr ($130 million). At the time, the airport was one of a number of airport terminal constructions that have been underway in Ethiopia. In 2006, a new cargo terminal and maintenance hangar was opened five months late. This was because of expanded specifications vastly to improve Ethiopian Airlines' handling capacity and needs. The facility can accommodate three to four aircraft at a time. This project was worth a total of 340 million birr. At the same time, the first Airbus A380 arrived at the airport to undertake tests to validate its Engine Alliance GP7200 engines' performance from high altitude airports. The airport is capable of accommodating the A380. In 2010, the Ethiopian Airports Enterprise announced another expansion project worth $27.9 million at the airport. The project will include expansion of the aircraft parking capacity from 19 to 44 in order to accommodate heavier aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Boeing 777. In the first phase of the project, 15 parking stands will be constructed and the remaining will be completed in the next phase. The expansion will help in easing air traffic congestion due to an increase in international travel. This would lead to the new expansion plan in 2012. Expansion Check-in hall Departure Hall of Terminal 2 Expansion of the passenger terminal, cargo space, hangar, the runway and construction of the hotel is currently being completed by Chinese state-owned companies. The expansion work is being undertaken in two phases on an 80-hectare site. The first phase of the expansion work had enabled the airport to accommodate 15 additional aircraft, reducing traffic congestion at the airport. The second phase of the expansion work will enable the airport to service 10 additional aircraft. The airport will be able to service a total of 44 aircraft upon the completion of the expansion. The airport also plans to expand the apron which purportedly can solve the persistent aircraft parking problem it faces particularly during large international conferences. In 2012, expansion of the new passenger terminal was announced. The outlay of this expansion was projected at $250 million. At the same time, a new ramp was completed and can now park 24 aircraft. Another ramp is being built for 14 more aircraft. At the same time, the first phase of expanding the taxiways and adding more aircraft parking was completed. Eventually, this will lead to the expansion of the terminal. This all falls in line with Ethiopian Airlines' plan, \\"Vision 2025\\". According to the CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, the east wing of the newly expanded airport was expected to be operational by the end of June 2018. The whole expansion project was completed by the end of 2018, enabling the airport to accommodate up to 22 million passengers per year. As of 23 Jan 2020 the extension is still not fully completed. The new check in area and the elevated road to it are not yet open. On 27 January 2019 Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, inaugurated the expansion to Terminal 2. Further developments The former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn had purportedly given permission to build a new international airport in the town of Mojo, 65 kilometers south of the capital's current airport. The senior official at the Ethiopian Airport Enterprise said that the officials of the enterprise and the Ministry of Transport briefed the Prime Minister about the planned grand airport project. Two other sites are also options. Facilities The airport has two terminals with a total of 11 gates, plus more than 30 remote aircraft parking stands behind both Terminals. Terminal 1 has 4 gates and Terminal 2 has 7 gates. Terminal 1 serves Domestic and Regional flights for Ethiopian Airlines, EgyptAir, Qatar Airways, Sudan Airways, and Yemenia. Terminal 2 serves International flights and the rest of the airlines that serve the airport. In 2012, Ethiopian Airlines opened the first phase of its Cloud Nine Business Class Lounge at Bole International Airport. This will provide premium travelers with modern facilities and amenities. The second phase of the lounge's construction will include a spa, private digital lockers for passengers to stow away their bags, and a traditional Ethiopian coffee corner. Once complete, it will be three times the size of the existing lounge. Cloud Nine features a quiet corner with sleeping cots and individual reading lamps, massage chairs, and an internet corner with free Wi-Fi connection. The lounge is part of the airline's \\"Vision 2025 Fast Growth Plan\\". In 2017 Ethiopian Airlines Group announced that it signed $350 million contract with China Communications Construction to build a new hub, a part of which will be open to the public no later than June 2018. Airlines and destinations Passenger Cargo Accidents and incidents *On 18 April 1972 at 09:40, Super VC-10 5X-UVA crashed during take-off; 35 killed, including 8 of 11 crew, 13 injured, 48 uninjured. *On 18 March 1980, Douglas C-47B ET-AGM of Ethiopian Airlines crashed while on a single-engined approach to Bole International Airport. The aircraft was on a training flight. *On 10 March 2019, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 of Ethiopian Airlines operating as Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 bound for Nairobi crashed shortly after take off from Bole International Airport, killing all 157 people (149 passengers and 8 crew members) on board. This crash, along with the crash of Lion Air flight 610 five months earlier, led to the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.

The river is formed by water entering swallets in the limestone and rises from the ground at Wookey Hole Caves in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, and runs through a V-shaped valley. The geology of the area is limestone and the water reaches Wookey Hole in a series of underground channels that have eroded through the soluble limestone. The river mouth is in Weston Bay on the Bristol Channel. The river was navigable from the middle ages until 1915, and used for international trade.  Geography  The river's estuary at Uphill The River Axe is formed by the water entering the cave systems and flows through the third and first chambers, from which it flows to the resurgence, through two sumps and long, where it leaves the cave and enters the open air. It is the second largest resurgence on Mendip, with an estimated catchment area of , and an average discharge of per second. Some of the water is allogenic in origin i.e. drained off non-limestone rocks, collecting as streams on the surface before sinking at or near the Lower Limestone Shale ‚Äî Black Rock Limestone boundary, often through swallets. One such is Plantation Swallet near St Cuthbert's lead works, between the Hunter's Lodge Inn and Priddy Pools. It then passes through major cave systems such as Swildon's Hole, Eastwater Cavern and St Cuthbert's Swallet, around Priddy, but 95% is water that has percolated directly into the limestone. From Wookey Hole village the river flows through a ravine and then west through the village of Wookey. At Wookey the River splits into two channels with the ‚ÄòLower River Axe‚Äô running past to the south of the village west towards Henton and then onto Panborough Moor where it joins a series of rhynes and drains supplying water to the wetland in the area. The Lower River Axe then runs north along the west most edge of Knowle Moor whilst the River Axe continues west through the same moor. The two channels meet again on the boundary between Knowle and Panborough Moors. The mouth of the River Axe in Weston Bay. The river continues northwest past Wedmore Moor and through Oxmoor, Stoke Moor and Monk Moor. The river passes through the settlement of Lower Weare and on to the south of Loxton. From this point until it passes between Uphill Cliff and Brean Down, then reaches the coast at Weston Bay, the river forms the boundary of Sedgemoor and North Somerset. Tributaries of the Axe include three rivers called Yeo: the Cheddar Yeo, the Mark Yeo and the Lox Yeo.  History  The name derives from a Common Brittonic word meaning \\"abounding in fish\\", which is also the root for the River Axe in Lyme Bay as well as the Exe, Esk, Usk and other variants. The name is cognate with pysg (plural of pysgod), the Welsh word for fish. The lower reaches of the Axe have a history of navigation from the harbour at Uphill through to the settlement of Weare. The current tidal limit of the Axe is the sluice gates at Bleadon and Brean Cross. In the Middle Ages overseas trade was carried out from the port of Rackley, which is now north of the river as the course has been diverted. Rackley is now a farm below Crook Peak and west of Axbridge, which also had wharves. In the 14th century a French ship sailed up the river and by 1388 Thomas Tanner from Wells used Rackley to export cloth and corn to Portugal, and received iron and salt in exchange. Later slate was imported through this route and it may have still be possible to trade through Rackley until the act of 1915 authorising the drainage of the Axe and installation of the flood gate at Bleadon. Bleadon had been a small port, sometimes known as Lympsham Wharf, for many years, with the arrival of the railway in 1841 making this the furthest navigable point. It was last used by the ketch Democrat in 1942. A series of 11 watermills were powered by the river but the only one which remains is at Burcott.

It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city. It had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as Badalgarh. It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487-1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556-1605). History Agra Fort captured by Hemu before the Battle of Delhi (1556). After the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad. Diwan-i-Aam, Hall of Public Audience Effect produced by lighting candles in Sheesh Mahal, Agra Fort. Realising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.55649/page/n381/mode/1up It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort to make his own. The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 Years. In the fort, they built the Ratan Singh ki haveli. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in 1803. The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain. Layout Plan of the Red Fort, Agra from Murray's Handbooks for Travellers 1911 The fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river. Two of the fort's gates are notable: the \\"Delhi Gate\\" and the \\"Lahore Gate.\\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \\"Amar Singh Gate,\\" for Amar Singh Rathore. The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\\"Elephant Gate\\") ‚Äì guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders ‚Äì added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that thing is prevented by this layout. Because the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular) is still using the northern portion of the Agra Fort, the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate. The site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the beautiful designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace ‚Äì \\"Bengali Mahal\\". Akbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan. The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone. The Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal.  Other Historic sites inside Agra Fort  * Jahangir's Hauz (tank) A.D. 1610: This monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as 'Hauz-e-Jahangir'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal. * Shahjahani Mahal (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it. *Ghaznin Gate (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room. *Jahangir's Chain of Justice (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \\"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i- Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history. *The Muthamman Burj (Shah-Burj) & Jharokha (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i- Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the easternmost side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried. *Shish Mahal (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.

It runs from St Stephen's Green in the south (at the highest point of the street) to College Green in the north (to the lowest point). In 2008, Grafton Street was the fifth most expensive main shopping street in the world, at ‚Ç¨5,621/m¬≤/year, and the thirteenth most expensive main shopping street in the world in 2016 at approx ‚Ç¨3,300/m¬≤/year. History Grafton Street in the 1940s The street was named after Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, the illegitimate son of King Charles II who owned land in the area. The street was developed from a then existing country lane by the Dawson family in 1708, after whom the parallel Dawson Street is named. After O'Connell Bridge (then called 'Carlisle Bridge') was built to span the River Liffey, Grafton Street turned from a fashionable residential street into a busy cross-city route. The north end of Grafton Street is most notable for the eighteenth-century Trinity College Provost's House, home to the head of the college. Across the road from this is the former location of the Molly Malone statue, a well known tourist attraction and meeting-place, which was permanently moved from Grafton Street to nearby Suffolk Street in 2014, to make way for an extension to the Luas tram system. A life-size bronze statue of Phil Lynott was unveiled on Harry Street, off Grafton Street near the Stephen's Green end, on 19 August 2005. The street was known for prostitution in the 19th century. In the 1870s, 1,500 prostitutes were reputed to work in the street. Bewley's Oriental Caf√©, a Grafton Street institution since its opening in 1927, announced at the end of October 2004 that it would be closing before Christmas, along with its Westmoreland Street caf√©. Following a campaign by many, including the then Mayor of Dublin, Catherine Byrne, the caf√© on Grafton Street, which had closed, was reopened, including its small performance area. Buskers, including musicians, poets and mime artists, commonly perform to the shopping crowds on Grafton Street. This was portrayed in the opening scene of the 2006 film Once, starring Glen Hansard of The Frames, a former Grafton Street busker. Pedestrianisation The pedestrianisation of Grafton Street was first trialed in 1971 but prolonged delays meant that this wasn't made permanent until 1983, and then repaved in 1988. Objections came from councillors and small business owners, who alleged that pedestrianisation would lead to an increase in petty crime and antisocial behaviour. The North end of the street, between Nassau Street and College Green is not pedestrianised.

Her execution in the electric chair at New York's Sing Sing Prison in 1928 for the murder of her husband, Albert Snyder, was recorded in a well-publicized photograph. Crime Ruth Brown Snyder was a housewife from Queens, a borough of New York City, who began an affair with Henry Judd Gray, a married corset salesman, in 1925. She began to plan the murder of her husband Albert, enlisting Gray's help, though he appeared to be very reluctant. Ruth's distaste for her husband apparently began when he insisted on hanging a picture of his late fianc√©e Jessie Guischard on the wall of their first home, and named his boat after her. Guischard, whom Albert described to Ruth as \\"the finest woman I have ever met,\\" had been dead for ten years. Ruth first persuaded Albert to purchase insurance, and, with the assistance of an insurance agent (who was subsequently fired and sent to prison for forgery) \\"signed\\" a $48,000 life insurance policy that paid extra if an unexpected act of violence killed the victim. According to Gray, Ruth had made at least seven attempts to kill Albert, all of which he survived. On March 20, 1927, the couple garrotted Albert and stuffed his nose full of chloroform-soaked rags, then staged his death as part of a burglary. Detectives at the scene noted that the burglar left little evidence of breaking into the house. Moreover, Ruth's behavior was inconsistent with her story of a terrorized wife's witnessing her husband being killed. Police discovered that the property Ruth had claimed had been stolen was still in the house, but hidden. A breakthrough came when a detective found a paper with the letters \\"J.G.\\" on it (it was a memento Albert had kept from former lover Guischard), and asked Ruth about it. A flustered Ruth's mind immediately turned to Gray, whose initials were also \\"J.G.,\\" and she asked the detective what Gray had to do with the murder. It was the first time Gray had been mentioned, and the police instantly became suspicious. Gray was found upstate in Syracuse. He claimed he had been there all night, but it was eventually found out a friend of his had set up Gray's room at a hotel to support his alibi. Gray proved far more forthcoming than Ruth about his actions. He was caught and returned to Queens and charged along with Ruth. Dorothy Parker told Oscar Levant that Gray tried to escape the police by taking a taxi from Long Island to Manhattan, which Levant noted was \\"quite a long trip.\\" According to Parker, in order \\"not to attract attention, he gave the driver a ten-cent tip.\\" The trial Tom Howard and published the next day in the New York Daily News Ruth and Gray turned on each other, contending the other was responsible for killing Albert; both were convicted and sentenced to death. Execution Ruth was imprisoned at Sing Sing in Ossining, New York, located thirty miles north of New York City. On January 12, 1928, she became the first woman to be executed at Sing Sing since Martha Place in 1899. She went to the electric chair ten minutes before Judd Gray, her former lover. Her execution (by New York State Electrician Robert G. Elliott) was caught on film, at the moment electricity was running through her body, with the aid of a miniature plate camera strapped to the ankle of Tom Howard, a Chicago Tribune photographer working in cooperation with the Tribune-owned Daily News. Howard's camera was later owned by inventor Miller Reese Hutchison and later became part of the collections of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. Ruth was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. Her footstone simply reads \\"May R.\\" with her date of death. Lorraine Snyder Lorraine Snyder. Albert and Ruth had one child, a daughter named Lorraine, who was nine at the time of her father's murder. Following the pronouncement of the death sentence on her mother in May 1927, legal disputes arose between the relatives of both parents regarding the care of the child. Warren Schneider, brother of Albert, petitioned to be allowed to appoint a legal guardian who was not a member of Ruth's family. Josephine Brown, mother of Ruth, also petitioned for custody of the girl. Lorraine had been in the care of Mrs. Brown since the murder. Lorraine was formally placed by her maternal grandmother in the Catholic institution where she had been residing at the time of her mother's execution. Ruth requested that her daughter not be brought to the prison for a final visit. On September 7, 1927, Josephine Brown was awarded guardianship of the girl. During this time, there were disputes with the insurance company Ruth had used to insure her husband's life. Although one policy, worth US$30,000, was paid without contest, they filed suit to void two other policies, worth $45,000 and $5,000 (the three combined policies worth $ million today). By May 1928, the insurance company made available $4,000 for the maintenance of Lorraine. In November 1928 a ruling in the case was reached, with a court finding the policies could not be collected because they had been issued fraudulently. At the time of the judgment, the lawyer acting on behalf of Ruth's family asked the court to allow them to appeal without a printed record on the basis that the family was destitute and unable to sell the house due to the notoriety of the case. By May 1930, it was ruled on appeal that the two policies were invalid. Woodlawn Cemetery While incarcerated on death row, Ruth Snyder wrote a sealed letter which she requested be given to Lorraine \\"when she is old enough to understand\\". One year after her mother's execution, Lorraine was apparently aware that her parents were both dead, but not of the manner of either of their deaths.Murder Casebook p. 2212 Depiction in popular media * The drama Machinal (1928), by playwright Sophie Treadwell, is based on Snyder's trial. * The movies Blessed Event (1932) and Picture Snatcher (1933) make references to Snyder's execution.Time, volume 19 (1932) * A fictionalized version of the trial was the basis of scenes in State's Attorney (1932) with John Barrymore as the prosecutor. * The case was the inspiration for the novella Double Indemnity (1936) by James M.

Moore originated the strategic planning concept of a business ecosystem, now widely adopted in the high tech community. The basic definition comes from Moore's book, The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems. The origins of the concept The concept first appeared in Moore's May/June 1993 Harvard Business Review article, titled \\"Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition\\", and won the McKinsey Award for article of the year. Moore defined \\"business ecosystem\\" as: > An economic community supported by a foundation of interacting organizations > and individuals‚Äîthe organisms of the business world. The economic community > produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves > members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead > producers, competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they coevolve > their capabilities and roles, and tend to align themselves with the > directions set by one or more central companies. Those companies holding > leadership roles may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader > is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared > visions to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles. Moore used several ecological metaphors, suggesting that the firm is embedded in a (business) environment, that it needs to coevolve with other companies, and that ‚Äúthe particular niche a business occupies is challenged by newly arriving species.‚Äù This meant that companies need to become proactive in developing mutually beneficial (\\"symbiotic\\") relationships with customers, suppliers, and even competitors. Using ecological metaphors to describe business structure and operations is increasingly common especially within the field of information technology (IT). For example, J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, has written that \\"business ecosystems\\" describe ‚Äúthe pattern of launching new technologies that has emerged from Silicon Valley‚Äù. He defines business ecology as ‚Äúa more productive set of processes for developing and commercializing new technologies‚Äù that is characterized by the ‚Äúrapid prototyping, short product- development cycles, early test marketing, options-based compensation, venture funding, early corporate independence‚Äù. DeLong also has expressed that the new way is likely to endure ‚Äúbecause it's a better business ecology than the legendarily lugubrious model refined at Xerox Parc‚Äîa more productive set of processes for rapidly developing and commercializing new technologies‚Äù. Mangrove Software,: ‚Äú(t)he interaction and correlation of economic conditions, technology, customers, employees, corporate partners, shareholders, and competitors forming the environment under which a business operates‚Äù. The Montague Institute,: ‚Äúinteracting systems consisting of companies, their customers and suppliers, and other players in the business environment‚Äù Kenneth L. Kraemer, director of the University of California, Irvine‚Äôs Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations: ‚ÄúIt is the applications that firms buy or create themselves that bring value-added to the firm and to its business ecology of customers, suppliers and business partners‚Äù. and Stephen Abram, Vice President of Micromedia, Ltd.,: has asserted that the Web is ‚Äúmaturing as a business ecology‚Äù Tom Gruber, co- founder and CTO of Intraspect Software,: ‚ÄúImagine that companies are like organisms in an evolutionary landscape‚Äù Vinod K. Dar, Managing Director of Dar & Company,: ‚ÄúEvolution on the Internet is no different from physical evolution but with vastly compressed life cycles and faster genetic mutation‚Äù. have all advocated this approach. Industries Gruber explains that over a century ago, Ford Motors did well using methods of mass production, an assembly line, and insourcing. However, Ford began to outsource its production ‚Äú[w]hen the ecology evolved.‚Äù Gruber (n.d.) has stated that such evolution in the ecology of the business world is ‚Äúpunctuated now and then by radical changes in the environment‚Äù and that ‚Äúglobalization and the Internet are the equivalents of large-scale climate change. Globalization is eliminating the traditional advantages of the large corporation: access to capital, access to markets, and economies of scale‚Äù. The application service provider (ASP) industry is moving toward relationship networks and focusing on core competencies. ‚ÄúAccording to the gospel of Cisco Systems, companies inclined to exist together within an ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù facilitate the imminence of Internet-based application delivery‚Äù. Books also use natural systems metaphors without discussing the interfaces between human business and biological ecosystems. Another work defines business ecology as ‚Äúa new field for sustainable organizational management and design,‚Äù one ‚Äúthat is based on the principle that organizations, as living organisms, are most successful when their development and behavior are aligned with their core purpose and values ‚Äì what we call ‚Äúsocial DNA‚Äô‚Äù. The need for companies to attend to ecological health is indicated by the following: ‚ÄúBusiness ecology is based on the elegant structure and principles of natural systems. It recognizes that to develop healthy business ecosystems, leaders and their organizations must see themselves, and their environments, through an ‚Äúecological lens‚Äù. Biological ecosystems The concept ecosystem in economy and business stems from the ecosystem concept in ecology. Some environmentalists, however, have used \\"business ecosystems\\" as a way to talk about environmental issues as they relate to business rather than as a metaphor to describe the increasing complexity of relationships among companies. According to Townsend, business ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between business and organisms and their environments. The goal of this \\"business ecology\\" is sustainability through the complete ecological synchronization and integration of a business with the sites that it inhabits, uses, and affects. Other environmentalists believe that the ecosystem metaphor is just a way for business to appear 'Green'. According to author Alan Marshall, the metaphor is used to make out that somehow business operates using natural principles which should be left to run without interference by governments. In the PESTEL-framework, ecology or environment is one of the criteria to analyse the external circumstances of a company.

Since the mid-1980s, it has primarily created and sold hand-held electronic references, such as spelling correctors, dictionaries, translation devices, medical references, and Bibles. It was publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol FEP until September 30, 2009, when it merged with Saunders Acquisition Corporation. Early history Franklin was originally named Franklin Computer Corporation. It was a manufacturer of clones of the Apple II series computer, which it first marketed in 1982. Franklin Ace 100 In early 1982, Franklin released the Franklin Ace 100, and in March of the same year, the Franklin Ace 1000; they were very close copies of the Apple II and Apple II Plus computers, respectively. The motherboard design is nearly identical and Franklin also copied Apple's ROMs. Two months later, Apple Computer sued Franklin for copyright violation. Franklin initially won. (See Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp..) Franklin followed with the Ace 1200, which included two built-in 5¬º\\" floppy drives and a Zilog Z80 processor for CP/M compatibility--a popular third-party option for the Apple II. The Ace 1200 was identical to the Ace 1000, but with the addition of a built-in floppy drive and four expansion cards pre-installed (one of which offered color video; the 1000 was monochrome). At its peak workforce in 1983, Franklin employed 450 employees. In August 1983, a court ruled against Franklin, which had argued that because computer code generally did not exist in printed form, it could not be copyrighted. Franklin freely admitted it had copied Apple's ROM and operating system code. However, Franklin was able to get an injunction that allowed it to continue marketing its computers. This case had lasting implications, setting precedent for copyright and reverse engineering. The case was still frequently cited more than 30 years after the August 1983 ruling. In June 1984, Franklin filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. Franklin reduced its workforce to just over 100, from a previous total of 275 employees. Starting in October 1985, Franklin released a second-generation line of Apple II clones, consisting of the Ace 2000 (based on the Apple IIe) and Ace 500 (based on the Apple IIc). These included more memory, as well as offering many features unique to the Apple IIe and Apple IIc, all while undercutting Apple's price. Franklin's last Apple II clone, the Ace 2200, sported a detached keyboard and dual internal 5.25-inch floppy disk drives. It was released in the 1987-1988 time frame. Franklin also released a pair of IBM PC compatible computers, the Franklin PC6000 and PC8000, during 1986-1988\\\\. Both were based on the Intel 8088 running at 4.77 MHz. The PC6000 had 512K of RAM and a single floppy drive, while the PC8000 had 640K and dual drives. These matched the most common configurations of the time. Soon after the Ace 2200's release, Apple was able to force Franklin out of the desktop computer market entirely, including its IBM-compatible PCs. As a result, the only Apple-compatible computer that remained on the market was VTech's Laser 128. With the loss of its desktop computer business, Franklin concentrated on its handheld line, which it had introduced in 1986. In 1987, Franklin released the Spelling Ace, which could provide spelling corrections to 80,000 English words based on technology from Proximity Technology. Franklin also released its Language Master device, which included spelling correction, dictionary definitions and a thesaurus.http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=23263 In 1988, Franklin acquired Proximity Technology. In 1989, Franklin released an electronic version of the Bible in the King James, Revised Standard and New International versions. Johnny Cash was a spokesperson for the company, recording Bible passages for their line of electronic Bibles. In 1995 Franklin launched its Bookman product line, which came with an installed database and included a slot for plugging in a second electronic book. Prices varied depending on the title. Previously, the Digital Book System (DBS) product was a player only, with two slots for electronic book cards. Franklin collaborated with Bien Logic to create educational titles for the Bookman platform. Products Currently FEP makes electronic versions of dictionaries, translators, tutors, puzzles, Bibles, Rolodex organizers, calculators, books. PDA In the past, it also made the Rex line of personal digital assistants, such as the REX 5000. That product line was later sold to Xircom. Language products The company marketed its first handheld reference device, the Spelling Ace spelling corrector, in 1986. The company also designs and licenses linguistic software to third party software application providers through its Proximity Technology Division. The company's first product for the Asian market, the Japanese-English Electronic PageMark Dictionary, was distributed through its partner Seiko Instruments, Inc. eBook The eBook products are sold in BOOKMAN Book Card, digital download (Franklin Reader, Mobipocket Reader, or other file formats) formats. They also made an eBook reader called eBookMan. Outsourced R&D; Franklin Electronic Publishers outsourced all of its R&D; to Hong Kong, with the last day of U.S. R&D; operations being March 31, 2009.

He is a founding member of the rap group the Click, and the founder of Sick Wid It Records. He has released twenty-eight studio albums to date, appeared on numerous movie soundtracks, and has also done guest appearances on a host of other rap albums. Initially an underground artist, his 1995 solo album In a Major Way opened him up to a wider audience. Beginning in 1998, he began collaborating with more mainstream rappers outside the Bay Area. He rose to even higher mainstream popularity in 2006 with his single \\"Tell Me When to Go\\" which was produced by Lil Jon. Music career 1986‚Äì99 E-40 made his rap debut in 1986, with the EP Let's Side as a member of the Click.

Federal, a nine-track LP/14-track CD produced by Studio Ton and released by Sick Wid' It Records in association with SMG (Solar Music Group), a regional distributor. After a talent show at Grambling State University, the emcee and his cousin B-Legit decided to attempt a career in rap. Together, and with his sister Suga-T, they released their 1993 mainstream radio hit Captain Save a Hoe. They moved back to Vallejo and teamed up with D-Shot, E-40's brother, to form the group MVP or Most Valuable Players. E-40's gospel singing uncle (Saint Charles) helped them put out the record. Suga-T was then added to the group to form the Click. Synonymous with Bay Area rap, E-40 garnered a regional following, and eventually a national one, with his flamboyant raps, while his entrepreneurial spirit, embodied by his homegrown record label, Sick Wid' It Records, did much to cultivate a flourishing rap scene to the east of San Francisco Bay, in communities such as Oakland and his native Vallejo. Along with Too Short, Spice 1, and Ant Banks, E-40 was among the first West Coast rappers to sign a major-label deal, penning a deal with Jive Records in 1994, after years of releasing music independently. Thus, six additional solo albums were to follow, beginning with In a Major Way in 1995 as well as remastered versions of E-40's independent Sick Wid It recordings from previous years. In a Major Way was regionally well-received, with guest spots by such rappers as Tupac Shakur and Mac Mall, as well as his son Droop-E. Although having a large following within West Coast, E-40 did not have a large mainstream audience, so only two of his songs released under Jive Records, \\"1-Luv\\" featuring Levitti and \\"Things'll Never Change\\" featuring Bo- Roc, charted on the Billboard Hot 100.[ E-40 Billboard Singles] on AllMusic He had been working nearly exclusively with rappers from the Bay Area until 1997, when he released the double disc compilation Southwest Riders featuring exclusively rap acts from the Bay Area and the south.

The company expanded to 123 stores to sell the shoes, boots, and sandals, all with the negative-heel design, across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The shoes surged in popularity and were prominently featured on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and in TIME Magazine. Soon, other firms, including Roots Canada, also marketed similar negative-heel shoes. Experts expressed varying opinions on whether the shoes were good or bad for one's feet.

His onscreen persona \\"Max\\" was one of the first recognizable recurring characters in film. He has also been cited as the \\"first international movie star\\"Waldekranz, Rune: Filmens Historia - Del 1, p. 208 (P.A. Norstedt & S√∂ners F√∂rlag, Stockholm) and \\"the first film star anywhere\\". Born in Cavernes, France to Catholic parents, Linder grew up with a passion for theater and enrolled in the Conservatoire de Bordeaux in 1899. He soon received awards for his performances and continued to pursue a career in the legitimate theater. He became a contract player with the Bordeaux Th√©√¢tre des Arts from 1901 to 1904, performing in plays by Moli√®re, Pierre Corneille and Alfred de Musset. From the summer of 1905, Linder appeared in short comedy films for Path√©, at first usually in supporting roles. His first major film role was in the Georges M√©li√®s-like fantasy film The Legend of Punching. During the following years, Linder made several hundred short films portraying \\"Max\\", a wealthy and dapper man-about- town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life. Starting with The Skater's Debut in 1907, the character became one of the first identifiable motion-picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies. By 1911, Linder was co-directing his own films (with Ren√© LePrince) as well as writing the scripts. Linder enlisted at the outbreak of the First World War, and worked at first as a dispatch driver and entertainer. During his service, he was injured several times, and the experiences reportedly had a devastating effect on him both physically and mentally.Mathiesen, Snorre Sm√†ri: \\"Max Linder: Father of Film Comedy\\" (Classic Images, March 2012, p. 76) It was during this time he suffered his first outbreak of chronic depression. Life and career Early life Linder was born Gabriel-Maximilien Leuvielle near Saint-Loub√®s, Gironde. His parents were wealthy vineyard owners and expected Linder to take over the family business; his older brother Maurice (born 28 June 1881) had become a celebrated national rugby player. But Linder grew up with a passion for theater, and was enthralled by the traveling theater and circus performances that occasionally visited his town. He later wrote that \\"nothing was more distasteful to me than the thought of a life among the grapes.\\"Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 671-77. Early career 1899-1905 In 1899, Linder enrolled in the Conservatoire de Bordeaux and quickly won awards for first prize in comedy and second prize in tragedy. He continued to pursue a career in the theater and became a contract player with the Bordeaux Th√©√¢tre des Arts from 1901 to 1904, performing in plays by Moli√®re, Pierre Corneille and Alfred de Musset. At the same time that he was performing in serious dramatic theater, he became friends with Charles le Bargy of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. Le Bargy encouraged Linder to audition for the Conservatoire de Paris in 1904. Linder was rejected and began appearing in less prestigious theaters such as the Olympia Theater and the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ambigu. By 1905, he had adopted his stage name of Max Linder and used it in several theatrical performances. Also during this period, Linder applied for work at Path√© Fr√®res in Vincennes at the suggestion of film director Louis Gasnier and began appearing in small bit parts, mostly in slapstick comedies. Linder continued to appear on the stage for the next two years and was not a significant film star at first. However, an often-told legend about the origins of Linder's film career is that French film producer Charles Path√© personally saw Linder on the stage and wrote him a note that read \\"In your eyes lies a fortune. Come and act in front of my cameras, and I will help make it.\\" Film career 1905‚Äì1916 Linder in Seven Years Bad Luck (1921) From 1905 to 1907, Linder appeared in dozens of short comedy films for Path√©, usually in a supporting role. His first noticeably larger film role was in The Young Man's first outing in 1905. He also appeared in Georges M√©li√®s-like fantasy films such as Serpentine Dances and The Legend of Punching, his first leading role. His rise to stardom commenced in 1907 when Path√©'s slapstick star Ren√© Gr√©han left the company to join √âclair. Gr√©han's screen character was Gontran, whose persona included high-society clothing and a dandy-ish demeanor. Linder was chosen to take over the characterization for Path√©, and the style of dress and personality of Gr√©han's character became his trademark. Film critic David Robinson described Linder's screen persona as \\"no grotesque: he was young, handsome, debonair, immaculate...in silk hat, jock coat, cravat, spats, patent shoes, and swagger cane.\\" Linder made more than one hundred short films portraying \\"Max\\", a wealthy and dapper man-about-town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life. With this character, he had created one of the first identifiable motion- picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies. Linder's first appearance as \\"Max\\" was in The Skater's Debut in 1907. Lake Daumesnil in Paris had frozen over and director Louis Gasnier filmed Linder in his new attire, with Linder improvising the rest. In the film, \\"Max\\" falls about and does a rendition of \\"the windmill routine\\" by spinning his cane around, predating Charlie Chaplin's version in The Rink by nine years. Path√© was unimpressed with the film and re-shot parts of it, and it was not popular with audiences when released. Soon afterwards, Gasnier left Path√© and moved to Italy, leaving Linder without a supporter at Path√©; he made few films in 1908. His luck began to change when Path√©'s top comedy star, Andr√© Deed, left to work with the Italian film company Itala, leaving Linder as the company's leading comedic actor. Later in 1909, Gasnier returned from Italy and immediately began working with Linder again. The team made several shorts in 1909 with Linder in various roles, such as a blind elderly man and a coquettish young woman. But they soon discovered that the character of \\"Max\\" was the most popular with audiences and stuck with him from then on. Among the popular \\"Max\\" films made by Linder and Grasnier in 1909 are A Young Lady Killer and The Cure for Cowardice By 1910, Linder had proved himself to Path√© and was quickly becoming one of the most popular film actors in the world. When Gasnier was sent to the United States later that year to oversee Path√©'s productions there, Lucien Nonguet took over as Linder's director. Together they made such films as Max takes a bath and the autobiographical Max Linder's Film Debut, which fictitiously recreates the legend of Linder's early film career and includes Charles Path√© as himself. By the end of the year, Linder had become the most popular film actor in the world. Although actress Florence Lawrence is often referred to as \\"The First Movie Star\\" in the United States, Linder appears to be the very first worldwide movie star with a major following. In Russia, he was voted the most popular film actor, ahead of Asta Nielsen. He also had a Russian impersonator, Zozlov, and a devoted fan in Czar Nicholas II. Another professed fan was British playwright George Bernard Shaw. The first feature film ever made in Bulgaria was a remake of one of Linder's earlier movies. He was offered $12,000 to spend a month in Berlin making public appearances with his film screenings, but had to decline for health reasons. In France, a Max Linder movie theater had opened in Paris. At the height of his fame, Linder ended 1910 with a serious illness. He was forced to stop making films when appendicitis left him bedridden, and some newspapers reported that he had died. He eventually recovered the following spring and began making films again in May 1911. Linder in 1913. In 1911, Linder returned to filmmaking and began co-directing his own films (with Ren√© LePrince) as well as writing the scripts. By 1912, he was the solo director of his films. Gaining complete control over his own films brought positive results both critically and commercially; the films Linder made during this period are generally considered to be his best. Max, Victim of Quinine is considered by film critic Jean Mitry to be \\"his masterpiece.\\" In the film, an intoxicated \\"Max\\" gets into numerous fights with such dignitaries as the Minister of War, an ambassador and the police commissioner, all of whom challenge him to a duel and present him with their business cards. Eventually \\"Max\\" is apprehended by the police, who attempt to return him to his residence, but end up mistakenly taking him to the homes of the various men whom he had previously fought with. The universality of silent films brought Linder fame and fortune throughout Europe, making him the highest paid entertainer of the day, with a salary increase of 150,000 francs (the average monthly salary in France was 100 francs at the time). He began touring Europe with his films from 1911 to 1912, including Spain, where he entertained thousands of fans at the Barcelona railway station, Austria, and Russia, where he was accompanied on piano by a young Dimitri Tiomkin. In 1912 after the tour, Linder demanded and received a salary of one million francs a year, and Charles Path√© used the huge sum to generate publicity, with an ad reading \\"We understand that the shackles which bind Max Linder have attained the value of one million francs a year...the imagination boggles at such a figure!\\" This set a precedent in the entertainment industry for actors' salaries that would become a staple of the Hollywood system, but privately Path√© nicknamed Linder \\"The Napoleon of the Cinema\\". The high point of Linder's career was from 1912 to 1914. His films were made with increased skill and \\"Max\\" was at his funniest. He made such films as Max Virtuoso, Max Does Not Speak English, Max and His Dog, Max's Hat and Max and the Jealous Husband. His ensemble of actors included Stacia Napierkowska, Jane Renouardt, Gaby Morlay, and occasional performances from the young actors Abel Gance and Maurice Chevalier. Linder had given Chevalier his start in movies, but the silent medium did not suit Chevalier, who stuck to the stage until the all-singing all-dancing features came in, many years later. The outbreak of World War I brought a temporary end to Linder's film career in 1914, but not before he made the short patriotic film The Second of August that year. Linder attempted to enlist in the French army, but was physically unfit for combat duty. Instead he worked as a dispatch driver between Paris and the front lines. Many conflicting stories about the reasons behind his dismissal from the army exist, including that he was shot through the lung, and seriously wounded. Initially, it was reported by one newspaper that he had been killed; Linder actually phoned the offending publishers, leading them to run the headline \\"Max Linder Not Killed\\".Paul Merton's Weird and Wonderful World of Early Cinema However, others have asserted that he became infected with pneumonia after hiding from a German patrol in icy water for several hours. After being dismissed from his duties, Linder spent the remainder of the war entertaining the troops and making films. It was also during this period that Linder suffered his first serious bout with chronic depression. Move to the US and career decline 1916-1925 Linder (c.1917) In 1916, Linder was approached by American film producer George K. Spoor, the president of the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, to make twelve short films for him in the US at a salary of $5,000 a week. Earlier that year, Charlie Chaplin, then the most popular comedian in the world, had left Essanay for more money and independence at Mutual Film and Spoor wanted to replace Chaplin with Max Linder, whose pantomime skills were arguably equally accomplished. Linder was offered a new contract from Charles Path√©, but accepted Spoor's offer and moved to the United States to work for Essanay later that year. Unfortunately his first few American-made \\"Max\\" films were unpopular both critically and financially. The first two, Max Comes Across and Max Wants a Divorce were complete failures, but the third film, Max and his Taxi was moderately successful. The financially troubled studio may have been counting on Linder to restore its flagging fortunes and cancelled production of the remaining films on Linder's contract. Max and his Taxi had been shot in Hollywood and while there Linder had developed a close friendship with Charlie Chaplin. They would often attend events such as boxing matches or car races together, and according to writer Jack Spears, \\"while working on a picture Linder would go next door to Chaplin's home and discuss the day's shooting. The two often sat until dawn, developing and refining the gags. Chaplin's suggestions were invaluable, Linder said.\\" Scene from The Little Caf√© Linder returned to France in 1917 and opened a movie theater, the Cin√© Max Linder. However, due to his depression and anxiety about the still ongoing war, he was unable to continue making films on a regular basis, and was often quoted by journalists about the horrors of the front lines. After the Armistice in 1918, Linder was able to regain his enthusiasm and agreed to make a film with director Raymond Bernard, the feature length The Little Caf√© in 1919. In the film, Linder plays a waiter who suddenly becomes a millionaire, but simultaneously is tricked into a twenty-year contract to be a waiter by the cafe owner. The film made over a million francs in Europe and briefly revived his career, but was financially unsuccessful in the US. Four years after failing to become a major star in the US, Linder made another attempt at filmmaking in Hollywood and formed his own production company there in 1921. His first film back in the US was Seven Years Bad Luck, considered by some to be his best film. The film contains one of the earliest (though not the first) examples on film of the \\"human mirror\\" gag best known in the scene between Groucho and Harpo Marx in Duck Soup twelve years later. Linder next made Be My Wife later that year, but again neither films were able to find a major audience in the US. Linder then decided to dispense of the \\"Max\\" character and try something different for his third (and final) attempt: The Three Must-Get- Theres in 1922. The film is a satire of swashbuckling films made by Douglas Fairbanks and is loosely based on the plot of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers. The film was praised by Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin, but again failed at the box office. At the films premiere, Linder had said to director Robert Florey \\"You see, Bob, I sense that I'm no longer funny; I have so many preoccupations that I can no longer concentrate on my film character ... The public is mildly amused by my situations, but this evening where were the explosions of laughter that we hear when Charlie's on the screen?...Make people laugh, its easy to say make people laugh, but I don't feel funny anymore.\\" With his depression making it difficult for him to work, Linder returned to France in 1922 and shortly afterwards made a semi-serious film: Au Secours! (Help!) for director Abel Gance. The film is essentially a horror film set in a haunted house, with occasional moments of comedy by Linder. The film was released in England in 1924 and was critically praised, however the legal copyright of the film prevented it from being released in France or the US for several years. Linder's last film was The King of the Circus directed by √âdouard-√âmile Violet (with pre-production collaboration from Jacques Feyder) and filmed in Vienna in 1925. In the film, \\"Max\\" joins a circus in order to be closer to the woman that he loves. The film includes such gags as a hungover \\"Max\\" waking up in a department store and the film's plot is similar to the Charlie Chaplin film The Circus (1928). In late 1925, Linder was working on pre-production for his next film Barkas le fol, which would never be made. Marriage and death As a consequence of his war service, Linder suffered from continuing health problems, including bouts of severe depression. In 1923, he married eighteen-year-old H√©l√®ne \\"Jean\\" Peters, who came from a wealthy family and with whom he had a daughter, Maud (1924-2017), also known as \\"Josette\\". Linder and his wife may have made a suicide pact. In February 1924, they were both found unconscious at a hotel in Vienna, Austria, though this was explained as an accidental overdose of \\"sleeping powder.\\" The incident was covered up by the physician reporting it as an accidental overdose of barbiturates. In late October 1925, Max and H√©l√®ne reportedly attended a Paris screening of Quo Vadis (in which the main characters, as a reporter put it, \\"bleed themselves to death\\"), and died on 1 November in a similar manner. They drank Veronal, injected morphine and slashed their wrists. There is still some question, however, as to whether the deaths were really a result of a suicide pact, or whether Max murdered his much-younger wife or pressured her into killing herself. On 2 November 1925, The New York Times reported that H√©l√®ne Linder had told her mother by letter that, \\"He will kill me.\\" The article also claims that \\"no one believes she herself opened her veins.\\" Critic Vincent Canby acknowledged in 1988 that \\"Linder died with his young wife in what has sometimes been described as a suicide pact, and sometimes as a murder-suicide.\\" In addition, Maud Linder reported in her memoir that the head of the workmen at Linder's house in Neuilly overheard Max tell a friend, probably Armand Massard, that he planned to kill his wife along with himself, as he could not bear the thought of her belonging to another after he was gone. Linder was buried at the Catholique cimeti√®re de Saint- Loub√®s. His wife is buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Legacy Upon receiving the news of Linder's death, Chaplin is reported to have closed his studio for one day out of respect.Max Linder profile, imdb.com; accessed 21 January 2015. In the ensuing years, Linder was relegated to little more than a footnote in film history until 1963 when a Max Linder compilation film titled Laugh with Max Linder premiered at the Venice Film Festival and was theatrically released. The film was a compilation of Linder's last three films made in Hollywood and its release was supervised by his daughter, Maud Linder. In 1983, Maud Linder made a documentary film, The Man in the Silk Hat, about Linder's life and career. It was screened out of competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. In 1992, Maud Linder published a book about Linder in France, Max Linder was my father and in 2008 she received the Prix Henri Langlois for her work to promote her father's legacy. In his honor, Lyc√©e Max Linder, a public school in the city of Libourne in the Gironde d√©partement near his birthplace was given his name in 1981.https://www.amaelmaxlinder.fr/la-m%C3%A9moire-du-lyc%C3%A9e/historique/ Linder's influence on film comedy and particularly on slapstick films is that the genre shifted from the \\"knockabout\\" comedies made by such people as Mack Sennett and Andr√© Deed to a more subtle, refined and character driven medium that would later be dominated by Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and others. Linder's influence on Chaplin is apparent both from Chaplin sometimes borrowing gags or entire plot-lines from Linder's films, as well as from a famous signed photo that Chaplin sent Linder which read: \\"To Max, the Professor, from his disciple, Charlie Chaplin.\\" Mack Sennett and King Vidor also singled out Linder as a great influence on their directing careers. His high society characterizations as \\"Max\\" also influenced such actors as Adolphe Menjou and Raymond Griffith. In his heyday, Linder had two major rivals in France: L√©once Perret and Charles Prince. Perrett later became a successful director, but his early career included a series of \\"L√©once\\" slapstick shorts that were popular but nowhere near the stature of Linder's films. Charles Prince, on the other hand, was gaining popularity during his career and was nearly equal to Linder by the beginning of World War I. Prince's screen persona was \\"Rigadin\\", who like \\"Max\\" was a bumbling bourgeois socialite who always got into trouble. Both Linder and Prince were employed by Path√© in the early 1910s and they often used the same story lines, sets and directors. Years after both comedians' careers were long over, Linder has received several revivals in interest while Charles Prince remains mostly forgotten. In popular media Linder is referenced in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds where the owner of a cinema in Nazi occupied Paris in 1944, Shosanna Dreyfus, says that she will be having a Max Linder festival.

Early life and Council career He was born on 4 March 1923 in Adelboden, Switzerland, to a father in the civil service, brought up in India and sent back to England when his father was dying. As a boy, he was shunted around among aunts and uncles. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Balliol College, Oxford. During World War II he was a conscientious objector, and left Oxford to work on the land.Ian Patterson, \\"Pacifists and Conscientious Objectors\\", in Adam Piette and Mark Rawlinson, The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century British and American War Literature, Edinburgh University Press 2012.

It is printed as a project of Black and Green Network and edited by anarcho-primitivist writer, Kevin Tucker. ST was initially labeled as a project of the Coalition Against Civilization (CAC) and the Black and Green Network (BAG). The CAC was started towards the end of 1999 in the aftermath of the massive street protests in Eugene (Reclaim the Streets) and in Seattle (WTO) of that year. That aftermath gave a new voice and standing for green anarchist and anarcho-primitivist writers and viewpoints within both the anarchist milieu and the culture at large. Particular media attention turned to writer John Zerzan, the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, and critical views of technology. But within this media frenzy, a number of ecological minded anarchists began to draw critical lines between each other and stepped up on their own. This was the beginning of the new wave of green anarchism which gave rise to the CAC, ST, BAG, as well as Green Anarchy (originally a U.S. distributor of the premier green anarchist journal, Green Anarchist turned into its own project and now the largest anarchist publication). It was established in 2000 and the first issue came out in winter 2001 (currently out of print) and contained a mix of reprints and some original articles from Derrick Jensen and John Zerzan among others. Issue two came in the following year in the wake of Sept. 11 and took a major step from the first issue in becoming something of its own rather than another mouthpiece of green anarchist rhetoric. The articles took a more in depth direction opening a more analytical and critical draw between anarchy and anthropology, attacks on Reason and the Progress/linear views of human history and Future that stand at the base of the ideology of civilization. The magazine is based in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Early 2003 saw the release of Number Three which further reflected the growth of ST in both ideas and format. At just over 100 pages, this issue began to focus upon more particular issues, primarily on a critique of symbolic culture, a further look at the relationship between anarchy and anthropology, and opened up a critical look at the concept and form of revolution. Thematically this would be the establishment of what ST has been known for: the primary source for critical and analytical anarcho-primitivist critique and praxis. In seeking out the limits and failures of revolution and revolutionary thinking, the turn looked more towards insurrection, rewilding and a deeper understanding of the collapse of civilization and what that means in terms of resistance. Though containing no articles or references to the CAC, this would be the last issue published by the CAC as such. Recognizing the long overdue necessity to move beyond an unused name, the CAC was formally collapsed in 2005 to put more attention where it belonged and give Tucker more time to devote immediately towards the more important projects of the Black and Green Network and ST. Two and a half years later (Fall 2005) brought Issue No. 4, which really represents the fruition of the past years' experience and questioning. Again taking new steps in terms of presentation (now a nearly 200 page book) and in terms of concepts, this issue gave a more complete merging of what No. 3 was heading towards: a fusion of critical theory (looking at the relationship between sedentism and domestication with the formation of hierarchies, coercive power and its other side effects), the relationship between rewilding and resistance, delving into primitive skills and more in- depth glances at what a non-revolution, anti-civilization resistance might look or aim at, attempts to rescue animal liberation from animal rights, and much more. In 2010 activist/musician Jadis Mercado, under the stage name The Adjective Noun, released the album \\"Species Traitor\\" as an homage to the publication.

Biography  He was the youngest of five children born to the carpenter, Henri-Louis Bocion (1792-1835), who was originally from Bournens, and his wife Suzanne-Catherine. After his father's death, the family's financial situation became untenable and he was placed with his paternal grandfather, a marble sculptor, in Montreux. His grandfather, in turn, died in 1840 and Fran√ßois went to live with his mother's family in Vevey, where he completed his primary education. During those years, he was introduced to drawing by Christian-Gottlieb Steinlen (1779-1847) and Fran√ßois Bonnet (1811-1894). This inspired him to visit Paris in 1846, where he frequented the studios of Louis-Aim√© Grosclaude and Charles Gleyre at the √âcole des Beaux-arts. He also made friends with Gustave Courbet. After a bout with typhoid fever, he returned to Lausanne. He held his first showing with the \\"Soci√©t√© des beaux-arts\\" (Turnus), shortly thereafter. From 1849 until his death, he was a Professor of Drawing at the √âcole industrielle de Lausanne and designed the school's student uniform. He was a regular contributor of cartoons to the satirical journal, La Gu√™pe (The Wasp) from 1851 to 1854. Until 1858, he made numerous trips to Italy. His painting of Venice was purchased by the Canton of Vaud and hangs in the meeting room of the Council of State. He also took private students, notably Th√©ophile Steinlen and Eug√®ne Grasset. In 1859, he married Anna-Barbara Furrer. They had nine children, five of whom died in infancy. After 1888, he was a member of the . His works may be seen at the , the Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts and the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg. A pedestrian passage in Lausanne was named after him in 1924.

CMOs were first created in 1983 by the investment banks Salomon Brothers and First Boston for the U.S. mortgage liquidity provider Freddie Mac. The Salomon Brothers team was led by Lewis Ranieri and the First Boston team by Laurence D. Fink,David Dayan, Chain of Title (New York and London: The New Press, 2016 p. 22 although Dexter Senft also later received an industry award for his contribution). Legally, a CMO is a debt security issued by an abstraction‚Äîa special purpose entity‚Äîand is not a debt owed by the institution creating and operating the entity. The entity is the legal owner of a set of mortgages, called a pool. Investors in a CMO buy bonds issued by the entity, and they receive payments from the income generated by the mortgages according to a defined set of rules. With regard to terminology, the mortgages themselves are termed collateral, 'classes' refers to groups of mortgages issued to borrowers of roughly similar credit worthiness, tranches are specified fractions or slices, metaphorically speaking, of a pool of mortgages and the income they produce that are combined into an individual security, while the structure is the set of rules that dictates how the income received from the collateral will be distributed. The legal entity, collateral, and structure are collectively referred to as the deal. Unlike traditional mortgage pass-through securities, CMOs feature different payment streams and risks, depending on investor preferences. For tax purposes, CMOs are generally structured as Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits, which avoid the potential for \\"double-taxation\\".Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, ¬ß4:20 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Investors in CMOs include banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, government agencies, and most recently central banks. This article focuses primarily on CMO bonds as traded in the United States of America. The term \\"collateralized mortgage obligation\\" technically refers to a security issued by a specific type of legal entity dealing in residential mortgages, but investors also frequently refer to deals put together using other types of entities such as real estate mortgage investment conduits as CMOs. Purpose The most basic way a mortgage loan can be transformed into a bond suitable for purchase by an investor would simply be to \\"split it\\". For example, a $300,000 30 year mortgage with an interest rate of 6.5% could be split into 300 1000 dollar bonds. These bonds would have a 30-year amortization, and an interest rate of 6.00% for example (with the remaining .50% going to the servicing company to send out the monthly bills and perform servicing work). However, this format of bond has various problems for various investors *Even though the mortgage is 30 years, the borrower could theoretically pay off the loan earlier than 30 years, and will usually do so when rates have gone down, forcing the investor to have to reinvest his money at lower interest rates, something he may have not planned for. This is known as prepayment risk. *A 30-year time frame is a long time for an investor's money to be locked away. Only a small percentage of investors would be interested in locking away their money for this long. Even if the average home owner refinanced their loan every 10 years, meaning that the average bond would only last 10 years, there is a risk that the borrowers would not refinance, such as during an extending high interest rate period, this is known as extension risk. In addition, the longer time frame of a bond, the more the price moves up and down with the changes of interest rates, causing a greater potential penalty or bonus for an investor selling his bonds early. This is known as interest rate risk. *Most normal bonds can be thought of as \\"interest only loans\\", where the borrower borrows a fixed amount and then pays interest only before returning the principal at the end of a period. On a normal mortgage, interest and principal are paid each month, causing the amount of interest earned to decrease. This is undesirable to many investors because they are forced to reinvest the principal. This is known as reinvestment risk. *On loans not guaranteed by the quasi-governmental agencies Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, certain investors may not agree with the risk reward tradeoff of the interest rate earned versus the potential loss of principal due to the borrower not paying. The latter event is known as default risk. Salomon Brothers and First Boston created the CMO concept to address these issues. A CMO is essentially a way to create many different kinds of bonds from the same mortgage loan so as to please many different kinds of investors. For example: *A group of mortgages could create 4 different classes of bonds. The first group would receive any prepayments before the second group would, and so on. Thus the first group of bonds would be expected to pay off sooner, but would also have a lower interest rate. Thus a 30-year mortgage is transformed into bonds of various lengths suitable for various investors with various goals. *A group of mortgages could create 4 different classes of bonds. Any losses would go against the first group, before going against the second group, etc. The first group would have the highest interest rate, while the second would have slightly less, etc. Thus an investor could choose the bond that is right for the risk they want to take (i.e. a conservative bond for an insurance company, a speculative bond for a hedge fund). *A group of mortgages could be split into principal-only and interest-only bonds. The \\"principal-only\\" bonds would sell at a discount, and would thus be zero coupon bonds (e.g., bonds that you buy for $800 each and which mature at $1,000, without paying any cash interest). These bonds would satisfy investors who are worried that mortgage prepayments would force them to re-invest their money at the exact moment interest rates are lower; countering this, principal only investors in such a scenario would also be getting their money earlier rather than later, which equates to a higher return on their zero-coupon investment. The \\"interest-only\\" bonds would include only the interest payments of the underlying pool of loans. These kinds of bonds would dramatically change in value based on interest rate movements, e.g., prepayments mean less interest payments, but higher interest rates and lower prepayments means these bonds pay more, and for a longer time. These characteristics allow investors to choose between interest-only (IO) or principal-only (PO) bonds to better manage their sensitivity to interest rates, and can be used to manage and offset the interest rate-related price changes in other investments. Whenever a group of mortgages is split into different classes of bonds, the risk does not disappear. Rather, it is reallocated among the different classes. Some classes receive less risk of a particular type; other classes more risk of that type. How much the risk is reduced or increased for each class depends on how the classes are structured. Credit protection CMOs are most often backed by mortgage loans, which are originated by thrifts (savings and loans), mortgage companies, and the consumer lending units of large commercial banks. Loans meeting certain size and credit criteria can be insured against losses resulting from borrower delinquencies and defaults by any of the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) (Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, or Ginnie Mae). GSE guaranteed loans can serve as collateral for \\"Agency CMOs\\", which are subject to interest rate risk but not credit risk. Loans not meeting these criteria are referred to as \\"Non- Conforming\\", and can serve as collateral for \\"private label mortgage bonds\\", which are also called \\"whole loan CMOs\\". Whole loan CMOs are subject to both credit risk and interest rate risk. Issuers of whole loan CMOs generally structure their deals to reduce the credit risk of all certain classes of bonds (\\"Senior Bonds\\") by utilizing various forms of credit protection in the structure of the deal. Credit tranching The most common form of credit protection is called credit tranching. In the simplest case, credit tranching means that any credit losses will be absorbed by the most junior class of bondholders until the principal value of their investment reaches zero. If this occurs, the next class of bonds (more senior) absorb credit losses, and so forth, until finally the senior bonds begin to experience losses. More frequently, a deal is embedded with certain \\"triggers\\" related to quantities of delinquencies or defaults in the loans backing the mortgage pool. If a balance of delinquent loans reaches a certain threshold, interest and principal that would be used to pay junior bondholders is instead directed to pay off the principal balance of senior bondholders, shortening the life of the senior bonds. Overcollateralization In CMOs backed by loans of lower credit quality, such as subprime mortgage loans, the issuer will sell a quantity of bonds whose principal value is less than the value of the underlying pool of mortgages. Because of the excess collateral, investors in the CMO will not experience losses until defaults on the underlying loans reach a certain level. If the \\"overcollateralization\\" turns into \\"undercollateralization\\" (the assumptions of the default rate were inadequate), then the CMO defaults. CMOs have contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis. Excess spread Another way to enhance credit protection is to issue bonds that pay a lower interest rate than the underlying mortgages. For example, if the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage pool is 7%, the CMO issuer could choose to issue bonds that pay a 5% coupon. The additional interest, referred to as \\"excess spread\\", is placed into a \\"spread account\\" until some or all of the bonds in the deal mature. If some of the mortgage loans go delinquent or default, funds from the excess spread account can be used to pay the bondholders. Excess spread is a very effective mechanism for protecting bondholders from defaults that occur late in the life of the deal because by that time the funds in the excess spread account will be sufficient to cover almost any losses. Prepayment tranching The principal (and associated coupon) stream for CMO collateral can be structured to allocate prepayment risk. Investors in CMOs wish to be protected from prepayment risk as well as credit risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that the term of the security will vary according to differing rates of repayment of principal by borrowers (repayments from refinancings, sales, curtailments, or foreclosures). If principal is prepaid faster than expected (for example, if mortgage rates fall and borrowers refinance), then the overall term of the mortgage collateral will shorten, and the principal returned at par will cause a loss for premium priced collateral. This prepayment risk cannot be removed, but can be reallocated between CMO tranches so that some tranches have some protection against this risk, whereas other tranches will absorb more of this risk. To facilitate this allocation of prepayment risk, CMOs are structured such that prepayments are allocated between bonds using a fixed set of rules. The most common schemes for prepayment tranching are described below. Sequential tranching (or by time) All of the available principal payments go to the first sequential tranche, until its balance is decremented to zero, then to the second, and so on. There are several reasons that this type of tranching would be done: *The tranches could be expected to mature at very different times and therefore would have different yields that correspond to different points on the yield curve. *The underlying mortgages could have a great deal of uncertainty as to when the principal will actually be received since home owners have the option to make their scheduled payments or to pay their loan off early at any time. The sequential tranches each have much less uncertainty. Parallel tranching This simply means tranches that pay down pro rata. The coupons on the tranches would be set so that in aggregate the tranches pay the same amount of interest as the underlying mortgages. The tranches could be either fixed rate or floating rate. If they have floating coupons, they would have a formula that make their total interest equal to the collateral interest. For example, with collateral that pays a coupon of 8%, you could have two tranches that each have half of the principal, one being a floater that pays LIBOR with a cap of 16%, the other being an inverse floater that pays a coupon of 16% minus LIBOR. *A special case of parallel tranching is known as the IO/PO split. IO and PO refer to Interest Only and Principal Only. In this case, one tranche would have a coupon of zero (meaning that it would get no interest at all) and the other would get all of the interest. These bonds could be used to speculate on prepayments. A principal only bond would be sold at a deep discount (a much lower price than the underlying mortgage) and would rise in price rapidly if many of the underlying mortgages were prepaid. The interest only bond would be very profitable if few of the mortgages prepaid, but could get very little money if many mortgages prepaid. Unlike sequential tranche securitization, an IO/PO split is a parallel tranche securitization in that each simply represents a separate claims on a different portion of the cash flows from the collateral pool (e.g. mortgages bonds). Unlike sequential tranche securitization, the payments to each tranche of a parallel securitization are not predicated on the prior payment to a more senior tranche of the pool. Absent any subordination of one tranche to the other, neither tranche of an IO/PO split (parallel securitization) would be deemed to be leveraged. Z bonds This type of tranche supports other tranches by not receiving an interest payment. The interest payment that would have accrued to the Z tranche is used to pay off the principal of other bonds, and the principal of the Z tranche increases. The Z tranche starts receiving interest and principal payments only after the other tranches in the CMO have been fully paid. This type of tranche is often used to customize sequential tranches, or VADM tranches. Schedule bonds (also called PAC or TAC bonds) This type of tranching has a bond (often called a PAC or TAC bond) which has even less uncertainty than a sequential bond by receiving prepayments according to a defined schedule. The schedule is maintained by using support bonds (also called companion bonds) that absorb the excess prepayments. *Planned Amortization Class (PAC) bonds have a principal payment rate determined by two different prepayment rates, which together form a band (also called a collar). Early in the life of the CMO, the prepayment at the lower PSA will yield a lower prepayment. Later in the life, the principal in the higher PSA will have declined enough that it will yield a lower prepayment. The PAC tranche will receive whichever rate is lower, so it will change prepayment at one PSA for the first part of its life, then switch to the other rate. The ability to stay on this schedule is maintained by a support bond, which absorbs excess prepayments, and will receive less prepayments to prevent extension of average life. However, the PAC is only protected from extension to the amount that prepayments are made on the underlying MBSs. When the principal of that bond is exhausted, the CMO is referred to as a \\"busted PAC\\", or \\"busted collar\\". *Target Amortization Class (TAC) bonds are similar to PAC bonds, but they do not provide protection against extension of average life. The schedule of principal payments is created by using just a single PSA. Very accurately defined maturity (VADM) bonds Very accurately defined maturity (VADM) bonds are similar to PAC bonds in that they protect against both extension and contraction risk, but their payments are supported in a different way. Instead of a support bond, they are supported by accretion of a Z bond. Because of this, a VADM tranche will receive the scheduled prepayments even if no prepayments are made on the underlying. Non-accelerating senior (NAS) NAS bonds are designed to protect investors from volatility and negative convexity resulting from prepayments. NAS tranches of bonds are fully protected from prepayments for a specified period, after which time prepayments are allocated to the tranche using a specified step down formula. For example, an NAS bond might be protected from prepayments for five years, and then would receive 10% of the prepayments for the first month, then 20%, and so on. Recently, issuers have added features to accelerate the proportion of prepayments flowing to the NAS class of bond in order to create shorter bonds and reduce extension risk. NAS tranches are usually found in deals that also contain short sequentials, Z-bonds, and credit subordination. A NAS tranche receives principal payments according to a schedule which shows for a given month the share of pro rata principal that must be distributed to the NAS tranche. NASquential NASquentials were introduced in mid-2005 and represented an innovative structural twist, combining the standard NAS (Non-Accelerated Senior) and Sequential structures. Similar to a sequential structure, the NASquentials are tranched sequentially, however, each tranche has a NAS-like hard lockout date associated with it. Unlike with a NAS, no shifting interest mechanism is employed after the initial lockout date. The resulting bonds offer superior stability versus regular sequentials, and yield pickup versus PACs. The support-like cashflows falling out on the other side of NASquentials are sometimes referred to as RUSquentials (Relatively Unstable Sequentials). Coupon tranching The coupon stream from the mortgage collateral can also be restructured (analogous to the way the principal stream is structured). This coupon stream allocation is performed after prepayment tranching is complete. If the coupon tranching is done on the collateral without any prepayment tranching, then the resulting tranches are called 'strips'. The benefit is that the resulting CMO tranches can be targeted to very different sets of investors. In general, coupon tranching will produce a pair (or set) of complementary CMO tranches. IO/discount fixed rate pair A fixed rate CMO tranche can be further restructured into an Interest Only (IO) tranche and a discount coupon fixed rate tranche. An IO pays a coupon only based on a notional principal, it receives no principal payments from amortization or prepayments. Notional principal does not have any cash flows but shadows the principal changes of the original tranche, and it is this principal off which the coupon is calculated. For example, a $100mm PAC tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% coupon ('6 off 6' or '6-squared') can be cut into a $100mm PAC tranche with a 5% coupon (and hence a lower dollar price) called a '5 off 6', and a PAC IO tranche with a notional principal of $16.666667mm and paying a 6% coupon. Note the resulting notional principle of the IO is less than the original principal. Using the example, the IO is created by taking 1% of coupon off the 6% original coupon gives an IO of 1% coupon off $100mm notional principal, but this is by convention 'normalized' to a 6% coupon (as the collateral was originally 6% coupon) by reducing the notional principal to $16.666667mm ($100mm / 6). PO/premium fixed rate pair Similarly if a fixed rate CMO tranche coupon is desired to be increased, then principal can be removed to form a Principal Only (PO) class and a premium fixed rate tranche. A PO pays no coupon, but receives principal payments from amortization and prepayments. For example, a $100mm sequential (SEQ) tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% coupon ('6 off 6') can be cut into an $92.307692mm SEQ tranche with a 6.5% coupon (and hence a higher dollar price) called a '6.5 off 6', and a SEQ PO tranche with a principal of $7.692308mm and paying a no coupon. The principal of the premium SEQ is calculated as (6 / 6.5) * $100mm, the principal of the PO is calculated as balance from $100mm. IO/PO pair The simplest coupon tranching is to allocate the coupon stream to an IO, and the principal stream to a PO. This is generally only done on the whole collateral without any prepayment tranching, and generates strip IOs and strip POs. In particular FNMA and FHLMC both have extensive strip IO/PO programs (aka Trusts IO/PO or SMBS) which generate very large, liquid strip IO/PO deals at regular intervals. Floater/inverse pair The construction of CMO Floaters is the most effective means of getting additional market liquidity for CMOs. CMO floaters have a coupon that moves in line with a given index (usually 1 month LIBOR) plus a spread, and is thus seen as a relatively safe investment even though the term of the security may change. One feature of CMO floaters that is somewhat unusual is that they have a coupon cap, usually set well out of the money (e.g. 8% when LIBOR is 5%) In creating a CMO floater, a CMO Inverse is generated. The CMO inverse is a more complicated instrument to hedge and analyse, and is usually sold to sophisticated investors. The construction of a floater/inverse can be seen in two stages. The first stage is to synthetically raise the effective coupon to the target floater cap, in the same way as done for the PO/Premium fixed rate pair. As an example using $100mm 6% collateral, targeting an 8% cap, we generate $25mm of PO and $75mm of '8 off 6'. The next stage is to cut up the premium coupon into a floater and inverse coupon, where the floater is a linear function of the index, with unit slope and a given offset or spread. In the example, the 8% coupon of the '8 off 6' is cut into a floater coupon of: :1 \\\\times \\\\text{LIBOR} + 0.40\\\\% (indicating a 0.40%, or 40, spread in this example) The inverse formula is simply the difference of the original premium fixed rate coupon less the floater formula. In the example: :8\\\\% - \\\\left(1\\\\times\\\\text{LIBOR} + 0.40\\\\%\\\\right) = 7.60\\\\% - 1\\\\times\\\\text{LIBOR} The floater coupon is allocated to the premium fixed rate tranche principal, in the example the $75mm '8 off 6', giving the floater tranche of '$75mm 8% cap + 40 LIBOR SEQ floater'. The floater will pay LIBOR + 0.40% each month on an original balance of $75mm, subject to a coupon cap of 8%. The inverse coupon is to be allocated to the PO principal, but has been generated of the notional principal of the premium fixed rate tranche (in the example the PO principal is $25mm but the inverse coupon is notionalized off $75mm). Therefore, the inverse coupon is 're- notionalized' to the smaller principal amount, in the example this is done by multiplying the coupon by ($75mm /$25mm) = 3. Therefore, the resulting coupon is: :3\\\\times \\\\left(7.60\\\\% - 1\\\\times\\\\text{LIBOR}\\\\right) = 22.8\\\\% - 3\\\\times\\\\text{LIBOR} In the example the inverse generated is a '$25mm 3 times levered 7.6 strike LIBOR SEQ inverse'. Other structures Other structures include Inverse IOs, TTIBs, Digital TTIBs/Superfloaters, and 'mountain' bonds. A special class of IO/POs generated in non-agency deals are WAC IOs and WAC POs, which are used to build a fixed pass through rate on a deal. Attributes of IOs and POs Interest only (IO) An interest only (IO) tranche may be carved from collateral securities to receive just the interest payments from a pool of mortgages. IO holders are only entitled to the actual amount of interest paid, as it is paid, on a pool of mortgage collateral. Since mortgages allow for prepayment, there is no assurance how much interest will actually be paid. Once all an underlying debt is paid off, that debt's future stream of interest is terminated and the IO expires with no terminal value. Therefore, IO securities are annuity-like securities but the amount and timing of payments is uncertain as payments are based on the total interest payments paid on all the underlying mortgages in the collateral pool. Generally speaking, mortgage prepayments tend to slow down as general interest rates increase. Therefore, IOs prices generally increase as interest rates increase and decrease as interest rates decrease (i.e. negative duration). If mortgage prepayments increase, or the market's expectations of future prepayments increases (i.e. higher expected PSA speed), the expected aggregate dollar amount of interest payments [and therefore the market price of the IO tranche] would generally be expected to decrease. By contrast, if mortgage prepayments decrease, or the market's expectations of future prepayments decreases (i.e. lower expected PSA speed), the expected dollar amount of interest payments [and therefore the market price of the IO tranche] would generally be expected to increase. Therefore, IOs have investor demand due to their expected negative effective duration as they can be used as a hedge against conventional fixed-income securities in a portfolio. Additionally, since investors are only buying a portion of the overall cash flows and are not entitled to any payments of principal (the PO tranche), the cost of the IO trance may be significantly lower than that of the PO tranche. While IO and PO tranches have different risk characteristics, neither the IO nor the PO represents a leveraged position in the underlying collateral pool. Principal only (PO) A principal only (PO) strip may be carved from collateral securities to receive just the principal portion of a payment. Since the IO tranche has negative duration, a PO typically has more effective duration than its collateral. One may think of this in two ways: 1. The increased effective duration must balance the matching IO's negative effective duration to equal the collateral's effective duration, or 2. Bonds with lower coupons usually have higher effective durations, and a PO has no [zero] coupon. POs have investor demand as hedges against IO-type streams (e.g. mortgage servicing rights).

The Ad Council partners with advertising agencies which work pro bono to create the public service advertisements on behalf of their campaigns. The organization accepts requests from sponsor institutions for advertising campaigns that focus on particular social issues. To qualify, an issue must be non-partisan (though not necessarily unbiased) and have national relevance. The Ad Council distributes the advertisements to a network of 33,000 media outlets‚Äîincluding broadcast, print, outdoor (i.e. billboards, bus stops), and Internet‚Äîwhich run the ads in donated time and space. Media outlets donate approximately $1.8 billion to Ad Council campaigns annually. If paid for, this amount would make the Ad Council one of the largest advertisers in the country. History The organization was conceived in 1941, and it was incorporated as The Advertising Council, Inc., on February 26, 1942, On June 25, 1943, it was renamed The War Advertising Council, Inc. for the purpose of mobilizing the advertising industry in support of the war effort. Early campaigns encouraged enlistment to the military, the purchase of war bonds, and conservation of war materials.Robert Jackall and Janice M. Hirota, The Image Makers: Advertising, Public Relations, and the Ethos of Advocacy (University of Chicago, 2000). . Paperback: . Before the conclusion of World War II President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested that the Ad Council continue its work during peacetime. On February 5, 1946, The War Advertising Council officially changed its name back to The Advertising Council, Inc., and shifted its focus to issues such as atomic weapons, world trade and religious tolerance. In 1945, the Ad Council began working with the National Safety Council. Since Roosevelt, every U.S. president has supported the Ad Council's work. In the 1950s, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and General Dwight D. Eisenhower appeared in the Ad Council's anti-communism ads. In the 1980s First Lady Nancy Reagan collaborated with the Ad Council on the ‚ÄúJust Say No‚Äù anti- drug campaign. The Ad Council's longtime logo, used from 1974 until 2018. It is still in use on many PSAs. The Ad Council's first president, Theodore Repplier, assumed leadership of the organization in 1947. Robert Keim succeeded Repplier as Ad Council president from 1966 to 1987, Ruth Wooden succeeded Keim from 1987 to 1999, and Peggy Conlon succeeded Wooden from 1999 to 2014, when the current president, Lisa Sherman, began her tenure. The Ad Council celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2012. The Ad Council released an infographic that demonstrated its impact through the years on issues including safety belts, autism, litter reduction, crime and wildfire prevention. Since 1986, the Ad Council's archive has been housed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Famous campaigns * American Capitalism was popularized in the mid-1950s as a name for the American economic system. It was endorsed by President Dwight David Eisenhower for worldwide use by the United States Information Agency, to highlight the successful aspects of the American economy worldwide during the Cold War. It depicted the United States as a society of prosperous citizens versus societies of \\"slaves\\" in the Soviet Union and China. * Savings Bond (1942‚Äì1980) The first campaign by the then War Advertising Council encouraged Americans to support the war effort by purchasing war bonds. * Security of War Information‚ÄîLoose Lips Sink Ships (1942‚Äì1945) The War Advertising Council's \\"Loose Lips Sink Ships\\" and \\"Keep It Under Your Stetson\\" public service ads reminded Americans to be discreet in their communication to prevent information from being leaked to the enemy during World War II. * Wildfire Prevention (1944‚Äìpresent) The Ad Council's longest running campaign, Smokey Bear and his tagline, \\"Only You Can Prevent Forest (now Wild as of 2001) Fires\\", was created in 1944 to educate Americans about the harm wildfires could cause the war effort, and the danger that the Japanese might deliberately start forest fires by shelling the West Coast of the United States. It was 1947 when the iconic Smokey Bear phrase was finally coined: \\"Remember...only YOU can prevent forest/wild fires!\\" The Forest Fire Prevention campaign has helped reduce the number of acres lost annually to wildfire from 22 million to 8.4 million (in 2000). Smokey Bear * American Red Cross (1945‚Äì1996) The Ad Council PSAs for the American Red Cross has recruited blood donors, enlisted volunteers, and raised funds for the Red Cross for more than 50 years. * Polio (1958‚Äì1961) PSAs for the polio vaccine helped get 80% of the at-risk populace fully immunized, eradicating the disease in the USA. * Crying Indian (1971‚Äì1983) anti-pollution campaign for Keep America Beautiful. The iconic ‚ÄúCrying Indian‚Äù ad, which featured Italian-American actor Iron Eyes Cody, first aired on Earth Day in 1971. The campaign helped reduce litter by as much as 88 percent by 1983 and won two Clio Awards. * Peace Corps (1961‚Äì1991) PSAs featuring the tagline \\"The Toughest Job You'll Ever Love\\" helped recruit thousands of volunteers to the program. In 1991, 30 percent of Peace Corps volunteers had been reached through the Ad Council's recruitment campaign. * United Negro College Fund (1972‚Äìpresent) campaign, with its slogan \\"A mind is a terrible thing to waste,\\" has helped raise more than $2.2 billion and helped to graduate more than 400,000 minority students from college or beyond. * McGruff (1979‚Äìpresent) campaign, with its slogan \\"Take a bite out of crime\\" for the National Crime Prevention Council (in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice). It was created in 1978. * Drunk Driving Prevention (1983‚Äìpresent) Intended to reduce the number of DUI accidents and alcohol- related fatalities, this campaign with the U.S. Department of Transportation has featured the taglines: \\"Drinking & Driving Can Kill A Friendship\\", \\"Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk\\" and \\"Buzzed Driving is Drunk Driving\\". * Vince and Larry, the Crash Test Dummies (1985‚Äìpresent) a campaign about safety belts. Since the introduction of this campaign, safety belt usage has increased from 14% to 79%, saving an estimated 85,000 lives, and $3.2 billion in costs to society.The Crash Test Dummies * AIDS Prevention (1988‚Äì1990) This Ad Council ad campaign was the first to use the word \\"condom\\" in America. The PSAs informed Americans of the dangers of the HIV and encouraged them to \\"Help stop AIDS. Use a condom.\\" * Domestic Violence (1994‚Äìpresent) The PSAs encourage people to get involved in efforts to prevent domestic violence and to intervene if they know someone in an abusive relationship. In the first year of the campaign, more than 34,000 calls were made to the Family Violence Prevention hotline. * I am an American (2001‚Äìpresent) a campaign launched in wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks emphasizing the diversity of America. The ad features people of many ethnicities looking in the camera and simply saying \\"I am an American\\". A slightly updated version of the ad was shown in 2011, during the 10th anniversary of the attacks. * Adoption from Foster Care (2004‚Äìpresent) This campaign delivers the message that \\"You don't have to be perfect to be a perfect parent.\\" Since the beginning of the campaign, more than 14,000 families have registered to adopt kids through the campaign Web site AdoptUSKids.org. * Autism Awareness (2006‚Äìpresent) The PSAs encourage parents to visit autismspeaks.org/signs to learn the signs of autism and to find out about early intervention. The campaign won an Effie Award for advertising effectiveness in 2008, a Silver Telly in 2009, a Silver Addy and Gold Ogilvy in 2011. * Gay and Lesbian Bullying Prevention (2008‚Äìpresent) GLSEN and Ad Council launched the first campaign to address anti-gay language among teens. PSAs feature celebrities such as Wanda Sykes, Grant Hill and Hilary Duff and ask kids to stop using homophobic language such as \\"That's so gay.\\" * Love Has No Labels (2015‚Äìpresent) focused on diversity and inclusion, the campaign's video was among the 10 most watched videos on YouTube in 2015. The commercial for the campaign won the award for Best Commercial during at the 2016 Emmy Awards. * Fatherhood Involvement (2008‚Äìpresent) PSAs featuring the tagline \\"Take time to be a dad today\\" encourage fathers to play an active role in their children's lives. The campaign's ‚ÄúCheerleader‚Äù PSA is one of the Ad Council's most popular PSAs and has earned $9.7 million in donated media since 2008. * FWD campaign with USAID (2011‚Äìpresent) In September 2011, Ad Council and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the FWD campaign to spread awareness about famine, war and drought in the Horn of Africa. The initiative garnered the participation of celebrities like Uma Thurman, Geena Davis, Josh Hartnett, Chanel Iman and Anthony Bourdain who starred in Public Service Announcements that asked the public to \\"forward the facts\\" about the crisis. The \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster was used by the Ad Council for its 70th anniversary celebration, through a Facebook app called \\"Rosify Yourself\\". However, the historic image was not produced by the War Advertising Council. The Ad Council claimed the 1943 \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster (associated with Rosie the Riveter after 1982) was developed by the WAC as part of its \\"Women in War Jobs\\" campaign. In February 2012 during the Ad Council's 70th anniversary celebration, an interactive application designed by Animax's HelpsGood digital agency was linked to the Ad Council's Facebook page. The Facebook app was called \\"Rosify Yourself\\" and it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster, then saved to be shared with friends. Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own \\"Rosified\\" face on The Huffington Post in an article about the Ad Council's past 70 years of public service. The staff of the TV show Today posted two \\"Rosified\\" images on their Web site, using the faces of news anchors Matt Lauer and Ann Curry. However, the now-famous poster was actually produced by an internal Westinghouse Electric Corporation corporate program as part of a series of posters shown to Westinghouse employees for two weeks then discarded. It was not produced by the Ad Council nor was it used for recruiting women workers. Also available through Highbeam.

Examples include a partnership with Warner Bros. featuring characters from Where the Wild Things Are in PSAs to counteract childhood obesity, Retrieved 2013-09-02. PSAs for child passenger safety featuring clips from Warner Bros.

Several 20th Century Studios films also appears in partnership, such as Alvin and the Chipmunks and Ice Age. Universal Studios films are also in partnership, such as The Lorax and Curious George. Criticism Radio show host/comedian Adam Carolla took umbrage with the Ad Council on his former radio programs The Adam Carolla Show and Loveline, stating that the announcements provide little value, and that the topics they choose to provide statements on are not real issues that affect Americans, such as airplane turbulence, or are issues that an ad on public radio could not possibly do anything about, such as housing discrimination. Furthermore, Carolla has stated that this valuable time taken up could be used to enlighten Americans on topics such as teen pregnancy and options, or illiteracy, topics that have a much more significant impact on society.The Adam Carolla Show, 7-17-2007 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfoD1HujJqY Given the Ad Council's historically close collaboration with the President of the United States and the federal government, it has been labeled by historian Robert Griffith as \\"little more than a domestic propaganda arm of the federal government.\\" The Ad Council has been further criticized for distracting the public by focusing on individual lifestyle changes, rather than on the need to fix social problems by changing institutions, such as the Ad Council's many corporate sponsors, or the government and military, whose campaigns the Ad Council has also promoted. Ad Council spots are used to fill unsold air time by stations and networks. Political talk shows often have advertising time either controlled by the local station or a program's syndicating network that goes unsold; this is often filled by promotions for other programming on a station, short segments, and public service announcements, including from the Ad Council. Activists unfamiliar with the ad model of these programs or that of the Ad Council often complain to the Ad Council itself, along with the organizations which coordinate their messages with the Ad Council such as the AARP, leading the Ad Council and the organizations to disclaim they do not share the views of the hosts where their announcements air, and have little to no control about where they may be scheduled to air.

Widely known as the oldest newspaper in the state, it began publication as the Florida Union in 1864. Its current incarnation started in 1883, when the Florida Union merged with another Jacksonville paper, the Florida Daily Times. A Southeast Georgia edition, called The Georgia Times- Union, serves the Brunswick area. In 1983, Morris Communications of Augusta, Georgia, purchased Florida Publishing Company. The Times-Union became the largest newspaper of this chain, which owns a number of newspapers around the country. In 2018, its editor was Mary Kelli Palka, and the editorial page editor was Michael P. Clark. History In 1864, during the American Civil War, J. K. Stickney and W. C. Morrill published the first edition of the Florida Union. It was a Northern and Republican paper, at the time when Jacksonville was occupied by the Union Army. By 1867, Stickney sold the Florida Union to Edward M. Cheney, of Boston. Cheney tried to make the paper into a daily publication but lacked the needed money. The Union was sold to Walton, Fowle & Co. in 1873. Stockholder C. F. Mawbey assumed control and turned the Union into a daily publication. Cheney returned to the Union as an editor. In 1876, the Union was in decline and abandoned daily publication. Financially doomed, it was sold to H. B. McCallum, who then returned it to daily publication and converted it from an afternoon to a morning paper. Charles H. Jones wanted to buy the Union but was refused by McCallum. Annoyed, Jones started a rival paper, the Florida Daily Times, in November 1881. By 1883, the Daily Times was dominating the Union. McCallum became ill and finally decided to sell the paper to the Daily Times. The Union then combined with the Daily Times to form The Florida Times-Union, whose first edition was published on February 4, 1883. The Daily Times was reporting on election related violence in 1882.https://books.google.com/books?id=GAJSAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA701&dq;=independent+party+florida+frank+pope&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiw5r32o4DsAhUH7awKHYo_DPQQ6AEwAnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q;=independent%20party%20florida%20frank%20pope&f;=false On February 11, 2018, The Florida Times-Union printed its last papers in Jacksonville after 154 years. The Florida Times-Union newspapers are now printed at The Gainesville Sun and The Daytona Beach News-Journal, which are both owned by Gatehouse Media. On April 1, 2019, The Florida Times-Union moved to the Wells Fargo building at 1 Independent Drive, Suite 200 in downtown Jacksonville.

Ownership For most of the 20th century, The Florida Times-Union was owned by the Florida Publishing Company, which was in turn jointly owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, the Florida East Coast Railway, and the Seaboard Air Line Railway, the three main railroads serving Jacksonville, having been acquired in equal shares by them or their corporate predecessors about 1896. The Coast Line and the Seaboard merged in 1967 and were predecessors of CSX Transportation; the Florida East Coast has maintained its corporate identity into the 21st century.

Later that year, boys were admitted and it changed its name for the first time, to New Jersey Classical and Scientific Institute. In 1872, it became the Peddie Institute in honor of philanthropist and politician Thomas B. Peddie, who gave the school $25,000 ($500,000 in 2015 dollars). In 1923 the school was formally renamed The Peddie School, which is as it remained until 2005 when the school was renamed Peddie School and the present logo was created.History, The Peddie School. Accessed October 10, 2019. Peddie remained coeducational until 1908, when, for social and economic reasons, it decided to admit boys only. This was reversed in the early 1970s, and girls were readmitted. Today, the school is coeducational and non-denominational. In 1993, former Ambassador Walter Annenberg (Class of 1927) gave $100 million to Peddie, the largest donation ever made to a U.S. secondary school at the time.\\"Publisher Gives $365 Million To 4 Schools\\", The New York Times, June 20, 1993.

This endowment was not earmarked for new buildings, but for financial aid. The endowment has enabled students from all backgrounds to pursue a course of study that would have been unattainable otherwise.

S-30 was laid down on 1 April 1918 by the Union Iron Works at San Francisco, California. She was launched on 21 November 1918 sponsored by Mrs. Edward S. Stalnaker, and commissioned on 29 October 1920 with Lieutenant Commander Stuart E. Bray in command. Service history Based at San Pedro, California, with her home yard at Mare Island, S-30 conducted tests and exercises off the California coast into the summer of 1921. Then, on 15 August, she was placed in ordinary. Recommissioned in full on 14 February 1922, she was ordered to New London, Connecticut, where she was placed in ordinary again on 21 June for engine alterations by the prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company. Trials and exercises off the southern New England coast followed her recommissioning in full on 21 November; and, in January 1923, she moved south to the Caribbean Sea to participate in winter maneuvers and Fleet Problem I, conducted to test the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone. In April, she returned to California and resumed operations off that coast with her division, Submarine Division (SubDiv) 16. During the winter of 1924, she again participated in fleet exercises and problems in the Canal Zone and in the Caribbean and, in the winter of 1925, she prepared for transfer to the Asiatic Fleet. S-30 departed Mare Island, with her division, in mid-April. During May, she conducted exercises and underwent upkeep in the Hawaiian Islands; and, on 16 June, she continued on to the Philippines. On 12 July, she arrived at the Submarine Base, Cavite, Luzon, whence she operated until 1932. Her division rotated between exercises and patrols in the Philippines during the winter and operations off the China coast during the summer. In 1932, her division was ordered back to the eastern Pacific Ocean; and, on 2 May, she departed Manila for Pearl Harbor, her home port until transferred back to the East Coast in 1937. Sailing from Pearl Harbor on 19 May 1937, S-30 arrived at New London on 8 August. For the next year and one-half, she trained along the Atlantic Ocean seaboard. Then, in May 1939, she was placed in commission, in reserve. On 1 September 1940, she was returned to full commission.  World War II  As World War II began its second year, German U-boats were raiding shipping in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean. The American S-boats, designed in World War I, were assigned to Submarines, Patrol Force (Submarines, Atlantic Fleet after February 1941) and were carrying out multipurpose missions which involved training and development of tactical skills.  First, Second, and Third (Defensive) War Patrols  S-30, homeported at New London, operated along the mid-Atlantic and northeast coasts into the spring of 1941. She then served briefly in the Bermuda area; returned to New London; and, in early July, 1942, proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for overhaul. In September, she emerged from the yard; returned to New England; and resumed submarine and antisubmarine warfare training operations. She continued those duties in the Long Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, Casco Bay, and Placentia Bay areas, until after the United States officially entered the war. With 1942, however defensive patrols were added to her duties, and her division, SubDiv 52, was reassigned to the Panama Canal Zone. Departing New London on 31 January, she hunted for enemy submarines along her route which took her via Bermuda and Mona Passage into the Caribbean Sea. On 16 February, she arrived at Coco Solo, whence she conducted two defensive patrols in the western approaches to the canal, from 10-31 March and from 14 April to 13 May, before she was ordered to California to prepare for service in the Aleutian Islands. Into July, she underwent repairs at San Diego, California; and, at mid-month, she started for Alaska. While en route, engine trouble forced her into Mare Island, and, on 1 August, she headed north again.  Fourth War Patrol (First Offensive)  On 12 August, 1942, S-30 departed the submarine base at Dutch Harbor, Unalaska, on her first offensive war patrol. Moving through fog, she arrived off Attu Island on 16 August; sighted only the hazy outline of Cape Wrangell; and continued on to patrol across the anticipated Japanese shipping lanes between that island and the northern Kuril Islands. On the afternoon of 7 September, she was attacked by three enemy destroyers some ten miles north of the cape and, in that two and one-half hour encounter, gained her first close experience with Japanese depth charges. Three days later, she turned for home.  Fifth War Patrol  On 24 September, S-30 got underway for her fifth war patrol, her second in the Aleutians. A cracked cylinder in her port engine forced her back to Dutch Harbor on 27 September; and, on 30 September, she again moved west. On 3 October, she entered her patrol area and commenced hunting enemy ships along traffic lanes west of Kiska; but, by 9 October, additional engineering casualties, cracks, and leaks had developed and forced her to return to Unalaska. From there, the submarine was ordered to San Diego for an overhaul. During her yard period, she received a fathometer, a new distilling unit, and more up-to-date radar equipment. Then, from mid- February 1943 into March, she provided training services to the West Coast Sound School. On 16 March, she sailed for Dutch Harbor.  Sixth War Patrol  Following the submarine's arrival in the Aleutians on 21 March, 1943, air compressor failure and malfunctioning of her fathometer delayed her departure until 13 April. She then headed for Attu. On 15 April, she crossed the 180th meridian and, keeping Dutch Harbor dates, arrived at her destination on 17 April. For the next few days, she reconnoitered and, when possible photographed the island's principal coves, bays, and harbors. On 26 April, she was ordered to the east of 176¬∞E and south of 52¬∞40'N, where she remained until after an Allied strike against Attu. The next afternoon, she returned to the island but was unable to determine the extent of damage inflicted.  Seventh War Patrol  On 2 May, 1943, S-30 departed the area; returned to Dutch Harbor for refit; and, on 24 May, sailed west again, this time for the northern Kurils. On 31 May (Dutch Harbor date), she entered her assigned area; and, on 5 June, off the Kamchatka peninsula, she attacked her first target, a large sampan. Her guns set the enemy vessel on fire; but, as it burned, a Japanese destroyer appeared on the horizon and began closing the surfaced submarine at high speed. Three minutes later, the destroyer opened fire on the diving S-boat. S-30 commenced an approach on the destroyer, but just as she reached firing bearing, she lost depth control. A few seconds later, depth charging started. In the next 20 minutes, 33 depth charges were dropped by the destroyer. Others followed sporadically over the next five hours. S-30 was then able to clear the area. On 6 June, the ship's crew repaired all minor damage and commenced efforts to remove two torpedoes which had been crushed in the number-three and number-four tubes. The one in the latter tube was removed on 7 June, but the one in the number-three tube remained until the completion of the patrol. On 8 June, S-30 headed down the Paramushiro coast; approached Onekotan; then transited Onekotan Strait and set a course for Araito. During the next two days, she sighted four targets but was able to close only the last two, merchantmen in column, contacted on 10 June (the 11th local date). Fog closed in rapidly as she made her approach; then blanketed the area as she launched three torpedoes. Two explosions were heard, but nothing could be seen. Post-war examination of Japanese records revealed that she had sunk Jinbu Maru, a 5228-ton cargo ship. During the ensuing depth charging, S-30 began to move out of the area. Within two and one-half hours, she had left the pinging of the searchers behind and had resumed her own hunting. On 12 June, she retransited Onekotan Strait. The following day, she fired on a convoy, but missed. On 14 June, she departed the area; and, on 22 June, she returned to Dutch Harbor to begin extracting the damaged torpedo and commence refitting.  Eighth War Patrol  On 5 July, 1943, S-30 got underway on her eighth war patrol, which took her back to the Kurils and into the Sea of Okhotsk. She patrolled on both sides of the island chain and across the traffic lanes leading to Soya Strait and to Yokosuka. She took periscope pictures of facilities on various islands. She sighted several targets, but was unable to close on most and was unsuccessful on those she attacked. On 20 July, she attacked what appeared to be an inter-island steamer, but which turned straight down the torpedo track and dropped six depth charges in quick succession. S-30 went deep, reloaded and prepared to reattack. The target, however, was lost in the fog. S-30 continued her patrol. A week later, she sent three torpedoes against a Japanese merchantman estimated at 7000 tons. Two hits, breaking-up noises, and distant depth charging were reported by the sound operator, but the damage went unverified. Four days later, she attacked another cargoman under similar circumstances. One torpedo was reported to have hit. Screw noises from the target stopped, breaking-up noises were heard, and periscope observation showed no ship at the site of the attack. But any damage which might have been inflicted was never verified.  Ninth War Patrol  S-30 left the Kurils behind and headed east on 7 August, 1943. Two days later, she arrived in Massacre Bay, Attu, whence she conducted her last war patrol. On that patrol, from 26 August to 23 September, she again hunted in the shipping lanes along the eastern and western sides of the Kurils. Again, several targets were lost in fog; nevertheless, she took pictures of the islands. Then, in mid-September, she added a new dimension to her activities and attempted to shell the enemy garrison on Matsuwa. Fog had interfered with an earlier attempt to bombard that post, but cleared off early on the morning of 15 September (local date) as she neared the firing point with her crew at battle stations. But, when the order to fire was given, the gun failed to respond. A new firing pin was a fraction of an inch too short, and the effort had to be abandoned.  Retirement  The following day, S-30 was ordered home. En route, on 17 September, 1943, she was sighted and bombed by a Japanese patrol plane. Failure of the port motor at that moment caused anxiety; but the submarine escaped serious damage. On 23 September, she arrived at Dutch Harbor. Within the week, she headed south to San Diego, where, with others of her class, she provided training services for the West Coast Sound School for the remainder of World War II. In mid-September 1945, she proceeded to Mare Island, where she was decommissioned on 9 October. Fifteen days later, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and, in December 1946, she was sold and delivered to the Salco Iron and Metal Company, San Francisco, for scrapping. S-30 was awarded two battle stars for her World War II service.

Plot Paul Linden (David Farrar), a wealthy and prominent architect, returns home to Marylebone, London. He brings his new wife: beautiful, French, 24-year-old Nichole (Noelle Adam), whom he has just married in Paris. Paul is anxious to introduce Nichole to his teenage daughter Jennifer (Gillian Hills), but Jennifer appears less than happy about her father's remarriage and coldly rejects Nichole's friendly overtures all evening. After Paul and Nichole go to bed, Jennifer sneaks out to the Off-Beat caf√© in Soho for an evening of rock music and dancing with her friends, including Dave (Adam Faith), a youth from a working-class background who plays guitar and writes songs; Tony (Peter McEnery), a general's son whose mother was killed in the Blitz and who has a drinking problem (although beatniks frown on alcohol); and Dodo (Shirley Anne Field), Tony's well-bred girlfriend. Dave and Jennifer are attracted to each other. The next day Nichole plans to meet Jennifer at Saint Martin's School of Art, where she is studying, so they can have lunch together. At lunchtime, Nichole arrives at St Martin's, but is told that Jennifer has left and gone to the Off-Beat. Nichole goes to the caf√© and confronts Jennifer in front of her friends, who are impressed by Nichole's youth, good looks, and knowledge of modern jazz. The fact that her friends, especially Dave, seem to like Nichole upsets Jennifer. Nichole leaves, reminding Jennifer to be home for her father's important business dinner that night. As Nichole leaves, she passes Greta (Delphi Lawrence), the star performer at the strip club across the street. Greta recognises Nichole and greets her by name, but Nichole ignores her, to Greta's annoyance. Jennifer and her friends see this encounter and wonder how Greta and Nichole might know each other. Jennifer suspects that Nichole was also a stripper before meeting her father. That night at Paul's business dinner, Jennifer tries to embarrass Nichole in front of the guests by bringing up the encounter with Greta, making sure to emphasise that Greta is a stripper. After the guests leave, Paul questions Nichole, who says that she knew Greta in Paris and that they were in ballet together but Greta pursued a different way of life and Nichole lost track of her. Paul accepts her explanation, but Jennifer goes to the strip club to ask Greta directly. Greta at first claims she made a mistake and doesn't really know Nichole, but under pressure from her boyfriend, strip club manager Kenny King (Christopher Lee), she reveals that she and Nichole worked together as strippers and occasional prostitutes in Paris. Jennifer, encouraged by Kenny, becomes enamoured with the idea of becoming a stripper herself. Jennifer is caught by Paul and Nichole coming home from the strip club at 3 am and an angry confrontation results. Jennifer taunts Nichole by telling her she has spoken with Greta and threatens that if Nichole doesn't stay out of her life, Jennifer will tell Paul about Nichole's background. Nichole visits the strip club to tell Kenny and Greta to stay away from her stepdaughter, but Kenny says that Jennifer will be welcome at the club any time and that if Nichole interferes he will tell Paul about her past. Jennifer and her friends have a wild night including dancing at Chislehurst Caves, a dangerous car race, and a game of \\"chicken\\" on railway tracks where the last person to leave the rails before the train arrives (Jennifer) wins. Throughout the evening, Jennifer and Dave dare each other to increasingly dangerous behaviours as a way of flirting. Jennifer invites everyone to continue the party at her house, as her father is out of town and Nichole presumably won't interfere for fear Jennifer will reveal her past. Jennifer accepts a dare to \\"strip like a Frenchie\\" and begins a striptease to music, but when she gets down to her underwear Nichole bursts from her bedroom and stops her. Then Paul suddenly arrives home and breaks up the party, throwing all of the beatniks out of his house including Dave. Jennifer angrily tells her father about Nichole's activities in Paris. Nichole, crying, admits it is true and explains she only did it because she was broke and hungry. Paul and Nichole profess their love for each other and reconcile. Jennifer goes to the caf√©, but now finds it boring. She walks out on her friends and meets Kenny across the street at the strip club. Kenny invites her to go to Paris with him and have him train her to be a star stripper. Greta, performing onstage, is told by stage manager Simon (Nigel Green) that Kenny plans to leave her and go off with Jennifer. Just as Kenny makes a pass at Jennifer, a woman's hand is shown stabbing Kenny to death with a letter opener. The club staff, thinking Jennifer killed Kenny, lock her up and call the police. Jennifer screams that she didn't do it, and the real culprit, jealous Greta, emerges from behind a curtain. Meanwhile, Dave, Tony and Dodo confront some Teddy Boys who vandalise Tony's car and smash his guitar. Paul and Nichole arrive on the scene searching for Jennifer just as the police drag her, in hysterics, out of the strip club. The police release Jennifer to Paul and Nichole, and they head for home, arms around each other, as Dave throws his broken guitar in a rubbish bin and proclaims \\"Funny, only squares know where to go.\\" Cast *David Farrar as Paul Linden *No√´lle Adam as Nichole *Gillian Hills as Jennifer Linden *Adam Faith as Dave *Peter McEnery as Tony *Shirley Anne Field as Dodo *Christopher Lee as Kenny King *Delphi Lawrence as Greta *Nigel Green as Simon *Margot Bryant as Martha *Oliver Reed as Plaid Shirt (Beat youth) *Michael Kayne as Duffle Coat (Beat youth) *Claire Gordon as Honey *Robert Raglan as F.O. official *Nade Beall as Official's Wife *Norman Mitchell as Club doorman *Pascaline as strip dancer with scarf *Diane D'Orsay (Moyle) as strip dancer in white n√©glig√©e Production notes When the original script, entitled \\"Striptease Girl,\\" was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors in March 1959, the reviewer termed it \\"machine-made dirt\\" and \\"the worst script I have read for some years\\". The project was then renamed \\"Beat Girl\\" and nudity was reduced, but censors still objected to scenes of strip tease, juvenile delinquency, and teenagers playing \\"chicken\\" by lying on railway tracks in front of an oncoming train. Ultimately, the film received an \\"X\\" certificate, causing its release to be delayed because it was queued behind a glut of other X-rated films.Fiegel, p. 72. When finally released it performed reasonably well at the box office in UK, despite receiving bad reviews. The movie was filmed at MGM- British Studios at Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, UK, with exteriors filmed in Soho and Chislehurst Caves (located in Kent). After Adam Faith was cast, John Barry was asked to compose the film soundtrack, because he had already been collaborating with Faith as an arranger. Barry was subsequently hired to score Faith's next films, Never Let Go and Mix Me a Person, leading to Barry's successful career as a composer and arranger of film music. In addition to the Beat Girl soundtrack LP reaching number 11 in the album charts, the song \\"Made You,\\" composed by John Barry and Trevor Peacock and performed in the film by Faith, achieved minor hit status before being banned by the BBC for suggestive lyrics.Fiegel, p. 72-73.

Fifth Third Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Fifth Third Bank branch in Springboro, Ohio. Fifth Third Bank branch in Xenia, Ohio. Fifth Third Bank (5/3 Bank) is a bank headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, at Fifth Third Center. It is the principal subsidiary of Fifth Third Bancorp, a diversified bank holding company. One of the largest consumer banks in the Midwestern United States, it operates 1,154 branches and 2,469 automated teller machines in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina. Fifth Third Bank is incorporated in Ohio. It was state-chartered until late 2019, when it obtained a national charter. The name \\"Fifth Third\\" is derived from the names of the bank's two predecessor companies, Third National Bank and Fifth National Bank, which merged in 1909. The company is ranked 384th on the Fortune 500. It is on the list of largest banks in the United States. History On June 17, 1858, the Bank of the Ohio Valley opened in Cincinnati. On June 23, 1863, the Third National Bank was organized. On April 29, 1871, Third National Bank came into possession of Bank of the Ohio Valley and by 1882 the bank's capital was around $16 million, considered to be the largest bank capital in the state at the time. In 1888, Queen City National Bank changed its name to Fifth National Bank. On June 1, 1908, Third National Bank and Fifth National Bank merged to become the Fifth-Third National Bank of Cincinnati; the hyphen was later dropped. The merger took place when prohibitionist ideas were gaining popularity, and it is legend that \\"Fifth Third\\" was better than \\"Third Fifth\\", which could have been construed as a reference to three fifths of alcohol. The name went through several changes until March 24, 1969, when it was changed to Fifth Third Bank. In November 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $3.4 billion in the company as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and in February 2011, the company repurchased the investment from the Treasury. 2018 shooting incident On September 6, 2018, a gunman named Omar Enrique Santa-Perez entered the lobby area of the company headquarters in downtown Cincinnati, shooting and killing three people and wounding two others before being shot and killed by the Cincinnati Police. Controversies 2014 discrimination settlement In August 2014, the company settled with the United States Department of Justice, resolving allegations that the bank engaged in a pattern of discrimination on the basis of disability and receipt of public assistance, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

The site of the ancient Armenian capital of Tigranocerta, according to modern scholars, in Late Antiquity it was the capital of the district of Arzanene, a Syriac bishopric and a Sasanian Persian border fortress in the Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars of the period. After the Muslim conquests, it briefly became the seat of an autonomous dynasty of emirs in the 9th century, before being devastated in the wars between the Byzantine Empire and the Hamdanids in the 10th century. By the 12th century, it had been abandoned and ruined. Today, few traces of the town survive. Antiquity The origin of the name Arzƒïn (reflecting the Armenian pronunciation) is unknown, but non-Armenian. Its site, on the banks of the river Garzan Su (ancient Nicephorius) in southeastern Turkey, was visited and identified in the early 1860s by John George Taylor, then British consul in Diyarbakir, who sketched its outline in his Travels in Kurdistan (Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Vol. 35, 1865). In 1995‚Äì96 (The site of Tigranocerta, in Revue des √âtudes Arm√©niennes, Vol. 25, pp. 183‚Äì254 & Vol. 26, pp. 51‚Äì118), T. A. Sinclair identified Arzen with the site of Tigranocerta, the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia founded by Tigranes the Great, instead of previously current identifications with Martyropolis or Kƒ±zƒ±ltepe. In Classical Antiquity, Arzen was the chief city and capital of the district of Arzanene. Under the Kingdom of Armenia, Arzanene was governed by a march- warden (bdea≈°x). In the peace of 297, the city along with the rest of the district of Arzanene, and the neighbouring districts of Sophene, Ingilene, Zabdicene and Corduene was ceded to the Roman Empire by the Sasanian emperor Narseh, but returned to Sasanian control in 363. The office of bdea≈°x apparently continued to be filled, as a holder named Hormizd is mentioned by Procopius in 528 leading a Sasanian army. The city is attested as a bishopric of the Syriac Church for the first time , as a suffragan of Nisibis. In the 5th and 6th centuries it was a bastion of the Sasanians in their recurrent wars with the Byzantine Empire. Its strategic importance derived from its location on the route from Amida in Upper Mesopotamia via Lake Van to the Armenian Highlands and the Armenian capitals of Artaxata and Dvin. In 578, according to Theophylact Simocatta, 10,000 people from the district were forcibly resettled by the Byzantines to Cyprus. Middle Ages The city surrendered to Iyad ibn Ghanm in 640, during the first wave of the Muslim conquests. Arab geographers included the city in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), specifically in the district of Diyar Bakr, and often referred to it together with nearby Mayyafariqin. The region was fertile and wealthy: according to Qudama ibn Ja'far, the combined revenue of Mayyafariqin and Arzen in Abbasid times amounted to 4.1 million dirhams. Unlike the Armenian regions further north, which eventually formed part of a restored Armenian kingdom in the 9th century, Arzen and other towns on the southern periphery were quickly Arabized, and their population became indistinguishable from the inhabitants of Upper Mesopotamia or Syria. The Banu Shayban tribe, a branch of the Banu Bakr, settled in the wider area and dominated the Diyar Bakr politically until the late 9th century. Zurarid emirate of Arzen Arzen itself came to be ruled by a local Muslim dynasty, the Zurarids, which probably also descended from the Banu Bakr but whose exact origin, relationship to the Shaybanids, and early history are unknown. The first attested member of the dynasty is Musa ibn Zurara in the mid-9th century. The Zurarids intermingled with their Armenian Christian neighbours: Musa married the sister of Bagrat II Bagratuni, while his son Abu'l-Maghra married an Artsruni princess. As a result, the Zurarids tended to side with their Christian neighbours during the 9th century. Indeed, during the Armenian revolt in the early 850s, the emir Musa joined the uprising due to his opposition to the Abbasid governor Yusuf ibn Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Marwazi, and was one of the Armenian princes carried into captivity in the Abbasid capital Samarra by the Abbasid general Bugha al- Kabir. Threatened by his Shaybanid neighbours, Abu'l-Maghra, a half-Armenian married to an Armenian, even went as far as to secretly convert to Christianity, and join his forces to those of his Artsruni relatives, but in he was taken prisoner by the ambitious Shaybanid ruler of Diyar Bakr, Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani, who annexed the Zurarid domains. Later history and abandonment Faced with the Byzantine Empire's expansion under John Kourkouas in the 930s, Arzen came under Hamdanid control. A Hamdanid lieutenant, Ali ibn Ja'far al-Daylami, was appointed its governor, but rebelled against the Hamdanid emir Nasir al-Dawla in 936. The latter sent his brother, Sayf al-Dawla, to defeat the rebel and assume the governorship of the entire Diyar Bakr. During the next decades, Sayf al-Dawla would use the town as a base for his operations against the Armenian principalities to the north or the Byzantines to the west. In the course of these conflicts, the Byzantines sacked Arzen in 942. The Hamdanids soon retook it, but the area remained contested after that. During this period, the Kurds first appeared and settled in the area, quickly supplanting the Arab element. The town declined in importance from the mid-10th century on, so that the 12th/13th- century geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi reported that it was deserted and in ruins. Apart from Taylor's sketches, little survives of the town today, as the area has been given over to agriculture.

The name derives \\"from a map of the coastline made in 1525 by the Spanish explorer Esteban G√≥mez. He named the bay Bahio de Saco (Bay of the Sack).\\" Saco Bay is approximately 10 mi (16 km) wide, running from the Fletcher Neck (the Biddeford Pool peninsula) and the mouth of the Saco River in York County north to the Scarborough River and Prouts Neck in Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine, approximately 13 mi (19 km) southwest of Portland. The shoreline of the bay makes the largest sand beach and salt marsh system in Maine and contains the longest unbroken stretch of beach in the state. Ecosystem Construction of a railroad causeway in the 19th century led to the closure of the Little River Inlet. This tidal re-entrant had formed the county line between York and Cumberland counties and the town line between Scarborough and Old Orchard Beach. Prior to its closure, the Pine Point region of Scarborough was a barrier island, the only one in Maine. Behind Pine Point is the state run wildlife management area for Scarborough Marsh. The marsh is 15% of the state's total tidal marsh area and the largest contiguous marsh in Maine. The state owns and manages a reserve, of which is salt marsh, about is upland habitats, with the remainder being other types of wetlands. The marsh is an excellent site for birding as 72% of the water dependent birds that can be found in Maine can be found at the marsh. The marsh is located within of two nationally significant seabird nesting islands. The marsh has been designated essential habitat for endangered piping plovers and least terns. The Maine Audubon Society maintains a center at the marsh from which visitors can do hikes or rent a canoe and paddle through the marsh. The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has designated Saco Bay as \\"essential fish habitat\\" for at least fifteen types of fish, including Atlantic salmon, hake, halibut, herring, and scallops. Stratton Island in the bay is a wildlife sanctuary owned and run by the National Audubon Society where multiple species of terns nest. Arctic, common, and roseate terns have been regulars, and in 2005 they were joined for the first time by nesting least terns. Sand movement and erosion The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) initially thought that the beach sand was coming from an underwater glacial deposit. Thus when in 1866 they were called in to protect the navigable channel of the Saco river they built rock jettys on the both sides of the mouth of the Saco river to protect the channel from sand. The north jetty was extended in 1897, 1930 and 1938, and raised at various dates through 1969. The primary source of sediment for the beaches is the Saco river. Longshore drift is dominantly to the north along the shore. About 1960 another jetty was built on the south (Pine Point) side of the mouth of the Scarborough River to protect it from sand. It was not until 1992 that the USACOE acknowledged that there is no source of sand nourishment in the area. Thus, erosion is worst at Camp Ellis in Saco at the south end of the system where the Saco jetty prevents sand from coming ashore naturally while Pine Point is growing both from the sand coming out of the Saco river and from sand eroding from Camp Ellis and other parts of the bay to its south. Much of the inner shore of the bay is within the town of Old Orchard Beach, Maine's largest resort beach community. The geology of the larger Gulf of Maine means that warm waters coming up the Atlantic Coast are kept far offshore, while the inshore waters are flowing from the north to the south, fed by the Labrador Current that originates from the glaciers of Greenland, making most Maine coastal waters very cold, especially to the east. The combination of Saco Bay's western location, the inland waters of the Saco river, and the bay's local flow from the south to the north make it the warmest water for swimming in Maine, although summer water temperatures regularly dip into the 50s (Fahrenheit). History The bay was mapped again in 1605 by the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, who named it the Baie de Chouacou√´t. (The Jesuit Relations spell it \\"Chouacoet\\".) His chart of the bay and the mouth of the river has been described as one of his best charts., which cites In 1616, Sir Ferdinando Gorges sent Richard Vines to settle in New England. He spent the winter of 1616‚Äì1617 on Saco Bay. A pestilence was raging among the Indians, and as Vines was a physician he attended to sick Indians in the area. In 1630 the Plymouth Company gave Richard Vines and John Oldham each a tract of land on the Saco River, four miles (6 km) wide on the sea and extending eight miles (13 km) inland. Winslow Homer painting Saco Bay or Sunset, Saco Bay is a painting by Winslow Homer, showing a view of the bay from Checkley Point on the southwestern side of Prouts Neck. According to Winslow he worked on it for about 10 years, finishing only 3 days before shipping it for exhibition. It was first exhibited in 1897 at the Society of American Artists in New York City. The painting is now at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute.

It started operations in 1999 to study the cosmic microwave background radiation and ran until 2008. CBI conducted measurements at frequencies between 26 and 36 GHz in ten bands of 1 GHz bandwidth. It had a resolution of better than 1/10 of a degree. (In comparison, the pioneering COBE satellite, which produced the first detection of fluctuations in the microwave background in 1992, had a resolution of about 7 degrees.) Among the key findings of the CBI is the fact that fluctuations which have a small size on the sky are weaker than fluctuations which have a large size on the sky, which confirmed earlier theoretical predictions. More technically, CBI was the first experiment to detect intrinsic anisotropy in the microwave background on mass scales of galaxy clusters; it provided the first detection of the Silk damping tail; it found a hint of excess power at high-l multipoles (CBI-excess) than expected from the ŒõCDM model; and it detected fluctuations in the polarization of the microwave background obtaining the first detailed E-mode polarization spectrum providing evidence that it is out of phase with the total intensity mode spectrum. The CBI was built at the California Institute of Technology, and employed sensitive radio amplifiers from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory; two similar experiments are the Very Small Array, operated on the island of Tenerife, and the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer, operated in Antarctica. Both of these experiments used radio interferometry to measure CMB fluctuations at lower resolution over larger areas of the sky. Another experiment operated from Antarctica, the Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver, used total power (bolometric) detection and a single antenna at higher frequency and similar angular resolution to obtain results comparable to the CBI. The confluence of these and other CMB experiments employing different measurement techniques in recent years is a great triumph of observational cosmology. CBI was a collaboration among a number of institutions in the US and Europe. It still closely collaborates with Chilean institutions Universidad de Chile and Universidad de Concepci√≥n through the Chajnantor Observatory. In 2006, new 1.4 m antennas replaced the old 0.9 m dishes for more high-resolution studies in total intensity mode. During this stage, CBI was called CBI-2. In June 2008, CBI-2 stopped the observations and the 13-antenna instrument was removed from its mount. The new QUIET telescope instrument was installed in August 2008 on the CBI mount, replacing CBI-2 .

The fruit is usually red, but one species has yellow berries. The berries have a bitter taste. The species is widespread in all of Canada, except in Prince Edward Island, and in the western and northern United States, including AlaskaBiota of North America Program 2014 state-level distribution map and Idaho.

Harvest and consumption  Some Canadian First Nations peoples such as Nlaka'pamux (Thompson), St'at'imc (Lillooet), and Secwepemc (Shuswap) in the Province of British Columbia extensively collect the berries. The bitter berries are not directly consumed but rather processed as \\"sxusem\\", also spelled \\"sxushem\\" and \\"xoosum\\" or \\"hooshum\\" (\\"Indian ice cream\\"). Collection involves placing a mat or tarpaulin below the bushes, hitting the branches, collecting the very ripe fruits, mixing with other sweet fruit such as raspberries, crushing the mixture, and then beating of the mixture to raise the foam characteristic of the dish. The berry is both sweet and bitter, and is possibly comparable to the taste of sweetened coffee. The First Nations peoples who prepare it believe that the dish has many healthful properties, but the saponin chemicals which create the foam may cause gastrointestinal irritation if large quantities are consumed. Native themed restaurants in British Columbia have occasionally offered sxusem on their menus in recent years. Unrelated plants in the genus Sapindus produce very toxic saponins and are also commonly denominated \\"soapberry\\" along with the edible Canada buffaloberry.  Etymology of \\"soopolallie\\"  The common name of the plant in British Columbia is \\"soopolallie\\", a word derived from the historic Chinook Jargon trading language spoken in the North American Pacific Northwest in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The name is a composite of the Chinook words \\"soop\\" (soap) and \\"olallie\\" (berry).Turner, Nancy J., Laurence C. Thompson, M. Terry Thompson, and Annie Z. York. 1990. Thompson Ethnobotany.

Biography Shaw was born in San Francisco, California. He began writing about rock and roll music as a young teenager. His first zines were Tolkien-related, but among them was also a mimeographed sheet called Mojo Navigator (full title, \\"Mojo-Navigator Rock and Roll News\\"). Founded in 1966 by David Harris, with Shaw's assistance, Mojo Navigator is said to have been an early inspiration for Rolling Stone magazine. In the 1970s Shaw moved to Los Angeles with wife and partner Suzy and started the fanzine called Who Put the Bomp, popularly known as simply Bomp!, or Bomp magazine. Shaw's writing appeared in Bomp!, of which he was editor and publisher, as well as in Creem, Phonograph Record (where he again served as editor) and occasionally Rolling Stone. He also wrote a book about Elton John while on staff as a writer for United Artists Records. Bomp featured many writers who would later become prominent, including Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus, Richard Meltzer, and Ken Barnes. During the 1970s, Shaw worked for Sire Records, and was instrumental in the signing of Flamin' Groovies, a band that he also managed for a couple of years. In 1974, Bomp! became a record label, and Shaw released records by Devo, The Weirdos and Iggy Pop, and worked with several artists including Stiv Bators and the Dead Boys. He signed, and distributed, power pop and new wave acts such as Shoes, The Nerves, The Plimsouls and The Romantics. Bomp! Records was an LA record store for a couple of years, as well as one of the first independent distributors in the U.S. In the 1980s, Shaw helped launch the garage revival scene with bands such as The Miracle Workers and The Pandoras. He also released music by Spacemen 3 and The Brian Jonestown Massacre in the mid to late-1990s, and appears in the Sundance award-winning documentary Dig!. In 1994, he associated with Patrick Boissel's Alive Records, a label with music by The Black Keys, Two Gallants, Soledad Brothers, Black Diamond Heavies, Brian Olive, Thomas Function and many other artists. In addition, he was known as a record collector, archivist, and historian, and started the Pebbles series in the early-1980s, a project inspired by Lenny Kaye's 1972 Nuggets reissue.

It is highly desirable to measure the conditions under which explosives can be set off for several reasons, including: safety in handling, safety in storage, and safety in use. It would be very difficult to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of explosives. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested. For example, PETN is considered to be a primary explosive by some individuals, and a secondary explosive by others. As a general rule, PETN is considered to be either a relatively insensitive primary explosive, or one of the most sensitive secondary explosives. PETN may be detonated by striking with a hammer on a hard steel surface (a very dangerous thing to do), and is generally considered the least sensitive explosive with which this may be done. For these facts and other reasons, PETN is considered one standard by which other explosives are gauged. Another explosive that is used as a calibration standard is TNT, which was afforded the arbitrary Figure of Insensitivity of 100. Other explosives could then be compared against this standard. Types of safety testing Because there are different ways to set off explosives, there are several different components to the safety testing of explosives: * Impact testing. The impact testing of explosives is performed by dropping a fixed weight onto a prepared sample of the explosive to be tested from a given distance. The weight is released, impacts upon the sample, and the result is noted. The impact distances are determined and the results are analyzed by the sensitivity test and analysis methods selected. The two most common sensitivity test and analysis methods are the Bruceton analysis and Neyer d-optimal test. These methods allow the user to determine the 50% initiation level (the distance at which 50% of the samples will \\"go\\"), and a standard deviation. Impact testing may also be performed with liquid samples confined in special cells. * Friction testing. There are several techniques through which explosives may be tested to determine their sensitivity to friction. One of the most popular is the ABL friction test, which uses a line of explosives on a prepared metal plate, placed in front of a specially prepared metal wheel that is forced down upon the plate with a hydraulic press. The metal plate is then struck with a pendulum to move it, squeezing the explosives between plate and wheel as the plate moves. Initiation is determined, and analyzed by the Bruceton analysis or Neyer d-optimal test, as above. BAM friction testing is similar, except that the sample is placed on a ceramic plate which is then moved side-to-side as a ceramic peg exerts force on the sample. * Electrostatic discharge. Testing for ESD, or \\"spark\\" sensitivity of explosives is performed with a machine designed to discharge from a capacitor through a prepared sample. The Sandia National Labs design employs a dipping needle that punctures a sample cell and discharges the spark simultaneously. The amount of energy discharged into the cell becomes the variable in which Bruceton analysis or Neyer d-optimal test is performed to determine spark sensitivity. * Thermal sensitivity. Determining the point at which a compound is capable of detonating under confinement with thermal stress is useful. A fixed quantity of material is placed in an aluminum blasting cap shell, and pressed into place with an aluminum plug. The sample is immersed in a hot metal bath, and the time-to-detonation is measured. If over 60 seconds, a fresh sample is run again at a higher temperature. In this manner, it is possible to determine the temperature at which an explosive will detonate on the small scale. Unlike the other tests above, this figure is misleading as explosives have more thermal issues on the large scale. Therefore, the thermal sensitivity figures established using this technique are higher than one would expect in the real world. Thermal safety testing may also be performed via differential scanning calorimetry, in which a small (sub-milligram) sample is placed in a sample cell, and the temperature is increased slowly. The calorimeter determines how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the sample. Using this device, characteristics such as the melting point, phase transitions and decomposition temperature of an explosive may be determined. Used together, these numbers may be used to determine the potential threats afforded by energetic materials when employed in the field. It cannot be stressed enough that these figures are relative; when we determine that impact sensitivity of an explosive is lower for that of a tested explosive than PETN, for example, the number produced in the impact test is dimensionless, but it means that it is expected that it would take a greater impact to detonate it than PETN. Therefore, an experienced ordnance technician who works with raw PETN will know that the new explosive is not as sensitive with regards to impact. However, it could be more sensitive to friction, spark, or thermal issues. These conditions must be taken into account before any compound is to be stored, handled, or used in the field.  Fireworks  In the Netherlands, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research tests the safety of fireworks. According to a 2017 report by the Dutch Safety Board, 25% of all fireworks tested failed to meet safety standards and were banned from sale. Since 2010, safety testing of fireworks is required in the entire European Union, but companies are allowed to test their products in one member state before importing and selling them in another.

In general, legislatures first set broad policy mandates by passing statutes, then agencies create more detailed regulations through rulemaking. By bringing detailed scientific and other types of expertise to bear on policy, the rulemaking process has been the means by which some of the most far-reaching government regulations of the 20th century have been created. For example, science-based regulations are critical to modern programs for environmental protection, food safety, and workplace safety. However, the growth in regulations has fueled criticism that the rulemaking process reduces the transparency and accountability of democratic government. Introduction Legislatures rely on rulemaking to add more detailed scientific, economic, or industry expertise to a policy‚Äîfleshing out the broader mandates of authorizing legislation. For example, typically a legislature would pass a law mandating the establishment of safe drinking water standards, and then assign an agency to develop the list of contaminants and safe levels through rulemaking. The rise of the rulemaking process itself is a matter of political controversy. Many find that obscure and complex rulemaking tends to undercut the democratic ideal of a government that is closely watched by and accountable to its citizens. Purposes Although executive agencies are usually charged with executing, not promulgating a regulatory scheme, the breadth and depth of regulation today renders it difficult, if not impossible, for legislatures to specify the details of modern regulatory schemes. As a result, the specification of these details are mostly delegated to agencies for rulemaking. Common purposes of rulemaking include: * Adding scientific expertise. For example, in the U.S., the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act outlaws the sale of adulterated or impure drugs. The act requires that the Department of Health and Human Services promulgate regulations establishing which laboratory tests to use to test the purity of each drug. * Adding implementation detail. Legislation on automobile fuel efficiency, for example, often delegates the development of the actual engine tests used to calculate 'city mileage' and 'highway mileage'. * Adding industry expertise. The U.S. Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act require the United States Environmental Protection Agency to determine the appropriate emissions control technologies on an industry-by-industry basis. * Adding flexibility. More detailed regulations allow for more nuanced approaches to various conditions than a single legislative standard could. Moreover, regulations tend to be more easily changed as new data or technologies emerge. * Finding compromise. In some cases, a divided legislature can reach an agreement on a compromise legislative standard, while each side holds out hope that the implementing regulations will be more favorable to its cause. The rulemaking process Rulemaking processes are generally designed to ensure that * The public is informed of proposed rules before they take effect; * The public can comment on the proposed rules and provide additional data to the agency; * The public can access the rulemaking record and analyze the data and analysis behind a proposed rule; * The agency analyzes and responds to the public's comments; * The agency creates a permanent record of its analysis and the process; * The agency's actions can be reviewed by a judge or others to ensure the correct process was followed. For example, a typical U.S. federal rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.¬ß551, et seq. would contain these steps: * Legislation. The U.S. Congress passes a law, containing an organic statute that creates a new administrative agency, and that outlines general goals the agency is to pursue through its rulemaking. Similarly, Congress may prescribe such goals and rulemaking duties to a pre-existing agency. * Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This optional step entails publishing the agency's initial analysis of the subject matter, often asking for early public input on key issues. Any data or communications regarding the upcoming rule would be made available to the public for review. Occasionally, a board of potentially affected parties is comprised to do give-and-take bargaining over rulemaking subject-matter which would otherwise result in deadlocked opposition by an interested party. This is commonly called \\"negotiated rulemaking\\", and results in more custom-tailored proposed rule. * Proposed Rule. In this step, the agency publishes the actual proposed regulatory language in the Federal Register; in which a discussion of the justification and analysis behind the rule is printed, as well as the agency's response to any public comment on the advance notice. * Public comment. Once a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, a public comment period begins, allowing the public to submit written comments to the agency. Most agencies are required to respond to every issue raised in the comments. Depending on the complexity of the rule, comment periods may last for 30 to even 180 days. * Final Rule. Usually, the proposed rule becomes the final rule with some minor modifications. In this step, the agency publishes a full response to issues raised by public comments and an updated analysis and justification for the rule, including an analysis of any new data submitted by the public. In some cases, the agency may publish a second draft proposed rule, especially if the new draft is so different from the proposed rule that it raises new issues that have not been submitted to public comment. This again appears in the Federal Register, and if no further steps are taken by the public or interested parties, it is codified into the Code of Federal Regulations. * Judicial review. In some cases, members of the public or regulated parties file a lawsuit alleging that the rulemaking is improper. While courts generally offer significant deference to the agency's technical expertise, they do review closely whether the regulation exceeds the rulemaking authority granted by the authorizing legislation and whether the agency properly followed the process for public notice and comment. * Effective date. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the rule does not become effective for some time after its initial publication to allow regulated parties to come into compliance. Some rules provide several years for compliance. * \\"Hybrid\\" rulemaking. Not a legal term of art, but describes the kind of rulemaking performed by agencies that is somewhere between formal (with a hearing and record) and informal (with the notice and comment procedures described above). Hybrid rulemaking generally subsumes procedural aspects reserved for adjudication, such as a formal hearing in which interested parties are sworn and subject to cross-examination. The statutory construction of the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as the Supreme Court's ruling in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,SeeVermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, 435 U.S. 519 (1978) from Louisiana State University ‚Äì Medical & Public Health Law site make hybrid-rulemaking proper only when specifically provided for by the U.S. Congress. In the United States when an agency publishes a final rule generally the rule is effective no less than thirty days after the date of publication in the Federal Register. If the agency wants to make the rule effective sooner, it must cite \\"good cause\\" (persuasive reasons) as to why this is in the public interest. Significant rules (defined by Executive Order 12866) and major rules (defined by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act ) are required to have a 60 day delayed effective date. Rules for rulemaking Most modern rulemaking authorities have a common law tradition or a specific basic law that essentially regulates the regulators, subjecting the rulemaking process to standards of due process, transparency, and public participation. * In the United States, the governing law for federal rulemaking is the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Separate states often have parallel systems. * Commonwealth countries use a mix of common law and similar statute law. * The European Commission has recently developed new standards under ideas laid out in a 'Whitepaper on governance.' This effort was undertaken after the Irish ‚ÄòNo‚Äô vote in 2001, addressing concerns that the public perceived the Commission‚Äôs legislative and rulemaking processes as too removed from citizen input. Use in private industry Private rulemaking bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, Java Community Process, and other technical communities, have adopted similar principles and frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency, and thoroughness. While the mechanics vary, these efforts follow the same pattern of an open rulemaking record, public publication of proposals, and an opportunity for public comment on those proposals before they are finalized. Rulemaking apparatus Public participation requires some official methods for the agency to communicate with the public. Generally, agencies produce an official gazette, or periodical for publishing all rulemaking notice, such as the Federal Register. Once a rule is final, the language of the rule itself (not the supporting analysis or data) is codified in the official body of regulations, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In essence, the accountability of the rulemaking system assumes that the public does take note of all of the notices in the Federal Register, which can run over a hundred pages per day. In practice, many industry or public advocacy lobbyists and lawyers monitor the Federal Register Table of Contents every day by email on behalf of their constituents or clients. Public comments are the heart of the public‚Äôs ability to participate in the rulemaking process. The agency rulemaking is usually required to consider and publish a written response to all comments. Although high-profile rulemakings may include public hearings, most rulemakings are simply noticed in the Federal Register with a call for written comments by a set deadline. Holding agencies accountable for objective, fact-based rulemaking requires maintaining a formal record of the facts and analysis behind the rule. Agencies must assemble and make public a rulemaking record that includes all information considered as part of the rulemaking process. These records can be enormous and can easily fill scores to hundreds of boxes. Interested parties generally must travel to an agency repository to inspect and copy this record. In the United States, the Federal government is moving toward posting rulemaking dockets online at www.regulations.gov. Supporting documentation for 37% of new rulemakings was available on-line as of August 2006. By August 2007 it was available for 80% of new rulemakings. Interested parties frequently comb through the agency‚Äôs data to find flaws in the agency‚Äôs reasoning. Also, interested parties‚Äô comments on the rule then become part of this record. Rulemaking and the courts In the U.S., interested parties can sue to have a judge review the rulemaking process once the rule is finalized. Interested parties frequently sue the rulemaking agency, asking the court to order the agency to reconsider. For example, environmental groups may sue, claiming that the rule is too lax on industry; or industry groups may sue, claiming that the rule is too onerous. Traditionally, courts are reluctant to step into the shoes of the technical experts and re-open the decisions made in the agency‚Äôs detailed analysis. However, courts do review whether a rulemaking meets the standards for the rulemaking process. The basis of this review by the courts may be limited to certain questions of fairness or the procedures that ensure that both sides of a dispute are treated equally before any decision making occurs or that the decision is not patently unreasonable (under Canadian law) or Wednesbury unreasonableness (under British law) or similar doctrines described below. These powers of review of administrative decisions, while often governed by statute, were originally developed out of the royal prerogative writs of English law such as the writ of mandamus and the writ of certiorari. Thus, it is not enough to simply claim that the rulemaking agency could have done a better job. Instead, under U.S. administrative law, to ask the court to order changes in a rule, a party must argue that the rule is: Arbitrary and capricious and/or unsupported by the record. Most frequently, objectors will argue that, even if the judge is not an expert, the judge can tell that there is an obvious gap in the agency‚Äôs data or analysis. A court may intervene if it finds that there is no reasonable way that the agency could have drafted the rule, given the evidence in the rulemaking record. A court may send a rule back to the agency for further analysis, generally leaving the agency to decide whether to change the rule to match the existing record or to amend the record to show how they arrived at the original rule. If a court does remand a rule back to the agency, it almost always involves an additional notice and public comment period. Exceeds statutory authority. Frequently, opponents of a rule argue that it fails to follow the instructions of the authorizing legislation. Rules can be found to exceed statutory authority if they are too strict or too lax. If a law instructs an agency to issue regulations to ban a chemical, but the agency issues a rule that instead sets levels for safe use‚Äîor vice versa‚Äîa court may order the agency to issue a new rule. Bolt out of the blue. Occasionally, interested parties argue that the final rule contains provisions that were never vetted during the public comment period. A court may intervene if it finds that there was no way that the commenting public could have anticipated the new provisions and provided comments. If so, the new provisions are said to be, in a colorful legal phrase, a 'bolt out of the blue' rather than a reasonable course correction during the rulemaking process. Frequently, agencies will vet several options during the proposed rule phase to allow for comment on the full spectrum of rules under consideration.

Lying east of Luing and south of Seil, this tidal island was inhabited until the 1960s. There is now only one house there, which is used for holiday lets. The underlying bedrock is slate but unlike Torsa's immediate island neighbours this has never been worked commercially. The island's name is of Norse origin but the most prominent historical structure on the island is the ruined Caisteal nan Con on the northeast shore, once held by Clan Campbell. The abundant sea life in the waters surrounding the island are protected by the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Protected Area. Geography Torsa lies just offshore from the east coast of Luing. A rough track leads down from the road to Ardinamir farm on Luing to a narrow strait, fordable at low water, and onto the south west corner of the island. This area is known as Torsa Beag (\\"Little Torsa\\"), which name implies a small island in its own right but it is permanently attached to the main part of Torsa by a narrow strip of land. Torsa farmhouse, which was inhabited until the 1960s and is now a holiday let, is nearby. The bulk of the island, the total area of which extends to , lies above a raised beach at between 10 and 60 metres above sea level. There is a shallow anchorage at Ardinamir reached via a narrow entrance with drying rocks. There is no jetty on the island and holidaymakers reach it using a small dinghy. The island is relatively fertile compared to its larger neighbours with good pasture for cattle and \\"almost its entire surface is capable of cultivation\\". There are various small offshore islets on the west side of Torsa including Eilean Fraoch (Heather Island), Glas Eilean (Grey-green Island) and Sgeir a' Bodaich. The peninsula that forms the northern point of Torsa is called Eilean na h-Eaglaise - island of the church. Geology Most of Torsa comprises the Easdale Slate formation, although it has never been extracted commercially.\\"The Islands\\". Slate Islands Heritage Trust. Retrieved 27 June 2020. There are post-glacial marine deposits all around the raised beach that encircles the middle of the island. Torsa Beag has been formed from a Neoproterozoic metamorphic intrusion. Etymology The north of Torsa with visible raised beach line below the cliffs. Sgeir a' Bodaich is at centre and Glas Eilean between there and Torsa. The heights of D√πn Crutagain on the mainland of Scotland are beyond. Torsa, archaically Torsay, is a Gaelic name derived from Old Norse. It means \\"Thorir's island\\" or possibly \\"Thor's Island\\". The names were common ones and there is an early reference to the Norse presence in the Irish records to a king of \\"Viking Scotland\\" whose heir Th√≥rir brought an army to Ireland in 848. Just south of Ardinamir on Luing, overlooking Torsa, there is B√†gh Lachlainn - \\"Lachlan's Bay\\". The personal name Lachlan is derived from an 11th century term Lochlann indicating a person of Norse origin. History From about the 6th to the 8th century AD the Cen√©l Loairn kindred controlled what is today known as Lorn, which region includes the Slate Islands, in the then kingdom of Dalriada. By the late 8th century the area was a zone of conflict between the Celtic rulers of mainland Argyll and the newly arrived Norse settlers. Although there are few written references to the Slate Islands for this period the influence of the Norse language on placenames suggests that these islands then became part of the Kingdom of the Isles. Clan MacDougall were an important force in the area responsible for their mainland territories to the Scots crown, but to the Kings of Norway for their island territories until the 1266 Treaty of Perth when the Hebrides were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland. The ruins of Caisteal nan Con Caisteal nan Con - the Dogs' Castle - is a ruined tower house that occupied a rocky eminence on the NE shore of the island. During the late Middle Ages it was held by Clan Campbell and then by the MacDougalls of Rarey at a later date, then finally Clan MacLean. It occupies a fine defensive position built on a sheer rocky outcrop overlooking the sea on three sides. The rock platform was enclosed by the oblong tower which measured about 13.7 metres by 8.8 metres and the lower, seaward portion by a bailey which included a small circular tower. In the 1970s RCAHMS reported that \\"all the buildings are very ruinous and much overgrown with turf, but considerable portions of the external wall faces of the tower-house and bailey survive.\\" A small rocky inlet 75 metres north east of the ruins may have been used a boat landing.\\"Torsa, Caisteal Nan Con\\". Canmore. Retrieved 23 June 2020. The name suggests it may have been used as a hunting lodge although Torsa itself is too small to have provided much sport of this nature. It is more likely that this name is derived from a byname used of Clan MacLean by their enemies - Clann Illeathain nan Con. By the late 17th century the Dukes of Argyll were the dominant landowners in the area and they began to lease land on a competitive basis rather than as the traditional means of strengthening the welfare of their senior clansmen. Neighbouring Seil, Luing and Shuna were subject to significant clearances of the indigenous population by Clan Campbell as early as 1699 and it is highly likely that Torsa suffered the same fate. The Slate Islands then became part of the Netherlorn estates of the Breadalbane family, a branch of Clan Campbell, whose affairs were directed from Ardmaddy Castle on the mainland. Ardmaddy Castle on mainland Scotland, seat of the government of Nether Lorn under the Breadalbane family At the beginning of the 19th century there were eleven families living on the island who made use of the traditional run rig system of cultivation. In the mid-19th century the population was recorded as 9, 5 females and 4 males and by 1909 the island had a single farm. The 1961 census was the last record of any permanent inhabitation with a single resident living there at that time. During the 20th century most of the Breadalbane land on the Slate islands was sold off as smaller farms and individual houses. Torsa is still a part of Ardmaddy Estate today although this is now in the hands of the Struthers family.\\"About\\". Ardmaddy.com. Retrieved 27 June 2020.

He served one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1883 to 1885. Early life and career Breitung, the son of John M. Breitung, a Lutheran minister, was born in the city of Schalkau in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, Germany (now in Sonneberg District, Thuringia). He attended the College of Mining in Meiningen, then one of the celebrated schools in Germany for scientific and classical studies. In 1849, after the revolution in Germany, he immigrated to the United States and settled in Kalamazoo County, Michigan. He moved to Detroit in 1851 and became a clerk in a mercantile house. He moved to Marquette and engaged in mercantile pursuits until 1859, when he went to Negaunee. He sold out his mercantile business to engage exclusively in iron-mining operations in 1864, explored for iron deposits in Marquette and Menominee Counties, locating several profitable mines from 1864 to 1867. He later became interested in gold and silver mining in Colorado. Congress Breitung was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1873 and 1874 and a member of the Michigan State Senate in 1877 and 1878. He served as mayor of Negaunee in 1879, 1880, and 1882. He was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives from Michigan's 11th congressional district for the Forty-eighth Congress, serving from March 4, 1883 to March 3, 1885. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1884. Death Breitung died in Negaunee and is interred in Park Cemetery in Marquette. Breitung's son, Edward N. Breitung, continued his father's successful mining enterprises in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Breitung Township, Minnesota is named after him for his work in developing the Soudan Mine there in the 1880s. Breitung Township, Michigan is also named for him.

The editor is especially useful to create or modify files in ANSI format and text documents, which use the graphical characters of the IBM ASCII code pages, because they are not supported by Microsoft Windows anymore. The first version of the editor was developed in 1986 by Ian E. Davis of TheSoft Programming Services. The last public version of the editor was version 4.63, which was released in October 1993. TheDraw was one of the first ANSI editors that supported ANSIs longer than 25 rows. The limit in the latest available version is still 100 rows. Other editors, such as ACiDDraw are able to support ANSIs larger than 100 lines for a single ANSI/ASCII (ACiDDraw supports 1,000 lines). The animation mode is limited to 50 lines (rows). The column width can be extended from the standard 80 characters to 160, but this also reduces the row limit down to 50. Compatibility with Microsoft Windows The program is stable in an MS-DOS Window on Windows XP and allows the user to maintain mouse control. Used with Windows Vista however, TheDraw performs with less predictable results. It works with DOSBox.

Leventhal Park. In the 18th century, rope manufacturers occupied the area, then it became a residential district, and later a business and commercial area. The Great Boston fire of 1872 swept through the area, and as rebuilding began the area began to be called Post Office Square after the new United States Post Office and Sub-Treasury Building which faced the square. In 1874, the headquarters of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company, designed by Nathaniel Bradlee, was erected in the square on the site of what is now Norman B. Leventhal Park. This building was demolished in 1945, and a large parking garage which filled the area of the present park was erected, being completed in 1954. Post Office Square was the site of a 1964 speech by Lyndon B. Johnson. There was a transformer explosion and fire in the One Post Office Square building in December 1986. An electric company worker was killed but it was after normal business hours and the building was able to be evacuated with only a few injuries. The above-ground parking garage was demolished in 1988.

Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus, The Starry Night is one of the most recognized paintings in Western art. The asylum The Monastery of Saint-Paul de Mausole In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self- mutilation of his left ear, Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889. Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived, allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio. During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued. During this period, he produced some of the best- known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September, 1889, in the Mus√©e d'Orsay. The Starry Night was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date he wrote to his brother Theo to say he had a new study of a starry sky. The painting Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including The Starry Night. \\"Through the iron- barred window,\\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \\"I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.\\" Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of the day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane. One of the first paintings of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-R√©my, now in Copenhagen. Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical. It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside. In his June 9 letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days. Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889. This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air. F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-R√©my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it. Two days later, Vincent wrote Theo that he had painted \\"a starry sky\\". The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window. In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \\"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\\". Researchers have determined that Venus was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible. So the brightest \\"star\\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus. The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture, and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct. (For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.) The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village, which is based on a sketch F1541v made from a hillside above the village of Saint-R√©my. Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Proven√ßal, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \\"reminisces of the North\\" he was to paint and draw early the following year. Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse F1541r was also a study for the painting.

After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \\"night study.\\"Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 805 Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \\"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\\"; \\"the rest\\" would include The Starry Night. When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he didn't send.Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 806 Finally, in a letter to painter √âmile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \\"failure.\\" Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred, or paint what Gauguin called \\"abstractions\\": paintings conceived in the imagination, or de t√™te. In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the fall and winter of 1888: \\"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know. . . . But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall. . . And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big‚Äîanother failure‚Äîand I have had my fill of that.\\" Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night. Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \\"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\\" Vincent responded in early November, \\"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\\" And later in the same letter, he wrote, \\"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\\"Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 816 But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature. Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series. He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-R√©my. The Starry Night belongs to this latter series, as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles. Starry Night (Over the Rh√¥ne), 1888, oil on canvas The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.e., at night. The first painting in the series was Caf√© Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rh√¥ne) later that same month. Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular. Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \\"I need a starry night with cypresses or‚Äîperhaps above a field of ripe wheat; there are some really beautiful nights here.\\" That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \\"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\\" He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \\"we take death to reach a star.\\" Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion, he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife. He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rh√¥ne, confessing to a \\"tremendous need for, shall I say the word‚Äîfor religion‚Äîso I go outside at night to paint the stars.\\" He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky. \\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\\" \\"Hope is in the stars,\\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \\"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\\" And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \\"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\\" Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \\"pressure of feeling\\" and that it is a \\"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\\"Schapiro, p. 100 Schapiro theorizes that the \\"hidden content\\" of the work makes reference to the New Testament book of Revelation, revealing an \\"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\\"Schapiro, p. 33 (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,Schapiro, p. 108 painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.) Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \\"visionary painting\\" which \\"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\\" He writes of the \\"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns. Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \\"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman. He calls The Starry Night \\"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\\" and which \\"gives a never-to- be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\\" Loevgren praises Schapiro's \\"eloquent interpretation\\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament book of Genesis. Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \\"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\\" and notes that \\"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\\" The drawing Cypresses in Starry Night, a reed pen copy executed by Van Gogh after the painting in 1889.

Retrieved 3 June 2012.Richard Boudreaux: \\"Ex-Soviet Officer Tried to Return Art Found in Cellar\\", Los Angeles Times 20 March 1995, retrieved 3 June 2012. Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \\"traditional religious subject in disguise\\" and a \\"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\\" Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Eug√®ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night. He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun. He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \\"consolation.\\" It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting. As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries. He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous Moon but \\"reverted to a more traditional image\\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version. He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets. And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime. Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters, he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes. Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media. He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky. These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place. Harvard astronomer Charles A. Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.C.L.A.). While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries, he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed. He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, Lord Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced. Sketch of the Whirlpool Galaxy by Lord Rosse in 1845, 44 years before Van Gogh's painting Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence. (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.) Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning. The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,Schapiro, p. 34 or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-R√©my. In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom. Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate. In an April 1888, letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \\"funereal cypresses,\\" though this is possibly similar to saying \\"stately oaks\\" or \\"weeping willows.\\" One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \\"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts. I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\\" In the same letter he mentioned \\"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\\"Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 783 These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation. Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \\"vague symbol of a human striving.\\" Boime calls it the \\"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\\" Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \\"function as rustic and natural obelisks\\" providing a \\"link between the heavens and the earth.\\"Jirat-Wasiutynski, p. 657 (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.) Loevgren reminds the reader that \\"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\\" Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \\"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\\" The Starry Night \\"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\\" Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination. Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east, as does Jirat-Wasiuty≈Ñski.Jirat-Wasiutynski, p. 667 Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \\"telescoped\\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window, and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet. Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \\"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\\" to further his argument that the painting is \\"an amalgam of images.\\" However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \\"arrangement\\" as a synonym for \\"composition.\\" Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \\"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\\" as he called it, \\"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\\" The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects. What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \\"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\\" in The Starry Night. On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \\"arrangement\\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \\"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I‚Äôve never devised anything better.\\"Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 739 (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: \\"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you‚Äôre exchanging that for something ‚Äî must one say the word ‚Äî something artificial ‚Äî something affected.\\"Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 822 When Van Gogh calls The Starry Night a failure for being an \\"abstraction,\\" he places the blame on his having painted \\"stars that are too big.\\" While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy. \\"Not the kind,\\" they write, \\"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy‚Äîa seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\\"; emphasis in the original Symptoms of the seizures \\"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\\" Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889. Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \\"his defenses had been breached.\\" On that day in mid-June, in a \\"state of heightened reality,\\" with all the other elements of the painting in place, Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \\"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\\" Provenance After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings. Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891. Theo's widow, Jo, then became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy. She sold the painting to poet Julien Leclercq in Paris in 1900, who turned around and sold it to √âmile Schuffenecker, Gauguin's old friend, in 1901. Jo then bought the painting back from Schuffenecker before selling it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam in 1906. From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by Georgette P. van Stolk, of Rotterdam, who sold it to Paul Rosenberg, of Paris and New York. It was through Rosenberg that the Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting in 1941.

They ruled the Armenian regions of Tayk, Taron, Sasun, Bagrevand and others. Their patron saint was Saint Hovhannes Karapet (John the Baptist) whose monastery of the same name (also known as Glak) they fiercely defended against the Sassanid invaders. Origin The origin of the Mamikonians is shrouded in the mists of antiquity. Moses of Chorene in his History of Armenia (5th century) claims that three centuries earlier two noblemen of \\"Chem\\" (Arm. \\"’É’•’¥\\"; plur. \\"’É’•’¥÷Ñ\\") origin (which is speculated to mean probably Chinese origin), Mamik and Konak, rose against their half-brother, Chenbakir, the king of Chenk (which possibly refers to China). They were defeated and fled to the king of Parthia who, braving the Emperor's demands to extradite the culprits, sent them to live in Armenia, where Mamik became the progenitor of the Mamikonians. Another 5th-century Armenian historian, Pavstos Buzand, seconded the story. In his History of Armenia, he twice mentions that the Mamikonians descended from the Han Dynasty of China and as such were not inferior to the Arshakid rulers of Armenia. This genealogical legend may have been part of an agenda by the Bagratid dynasty of Armenia to take away the legitimacy off the Mamikonian dynasty. Although it echoes the Bagratids' claim of Davidic descent and the Artsruni's claim of the royal Assyrian ancestry, some Armenian historians tended to interpret it as something more than a piece of genealogical mythology. A theory from the 1920s postulated that the Chenk mentioned in the Armenian sources were not Han- Chinese but probably from a different Iranian-speaking ethnic group from Transoxania, such as the Tocharians in Northwest China.H. Skold, \\"L'Origine des Mamiconiens\\", Revue des etudes armeniennes (1925) pp. 134-35. Edward Gibbon in his The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire also believed that the founder of Mamikonian clan was not Han-Chinese but merely from the territory of the Chinese Empire and ascribes a Scythian origin to Mamgon stating that at the time the borders of the Chinese Empire reached as far west as Sogdiana.Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:Chapter XIII, Part II, Reign of Diocletian and This Three Associates. Another reconstruction, similar to the previous ones but without references whatsoever to distant China, has that the family originally immigrated from Bactriana (present northern Afghanistan) under the reign of Tiridates II of Armenia,Vahan M. Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, Armenian General Benevolent Union of America 1958: Chapter XVII The Arsacids (Arshakunis) of Armenia likely coinciding with the accession of the Sassanids in Iran. More recent theories, however, suggests that the \\"Chank\\" are to be identified either with the Tzans, a tribe in the southern Caucasus, or with a Central Asian group living near the Syr Darya river. In the words of Nina Garso√Øan / Encyclop√¶dia Iranica: Early history The Expansion of the House of Mamikonian. Vartan Mamikonian illustration in 1898 book ¬´Illustrated Armenia and Armenians¬ª Vartan Mamikonian illustration in 1898 book ¬´Illustrated Armenia and Armenians¬ª Vardan Mamikonian leading Armenians in the Battle of Vartanantz (451). The family first appears in the early 4th century. Under the late Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia, the family occupied an important position: they were hereditary commanders-in-chief (sparapet) and royal tutors (dayeak) and controlled large domains, including most of Taron and Tayk. The Mamikonian increased their property further with the death of the last hereditary Patriarch of Armenia, Isaac in ca. 428, when they inherited many Church lands through the marriage of his only daughter to Hamazasp Mamikonian. The first known Mamikonid lord, or nakharar, about whom anything certain is known was a certain Vatche Mamikonian (fl. 330-339). The family reappears in chronicles in 355, when the bulk of their lands lay in the province of Tayk. At that point the family chief was Vassak Mamikonian, who was the sparapetof Armenia. Later, the office of sparapet would become hereditary possession of the Mamikonians. Vassak Mamikonian was in charge of the Armenian defense against Persia but was eventually defeated through the treachery of Merujan Artsruni (c. 367-368). Following the defeat, Vassak's brother Vahan Mamikonian and multiple other feudal lords defected to the Persian side. The Emperor Valens, however, interfered in Armenian affairs and had the office of sparapet bestowed on Vassak's son Mushegh I Mamikonian in 370. Four years later Varasdates (Varazdat), a new king, confirmed Mushegh in office. The latter was subsequently assassinated on behest of Sembat Saharuni who replaced him as sparapet' of Armenia. On this event, the family leadership passed to Mushegh's brother, Manuel Mamikonian, who had been formerly kept as a hostage in Persia. The Mamikonids at once broke into insurrection and routed Varasdates and Saharuni at Karin. Emmanuel, together with his sons Hemaiak and Artches, took the king prisoner and put him in a fortress, whence Varasdates escaped abroad. Zarmandukht, the widow of Varasdates' predecessor, was then proclaimed queen. Emmanuel came to an agreement with the powerful Sassanids, pledging his loyalty in recompense for their respect of the Armenian autonomy and laws. Upon the queen's demise in 384, Manuel Mamikonian was proclaimed Regent of Armenia pending the minority of her son Arsaces III and had the infant king married to his daughter Vardandukht. It was Manuel's death in 385 that precipitated the country's conquest by the Persians in 386-387. Hamazasp Mamikonian was recorded as the family leader in 393. His wife is known to have been Sahakanoush, daughter of Patriarch Isaac the Great. She was a descendant of the Arsacid Kings and Saint Gregory the Illuminator. They had a son, Vardan Mamikonian, who is revered as one of the greatest military and spiritual leaders of ancient Armenia. After Vardan became sparapet in 432, the Persians summoned him to Ctesiphon. Upon his return home in 450, Vardan repudiated the Persian (Zoroastrian) religion and instigated a great Armenian rebellion against their Sassanian overlords. Although he died in the doomed Battle of Avarayr also known as Battle of Vartanantz (451), the continued insurrection led by Vahan Mamikonian, the son of Vartan's brother, resulted in the restoration of Armenian autonomy with the Nvarsak Treaty (484), thus guaranteeing the survival of Armenian statehood in later centuries. Vardan is venerated as a saint and commemorated by many churches in Armenia and an equestrian statue in Yerevan. After the country's subjugation by the Persians, the Mamikonians often sided with the Eastern Roman Empire, with many family members entering Byzantine service, most notably Vardan II Mamikonian in the late 6th century after his failed revolt against Persia. With the Arab conquest of Armenia in the late 7th century, the power of the Mamikonian began to decline, especially relative to their great rivals, the Bagratids. Grigor Mamikonian led a rebellion against Arab rule but was defeated and forced to flee to Byzantium in ca. 748. By 750, the Mamikonians had lost Taron, Khelat, and Mouch to the Bagratids. In the 770s, the family was led by Artavizd Mamikonian, then by Mushegh IV Mamikonian (+772) and by Samuel II. The latter married his daughter to Smbat VII Bagratuni, constable of Armenia. His grandson Ashot Msaker (\\"the Carnivorous\\") became forefather of Bagratid rulers of Armenia and Taron. The final death-blow to the family's power came in the mid-770s, with the defeat and death of Mushegh VI Mamikonian at the Battle of Bagrevand against the Abbasids. In its aftermath, Mushegh's two sons took refuge in Vaspurakan and were murdered by Merouzhan II Artsruni, and his daughter was married off to Djahap al-Qais, a tribal chief who settled in Armenia and seized part of the former Mamikonian lands and legalized it by marrying the daughter of Mushegh VI, the last living Mamikonian prince. This marriage created the Kaysite Dynasty of Arminiya centered in Manzikert, the most powerful Muslim Arab emirate in the Armenian Highlands region, and thus ending the existence of the Mamikonian line in Armenia. Only secondary lines of the family survived thereafter, both in Transcaucasia and in Byzantium. Even in their homeland of Tayk, they were succeeded by the Bagratids. One Kurdik Mamikonian was recorded as ruling Sasun c. 800, where the Surb Karapet Monastery and family seat was. Half a century later, Grigor Mamikonian lost Bagrevand to the Muslims, reconquered it in the early 860s and then lost it to the Bagratids, permanently. After that, the Mamikonians pass out of history. After their disastrous uprising of 774‚Äì775, some of the Mamikonian princes moved to the Georgian lands. The latter-day Georgian feudal houses of the Liparitids-Orbeliani and Tumanishvili are sometimes surmised to have been descended from those princes.Toumanoff, Cyril. \\"The Mamikonids and the Liparitids\\", Armeniaca (Venice, 1969), pp. 125-137. Several scholars‚Äîmost notably Cyril Toumanoff and Nicholas Adontz‚Äîhave suggested a Mamikonian origin for a number of leading Byzantine families and individuals, beginning with the usurper Phocas in the early 7th century, emperor Philippikos Bardanes, the general and usurper Artabasdos in the mid-8th century, and the families of men like Alexios Mosele or Empress Theodora and her brothers Bardas and Petronas in the 9th century. However, as the Armenian historian N. Garso√Øan comments, \\"[a]ttractive though it is, this thesis cannot be proven for want of sources\\".

It is located inland from the French research station at Dumont D'Urville, inland from Australia's Casey Station and inland from the Italian Zucchelli Station at Terra Nova Bay. Russia's Vostok Station is away. The Geographic South Pole is away. The facility is also located within Australia's claim on Antarctica, the Australian Antarctic Territory. Concordia Station is the third permanent, all-year research station on the Antarctic Plateau besides Vostok Station (Russian) and the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station (U.S.) at the Geographic South Pole. It is jointly operated by scientists from France and Italy and regularly hosts ESA scientists.  History  In 1992, France built a new station on the Antarctic Plateau. The program was later joined by Italy in 1993. In 1995, Pr. Jean Vernin from University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis and Pr. Giorgio Dall'Oglio from University of Rome performed the first scientific experience towards a site qualification at Dome C. In 1996, a French-Italian team established a summer camp at Dome C. The two main objectives of the camp were the provision of logistical support for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) and the construction of a permanent research station. The new all-year facility, Concordia Station, became operational in 2005. The first winterover began with a staff of 13 (eleven French and 2 Italians) in February 2005.  Access  Part of a traverse, which was bringing fuel, food, and other supplies from Dumont d'Urville to Dome C (January 2005) Location of the \\"Concordia Station\\" relatively near the South Pole Most of the cargo is moved to Dome C by traverse from Dumont d'Urville Station, covering in 7 to 12 days depending on weather conditions. Station personnel and light cargo arrive by air, landing on a Skiway, using the Twin Otters flying from DDU or Zucchelli Station at .  Environment  Dome C is situated on top of the Antarctic Plateau. No animals or plants live at a distance of more than a few tens of kilometers from the Southern Ocean. However, south polar skuas have been spotted overflying the station, 1,200 km away from their nearest food sources. It is believed that these birds have learned to cross the continent instead of circumnavigating it.  Human biology and medicine  Concordia Station shares many stressor characteristics similar to that of long-duration deep-space missions, in particular extreme isolation and confinement, and therefore serves as a useful analogue platform for research relevant to space medicine. During the winter, the crew are isolated from the outside world, having no transportation and limited communication for 9 months and live a prolonged period in complete darkness, at an altitude almost equivalent to 4000m at the equator. This creates physiological and psychological strains on the crew. Concordia station is particularly useful for the study of chronic hypobaric hypoxia, stress secondary to confinement and isolation, circadian rhythm and sleep disruption, individual and group psychology, telemedicine, and astrobiology. Concordia station has been proposed as one of the real-life Earth-based analogues for long-duration deep-space missions.  Glaciology  In the 1970s, Dome C was the site of ice core drilling by field teams of several nations. In the 1990s, Dome C was chosen for deep ice core drilling by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA). Drilling at Dome C began in 1996 and was completed on December 21, 2004, reaching a drilling depth of 3270.2 m, 5 m above bedrock. The age of the oldest recovered ice is estimated to be ca. 900,000 years.  Astronomy  Concordia Station has been identified as a suitable location for extremely accurate astronomical observations. The transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere permits the observation of stars even when the sun is at an elevation angle of 38¬∞. Other advantages include the very low infrared sky emission, the high percentage of cloud-free time and the low aerosol and dust content of the atmosphere. The median seeing measured with a DIMM Differential Image Motion Monitor placed on top of an 8.5 m high tower is 1.3 ¬± 0.8 arcseconds. This is significantly worse than most major observatory sites, but similar to other observatories in Antarctica. However, Lawrence et al. consider other features of the site and conclude that \\"Dome C is the best ground-based site to develop a new astronomical observatory\\". ‚Üí FAQ by the authors Note however that this was written before whole-atmospheric seeing measurements had been made at Dome C.

Climate  The climate at Dome C where Concordia Station is located is frigid all year round, being one of the coldest places on Earth. It has a polar ice cap climate (K√∂ppen EF), with maximums ranging from in December to in May, mean ranging from in December to in May and minimums ranging from in December to in May. The annual average air temperature is . The station has never recorded a temperature above freezing; the warmest temperature recorded was in January. Temperatures can fall below in winter, and the coldest recorded temperature was in August 2010; one of the coldest temperatures ever recorded on Earth. Humidity is low and it is also very dry, with very little precipitation throughout the year. Dome C does not experience the katabatic winds typical for the coastal regions of Antarctica because of its elevated location and its relative distance from the edges of the Antarctic Plateau. Typical wind speed in winter is 2.8 m/s. Winterovers While the station has been in use for summer campaigns since December 1997, the first winterover (February to October) was only made in 2005. During this period, the station is inaccessible, requiring total autonomy. First winter-over (DC01 ‚Äì 2005) Frozen face of wintering personnel (Christophe Mozer) during first Dome C winterover (2005) The first winter began in mid-February 2005, with thirteen wintering (eleven French people and two Italians): *Michel Munoz: station leader, plumber, *Roberto Dicasilati: physician, *Christophe Mozer: powerhouse chief, *Pascal Bordais: radio, electronics, computers, *Emanuele Salvietti: glaciologist, *Claire Le Calvez: technical chief, *Michel Galland: electrician, *Jean-Louis Duraffourg: chef, *Abdelkarim Agabi (Karim Agabi): astronomer, *St√©phane Beausire: boilermaker, welder, *Jean Elegoet: vehicle mechanic, *Jean-Fran√ßois Jurvilliers: multipurpose technician, *Guillaume Dargaud: climatologist, (under contract with the Italian National Antarctic Research Program ‚Äì PNRA) In September 2005 the highest temperature was ‚àí48 ¬∞C, with an average in August of ‚àí60.2 ¬∞C and a record of ‚àí78.6 ¬∞C on 1 September. At these temperatures, trips outside had to be performed with the utmost care. Those going outside travelled at least in pairs and were equipped with a radio, spare batteries and a full fleece suit, with only the eyes at times visible. Glaciologist Italian Emanuele Salvietti had to take snow samples every day one kilometre from the base. As he had to walk (because no vehicle operates at these temperatures), he built a full face mask, with only a pipe to breathe. The slightest mistake would lead to certain injury, as astronomer Agabi Karim explained: \\"Burns on the cheeks and eyelashes glued to the lens of the telescope,\\" after exposure to the freezing cold.

It had a population of 6,481 in the 2011 census and is situated east- northeast of Birmingham, southeast of Sutton Coldfield, south of Tamworth and northwest of Coventry by road. Location Coleshill is located on a ridge between the rivers Cole and Blythe which converge to the north with the River Tame. It is just to the east of the border with West Midlands county outside Birmingham. According to the 2001 census statistics it is part of the West Midlands conurbation, despite gaps of open green belt land between Coleshill and the rest of the conurbation. The green belt narrows to approximately to the north near Water Orton, and to approximately at the southern tip of the settlement boundary where Coleshill becomes Coleshill Heath, but is in excess of wide at some points in between. History Coleshill began life in the Iron Age, before the Roman conquest of 43AD at the Grimstock Hill Romano- British settlement, north of the River Cole. Evidence of hut circles was found by archaeologists at the end of the 1970s. These excavations showed that throughout the Roman period there was a Romano-Celtic temple on Grimstock Hill. It had developed over the earlier Iron Age huts and had gone through at least three phases of development. The area was at the junction of two powerful Celtic Tribes ‚Äì the Coritanii to the east from Leicester, and to the west the Cornovii from Viroconium Cornoviorum. In the post Roman or Arthurian period (The Dark Ages), the nucleus of Coleshill moved about a kilometre to the south, to the top of the hill. Here the present church is set and the medieval town developed around it. By 1066 the town was a Royal Manor held by King Edward the Confessor and is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as land held by William the Conqueror and the site of the court for the ancient hundred of Coleshill.Open Domesday Online: Coleshill, Warwickshire In 1284/5 John de Clinton, elder, was granted Coleshill Manor by King Henry II, and claimed by prescription within the lordship of Coleshill, Assize of bread and ale, gallows, pillory, tumbrell and court leet, infangthef and utfangthef, a market, fair, and free warren. He died in 1316. His heir was his 12-year-old grandson, John, who subsequently married a daughter of Sir Roger Hilary, and died in 1353 or 1354 leaving one daughter Joan. She had as her first husband Sir John de Montfort, illegitimate son of Sir Peter de Montfort of Beaudesert. Coleshill Manor then passed to this branch of the de Montford's who moated the manor houses at Coleshill and Kingshurst. King Henry VII granted Coleshill Manor and its lands to Simon Digby in 1496 following the execution and forfeiture of Sir Simon de Montford for supporting the rebellion of Perkin Warbeck. The (Wingfield-Digby) family descendants still hold the titles. Coleshill village was granted a market charter by King John in 1207, alongside Liverpool, Leek and Great Yarmouth.. During the era of coaching and the turnpike trusts, Coleshill became important as a major staging post on the coaching roads from London to Chester, Liverpool and Holyhead. At one point there were over twenty inns in the town. The Coleshill to Lichfield Turnpike dates from 1743. Notable buildings Church of St Peter and St Paul Many former coaching inns remain in Coleshill, mostly along the High Street and Coventry Road. One of the most notable buildings in the town is the parish's Church of St Peter and St Paul at the top of the Market Square. It has a 52-metre (170 ft) high steeple, one of the finest in Warwickshire, dating from the 13th century. Inside there is a 12th-century font of Norman origin, which is one of the finest examples in the country. There are also medieval table tombs with effigies of Knights, including John de Clinton. Just outside the south door are the preserved remains of a medieval cross. The Market Square is also the location of the town's pillory and whipping post. Historically these were used to punish drunks, and bakers who sold underweight loaves. Today though, they are one of the town's tourist attractions, having been restored and preserved by the Gascoigne family, a local family who have run businesses in Coleshill for over 100 years. A bronze sculpture by Peter Walker in the High Street shows three themes of the towns origins: a stagecoach wheel, a visiting circus elephant and the creation of the Typhoo Tea brand by John Sumner. Transport Coleshill Parkway The town is close to the M6, M6 Toll and M42 motorways. It is on Junction 4 of the M6, with Birmingham City Centre at Junction 6, Sutton Coldfield J5, Nuneaton, Bedworth and Coventry North at J3 and Coventry East at Junction 2. The town is connected to East Birmingham by the B4114 Road which subsequently creates a road connection into the City Centre. There is also a route to Coventry via the A446, which becomes the A452 just before the A45 road junction at Stonebridge, West Midlands. The A4114 road now takes you to the city centre ring road A4053 after the A45 was diverted to run south of Coventry acting as a bypass. Until 2007, the town's nearest railway station was at Water Orton, some to the north-west, but a new station opened as Coleshill Parkway, adjacent to the old Forge Mills site and about east of Water Orton, on 19 August 2007 approximately 16 weeks behind schedule due to construction delays. It is on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line and is served half hourly by CrossCountry as part of their service between Birmingham, Nuneaton, Leicester, Peterborough, Cambridge and Stansted Airport. A number of bus routes serve the town, including one to Birmingham, the Number X70 Route which terminates in Chelmsley Wood operated by National Express West Midlands. The new railway station also has an interchange serving a direct Sutton Coldfield ‚Äì Coleshill - Birmingham Airport bus connection. Twin Town Coleshill has been twinned with Chassieu near Lyon in France since 1983.

As Justice Attache, Levinson managed the U.S. government's diplomatic relationship with the Iraqi judiciary and its Chief Justice, Medhat al Mahmoud, and advanced the establishment of Major Crimes Courts where terrorists were prosecuted. Although stationed at the U.S. Embassy inside the International Zone, Levinson traveled to other population centers and provinces throughout Iraq, meeting with military and civilian leaders who were responsible for the administration of the rule of law in Iraq. In 2008, he worked in Kabul, Afghanistan as a Rule of Law and Courts Advisor. In this role, he collaborated with members of the Supreme Court of Afghanistan and helped draft and advance guidelines and procedures for establishing and resourcing commercial courts in Afghanistan to adjudicate business, contract and related civil conflicts. Upon his return to the U.S. in early 2009, a bipartisan group of Republican and Democratic lawmakers, business professionals, attorneys and community stakeholders endorsed his appointment to the N.C. Superior Court. As a Superior Court Judge, Levinson holds court in counties all across western, central and eastern N.C. and presides over violent crimes against persons (homicide, sexual assault, armed robbery, serious assault) as well as civil conflicts (complex business disputes, class action, property).  Adjunct Instructor  Levinson has taught as an adjunct instructor at a variety of N.C. colleges and universities, including (1) UNC-Chapel Hill School of Government, where he taught an offering on Ethics in the Masters of Public Administration Program; (2) the Charlotte School of Law, where he has taught offerings on Juvenile Law, Remedies, Appellate Advocacy, and Civil Litigation; and (3) the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he has taught courses in American Constitutional Law. Levinson has presented lectures to other state court judges through the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges and the UNC-Chapel Hill Institute of Government.  Community  Judge Levinson presently serves as a member of the Board of Advisors for Serving Alto Cayma, a mission originating in the Charlotte area that serves a large community in Peru; the Board of Advisors for the Wildacres Leadership Institute, a leading leadership organization based in Raleigh; and the Administration of Justice Committee for the North Carolina Bar Association. Levinson is an active member of Charlotte Rotary, too. Levinson was chosen as a \\"Friday Fellow\\" in 2006‚Äînamed after former UNC system president and respected educator William C. Friday‚Äîand completed a two-year leadership and human relations program sponsored by the Wildacres Leadership Institute. Levinson was formerly a Board member of Substance Abuse Prevention Services; Hands on Charlotte; and the Alumni Council for the Fund for American Studies, a Washington-based nonprofit engaged in the education of college students about public policy, journalism, and philanthropy. Levinson was also formerly involved in the Charlotte Jaycees and, in 2003, was honored with the Fund for American Studies' Outstanding Young Alumnus Award.  Education  Judge Eric Levinson is a native North Carolinian who gained his Juris Doctorate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law where he was President of the Student Bar Association. He obtained a BBA in Finance, cum laude, at the University of Georgia, where he was an Honors Program student. He also completed the Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems through the Fund for American Studies in Washington, D.C. and Georgetown University, and completed an overseas studies program in International Finance hosted by the University of London, England. He is a certified Superior Court mediator, too, having completed the required training in 2004, and is an N.C. Certified Juvenile Court Judge. Electoral history In 2014, Levinson unsuccessfully sought a seat as an Associate Justice of the NC Supreme Court. He finished second in a three-way May 6 primary election with 328,062 votes (36.57%), behind first place finisher Robin Hudson (the incumbent), who received 381,836 votes (42.56%). Jeanette Doran finished third with 187,273 votes (20.87%). Hudson and Levinson advanced to the general election, which was held on November 4. Hudson defeated Levinson by receiving 1,283,478 votes (52.46%) to Levinson's 1,163,022 votes (47.54%). Robin Hudson was re-elected to the Supreme Court for another eight-year term that will not expire until 2022.

Active during the years c.1640 to 1671, he was one of the last traditionally trained Irish Gaelic scholars, and was a member of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh, a leading family of northern Connacht. His best-known work is the Leabhar na nGenealach, which was published in 2004 as The Great Book of Irish Genealogies, by √âamonn de B√∫rca, more than 300 years after it had been written. Family and education Mac Fhirbhisigh was most likely born at the family castle, in the parish of Lackan, Tireragh, County Sligo, sometime in the first quarter of the 17th century. He was originally known as Dubhaltach Og (\\"young Dubhaltach\\") to distinguish him from his grandfather, Dubhaltach M√≥r (\\"big Dubhaltach\\"). He was the eldest of four sons born to Giolla Iosa Mor Mac Fhirbhisigh and an unnamed daughter of Eoghan Gruamadha Mac Diarmada of the Sliocht Cormaic Oig Mac Diarmada of Tireragh. It is unknown whether he himself was married or had children. On page nine of his Introduction to The Great Book of Irish Genealogies, Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le writes: It is possible that he had received some sort of formal education in Galway, studying English, Latin and some Greek. This is implied from his use of all three languages in his works. There is also the possibility that he received additional training at the Mac Aodhag√°in bardic school located at Ballymacegan, Lough Derg, County Tipperary, which was run by noted scholar, Flann Mac Aodhag√°in. Mac Fhirbhisigh's friends and acquaintances included Flann Mac Aodhagain, John Lynch, Patrick D'Arcy, Mary Bonaventure Browne, Dathi Og O Dubhda, Sir James Ware, Sir Diarmuid √ì Seachnasaigh, Eoin √ì Gn√≠mh and Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Flaithbheartaigh. His contemporaries include Peregrine O'Duignan, M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh, Richard Martyn, Daibhidh √ì Duibhgheann√°in, Fr. P√°draig √ì Fiannachta, and Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim. Mac Fhirbhisigh's career as a scholar overlapped with a devastating period of war, famine, and plague in Ireland (the Irish Confederate Wars of 1641‚Äì1653) but, curiously, he never mentions contemporary politics or events in his works. Emergence in 1643 The first certain date that can be associated with Dubhaltach is 5 May 1643, when he was situated at Ballymacegan translating the ancient glossary Duil Laithne (\\"the book of Latin\\"). In that year he transcribed from an old Mac Aodhagan manuscript what is now known as the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland. According to a Latin note prefixed to the manuscript, it was made for Rev. Dr. John Lynch, then Archdeacon of Tuam. It may also have been in 1643 that he transcribed Beatha Neimheadh Deidheanach (a legal tract) and the Chronicon Scotorum. Both of these may have been further copies made by Mac Fhirbhisigh at the behest of John Lynch. Seanchas S√≠l √çr At some point between 1643 and early 1645, Dubhaltach moved to the town of Galway, where in April 1645 he completed a transcription of the seventy- page historical-genealogical compilation called Seanchas S√≠l √çr. His source can be shown to be the late 14th-century manuscript called The Book of U√≠ Mhaine (also known as the Book of √ì Dubhag√°in). Dubhaltach's very faithful transcript is especially valuable as four of the original fourteen folios have since been lost. Work for the Poor Clares On 8 December 1647 Dubhaltach noted that he had completed the translation ‚Äì from English into Irish ‚Äì of part of one book and all of a second concerning the Rule of St. Clare, and related matters. This translation was commissioned by Mother Mary Bonaventure Browne, Abbess of the Order of the Poor Clares in Galway. The initial section had been copied by Brother M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh in 1636, and it was left to Mac Fhirbhisigh to complete it. He states in a note that his place of writing was the \\"College of Galway\\", most probably the college-house of the Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas, Galway. The college house was demolished in 1836, though the church itself is still in regular use. The Poor Clares are now based on Nun's Island in Galway city centre. Leabhar na nGenealach In April 1649 Mac Fhirbhisigh was working on what would come to be considered his magnum opus, Leabhar na nGenealach, or the Book of Genealogies. Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le describes it as \\"a compilation of Irish genealogical lore relating to the principal Gaelic and Anglo-Norman families of Ireland and covering the period from pre-Christian times to the mid-17th century and collected from a variety of sources.\\" The fact that many of these sources no longer exist adds considerably to the value of Mac Fhirbhisigh's work. This is particularly true of items held at Lackan by the Mac Fhirbhisighs. It is not known how long Dubhaltach spent collecting the necessary materials and planning the book's layout. Nor is it known when he commenced writing; he does note that on the \\"13 April, in Galway, 1649\\", he had completed a fifty-page tract on the genealogies of the Ui Bhruin down to \\"do shlioch Brian mc Eathach Muighmheadhoin/the lineage of Brian son of Eochaidh Muighmheadhoin.\\" That August saw him complete a catalogue of the Kings of Ireland, from Parthol√≥n to Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, entitled R√©im R√≠oghraidhe √âireann. He names the source of this material as Leabhar Airisean Fhearghail U√≠ Ghadhra, an alternative name for the Annals of the Four Masters. Exactly how this work reached Galway has never been explained. R√©im R√≠oghraidhe √âireann was completed on 8 August 1649, just as the bubonic plague entered Galway on a Spanish ship. Over the next nine months it killed some 3,700 of the town's inhabitants. Of Dubhaltach's whereabouts and activities in this period, √ì Mura√≠le has the following to say: In fact Dubhaltach's only remark thought to be connected with this time is what √ì Mura√≠le calles a \\"breathtaking understatement\\" that Dubhaltach writes in the D√≠onbhrollach (preface): With most of the text compiled, Dubhaltach added an index of just under three thousand entries, an index being rare in a Gaelic manuscript. This was completed on the Feast of the Holy Innocents (28 December 1650) just as English parliamentary forces, completing the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, crossed the Shannon. In July, these forces, under Sir Charles Coote, began a nine-month siege of Galway which ended in the town's surrender in April 1652. As in earlier periods of his life, Dubhaltach's activities in this period are unknown. In July 1653 at an unknown location, perhaps still in County Galway, he added further material, along with a separate index to the book's list of Saint's pedigrees. √ì Mura√≠le identifies one of his probable sources for this material as \\"one of two early-12th-century manuscript-recensions of the work known as the Irish Liber Hynorum, while another was the great early-15th-century manuscript now known as the Leabhar Breac (formerly Leabhar More Duna Daighre).\\" As the latter seems to have been held during the length of the 17th century at the Franciscan convent of Ceineal Fheichin, Abby, County Galway, it may hold a clue to Mac Fhirbhisigh's location at some point after the fall of Galway. 1656 to 1662 In April 1656, Dubhaltach acted as a witness to his hereditary lord, Dathi Og O Dubhda (David O Dowd) upon his marriage to Dorothy O Down. He may have drafted the \\"Articles of Agreement\\" or marriage articles, in English. Two other Mac Fhirbihisgh's, his brother Seamus and cousin Myles, are also listed as witnesses. In the same year he compiled a work on legendary Irish authors. It is now lost apart from a partial copy begun in May 1657. The final part of it, comprising about a third of the total, was only completed in the spring of 1666. In October 1657 ‚Äì on a Sunday ‚Äì Dubhaltach was writing in Sligo town, beside the ruined Dominican Abbey. His presence there was in direct contravention of a Cromwellian edict that forbade Catholics to approach or enter towns such as Sligo. Added to that, his working on a Sunday would have further aroused Puritan ire. His labour was adding further material to Leabhar na nGenealach from manuscripts no longer extant. The tracts included S√©anadh Saighre and Do Fhorshloinntibh √âireann. After this he disappears until around 1662 when he is named in an official report as liable to pay hearth-tax for a dwelling in Castletown, just a few miles north of his native Lackan. Also around this time, he is mentioned in print for the only time in his life, in Cambrensis Eversus, by John Lynch. Sir James Ware During 1665 and 1666, Dubhaltach was employed in Dublin by Sir James Ware, providing him with English translations of parts of certain Irish tracts. These included extracts from the Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of Tigernach for the years 1174‚Äì1281 and 1172‚Äì1178, respectively. From the archives of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh he drew upon documents and sources to write a tract, in English, on early and medieval Irish bishops. Few of his sources are now in existence. Much of this was used for Ware's final work, De Praesulibus Hiberniae, a history of Irish bishops published in 1665. Cuimre na nGenealach The following spring Mac Fhirbhisigh had returned home to Tireragh. On St. Patrick's Day he began compiling a catalogue, in Irish, of early bishops and extinct Irish bishoprics. On Monday 2 April 1666 he began work on the Cuimre na nGenealach, an ambitious, revised abridgement (or in Irish, cumire) of Leabhar na nGenealach. He continued work on the project into the summer but it is not known if he ever completed it as the original was lost and two surviving copies appear incomplete. Return to Dublin Mac Fhirbhisigh had returned to work for Ware in Dublin by early November. On 6 November 1666 he commenced a translation, into English, of part of the Annals of Lackan. This work too is lost, and his translation of the years 1443‚Äì68 is almost all that survives of a work compiled by members of his own family since before 1397. With the death of Sir James on 1 December, Dubhaltach's employment and time in Dublin came to an end. Final years and death After the death of Sir James, Mac Fhirbhisigh may have travelled to Gort, seeking patronage from Diarmuid √ì Seachnasaigh (Sir Dermot O Shaughnessey), as indicated by a poem he apparently composed in 1667. It is thought that also in this year or shortly after he obtained a copy of the important early Irish law tract, Senchas M√°r. It seems he also travelled to Larne in County Antrim, seeking patronage from Randall MacDonnell, Marquess of Antrim. Here it seems he left or sold about twelve or more manuscripts to a local bard, Eoin √ì Gn√≠mh. Nothing more is known of Mac Fhirbhisigh until January 1671, when his friend Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Flaithbheartaigh noted in a manuscript: \\"1670/1 mense Janu: Dualdus Firbisius obiit, a Thoma Croftono occisus.\\" Mac Fhirbhisigh was stabbed to death by local man Thomas Crofton, at a shebeen near the village of Skreen, County Sligo. The circumstances of Mac Fhirbhisigh's death were related by Eugene O'Curry as follows: He appears to have been buried at his local church, Kilglass (Cill Molaise). Fate of his manuscripts According to Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Flaithbheartaigh ‚Äì as noted by Edward Lhuyd ‚Äì Dubhaltach's manuscripts passed on his death to his lord, David O Dowd. √ì Flaithbheartaigh himself obtained Dubhaltach's transcript of Chronicum Scotorum. William O Sullivan believed that his law manuscripts were passed on to John Conry via the library of Tadhg O'Roddy. In 1702 Dubhaltach's genealogical works were in the possession of merchant and part-time scribe, Henry MacCarrick of Sligo. Leabhar na nGenealach was in this possession till 1705, while the Cuimre disappears after 1706, fate unknown (there exists a possibility that it was in the possession of Richard Tipper of Dublin, scribe, in the years 1710‚Äì30, as he made a copy of it). Leabhar na nGenealach next came into the hands of Seamus Bacach Mag Uidhir of An Leargaidh (Dowra-Blacklion area) who made a copy in 1715 or 1716 at Stranamart, north-west County Cavan. It is of poor value overall. A transcript of R√©im R√≠oghraidhe √âireann was made by him at Doobally in 1713. It next appeared in Dublin, held by John Conry, who penned extracts from it on 24 July 1723. He may have obtained it from the library of Tadhg O Rodaighe (Thady Roddy of Crossfield, County Leitrim). It was sold in 1731 to Dr. John Fergus (Eoin O Fearghusa) of Jervis Street, Dublin, though originally from County Mayo. Dr. Fergus also acquired the anonymous copy of the Cuimre. Following his death and that of his son, Dr. Fergus's daughter put his extensive library up for auction at their home in Abbey Street, Dublin, on 3 February 1766. Leabhar na nGenealach was purchased by Robert Jocelyn ( who became 1st Earl of Roden in 1771) for ¬£7.1.0. For much of the next hundred and fifty years it was placed at the Jocelyn family home of Tollymore House, Newcastle, County Down, who were in part descended through a female line from the local Magennis clan. During this time extensive use of Leabhar na nGenealach was made by Charles O'Conor (1770s), Thady Connellan (1830s), John O'Donovan (MacCarrick's version) and Eugene O'Curry, who transcribed in between March 1836 and February 1837. Upon the death of the 6th Earl of Roden in 1911, it was included in a list of items sold to cover his death duties. The auction was held at Sotheby's of London on 10 November 1911, and the manuscript was purchased by Dublin physician Michael F. Cox, for ¬£79.00. Dr. Cox died on 20 February 1926, and his son, Dublin solicitor Arthur Cox, oversaw his father's bequest of the manuscript to University College Dublin on 23 March 1926, \\"to be perpetually preserved in its library.\\" During the 20th century it was consulted by several scholars such as Eoin MacNeill, Eleanor Knott, Michael V. Duignan, Toirdehealbhach O Raithbhearthaigh, Margaret Emmeline Dobbs and most especially by Father Paul Walsh. Study of it by Mayoman Nollaig √ì Mura√≠le commenced in 1971; this process ended with its publication in five volumes by De Burca books in 2004. Personal life There are no substantial surviving details of Dubhaltach's personal life. It is unknown whether he married or ever had children. His brothers were Padraig (fl. 1663), Diarmaid, and Seamus (fl. 1656) but no sisters are mentioned. Nor does he record the year his father died, or even his mother's name. During the 1690s, one \\"Dudley Forbissy, Ardneere, clerk, commonly called Prior of the Abbey of Ardnaree\\" appears on a list of persons \\"Outlawed for Foreign Treason\\". However, the precise identity of this Father Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh of the Order of St. Augustine is not known. In 1842, a letter (dated 15 August 1842, Dublin) was received by the Royal Irish Academy from one John Mac Firbis, a farmer, \\"in a humble state of poverty,\\" from the parish of Lackan, County Sligo. He stated that he was \\"fifth in descent from the younger and only brother [sic] of Duald Mac Firbis,\\" that, \\"the sisters of the said Duald ... retired into Spain, where they ended their lives in a convent.\\" Having been informed that works by Dubhaltach and his family were in the possession of the R.I.A., Mac Firbis stated that he \\"humbly hopes, from the honor and humanity of the Noblemen and Gentlemen composing the Royal Irish Academy, that he will be allowed some consideration for those works of his ancestors.\\" Mac Firbis is listed as John Forbes in the 1834 Tithe Allotments but there is no trace of him or his family in the 1856 Griffith's Valuation. O Muralie suggests that as the letter was written in Dublin, Mac Firbis and his family may have been seeking financial aid while emigrating from Ireland. Under the Anglicised surname Forbes, descendants of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh are still to be found in small numbers in north Mayo, mainly in and about the town of Ballina. Legacy MacFhirbhisigh's endeavours ensured the survival of several invaluably important sources of medieval and early Irish history. These include three annals, an early Irish law tract, material on ecclesiastical matters, and translations. His supreme achievement however remains Leabhar na nGenealach, which together with the Cuimre, is comparable in size and scope to the Annals of the Four Masters. Yet it is especially astonishing as it was written by just one man, without any known patron, while the Four Masters was written by a team funded by Feargal O'Gara. Yet even beyond this, his importance as a collector and transmitter has been noted by the likes of William O Sullivan and Tomas O Concheannain.

Those who advocate new eugenics generally think selecting or altering embryos should be left to the preferences of parents, rather than forbidden (or left to the preferences of the state). New eugenics references eugenics, an ideology that promotes the genetic improvement of a given population by excluding groups of people which are deemed lesser.  History  New eugenics is distinguished from previous versions of eugenics by its emphasis on informed parental choice rather than coercive governmental control. Eugenics is sometimes broken into the categories of positive eugenics (encouraging reproduction among the designated \\"fit\\") and negative eugenics (discouraging reproduction among those designated \\"unfit\\"). Another distinction is between coercive eugenics and non-coercive eugenics. According to Edwin Black, many positive eugenic programs were advocated and pursued during the early 20th century, but the negative programs were responsible for the compulsory sterilization of hundreds of thousands of persons in many countries, and were contained in much of the rhetoric of Nazi eugenic policies of racial hygiene and genocide. New eugenics belongs to the positive eugenics category. Bioethicists generally consider coercive eugenics more difficult to justify than non-coercive eugenics, though coercive laws forbidding cousin marriage, for example, are widely considered justified. Compulsory sterilization of those deemed unfit is a form of coercive eugenics that has been overwhelmingly rejected, and is illegal under many national and international laws.  New eugenics practices  New eugenics generally supports genetic modification or genetic selection of individuals for traits that are likely to improve human welfare. The underlying idea is to improve the genetic basis of future generations and reduce incidence of genetic diseases and other undesirable traits. Some of the practices included in new eugenics are: pre-implantation diagnosis and embryo selection, selective breeding, and human enhancement through the use of genetic technologies, such as embryo engineering or gene therapy. Ethics  New eugenics was founded under the liberal ethical values of pluralism, which advocates for the respect of personal autonomy, and egalitarianism, which represents the idea of equality for all people. Arguments used in favor of new eugenics include that it is in the best interest of society that life succeeds rather than fail, and that it is acceptable to ensure that progeny has a chance of achieving this success. Ethical arguments against new eugenics include the claim that creating designer babies is not in the best interest of society as it might create a breach between genetically modified individuals and natural individuals. Additionally, some of these technologies might be economically restrictive further increasing the socio-economical gap. Dov Fox, a law professor at the University of San Diego, argues that new eugenics cannot be justified on the basis of the underlying liberal theory which inspires its name. He argues that heritable mental and physical capacities that are generally valued can be considered as alternative to John Rawls's social primary goods. In this case, natural primary goods. Fox suggests that reprogenetic technologies like embryo selection, cellular surgery, and human genetic engineering, which aim to enhance general purpose traits in offspring are practices a liberal government leaves to the discretion of parents than like practices the state makes compulsory. Fox argues that if the liberal commitment to autonomy is important enough for the state to mandate childrearing practices such as health care and basic education, that very same interest is important enough for the state to mandate safe, effective, and functionally integrated genetic practices that act on analogous all-purpose traits such as resistance to disease and general cognitive functioning. He concludes that the liberal case for compulsory eugenics is a reductio ad absurdum against liberal theory. The United Nations International Bioethics Committee wrote that new eugenics should not be confused with the ethical problems of the 20th century eugenics movements. Regardless, they have stated that it is still problematic as it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new ways of discrimination and stigmatization against those who do not want or cannot afford the enhancements.

She is primarily known for her death by falling down a flight of stairs, the circumstances of which have often been regarded as suspicious. Amy Robsart was the only child of a substantial Norfolk gentleman and at nearly 18 married Robert Dudley, a son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. In 1553 Robert Dudley was condemned to death and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where Amy Dudley was allowed to visit him. After his release the couple lived in straitened financial circumstances until, with the accession of Elizabeth I in late 1558, Dudley became Master of the Horse, an important court office. The Queen soon fell in love with him and there was talk that Amy Dudley, who did not follow her husband to court, was suffering from an illness, and that Elizabeth would perhaps marry her favourite should his wife die. The rumours grew more sinister when Elizabeth remained single against the common expectation that she would accept one of her many foreign suitors. Amy Dudley lived with friends in different parts of the country, having her own household and hardly ever seeing her husband. In the morning of 8 September 1560, at Cumnor Place near Oxford, she insisted on sending away her servants and later was found dead at the foot of a flight of stairs with a broken neck and two wounds on her head. The coroner's jury's finding was that she had died of a fall downstairs; the verdict was \\"misfortune\\", accidental death. Amy Dudley's death caused a scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely suspected to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view not shared by most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage with him. A tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's violent death evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence. Life Portrait miniature of an unknown lady, possibly Amy Robsart on the occasion of her wedding, 1550 Amy Robsart was born in Norfolk, the heiress of a substantial gentleman-farmer and grazier, Sir John Robsart of Syderstone, and his wife, Elizabeth Scott. Amy Robsart grew up at her mother's house, Stanfield Hall (near Wymondham), and, like her future husband, in a firmly Protestant household.Skidmore 2010 pp. 15‚Äì16 She received a good education and wrote in a fine hand.Skidmore 2010 p. 17 Three days before her 18th birthday she married Robert Dudley, a younger son of John Dudley, Earl of Warwick. Amy and Robert, who were of the same age, probably first met about ten months before their wedding.Wilson 1981 pp. 33, 43; Skidmore 2010 p. 15 The wedding contract of May 1550 specified that Amy would inherit her father's estate only after both her parents' death,Skidmore 2010 p. 23 and after the marriage the young couple depended heavily on both their fathers' gifts, especially Robert's.Haynes 1987 pp. 20‚Äì21; Loades 1996 p. 225 It was most probably a love-match, a \\"carnal marriage\\", as the wedding guest William Cecil later commented disapprovingly.Skidmore 2010 pp. 19‚Äì20; Adams 2008 The marriage was celebrated on 4 June 1550 at the royal palace of Sheen, with Edward VI in attendance.Wilson 1981 p. 44 The Earl of Warwick and future Duke of Northumberland was the most powerful man in England, leading the government of the young King Edward VI. The match, though by no means a prize, was acceptable to him as it strengthened his influence in Norfolk.Loades 1996 p. 179; Skidmore 2010 pp. 19, 24 The young couple dwelt mostly at court or with Amy's parents-in-law at Ely House; in the first half of 1553 they lived at Somerset House, Robert Dudley being keeper of this great Renaissance palace. In May 1553 Lady Jane Grey became Amy Dudley's sister-in- law, and after her rule of a fortnight as England's queen, Robert Dudley was sentenced to death and imprisoned in the Tower of London.Loades 2004 pp. 121, 125, 127; Loades 1996 pp. 266, 271 He remained there from July 1553 until October 1554; from September 1553 Amy was allowed to visit \\"and there to tarry with\\" him at the Tower's Lieutenant's pleasure.Skidmore 2010 pp. 38, 393 Lord Robert Dudley, Amy Robsart's husband c. 1560 After his release Robert Dudley was short of money and he and Amy were helped out financially by their families. Their lifestyle had to remain modest, though, and Lord Robert (as he was known) was heaping up considerable debts. Sir John Robsart died in 1554; his wife followed him to the grave in the spring of 1557, which meant that the Dudleys could inherit the Robsart estate with the Queen's permission.Skidmore 2010 pp. 45‚Äì46, 59; Loades 1996 p. 273 Lady Amy's ancestral manor house of Syderstone had been uninhabitable for many decades,Skidmore 2010 p. 15 and the couple were now living in Throcking, Hertfordshire, at the house of William Hyde, when not in London. In August 1557 Robert Dudley went to fight for Philip II of Spain (who was then Mary I's husband) at the Battle of St. Quentin in France.Loades 1996 p. 273 From this time a business letter from Amy Dudley survives, settling some debts of her husband's in his absence, \\"although I forgot to move my lord thereof before his departing, he being sore troubled with weighty affairs, and I not being altogether in quiet for his sudden departing\\".Adams 1995 pp. 380‚Äì381 In the summer of 1558 Robert and Amy Dudley were looking for a suitable residence of their own in order to settle in Norfolk; nothing came of this, however, before the death of Queen Mary I in November 1558.Wilson 1981 pp. 76‚Äì77 Upon the accession of Elizabeth I Robert Dudley became Master of the Horse and his place was now at court at almost constant attendance on the Queen.Wilson 1981 p. 78 By April 1559 Queen Elizabeth seemed to be in love with Lord Robert, and several diplomats reported that some at court already speculated that the Queen would marry him, \\"in case his wife should die\\",Wilson 1981 pp. 95‚Äì96 as Lady Dudley was very ill in one of her breasts. Very soon court observers noted that Elizabeth never let Robert Dudley from her side.Chamberlin 1939 p. 101 He visited his wife at Throcking for a couple of days at Easter 1559, and Amy Dudley came to London in May 1559 for about a month.Adams 1995 p. 378 At this time, on 6 June, the new Spanish ambassador de Quadra wrote that her health had improved, but that she was careful with her food.Adams 1995 p. 68 She also made a trip to Suffolk; by September she was residing in the house of Sir Richard Verney at Compton Verney in Warwickshire.Adams 1995 pp. 382‚Äì383 By the autumn of 1559 several foreign princes were vying for the Queen's hand; indignant at Elizabeth's little serious interest in their candidate,Skidmore 2010 pp. 162, 165 the Spanish ambassador de Quadra and his Imperial colleague were informing each other and their superiors that Lord Robert was sending his wife poison and that Elizabeth was only fooling them, \\"keeping Lord Robert's enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated\\".Skidmore 2010 pp. 166‚Äì168, 356‚Äì357 Parts of the nobility also held Dudley responsible for Elizabeth's failure to marry, and plots to assassinate him abounded.Doran 1996 p. 42 In March 1560 de Quadra informed Philip II: \\"Lord Robert told somebody ‚Ä¶ that if he live another year he will be in a very different position from now. ‚Ä¶ They say that he thinks of divorcing his wife.\\"Chamberlin 1939 p. 119 Lady Amy never saw her husband again after her London visit in 1559. A projected trip of his to visit her and other family never materialized.Adams 1995 p. 383; Skidmore 2010 p. 224 Queen Elizabeth did not really allow her favourite a wife; according to a contemporary court chronicle, he \\"was commanded to say that he did nothing with her, when he came to her, as seldom he did\\". From December 1559 Amy Dudley lived at Cumnor Place, also sometimes known as Cumnor Hall, in the village of Cumnor, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now on the outskirts of Oxford, and in Oxfordshire).Adams 1995 p. 382 The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented by a friend of the Dudleys and possible relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster.Adams 2011 He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner.Skidmore 2010 pp. 59, 169, 172 Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park.Skidmore 2010 p. 171 Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household,Adams 1995 pp. 383‚Äì384; Gristwood 2007 p. 101 which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24 August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.Skidmore 2010 pp. 192, 194, 195 No picture of her is known to have survived, though according to the Imperial ambassador Caspar Breuner, writing in 1559, she was ‚Äòa very beautiful wife‚Äô. Death and inquest On Sunday, 8 September 1560, the day of a fair at Abingdon, Amy Robsart was found dead at the foot of a pair of stairs at Cumnor Place. Robert Dudley, at Windsor Castle with the Queen, was told of her death by a messenger on 9 September and immediately wrote to his steward Thomas Blount, who had himself just departed for Cumnor. He desperately urged him to find out what had happened and to call for an inquest; this had already been opened when Blount arrived.Wilson 1981 pp. 118‚Äì120 He informed his master that Lady Dudley had risen early and > would not that day suffer one of her own sort to tarry at home, and was so > earnest to have them gone to the fair, that with any of her own sort that > made reason of tarrying at home she was very angry, and came to Mrs. > Odingsells ‚Ä¶ who refused that day to go to the fair, and was very angry with > her also. Because [Mrs. Odingsells] said it was no day for gentlewomen to go > ‚Ä¶ Whereunto my lady answered and said that she might choose and go at her > pleasure, but all hers should go; and was very angry. They asked who should > keep her company if all they went; she said Mrs. Owen should keep her > company at dinner; the same tale doth Picto, who doth dearly love her, > confirm. Certainly, my Lord, as little while as I have been here, I have > heard divers tales of her that maketh me judge her to be a strange woman of > mind.Skidmore 2010 pp. 381‚Äì382 Mrs. Picto was Lady Dudley's maid and Thomas Blount asked whether she thought what had happened was \\"chance or villany\\": > she said by her faith she doth judge very chance, and neither done by man > nor by herself. For herself, she said, she was a good virtuous gentlewoman, > and daily would pray upon her knees; and divers times she saith that she > hath heard her pray to God to deliver her from desperation. Then, said I, > she might have an evil toy [suicide] in her mind. No, good Mr. Blount, said > Picto, do not judge so of my words; if you should so gather, I am sorry I > said so much. Blount continued, wondering: > My Lord, it is most strange that this chance should fall upon you. It > passeth the judgment of any man to say how it is; but truly the tales I do > hear of her maketh me to think she had a strange mind in her: as I will tell > you at my coming.Skidmore 2010 p. 382 Amy's last letter to her London tailor on 24 August 1560. The coroner and the 15 jurors were local gentlemen and yeomen of substance.Skidmore 2010 pp. 210, 378; Chamberlin 1939 p. 40 A few days later Blount wrote that some of the jury were no friends of Anthony Forster (a good sign that they would not \\"conceal any fault, if any be\\") and that they were proceeding very thoroughly: > they be very secret, and yet do I hear a whispering that they can find no > presumptions of evil. And if I may say to your Lordship my conscience: I > think some of them be sorry for it, God forgive me. ‚Ä¶ Mine own opinion is > much quieted ‚Ä¶ the circumstances and as many things as I can learn doth > persuade me that only misfortune hath done it, and nothing else.Skidmore > 2010 p. 384 The jury's foreman assured Robert Dudley in a letter of his own that for all they could find out, it appeared to be an accident.Wilson 1981 p. 122 Dudley, desperately seeking to avert damage from what he called \\"my case\\",Gristwood 2007 p. 104 was relieved to hear the impending outcome, but thought \\"another substantial company of honest men\\" should undertake a further investigation \\"for more knowledge of truth\\". This panel should include any available friends of Lady Amy's and her half-brothers John Appleyard and Arthur Robsart, both of whom he had ordered to Cumnor immediately after Amy's death. Nothing came of this proposal.Gristwood 2007 p. 107 The coroner's verdict, pronounced at the local Assizes on 1 August 1561,Skidmore 2010 p. 230 was that Lady Dudley, \\"being alone in a certain chamber ‚Ä¶ accidentally fell precipitously down\\" the adjoining stairs \\"to the very bottom of the same\\".Skidmore 2010 p. 378 She had sustained two head injuries‚Äîone \\"of the depth of a quarter of a thumb\\", the other \\"of the depth of two thumbs\\".Skidmore p. 232 She had also, \\"by reason of the accidental injury or of that fall and of Lady Amy's own body weight falling down the aforesaid stairs\\", broken her neck, \\"on account of which ‚Ä¶ the same Lady Amy then and there died instantly; ‚Ä¶ and thus the jurors say on their oath that the Lady Amy ‚Ä¶ by misfortune came to her death and not otherwise, as they are able to agree at present\\". Amy Dudley was buried at St. Mary's, Oxford, with full pomp,Wilson 1981 pp. 122‚Äì123; Skidmore 2010 p. 217 which cost Dudley some ¬£2,000. He wore mourning for about six months but, as was within custom, did not attend the funeral, where Lady Dudley's half- brothers, neighbours, as well as city and county prominence played the leading parts.Doran 1996 p. 45; Wilson 1981 p. 123; Skidmore 2010 pp. 216‚Äì217; Adams 1995 p. 132 The court went into mourning for over a month; Robert Dudley retired to his house at Kew.Adams, Archer, and Bernard 2003 p. 66 Aftermath Amy Dudley's death, happening amid renewed rumours about the Queen and her favourite, caused \\"grievous and dangerous suspicion, and muttering\\" in the country.Doran 1996 pp. 43, 42 Robert Dudley was shocked,Adams 2008 dreading \\"the malicious talk that I know the wicked world will use\\".Skidmore 2010 p. 379 William Cecil, the Queen's Principal Secretary, felt himself threatened by the prospect of Dudley's becoming king consort and spread rumours against the eventuality.Haigh 2000 p. 16; Skidmore 2010 p. 239 Already knowing of her death before it was officially made public, he told the Spanish ambassador that Lord Robert and the Queen wished to marry and were about to do away with Lady Dudley by poison, \\"giving out that she was ill but she was not ill at all\\".Wilson 1981 pp. 115‚Äì116; Haigh 2000 p. 16 Likewise strongly opposed to a Dudley marriage, Nicholas Throckmorton, the English ambassador in France, went out of his way to draw attention to the scandalous gossip he heard at the French court.Doran 1996 p. 212 Although Cecil and Throckmorton made use of the scandal for their political and personal aims,Doran 1996 p. 212; Gristwood 2007 pp. 108‚Äì109; Skidmore 2010 pp. 243‚Äì244 they did not believe themselves that Robert Dudley had orchestrated his wife's death.HMC 1911 p. viii; Gristwood 2007 pp. 112, 119; Skidmore 2010 p. 223 In October Robert Dudley returned to court, many believed, \\"in great hope to marry the Queen\\".Doran 1996 p. 45 Elizabeth's affection and favour towards him was undiminished, and, importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert, she declared the inquest had shown \\"the matter ‚Ä¶ to be contrary to which was reported\\" and to \\"neither touch his honesty nor her honour.\\"Skidmore 2010 p. 253 However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, which seems to have convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley.Doran 2003 p. 76; Doran 1996 pp. 43, 45 Dudley himself had no illusions about his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: \\"God's will be done; and I wish he had made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me.\\"Skidmore 2010 p. 385 In September 1561, a month after the coroner's verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley's principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.Doran 1996 p. 44; Skidmore 2010 p. 245 John Appleyard John Appleyard had profited in terms of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was nevertheless disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently on behalf of the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of ¬£1,000 in cash.Wilson 1981 p. 182 He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, in the last few years come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law.HMC 1883 p. 350; Skidmore 2010 p. 300, 301, 363 Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation. Some weeks later the Privy Council investigated the allegations about Norfolk, Sussex, and Leicester, and Appleyard found himself in the Fleet prison for about a month. Interrogated by Cecil and a panel of noblemen (among them the Earl of Arundel, but not Robert Dudley), he was commanded to answer in writing what had moved him to implicate \\"my Lord of Norfolk, the Earl of Sussex and others to stir up matter against my Lord of Leicester for the death of his wife\\", and what had moved him to say that \\"the death of the Earl of Leicester's wife\\" was \\"procured by any person\\".Skidmore 2010 pp. 304, 303 Appleyard, instead of giving answers, retracted all his statements; he had also requested to see the coroner's report and, after studying it in his cell, wrote that it fully satisfied him and had dispelled his concerns.Gristwood 2007 p. 115 Early traditions and theories Victorian artist William Frederick Yeames From the early 1560s there was a tradition involving Sir Richard Verney, a gentleman-retainer of Robert Dudley from Warwickshire, in whose house Lady Dudley had stayed in 1559.Skidmore 2010 pp. 356, 358 A 1563 chronicle, which is heavily biased against the House of DudleyAdams, Archer, and Bernard 2003 p. 41 and was probably written by the Protestant activist John Hales,Adams, Archer, and Bernard 2003 pp. 46‚Äì51 describes the rumours: > the Lord Robert's wife brake her neck at Forster's house in Oxfordshire ‚Ä¶ > her gentlewomen being gone forth to a fair. Howbeit it was thought she was > slain, for Sir ----- Varney was there that day and whylest the deed was > doing was going over the fair and tarried there for his man, who at length > came, and he said, thou knave, why tarriest thou? He answered, should I come > before I had done? Hast thou done? quoth Varney. Yeah, quoth the man, I have > made it sure. ‚Ä¶ Many times before it was bruited by the Lord Robert his men > that she was dead. ‚Ä¶ This Verney and divers his servants used before her > death, to wish her death, which made the people to suspect the worse. The first printed version of Amy Robsart's alleged murder appeared in the satirical libel Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious propaganda work against the Earl of Leicester written by Catholic exiles in 1584.Wilson 1981 pp. 251‚Äì253; Jenkins 2002 p. 291 Here Sir Richard Verney goes directly to Cumnor Place, forces the servants to go to the market, and breaks Lady Amy's neck before placing her at the foot of the stairs; the jury's verdict is murder, and she is buried first secretly at the Cumnor parish church before being dug up and reburied at Oxford. Verney dies, communicating \\"that all the devils in hell\\" tore him in pieces; his servant (who was with him at the murder) having been killed in prison by Dudley's means before he could tell the story.Skidmore 2010 pp. 386, 387 Enhanced by the considerable influence of Leicester's Commonwealth, the rumours about Amy Robsart's death developed into a tradition of embellished folklore.Chamberlin 1939 pp. 16‚Äì19, 420‚Äì421; Wilson 1981 p. 124 As early as 1608, a domestic tragedy named A Yorkshire Tragedy alluded to her fall from a pair of stairs as an easy way to get rid of one's wife: \\"A politician did it.\\"Chamberlin 1939 pp. 417‚Äì418 In the 19th century her story became very popular due to the best-selling novel, Kenilworth, by Walter Scott. The novel's arch-villain is again called Varney.Chamberlin 1939 p. 22 The notion that Amy Robsart was murdered gained new strength with the discovery of the Spanish diplomatic correspondence (and with it of poison rumours) by the Victorian historian James Anthony Froude. Generally convinced of Leicester's wretchedness,Chamberlin 1939 pp. 23, 45‚Äì46 he concluded in 1863: \\"she was murdered by persons who hoped to profit by his elevation to the throne; and Dudley himself ‚Ä¶ used private means ‚Ä¶ to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently far.\\"Chamberlin 1939 p. 25 There followed the Norfolk antiquarian Walter Rye with The Murder of Amy Robsart in 1885: here she was first poisoned and then, that method failing, killed by violent means. Rye's main sources were Cecil's talk with de Quadra around the time of Amy Dudley's death and, again, Leicester's Commonwealth.Gristwood 2007 pp. 115‚Äì116 Much more scholarly and influential was an 1870 work by George Adlard, Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leycester, which printed relevant letters and covertly suggested suicide as an explanation.Gristwood 2007 pp. 115, 122 By 1910, A.F. Pollard was convinced that the fact that Amy Robsart's death caused suspicion was \\"as natural as it was incredible ‚Ä¶ But a meaner intelligence than Elizabeth's or even Dudley's would have perceived that murder would make the[ir] marriage impossible.\\"Chamberlin 1939 p. 40 Modern theories The coroner's report came to light in The National Archives in 2008 and is compatible with an accidental fall as well as suicide or other violence.Adams 2011; Skidmore 2010 pp. 230‚Äì233 In the absence of the forensic findings of 1560, it was often assumed that a simple accident could not be the explanationDoran 1996 pp. 42‚Äì44‚Äîon the basis of near-contemporary tales that Amy Dudley was found at the bottom of a short flight of stairs with a broken neck, her headdress still standing undisturbed \\"upon her head\\",Jenkins 2002 p. 65 a detail that first appeared as a satirical remark in Leicester's Commonwealth and has ever since been repeated for a fact.Jenkins 2002 p. 291 To account for such oddities and evidence that she was ill, it was suggested in 1956 by Ian Aird, a professor of medicine, that Amy Dudley might have suffered from breast cancer, which through metastatic cancerous deposits in the spine, could have caused her neck to break under only limited strain, such as a short fall or even just coming down the stairs. This explanation has gained wide acceptance. Another popular theory has been that Amy Dudley took her own life; because of illness or depression, her melancholy and \\"desperation\\" being traceable in some sources.Doran 1996 p. 44; Gristwood 2007 p. 121 As further arguments for suicide have been forwarded the fact that she insisted on sending her servants away and that her maid Picto, Thomas Blount, and perhaps Robert Dudley himself alluded to the possibility.Gristwood 2007 pp. 121‚Äì122; Doran 1996 p. 44 A few modern historians have considered murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's death on the grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive and that he was the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal.Weir 1999 p. 109 Against this idea it has been argued that he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position.Gristwood 2007 p. 119; Skidmore 2010 p. 357 The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c. 1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth.Bernard 2000 pp. 169‚Äì174; Skidmore 2010 p. 355 This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip,Adams, Archer, and Bernard 2003 p. 66; Adams 2011 poison being a stock- in-trade accusation in the 16th century.Gristwood 2007 p. 97 That Robert Dudley might have influenced the jury has been argued by George Bernard, Susan Doran, and by Chris Skidmore. The foreman, Sir Richard Smith (mayor of Abingdon in 1564/1565), had been a household servant of Princess Elizabeth and is described as a former \\"Queen's man\\" and a \\"lewd\\" person in Hales' 1563 chronicle, while Dudley gave a \\"Mr. Smith\\", also a \\"Queen's man\\", a present of some stuffs to make a gown from in 1566; six years after the inquest.Doran 1996 pp. 228; Bernard 2000 pp. 170‚Äì171; Skidmore 2010 pp. 369‚Äì370 It has, however, not been established that Sir Richard Smith and the \\"Mr. Smith\\" of 1566 are one and the same person, Smith being a \\"very common\\" name.Doran 1996 p. 228; Bernard 2000 p. 171 Susan Doran has pointed out that any interference with the jury could be as easily explained by the desire to cover up a suicide rather than a murder. Most modern historians have exonerated Robert Dudley from murder or a cover-up.Doran 1996 p. 44 Apart from alternatives for a murder plot as causes for Amy Robsart's death, his correspondence with Thomas Blount and William Cecil in the days following has been cited as proofs of his innocence; the letters, which show signs of an agitated mind, making clear his bewilderment and unpreparedness.Gristwood 2007 pp. 114, 115; Skidmore 2010 pp. 237‚Äì238; Adams 2002 p. 136 It has also been judged as highly unlikely that he would have orchestrated the death of his wife in a manner which laid him open to such a foreseeable scandal.Weir 1999 p. 107; Wilson 2005 p. 275; Chamberlin 1939 p. 40 See also * Cultural depictions of Elizabeth I of England * List of unsolved deaths Footnotes Citations References * Adams, Simon (ed.)

Geography It rises in the Adamawa Plateau of northern Cameroon, from where it flows west, and through the town of Garoua and Lagdo Reservoir, into Nigeria south of the Mandara mountains, and through Jimeta, Ibi and Makurdi before meeting the Niger River at Lokoja. Large tributaries are the Faro River, the Gongola River and the Mayo K√©bbi, which connects it with the Logone River (part of the Lake Chad system) during floods. Other tributaries are Taraba River and River Katsina Ala. At the point of confluence, the Benue exceeds the Niger by volume. The mean discharge before 1960 was for the Benue and for the Niger. During the following decades, the runoff of both rivers decreased markedly due to irrigation. The Benue River flooded in October 2012, resulting in a large increase in the population of venomous snakes in the Duguri District, Alkaleri Local Government Area, Bauchi State.

He founded/co-founded numerous broadcast and radio syndication companies, including Dallas-based TM Productions/Starr Broadcasting, FirstCom/Jim Long Music, Long-Pride Broadcasting, and a Nashville-based music and publishing group, OneMusic. At various times, he also held owner interest in 19 radio and TV stations throughout the U.S. His record label, Honest Entertainment, produced Grammy- nominated albums. Biography Early years Long (who took his maternal grandfather‚Äôs name when he began his career as a radio announcer) was the only child of John Francis Moynihan and Marion Long Moynihan, whose families immigrated to New England from County Kerry and County Mallow, Ireland in the 1800s. Always in some form of law enforcement, Long‚Äôs father retired as a United States Air Force Major (Provost Marshall in Germany) and corrections officer for the State of Massachusetts. His mother was a registered nurse and homemaker. Fascinated by radio since childhood, Long built his first vacuum tube radio transmitter at the age of 13 and started his own radio station in his basement in Marlborough, Massachusetts. It was a successful enterprise until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) showed up to confiscate his transmitter. It was interfering with a local radio station's signal. (Long later went to work for the station, WMRC, Milford, Massachusetts). At 15, he produced his first record, \\"Liza Lee\\" by Roger and The Markees, and started his own record company, Dell Mont Recording, to release it (also in his basement, using his savings and a $200 loan from his mother). This gave him his first taste of artist promotion, record production, and distribution, especially ‚Äúreturns‚Äù. After high school, Long worked at Walgreens Drug Stores, while taking courses in broadcasting, to fulfill his goal of becoming a D.J./radio announcer. He joined the United States Navy and was stationed at Anacostia Naval Base in Washington, D.C., where he served in the elite U. S. Navy Ceremonial Guard, with duty at Arlington National Cemetery. Honorably discharged, he returned to civilian life to pursue a career in broadcasting, where he put his talents as a writer and producer to work.

Companies The TM Companies (1967‚Äì1979) In 1967 TM Productions began as a music production company, producing commercial jingles and broadcast station identifications (IDs). Long conceptualized and co-produced an entirely new approach to station IDs which provided stations a natural flow from commercial breaks to station IDs to music programming, increasing listenership and ratings. Called ‚ÄúPhase 2‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Propellants‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Winning Score‚Äù, these programs were quickly adopted by top stations including KILT Houston, WCFL Chicago and KHJ Los Angeles. He also created IDs that sounded like the hit songs the stations were playing (e.g., ‚ÄúAnd the Beat Goes On‚Äù and ‚ÄúCharisma‚Äù for WCFL Chicago and KLIF Dallas). These concepts were extremely successful and soon widely imitated within the industry. TM Productions was the first production-syndication company to create and market comprehensive multi-media image campaigns for radio stations, complete with station IDs, print and broadcast advertising, promotional materials, and market research programs. (‚ÄúSomeplace Special‚Äù, ‚ÄúRhythm of the City‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere You Belong‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere Your Friends Are‚Äù) These image campaigns increased ratings at stations like WCOL Columbus, KRFC San Francisco, KHJ Los Angeles, and WIBG in Philadelphia. These award-winning campaigns could be syndicated for use in non-competing markets. A similar format image campaign was also developed for television stations, with WLKY-TV in Lexington, Kentucky serving as the pilot. Called ColorTheme, it incorporated animation and music for station IDs and was customized for many major market TV stations, including the MetroMedia Group, Inc. Long also introduced commercial services libraries ‚Äì full service, multi- media advertising campaigns designed for local advertisers by award-winning composers and writer-producers. For the first time, radio stations could provide high quality advertising campaigns to their advertising sponsor clients. The Producer (1973) and MasterPlan (1976)(Deutsch), Ken R.

It was the first to successfully automate mainstream rock programming (WGY-FM in Albany, New York) and the first syndicator to successfully program country music on FM radio (WSOC-FM, Charlotte, North Carolina). TM Special Projects produced music ‚Äúspecials‚Äù for broadcast, including the first ever 48-hour history of album rock, Album Greats, which was aired by hundreds of top progressive rock radio stations, upon its release in 1977.

Buckley. Long and Merriman (who both became multi-millionaires in the deal) continued in their roles with TM, but sought to buy back the company in 1976 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation into Buckley‚Äôs business affairs, accusing him and several members of the Starr Broadcasting board of directors of fraud and misuse of shareholder‚Äôs funds.(www.nytimes.com/SEC vs. Buckley)‚ÄúSEC Says William F.

Long founded FirstCom in 1980 to provide broadcasters with a new level of promotion, music production services, and high-end creative ideas, using emerging technologies. He called his new commercial services library ‚ÄúThe Creative Department‚Äù and was considered a pioneer in his use of market research to develop audience share and increase profitability - resulting in a series of syndicated promotions, sales training programs (Sales Performance System), and high quality music production libraries, unsurpassed in the industry, at that time. In 1984, Long introduced the first ever compact disc (CD) production music library, Digital Production Library. This production format soon became the industry standard (instead of vinyl). By this time, FirstCom had become one of the largest stock music library companies worldwide. Long had reinvented the company to look beyond radio at the broader arena of domestic and international copyrights/music publishing, exploring audio-visual and digital technologies not yet widely used by business. He also expanded FirstCom‚Äôs marketing to include sales to television and film music clients, a concept he later expanded upon when he created OneMusic and Crucial Music Corporations.

Honest Entertainment Group, Inc. (1992‚Äì2001)/The Gold Label (1999‚Äì2001) Having already produced artists for the Capitol, MCA, and Atlantic labels, Long started his own record label in California in 1992, Honest Entertainment, as a vehicle for re-launching Charley Pride‚Äôs career. He produced three albums for Pride (Pride, My 6 Latest & 6 Greatest, Platinum Pride, Volumes 1 & 2, and Classics with Pride)Charley Pride, My 6 Latest & 6 Greatest, 1993 Cecca Prod & Telos Holdings, Inc., Honest CDI 9115, Produced by Jim Long with Brent Rowan and Rocky Schnaars which provided impetus for the Country Music Association Awards (CMA) to recognize Pride with their Pioneer Award and other accolades. As part of his marketing strategy, Long created the first direct response marketing (DR) campaign for a major artist that used 800# marketing to drive new retail sales, selling over 500,000 units through the combination of DR and retail. Honest developed similar campaigns for other artists, including country superstar, Alan Jackson. Honest Entertainment opened offices in Nashville in 1994 and became known for its niche marketing of Irish artists, including Foster & Allen, Daniel O‚ÄôDonnell, and Ronan Hardiman, the composer for Michael Flatley‚Äôs Lord of the Dance extravaganza. Honest also had its own roster of singer/songwriters, including Kate Wallace for whom Long produced the first ‚ÄúCD Plus‚Äù for a new artist marketing campaign, providing biographical audio as well as music video and behind the scenes footage (a new technology format, now familiar on DVD). It was at this time that he pioneered the use of the (almost unheard of then) Internet chat rooms for music listening tests, focus groups and market research. Honest also featured a group of legendary older artists, including Jack Jones, for whom Long produced two albums, one of which received a Grammy nomination in 1998, Jack Jones Paints a Tribute to Tony Bennett Honest Entertainment/Lee Solters Company postcard documenting Grammy Nominee, Jack Jones, for ‚ÄúBest Traditional Pop Vocal Performance in 1999 Grammy Awards for ‚ÄúJack Jones Paints a Tribute to Tony Bennett‚Äù Ref documentation of Jack Jones as Grammy nominee for 41st Grammy Award Nominations, Billboard, January 23, 1999 issue (Bennett actually won the Grammy that year for his own CD.Honest Entertainment‚Äôs ‚ÄúJack Jones Paints a Tribute to Tony Bennett‚Äù CD, reviewed as ‚ÄúBrilliant‚Äù by United News Service, September 1998)(www.digitalhit.com/grammy) This group of older artists became a separate company, The Gold Label, in 1999 and was sold to Pat Boone in 2001.

It was released on January 22, 2004 in Japan, on August 31, 2004 in North America and on February 4, 2005 in Europe. The North American release was the first game published by NIS America. The game shipped in two \\"editions\\"‚ÄîNormal and Special‚Äîthe Special edition coming with a free soundtrack and shortened instruction manual. An expanded remake for the Wii console; titled Phantom Brave: We Meet Again,Official Japanese Phantom Brave Wii site was released on March 12, 2009 in Japan. A North American release by NIS America was originally set for June, but was delayed to August 14 to include dual audio and as a result of manufacturing issues. In addition to the Wii game disc, NIS America included a DVD which contains official artwork and both animated and non-animated sprites. Later, the game was ported to the PlayStation Portable with added features under the title Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle. Siliconera teased gamers with a \\"puzzlehunt\\", giving them the quote \\"Maybe that means thank you?\\" This puzzlehunt eventually came to be the announcement that Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle was set for release in North America and Europe. While US players got both PSN and UMD versions of the game, players in Europe were only offered the downloadable PSN version. The game was later ported to Steam on July 25, 2016. NIS claims that the PC version has all of the added content in both The Hermuda Triangle and We Meet Again.  Plot  A typical cut scene. The protagonist of Phantom Brave is a 13-year-old girl named Marona. Having lost both of her parents at a young age, Marona lives on Phantom Isle in the oceanic world of Ivoire with a phantom named Ash. While he was still alive, Ash worked alongside Jasmine and Haze (Marona's parents) as a Chroma, a sort of bounty hunter or adventurer for hire. On an assignment that brought the trio to the Isle of Evil, a fragment of a malevolent being known as Sulphur attacked the group, mortally wounding them. Using the last of his life energy, Haze attempted to revive the party after the battle; however, there was only enough life left in him to bring Ash back as a phantom. Haze and Jasmine's dying wish was for Ash to watch over their then infant daughter Marona. As far as the game is concerned, Marona is the only one able to see Ash in phantom form. This is primarily because of her unique ability known as \\"Chartreuse Gale\\". This ability not only allows her to see and interact with phantoms, but bind their souls to various objects to grant them a temporary body, referred to in-game as \\"Confine\\". Using this power she can summon Ash and other phantoms to the world of the living to aid her in her own endeavors as a Chroma, similar to the work done by her late parents. Because she possesses the ability to see and speak with the dead, many assume that she is either controlled by or cooperates with evil spirits, and are afraid to even interact with her, much less employ her for Chroma work. Also; in the early portions of the story, people who offer Marona employment would rescind any rewards upon completion once they discover that she was the fabled phantom- possessed Chroma. As she continues her Chroma work, Marona's path eventually crosses with that of a man named Walnut. Walnut prides himself on his status as a Chroma Oxide, one who secretly follows a Chroma on their mission and steals the reward for their work. Walnut regularly tries to meddle in Chroma- related matters involving Marona, but is rarely successful. As they continue their work, Ash and Marona also meet a sickly young girl named Castille. Confined to her bed or wheelchair for most of her life, Castille has been unable to go out into the world and make friends. However; after helping Castille's family on an assignment, Marona grows close to Castille and they become friends. Marona leaves Putty‚Äîa mischievous nature spirit found on an earlier assignment‚Äîwith Castille to keep her company when Marona is unable to do so. As the game progresses, signs of Sulphur returning to Ivoire in full force become more apparent. Earthquakes increase in frequency and monsters plague the land, with lesser forms of Sulphur known as Wraiths appearing to attack Ash and Marona several times. At one point Marona and her rival Walnut are forced to team up, and it is revealed that Walnut is Castile's older brother who's been stealing money from Marona and other Chromas in an effort to pay for Castile's hospital bills so that she can be cured of the sickness that keeps her bedridden. Ash and Marona meet more people who are aware of the signs signalling Sulpher's return and are making preparations to meet Sulpher in battle, if necessary. Among these individuals are Raphael; a renowned knight known as one of the Nine Swords of Ivoire, and the dreary Sprout; a renegade soldier whose family was killed by Sulphur many years earlier. While Sprout seems to side with Ash in this fight, he is hellbent on the destruction of Sulphur at all costs, no matter the means used. As preparations for the final battle are made, Ash and Marona return to the Isle of Evil and find Raphael is possessed by Sulphur, and so Marona's team of phantoms is forced to engage Raphael in a duel. After Raphael is too injured to continue and comes back to his senses, he entrusts Ash with Heliotrope; his sacred sword, for use in their battle against Sulphur. At the center of the island lies a portal from which Sulphur is entering the world, and upon the heroes' arrival to this point they expect to engage in combat with Sulphur immediately. However they are intercepted by Sprout. Having gone mad from the dark power that he has stolen from the countless minions of Sulphur that he has killed and by Sulphur's increased influence in the area, Sprout attacks Ash and Marona. When he loses to Ash he kills himself with his sword; Shiva, in an attempt to kill Sulphur within him, but his sacrifice is in vain as Sulphur successfully materializes anyway. Ash and Marona finally battle it out with Sulphur, but in spite of the duo's best efforts, Sulphur is merely weakened and is still attempting to enter into Ivoire. At that point Walnut appears and says farewell to Castile, sacrificing his own life to sever the portal between Ivoire and Sulphur's domain and effectively save the world.  Gameplay  Phantom Brave is a tactical role-playing game with battles that take place on an isometric board. Marona dispatches her phantom allies by confining them to objects on the field, such as trees, grass, rocks, and flowers. Different objects grant different stat bonuses to the characters that are confined to them, making it advantageous to confine certain characters to certain things. A soldier, for example, often benefits from the stat bonuses found on a rock because of his physical combat abilities, whereas a witch works better when summoned out of a flower or another object that increases its magical abilities. Up to 14 phantoms can be dispatched during any given battle, but the phantoms can only be confined to the physical world for a particular number of turns. The number of turns that a character can stay confined is based upon their class. For example, a witch can stay on the field for three turns, while a soldier lasts eight. While a high confine is desirable for continuous use of the character, a low confine number is actually advantageous if the player intends to either reuse the item to confine another phantom or take items back from the battlefield permanently, or for bomber units. Depending on their class, each phantom has a certain chance of acquiring the item he is confined to, bringing it back to Phantom Isle when the battle is won. A typical battle sequence; Ash is attempting to attack an Amazon with the \\"Subtle\\" title. Phantom Brave has a gridless system in which each character can move a certain number of dm in each turn. The terrain also has traction and pliability characteristics, which affect how long characters continue to slide along after they stop moving and how high they bounce when the character jumps down from a ledge. On slippery surfaces, it is possible to make the characters \\"ice skate\\" by moving very short distances (consuming few dm) and letting them slide to their destination. In addition, the hold and throw system inherited from Disgaea: Hour of Darkness allows characters to pick up and throw objects and even other characters (including allies) toward a desired location. Unlike most tactical role-playing games, the border of the battle maps do not have barriers around their edges. Most characters and objects can be thrown off, hit off, fall off, or slip off of the field of battle and sent O.B. (out-of-bounds). Characters and objects that are O.B.'d are gone for the rest of the battle. When an enemy is O.B'd, the level of each of the remaining enemies rises by one, so the player can trade a large force of weak enemies for a smaller number of stronger ones. If the enemy's HP is reduced to zero before it is thrown out of the stage, its allies will not be granted a level up. The last enemy on the map cannot be thrown O.B., and Marona's team members do not gain levels for falling out of bounds. All characters and weapons accumulate \\"mana\\" (a magical currency for increasing a character or weapon's abilities) whenever they kill an enemy. This mana can be spent to fuse two characters together, an item into a character, or an item to an item. Fusion increases the level cap of the beneficiary by the level of the consumed item or character. By spending mana, the player can improve equipment percentages (stat bonuses given to characters who equip the item or character) and confine percentages (bonuses to characters confined in the item on the field), and even transfer skills to the beneficiary. In Phantom Brave, weapons have a much greater effect on a character's stats than their natural affinity. The maximum obtainable character level is 9999. While on Phantom Isle, a character class called Dungeon Monk can be asked to create a random dungeon. Some characteristics of the dungeon can be seen before creation, including the type and general number of enemies present, the floor conditions, and if the use of equipped weapons is restricted or not. Dungeons also have titles, which are applied to every enemy in the dungeon. As the floors of the dungeon are cleared, the title of the dungeon will improve. These titles can later be removed and placed on player characters or weapons to alter their stats. Random dungeons can also be retitled. A popular leveling trick is to give a random dungeon the \\"failure\\" title, allowing the player to beat hordes of high level enemies easily. Random dungeons tend to take the form of a linear series of floors, although occasionally a floor may have a special named layout (for example, \\"Self-Styled God\\" floors have a stronger enemy in the center of a terraced layout). These floors occur randomly and confer an extra bonus upon completion. Unlike in Disgaea, where to descend to the next floor one may merely move a character to a certain panel, in Phantom Brave one must defeat all the enemies present to continue. To leave a random dungeon, one must either clear every floor, or use a Dungeon Monk's Return skill, which costs money proportional to the current depth. While between battles, Marona can return to her home; Phantom Island, where she can summon (create) new phantoms to aid her in future battles. The player starts off by being able to create characters from a limited selection of classes, but each class of enemy that is defeated in battle is added to the selection of phantoms the player may summon. Summoning phantoms requires only a nominal fee, but new phantoms always join at level 1 no matter when they are summoned. Marona's phantoms populate the island, and the player can converse with them. Many classes have a special utility on the island; Merchants sell items, Healers can recover the damage that units have sustained Fusionists can combine characters and items, Witches allow the player to reorder a character or weapon's spells and skills, and Blacksmiths combine mana with weapons to either level them up or to awaken latent skills hidden in the weapon. Phantom Isle hides several secret items and character classes, such as the Changebook, which allows the player to switch the character they explore the map with. Phantom Brave has a series of extra maps following the main storyline. These post-game maps offer more powerful enemies and feature cameos by some members of the cast of the Disgaea games as enemies. After defeating these characters they will join the player's pool of playable characters as \\"phantom doubles\\". While the first couple of extra maps can be completed immediately after the main story, the later extra maps are very difficult and require a large amount of time invested into the game to be spent leveling characters and fusing weapons before they can be completed.  Characters  *Marona The heroine of the game, Marona is a 13-year-old girl who has the ability to see and communicate with phantoms, a set of abilities collectively known in-game as \\"Chartreuse\\". This power enables her to make a living as a Chroma, a kind of adventurer-for-hire, despite being at such a young age, but it also makes her feared and shunned by other people, many thinking that she is possessed. She lost her parents when she was five, but Ash, a friend of her parents and a former Chroma-turned- phantom, came back to protect Marona after the demise of her parents and himself. *Ash One of the two main heroes of the game, Ash is the phantom of a young man who protects Marona. When he was alive he worked alongside Marona's parents as a Chroma. After dying along with them, he found himself stuck between life and death, thanks to the efforts of Marona's father. He has since sworn to watch over and protect Marona, feeling that he owes Marona's parents for being the only one to \\"survive\\" their unfortunate demise. He is usually careful and well-intentioned, if overprotective of Marona, but is sometimes known to frighten the unwary when he accidentally speaks aloud while concealed in his phantom form. He frequently objects to Marona's selfless behavior. *Bijou A werewolf who impersonates Raphael of the White Wolf Army in order to steal from people who have heard of Raphael's renowned fighting prowess. He later returns in the Sand region under the influence of Sulphur, which fuels his impersonation into a belief that he really is Raphael. After he is defeated again, he is shown to be a member of the Raven clan, the Fighting Beasts, under Captain Drab. Bijou, along with many other characters that show up in the original game's story, is a playable unit in the Wii and PSP exclusive side story \\"Another Marona\\". *Walnut A Chroma Oxide, a person that makes a living by waiting for a Chroma to near the completion of their assigned job and then takes proof of the work's completion in order to steal the reward. Willing to do anything and step on anyone to achieve his goals, Walnut is the older brother of Marona's newfound friend Castile, and puts aside his Chroma Oxide earnings to pay for an operation for her. Walnut's power, \\"Psycho Burgundy\\", is the same power utilized by the legendary hero Scarlet the Brave, and is fueled by burning the wielder's soul to create a powerful energy. An alternate universe version of Walnut joins Marona and company as a playable character in \\"Another Marona\\", a side story that is exclusive to the Wii and PSP versions of the game. Walnut also makes an appearance in another NIS game, Soul Nomad. *Castile Castile is a young wheelchair-bound girl, whose family was rich before spending most of their fortune on her treatments. She is kidnapped by minions of Sulphur, but rescued by Marona and Ash. Castile learns about Marona's ability to see phantoms, and meets with Ash, and she and Marona become best friends as the events of the story unfold. According to an after-game bonus map in the PS2 game Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome, Castile eventually recovers from the sickness that keeps her in bed and becomes healthy enough to fight alongside Marona, while searching for signs that her brother Walnut may still be alive. *Sienna Sienna is a beautiful and elegant businesswoman who owns Phantom Isle, Marona's home. She is generous and polite to a fault, but her calm demeanor holds a few secrets. Even her assistant, Murasaki, is clueless as to Sienna's true motivations, or what it is about Phantom Isle that makes it so important to her. Besides Phantom Isle, Sienna owns an immense Bottle Mail factory. It is later revealed that she was the legendary hero Scarlet the Brave before she was severely wounded in her battle with Sulphur, and that she gave up being a famed warrior to live a calm life of relative obscurity. *Sprout A fierce and powerful 85-year-old man whose family was slain by Sulphur's hand 30 years ago. Once the famed wielder of a holy sword, he has sworn to kill Sulphur and avenge his family, turning to the use of dark powers in order to achieve his revenge. He is the former mentor of Raphael, and one of the warriors known as the 9 Swords of Ivoire. His signature technique is the power \\"Dark Eboreus\\". An alternate version of Sprout joins the player's party in \\"Another Marona\\". *Raphael Leader of the White Wolf Army; a group of Ravens (a large team of professional demon slayers), Raphael is one of the warriors known as the 9 Swords of Ivoire. He is first seen in the quest to find the rainbow bird. His signature technique is called Heliotrope Blade. An alternate version of Raphael fights by Marona's side in the Wii and PSP exclusive side story, \\"Another Marona\\". *Count Malt A dignified old Scrabbit with a mustache that sends Marona on a search for Scarlet the Brave. *Sulphur The story's main antagonist and a powerful demon that periodically threatens the world of Ivoire. The very thought of his return causes chaos and widespread panic across all of Ivoire. His power possesses a number of characters throughout the game. After his defeat, Sulphur returns to Ivoire in a bonus battle on the Island of Evil. Another optional battle in the PS2 game Soul Nomad & the World Eaters reveals both how Sulfur came back to Ivoire and Walnut's fate after Phantom Brave's final battle.  \\"Another Marona\\" characters  These characters were originally introduced in Phantom Brave: We Meet Again for the Nintendo Wii (and its PSP port, Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle), in the new campaign \\"Another Marona\\". *Carona The Marona of an alternate reality, she shares the same phantom-related Chartreuse powers that the original Marona has. In order to avoid confusion amongst the people of this reality's world she goes by the name 'Carona' instead. Whereas Marona is both carefree and optimistic, Carona is usually serious and pessimistic, although she does show a twisted sense of humor. Her goals and intent are both unknown, and she mostly keeps to herself when she's not training Marona and company for their upcoming battle with Sulpher. Carona appears in Ivoire just after a mysterious veil of darkness claimed the lives of all of the peoples of Ivoire, save Marona. *God Eringa A powerful character that appears alongside Carona, this bearded mushroom creature claims to be God. He entices Marona and company to work in his interest under the proposal that if they can defeat Sulfer within a certain number of days, he will revive all of the people who were felled by the darkness that swallowed Ivoire. During the final battle of \\"Another Marona\\" it is revealed that he is actually the fabled Merchant of Death, and was responsible for the spreading darkness that killed everyone.  Other characters  Four characters that originate from the Disgaea series (Laharl, Etna, Flonne, and Vyers) become playable characters upon completing certain post-game content.

It gained fame as the organizing point for the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773. Five thousand or more colonistsJohn Galvin puts that number as high as 8,000 (Three Men of Boston, New York: Thomas Cromwell, 1976, p. 268). gathered at the Meeting House, the largest building in Boston at the time. History Church (1729‚Äì1872) The meeting house or church was completed in 1729, with its 56 m (183 ft) steeple. The congregation was gathered in 1669 when it broke off from First Church of Boston, a Congregational church founded by John Winthrop in 1630. The site was a gift of Mrs. Norton, widow of John Norton, pastor of the First Church in Boston. The church's first pastor was Rev. Thomas Thatcher, a native of Salisbury, England. Thatcher was also a physician and is known for publishing the first medical tract in Massachusetts. Interior of Old South, 2018 After the Boston Massacre in 1770, yearly anniversary meetings were held at the church until 1775, featuring speakers such as John Hancock and Dr. Joseph Warren. In 1773, 5,000 people met in the Meeting House to debate British taxation and, after the meeting, a group raided three tea ships anchored nearby in what became known as the Boston Tea Party. Lt Col Samuel Birch leading the 17th Dragoons in the Old South Meeting House, Boston In October 1775, led by Lt Col Samuel Birch of the 17th Dragoons, the British occupied the Meeting House due to its association with the Revolutionary cause. They gutted the building, filled it with dirt, and then used the interior to practice horse riding. They destroyed much of the interior and stole various items, including William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation (1620), a unique Pilgrim manuscript hidden in Old South's tower. After the British evacuated Boston, the plan for rebuilding the interior of the church was drawn by Thomas Dawes.Eckley, Joseph. \\"Obituary: Sketch of the Character of the Late Hon. Thomas Dawes, Esq.,\\" 1809, Boston Athenaeum Library, Tracts B438, B1213. Old South Meeting House was almost destroyed in the Great Boston Fire of 1872, saved by the timely arrival of a fire engine from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, but the fire caused the city's residential districts to shift toward the Back Bay, away from the church. The congregation then built a new church building (the \\"New\\" Old South Church at Copley Square) which remains its home to this day. The Old South congregation returns to Old South Meeting House for services in its ancestral home once a year, on the Sunday before Thanksgiving.

Renowned for the protest meetings held here before the American Revolution when the building was termed a mouth-house, this National Historic Landmark has long served as a platform for the free expression of ideas. Today, the Old South Meeting House is open daily as a museum and continues to provide a place for people to meet, discuss and act on important issues of the day. The stories of the men and women who are part of Old South's vital heritage reveal why the Old South Meeting House occupies an enduring place in the history of the United States. The museum and historic site is located at the intersection of Washington and Milk Streets and can be visited for a nominal sum. It is located near the State Street, Downtown Crossing and Park Street MBTA (subway) stations. The Old South Meeting House is claimed to be the second oldest establishment existent in the United States. It is currently under consideration for local landmark status by the Boston Landmarks Commission.https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/PETSTATS_June2016_tcm3-53570.pdf In 2020 the former caretaker of Old South Meeting House (the Old South Association in Boston) merged with the Bostonian Society, forming Revolutionary Spaces, which now manages both Old South Meeting House and the Old State House.

McCammon. It received the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1992. It is considered by readers and critics as his best novel. The story is set in the early 1960s and makes observations about changes in America at that time, with particular emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement. Several of the characters are connected to the Ku Klux Klan, and the segregation of the black community is dealt with in some detail. Plot summary In the novel, Cory Mackenson shares with the reader his experiences in the twelfth year of his life. The year begins when his father attempts to rescue a driver as his car plunges into Saxon's Lake, only to discover the man has been beaten to death. Cory spends the rest of the year, despite multiple distractions, attempting to find out who killed this stranger before his father's dreams drive him into the depths of the lake too. Boy's Life is a story of coming of age in the south, an all too real reality mixed with the magic and fantasy of childhood. Cory gets up early to help his father work his milk route. As they discuss Cory's plans for the future, they drive through their little town of Zephyr, Alabama. When Cory's father begins to drive past Saxon's Lake, they are both shocked when they see a car race across the road in front of them and plunge into the lake. Cory's father dives into the water to rescue the driver only to discover the man has been horribly beaten and strangled. Someone has stripped the dead man naked and handcuffed him to the steering wheel to prevent his body from ever rising to the surface again. Cory and his father rush to the nearest house, which happens to be a brothel managed by a woman named Grace, and call the police. Unfortunately, there is little the police can do without a victim, a name, or a motive. People talk about the murder for weeks, disturbed that such a thing could happen in their small town. However, with no progress on the legal end of things, people soon forget. Easter comes. Cory and his family attend church with both sets of grandparents. The day is extremely hot and the church is packed. Within moments of the pastor beginning his sermon a nest of wasps become agitated in the attic and wasps begin invading the church. Within moments the entire congregation is rushing for the doors, hoping to escape their horrible stings. Not long after Easter, Cory's bike breaks down and doesn't work anymore. Cory goes to retrieve it with his father, but they learn that the junk man has picked it up. At the junk man's house, Cory learns that his bike has already been crushed. However, Cory and his father get to see a tooth that possibly came from the mythic creature that lives in the Tecumseh, Old Moses. Not long after this, rains bring a swelling of water in the river, leading to a flood. The whole town of Zephyr rushes to Bruton to build a temporary dam to hold the waters back. While there, Cory goes to the home of a local woman whose father is having a heart attack. Cory is left alone with a little boy while his mother and the boy's mother move the old man to dry ground. A creature floats into the house and attempts to attack Cory and the boy. Cory manages to fend him off with a broom, shoving it so far in the back of its throat the creature backs off. As a result of his heroics, Cory is invited to visit the Lady, the honorary leader of Bruton, and promised a new bike. School finally gets out. Cory and his friends rush off to make plans for their summer. When Cory gets home, he discovers that he has received the promised bike from the Lady. The bike is new and has everything a boy could want, including what Cory believes is a golden eye in the headlamp. A few days later, Cory and his friends meet at the baseball field. A new boy in town, Nemo Curliss, watches them toss the ball for a time. Cory invites him to play too. Nemo turns out to have a powerful pitching arm, strong enough to bruise Davy Ray's hand when he catches Nemo's pitch. As they play ball, the Branlins come upon them. The Branlins begin to tease the younger boys as they often do. When the Branlins begin picking on Nemo, Cory and his friends defend him. The Branlins begin to beat the boys, leaving Cory and Davy Ray hurt, but Johnny Wilson with a concussion. One afternoon at the public pool, Cory hears a new song by a new group called the Beach Boys. Cory is excited by this new song. However, a local preacher is not as impressed. In fact, he has a special church service to lecture the community on the evils of this new music. Cory and his family attend out of curiosity. During the sermon, the preacher pulls out a monkey he calls Lucifer. Lucifer becomes frightened by the crowd and attacks the preacher. Lucifer then attacks the congregation before escaping through the open door. A short time later, Cory spends a week with his paternal grandparents, Jaybird and Sarah. Cory dislikes his Granddaddy Jaybird because he always wakes him before dawn and makes Cory do some of the harder chores around the farm. On Cory's last day at the farm, Granddaddy Jaybird takes him to the store to buy ice cream salt. However, instead of going home, Granddaddy Jaybird takes Cory to a house where an illegal poker game is going on. Cory waits for several hours outside and finally gives up, deciding to walk home. Finally Cory is picked up by the local doctor who drives him back to the farm. As a deal with his father to go to Jaybird's, Cory is allowed to go camping alone with two of his friends. The boys walk deep into the woods and settle down for the night. Cory tells a scary story. In the middle of the story, they see a car drive past their campsite. The boys follow the road and find two men waiting in their car. The boys watch as another car drives up and the men transact some kind of business with these new arrivals. Ben becomes covered with spiders and screams out, attracting the attention of the men. The men chase the boys through the woods. Cory is separated from his friends. The following day Cory comes across a girl skinny dipping in a pond. The girl takes him home, cleans his wounds, and arranges for him to get a ride to a phone. Cory wins third prize in a writing contest. The mayor calls and asks Cory to meet him at his office. Once there, Cory sees a hat with a green feather in it and jumps to the conclusion that the mayor is the killer. Cory becomes frightened and runs off. However, the feather on the mayor's hat does not match the one Cory found at Saxon's Lake. Cory wins a plaque and has to read his story at a ceremony. A few days later, Cory is invited to have dinner with Vernon Thaxter, the son of the local bank owner. Back at school, Johnny brings his collection of arrowheads. After school, the Branlins attempt to steal the arrowheads. Johnny fights Gotha, using the boxing techniques he learned from a book during his long recuperation from his concussion. At the same time, Cory leads Gorda off on his bike and causes him to fall into a ditch filled with poison ivy. Neither Branlin ever teases or bullies Cory and his friends again. One afternoon Cory comes home from school to learn that Rebel, his dog, has been hit by a car. Cory rushes to the vet to see his dog, only to learn he is dying. Cory prays death away. Rebel recovers, but he is never quite right. One night Cory hears someone talking to his dog. Cory realizes it is a young boy who once lived down the street, but died in a fire. Cory realizes it is time to give up Rebel. Cory arranges to have the vet put Rebel down. A short time later, Cory is riding his bike in town and is kidnapped by Donny Blaylock, one of the men he saw transacting business during his camping trip. Donny plans to hurt Cory, but instead he is distracted by the memory of a man he killed on that road. There is a car accident and Cory is freed. However, Donny is arrested for murder. The sheriff, it turns out, has been taking bribe payments from the Blaylocks. As a result, he is leaving town. However, before he leaves, the sheriff wants Donny to be taken by the state police. The sheriff asks Tom Mackenson for help. At first Tom refuses, but later agrees. There is a shootout that ends when Biggun Blaylock's ammunition turns into green garden snakes. A short time later, the Brandywine Carnival comes to town. At the carnival, Cory and his friends see everything from the haunted house to a baby with one eye. Cory drags them off to see a creature that appears to be a triceratops. Davy Ray is deeply affected by seeing this animal, so when Cory learns the next day that someone helped the animal escape, he suspects it was Davy Ray. That fall, when hunting season begins, Cory finds himself thinking about parrots and green feathers. However, before Cory can investigate his suspicions, he learns that Davy Ray has been shot in a hunting accident. Cory and his family rush to the hospital. Cory tells Davy Ray a story about a solitary traveler. The following morning, Cory learns that Davy Ray has died. Cory does not know how to deal with the death of his friend, especially when his mother and pastor tell him he must have faith that Davy Ray is somewhere better. When Cory learns that the vet and his wife had a green parrot in their home the night the stranger from Saxon's Lake was killed and that they both are allergic to milk and therefore would not have thought of seeing a milk man out before dawn, he begins to suspect they killed the man. At the same time, Cory's father finally goes to see the Lady after he goes to her for help dismantling a bomb. At this meeting, Cory's father is told the number thirty-three is important. The only thing Tom can find with that number is a bus that comes to town every other day. Tom takes a job at the gas station where the bus drops off passengers and waits. On the day someone finally gets off the bus, Cory goes to the vet's house to spy on him, to try to prove he killed that stranger. Tom learns that the dead stranger was a Neo-Nazi who helped hide a couple of German officers in Zephyr years before. The man came to town to blackmail these Germans to start a new life. Tom cannot imagine which of his neighbors might be German officers who could be so cruel as to pick and choose which Jewish prisoners should die. However, when Tom learns the German officer was a veterinarian, he begins to suspect Dr. Lezander, the local vet. Tom and his new companions go to the vet's house where they discover Cory is being held against his will. Dr. Lezander takes off with Cory. Tom follows. When they reach the road that runs beside Saxon's Lake, the triceratops comes out of the woods and attacks Dr. Lezander's car, pushing it into the water. Tom saves Cory, but can do nothing for Dr. Lezander. Cory returns to Zephyr many years later with his own family. The town was abandoned after the paper mill closed down in the 1970s. Cory drives to all his familiar haunts, finally stopping at his family's home. Before leaving, Cory decides to drive to the Thaxter mansion. There, Cory discovers that the mansion was given to an orphanage for boys and several people he knew in childhood still live there, working with the little boys.  Setting  The novel is set in Zephyr, Alabama, a fictional town near the Tecumseh River. The book is set in the 1960s. Zephyr is a small town that is populated with people who work both at the paper mill up river and for the local dairy. The people all know one another and often are friendly with one another, sharing holidays and birthdays together as well as tragedies. Down river is Bruton, a small town that is populated by many of the black people who work in Zephyr as domestic and blue collar workers. Through the course of the novel, the main character befriends many of the residents of Bruton, overshadowing the border between the two towns that often separates his neighbours from the Bruton residents.  Characters   Cory Mackenson  Cory Mackenson is an eleven-year-old boy in 1964. This novel follows Cory's adventures that year, including his attempts to solve a murder by which his father has been haunted since inadvertently witnessing the disposal of the body. Cory is precocious, a young man who wants to be a writer, so he spends a great deal of his time investigating the people and events taking place in the little town where he lives. Cory fights off Old Moses, a large aquatic creature that swims into a house in Bruton during the flood. Cory later goes camping alone with a group of friends and overhears a bomb transaction that allows him later to save the people of Bruton from a hate crime. Cory loses a good friend that year and gains another. It is an amazing summer that will remain with Cory the rest of his life, bringing him back to Zephyr twenty years later with his family, only to find several friends still living there.  Tom Mackenson  Tom Mackenson is Cory's father, employed as a milkman. While delivering milk early one morning, he and son Cory saw a car drive into Saxon's Lake so Tom dove into the water attempting to save the driver. What Tom saw that day will haunt him for the rest of the novel. The man in the car was already dead; he had been beaten, had a piano wire wrapped around his throat, and had been handcuffed to the steering wheel of the car before it plunged into the lake. Tom then begins having nightmares, in which he believes he hears the murdered man telling him to join him down in the dark. Tom interprets this to mean the man wants him to commit suicide, but eventually he learns from the Lady that the man is speaking instead to the killer. Tom will later learn that he is not saying \\"down in the dark\\", but \\"Dahninaderke\\". His dreams will lead Tom to the identity of the killer and solve his nightmares.  Rebecca Mackenson  Rebecca Mackenson is Cory's mother. Rebecca is an overprotective mother who has trouble adjusting to the idea that her son is growing up. Rebecca does not want Cory to go camping on his own, but finally relents when her husband agrees to it. Rebecca is a force in her son's life, not always the one to say no but occasionally the one who encourages her son. When the Lady invites Cory to visit her, Rebecca insists that they go even though her husband disagrees. This meeting allows the Mackenson family to discover that the Lady is actually a kind woman who only wants to help.  The Lady  The Lady is a highly respected black woman who lives in Bruton. It is said that the Lady is over one hundred years old and that she is an expert in voodoo magic. Most white people are afraid of the Lady, including Tom Mackenson. However, Cory becomes good friends with the Lady after the flood that wipes out a portion of Bruton. Cory rescues a small black boy from a monster fish known as Old Moses. In return, the Lady gives Cory a new bike he names Rocket. The Lady also claims to be able to help Tom with nightmares he has suffered since he saw a dead man sink into Saxon's Lake. The Lady gives Tom a reading that comes up with the number 33. In the end, Tom uses this number to solve the mystery of the dead man, proving the Lady's powers of the unknown.  Minor characters   Vernon Thaxter  Vernon Thaxter is the eccentric son of the richest man in town. Vernon once wanted to be a writer despite his father's disapproval and even published a book once. However, the publishers talked Vernon into changing the book to fit their market, a change that caused the book to not sell well. As a result, Vernon had a mental breakdown that brought him back home, living as though he were a child again. Vernon can often be seen walking through town naked. However, Vernon has a clear mind when it comes to watching the people in town and he manages to give Cory some insight into the killer of the mystery man in Saxon's Lake that helps him identify that person.  Davy Ray Callan  Davy Ray Callan is a friend of Cory's. Davy Ray is the friend who likes to tease the others, often voicing doubts about the games and theories the others entertain. Davy Ray has a strong opinion on everything, including the stories that Cory often tells, forcing him to stay honest to his story. The fall of 1964, Davy Ray is hunting with his father when he trips and accidentally shoots himself. Davy Ray dies during the night after the accident.  Ben Sears  Ben Sears is another of Cory's friends. Ben has a father who drinks moonshine with the Blaylocks, causing a great deal of tension in the home. Ben is the friend who always seems to be lagging behind, who is slower than the others. However, Ben remains a close friend to all, especially Davy Ray who delights in teasing Ben for his slowness. Ben grows up to be a successful stock broker.  Johnny Wilson  Johnny Wilson is a friend of Cory's. Johnny is beaten badly by the Branlin boys, Gordo and Gotha, leaving him with a concussion that excludes him from many of the summer activities the other boys indulge in. As a result, Johnny teaches himself boxing with a book written by Sugar Ray Robinson. When Gotha Branlin attempts to beat Johnny again over some arrowheads, Johnny fights back, teaching Gotha a lesson. This causes Gotha to go straight and stop beating smaller kids. In the end, Johnny grows up to be chief of police in a city in Florida.  Granddaddy Jaybird  Granddaddy Jaybird is Cory's paternal grandfather. Granddaddy Jaybird is a loud, obnoxious man who is obsessed with practical jokes and animal carcasses. Cory comes to realize as he grows that Granddaddy Jaybird is a selfish person who cares for no one but himself. In fact, Cory's first lesson in this is when Granddaddy Jaybird abandons Cory in the heat of a summer's day in order to play illegal poker with Bodean Blaylock. Cory understands that Granddaddy Jaybird is not a good person, but he also believes that his curiosity that helps in his writing comes from Jaybird, therefore he respects his grandfather for his gifts to his own personality.  Gotha and Gordo Branlin  Gotha and Gordo Branlin are the local bullies in Zephyr. Gotha and Gordo like to pick on boys younger than themselves, which means Cory and his friends. On the baseball field one day, the Branlin boys attack Cory and his friends mercilessly, causing one boy to suffer a concussion. As a consequence of this episode, one of those boys learns to box from a book and he attacks Gotha Branlin in the schoolyard. Gotha learns from this experience and never attacks these boys again. In fact, Gotha straightens out his life and becomes a decent citizen when he grows older. Gordo, on the other hand, never learns his lesson and eventually dies in a holdup when he is shot by the owner of the convenience store he is trying to rob.  Nemo Curliss  Nemo Curliss is a young boy who comes to live in Zephyr for a few short months during the summer of 1964. On their first meeting, Cory comes to discover that Nemo has a talent when it comes to throwing baseballs. However, Nemo's overprotective mother refuses to allow him to play because she feels her little boy is too fragile to play rough sports like baseball. Cory and his friends are deeply disappointed because Nemo could have helped them win the season that summer in little league. During their brief friendship with Nemo, Cory and his friends are attacked by the Branlin boys while defending Nemo, an event that causes the boys terrible injuries and leaves Johnny looking for revenge. Nemo's dad is a salesman for shirts, so they move around a lot and as a result, Nemo can't make any friends. It's very sad when he moves away since he said that Cory and his friends were probably the closest friends he's ever had.  The Blaylocks  The Blaylocks, Wade, Donny, Bodean, and Biggun, run the moonshining business in Zephyr. The Blaylocks also run the local brothel and several other illegal businesses. The town of Zephyr lives in fear of the Blaylocks because they know that they will not hesitate to kill in order to protect their businesses or each other. Even the sheriff is under the control of the Blaylocks, taking payments from them every month in a promise to leave them be. In the end, however, the sheriff finds himself forced out of office because of the Blaylocks. Before he leaves, however, the sheriff is insistent that he take Donny Blaylock to jail for the murder of Little Stevie Cauley. There is a shootout, leaving the Blaylocks wounded and arrested. This leaves Zephyr free of the criminal clan for the first time in many years.  Dr. Frans Lezander  Dr. Frans Lezander is the veterinarian in Zephyr. Dr. Lezander cares for Rebel when he is hit by a car. Cory is overwhelmed by Dr. Lezander's care of his dog and is so impressed that he entertains the idea of becoming a vet himself. However, when Cory learns that Dr. Lezander is allergic to milk and that he is a night owl, Cory begins to wonder if Dr. Lezander could be the mysterious killer who killed a man and dumped his body in Saxon's Lake. Later, when Cory learns that Dr. Lezander had in his care the parrots of the Glass sisters, he realizes that the green feather he found at Saxon's Lake that fateful day came from Lezander's house. Before Cory can do anything with all this information, his father learns that Dr. Lezander and his wife were really German soldiers who were cruel to Jews at a concentration camp. Dr. Lezander's real name is Gunther Dahninaderke, a German doctor who chose who would live or die in the concentration camp. Dr. Dahninaderke killed the mysterious man for blackmailing him and threatening to reveal his true identity.

He overcame the amputation of his left arm in 1984 and continued to play with the band, which subsequently went on to its most commercially successful phase. He is known as \\"The Thunder God\\" by fans. He is ranked No. 7 on the UK website Gigwise in The Greatest Drummers of All Time list.  Early life  Rick Allen was born on 1 November 1963 in Dronfield, Derbyshire to Geoffrey Allen and Kathleen Moore, and started playing drums at the age of nine. He performed in the bands Grad, Smokey Blue, Rampant, and the Johnny Kalendar Band. When Allen was 14, his mother replied on his behalf to an advertisement placed by a band called Def Leppard looking for a drummer to replace Tony Kenning (\\"Leppard loses skins\\" was the advertisement's headline). He later joined the band on 1 November 1978, which was his 15th birthday. In 1979, he dropped out of school to concentrate on a career in music. Allen celebrated his 16th birthday with a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon, when Def Leppard opened for AC/DC.  Crash and recovery  On the afternoon of 31 December 1984, Allen was involved in a car crash, with his then-girlfriend Miriam Barendsen, on the A57 road in the countryside a few miles west of Sheffield. While trying to pass another car at a high speed, he lost control of his Corvette C4, which hit a dry stone wall and entered a field. He was thrown from the car because his safety belt had been improperly fastened, causing his left arm to be severed. Reportedly, a woman who lived nearby responded to the scene to assist the victims. When asked by Allen \\"do you know who I am?\\", the woman said she didn't recognize Allen and wasn't familiar with Def Leppard. The woman packed his severed arm in ice to provide to first responders. His girlfriend suffered head, neck, and spine injuries from severe whiplash. Doctors initially reattached Allen's arm but, because of an infection, it had to be re-amputated. His right shoulder was also severely broken in the crash., Fricke, D., and M. Selinger. \\"To Hell & Back. (Cover Story).\\" Rolling Stone 629 (1992): 38.

Despite losing his arm, Allen soon decided to continue playing drums with Def Leppard, and adopted a specially-designed electronic drum kit. The band took a hiatus from onstage performances until August 16, 1986, when Allen was able to return to live drumming at the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington. He has since re-adopted partially-acoustic drum kits depending on the setting. Equipment Allen has used custom-manufactured cable routing by Whirlwind. He uses four electronic pedals for his left foot to play the pieces he used to play with his left arm, which from left to right trigger sounds of a closing hi-hat, bass drum, snare drum, and a tom drum.Whirlwind / Def Leppard In 2009, Yamaha announced the addition of Rick Allen to their artist roster.

Allen also uses Remo drumheads (usually he has coated Ambassadors on his drums and a clear Powerstroke 3 on his bass drum), Zildjian cymbals (mostly K customs, Z Customs and A customs), and a LP rock cowbell. He previously used Paiste 2002, RUDE and Sound Creation cymbals.  Charitable works  Allen and his wife Lauren Monroe are the co-founders of the Raven Drum Foundation, a charity with a mission to serve, educate, and empower veterans and people in crisis. The Raven Drum Foundation commonly works to help individuals and communities in crisis through healing arts programs, drum circle events, and collaborative partnerships. Allen also formed the One Hand Drum Company to provide funding for the Raven Drum Foundation. The company primarily sells merchandise featuring \\"Stick Rick\\", an illustrated character representing Allen.  Personal life  Allen was married to Stacy Lauren Gilbert from 1991 to 2000. In 1995, Allen was arrested for spousal abuse and was sentenced to a work crew and ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He married Lauren Cuggino Monroe in 2003; Monroe is also a musician and Allen has contributed to some of her albums.

It explores home and home life from 1600 to the present day with a series of period room displays. The museum is housed in 18th-century Grade I-listed almshouses, formerly belonging to the Ironmongers' Company. These were built in 1714 thanks to a bequest by Sir Robert Geffrye, a merchant and slave trader who had served as Lord Mayor of London and Master of the Ironmongers' Company. In 1911 the Ironmongers' Company sold the buildings to London County Council in 1911, who opened the museum in 1914. The museum became a charitable trust in 1991. Several structures connected with the Museum are listed on the National Heritage List for England. The main museum building is Grade I listed and the niche in the northwest corner of the forecourt of the Museum is listed Grade II*. The forecourt wall, gates and railings to the Museum are Grade II* listed, and the two K6 telephone boxes on the Kingsland Road outside the Museum are listed Grade II. In January 2018, the museum closed for a two-year ¬£18m development project, and is due to reopen in 2020. Until this closure, the main permanent displays were a series of room settings furnished and decorated to show the main living spaces and elements of domestic life through the centuries, reflecting changes in society, behaviour, style and taste. The museum's change of name was announced in 2019. The building that houses the museum has above its entrance a statue of merchant and slave trader Robert Geffrye, a replica of the original which was removed in 1912 when the building was sold to London County council. In July 2020 the museum held a consultation on the potential removal of the statue, with public opinion being in favour of removing it. The museum's board elected to instead \\"reinterpret and contextualise\\" the statue in its current location, partly on the advice of Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden.

The museum presents stories and artifacts of the information age and explores the computing revolution and its impact on society. History The museum's origins date to 1968 when Gordon Bell began a quest for a historical collection and, at that same time, others were looking to preserve the Whirlwind computer. The resulting Museum Project had its first exhibit in 1975, located in a converted coat closet in a DEC lobby. In 1978, the museum, now The Digital Computer Museum (TDCM), moved to a larger DEC lobby in Marlborough, Massachusetts. Maurice Wilkes presented the first lecture at TDCM in 1979 ‚Äì the presentation of such lectures has continued to the present time. TDCM incorporated as The Computer Museum (TCM) in 1982. In 1984, TCM moved to Boston, locating on Museum Wharf. In 1996/1997, The TCM History Center (TCMHC) in Silicon Valley was established; a site at Moffett Field was provided by NASA (an old building that was previously the Naval Base furniture store) and a large number of artifacts were shipped there from TCM. In 1999, TCMHC incorporated and TCM ceased operation, shipping its remaining artifacts to TCMHC in 2000. The name TCM had been retained by the Boston Museum of Science so, in 2000, the name TCMHC was changed to Computer History Museum (CHM). In 2002, CHM opened its new building (previously occupied by Silicon Graphics), at 1401 N.

Such suburbs developed in the United States in the years before the automobile, when the introduction of the electric trolley or streetcar allowed the nation‚Äôs burgeoning middle class to move beyond the central city‚Äôs borders. Early suburbs were served by horsecars, but by the late 19th century cable cars and electric streetcars, or trams, were used, allowing residences to be built farther away from the urban core of a city. Streetcar suburbs, usually called additions or extensions at the time, were the forerunner of today's suburbs in the United States and Canada. Western Addition in San Francisco is one of the best examples of streetcar suburbs before westward and southward expansion occurred. Although most closely associated with the electric streetcar, the term can be used for any suburb originally built with streetcar-based transit in mind, thus some streetcar suburbs date from the early 19th century. As such, the term is general and one development called a streetcar suburb may vary greatly from others. However, some concepts are generally present in streetcar suburbs, such as straight (often gridiron) street plans and relatively narrow lots. Similar terms Railroad suburbs Advertisement for a subdivision in Cincinnati, Ohio touting the short walk to nearby rail stations By 1830, many New York City area commuters were going to work in Manhattan from what are now the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, which were not part of New York City at that time. They commuted by ferries. In 1852, architect Alexander Jackson Davis designed Llewellyn Park in New Jersey, a planned suburb served by both ferry and steam railroad. In the 1840s and 1850s, new railroad lines fostered the development of such New York City suburbs as Yonkers, White Plains, and New Rochelle. The steam locomotive in the mid 19th century provided the wealthy with the means to live in bucolic surroundings, to socialize in country clubs, p. 97-99 and still commute to work downtown. These suburbs were what historian Kenneth T. Jackson called the \\"railroad suburbs\\", Chapter 5: \\"The Main Lite Elite Suburbs and Commuter Railroads\\", p. 87-102 and historian Robert Fishman called a \\"bourgeois utopia\\". Outside of Philadelphia, suburbs like Radnor, Bryn Mawr, and Villanova developed along the Pennsylvania Main Line. As early as 1850, 83 commuter stations had been built within a 15-mile radius of Boston. Chicago saw huge developments, with 11 separate lines serving over 100 communities by 1873. A famous community served was Riverside, Illinois, arguably one of the first planned communities in the United States, designed in 1869 by Frederick Law Olmsted. Horsecar and cable car suburbs However, the suburbs closest to the city were based on horsecars and eventually cable cars. First introduced to America around 1830, the horse-drawn omnibus was revolutionary because it was the first mass transit system, offering regularly scheduled stops along a fixed route, allowing passengers to travel three miles sitting down in the time it would take them to walk two miles. Later more efficient horse-drawn streetcars allowed cities to expand to areas even more distant. By 1860, they operated in most major American and Canadian cities, including New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, Cincinnati, Saint Louis, Montreal, and Boston. Horsecar suburbs emanated from the city center towards the more distant railroad suburbs. For the first time, transportation began to separate social and economic classes in cities, as the working and middle class continued to live in areas closer to the city center, while the rich could afford to live further out. History Development The introduction of the electrical streetcar in Richmond, Virginia in 1887 by Frank J. Sprague marked the start of a new era of transportation-influenced suburbanization through the birth of the \\"streetcar suburb\\". The early trolley allowed people to effortlessly travel in 10 minutes what they could walk in 30, and was rapidly introduced in cities like Boston and Los Angeles, and eventually to all larger American and Canadian cities. There were 5,783 miles of streetcar track serving American cities in 1890; this grew to 22,000 by 1902 and 34,404 by 1907. By 1890, electric streetcar lines were replacing horse-drawn ones in cities of all sizes, allowing the lines to be extended and fostering a tremendous amount of suburban development. They were often extended out to formerly rural communities, which experienced an initial surge of development, and then new residential corridors were created along the newly built lines leading to what had sometimes been separate communities., p.119 On side streets, the houses closest to the original streetcar line are often as much as ten to twenty years older than houses built further down the street, reflecting the initial surge and slow completion of a development. Because streetcar operators offered low fares and free transfers, commuting was finally affordable to nearly everyone. Combined with the relatively cheap cost of land further from the city, streetcar suburbs were able to attract a broad mix of people from all socioeconomic classes, although they were most popular by far with the middle class., p.118‚Äì120 The houses in a streetcar suburb were generally narrow in width compared to later homes, and Arts and Crafts movement styles like the California Bungalow and American Foursquare were most popular. These houses were typically purchased by catalog and many of the materials arrived by railcar, with some local touches added as the house was assembled. The earliest streetcar suburbs sometimes had more ornate styles, including late Victorian and Stick. The houses of streetcar suburbs, whatever the style, tended to have prominent front porches, while driveways and built- in garages were rare, reflecting the pedestrian-focused nature of the streets when the houses were initially built. Setbacks between houses were not nearly as small as in older neighborhoods (where they were sometimes nonexistent), but houses were still typically built on lots no wider than 30 to 40 feet. Shops such as groceries, bakeries and drug stores were usually built near the intersection of streetcar lines or directly along more heavily traveled routes (otherwise, routes would simply be lined with houses similar to those found in the surrounding neighborhoods). These shops would sometimes be multi-story buildings, with apartments on the upper floors. These provided convenient shopping for household supplies for the surrounding neighborhoods, that could potentially be visited on one's way to or from work. While there were stores near houses, they were not quite as close as in older parts of cities, and they were usually confined to specific streets, representing the beginning of a complete separation between residential and commercial areas in cities. Unlike railroad suburbs, which tended to form in pockets around stations along the interurban line, streetcar suburbs formed continuous corridors stretching outwards from city cores. The streetcar lines themselves were either built on roads that conformed to the grid, or on former turnpikes radiating in all directions from the city, sometimes giving such cities a roughly star-like appearance on maps. Along the lines, developers built rectangular \\"additions\\" with homes, usually on small lots, within a five- to ten-minute walk of the streetcar. These were essentially built on the grid plan of the older central cities, and typically spread out in between streetcar lines throughout a city. Streetcar use continued to increase until 1923 when patronage reached 15.7 billion, but it declined in every year after that as automobile use increased amongst the middle and upper classes. By the 1930s, the once-profitable streetcar companies were diversifying by adding motorized buses and trackless trolleys to their fleets. By the 1940s, streetcar ridership had dropped dramatically, and few subdivisions were being built with streetcars or mass transit in general in mind. By the 1950s, nearly all streetcar lines had stopped running, and were instead served by buses. Modern streetcar suburbs Now somewhat urban in appearance, former streetcar suburbs are readily recognizable by the neighborhood structure along and near the route. Every few blocks, or along the entire route in well-preserved neighborhoods, there are small commercial structures, storefronts usually flush with the sidewalk; these were small stores‚Äîoften groceries‚Äîoperated by \\"mom and pop\\" operators who lived in quarters behind or above the establishment. Off-street parking, if it exists at all, is in the rear of the building. Because stores were originally built along streetcar lines, a person could exit the transport near home, do some light shopping for dinner items, and continue by walking to his or her residence. These buildings also provided shopping for a non- employed spouse. Very few small groceries remain (outside of New York City), though the space is often now used for non-foodstuff retail, capable of drawing clients from outside of the immediate neighborhood. Modern streetcar suburbs are usually served by buses which run roughly the original streetcar routes, and may offer highly reasonable mass transit commute times to downtowns and other business areas, especially compared to later automobile suburbs. Toronto, Ontario, Canada is an example of a city in which most streetcar suburbs are still served by streetcars. House prices in streetcar suburbs vary by neighborhood and city. Lots left empty in these areas during initial development, or where the initial houses have burned or been torn down, are usually too narrow for modern residential zoning regulations, meaning that it is difficult to infill housing in well-preserved streetcar suburbs. Occasionally two lots are combined into one for a wide enough lot, or many houses are torn down for a new use as needed. However, in some cases where historic zoning applies, infill housing is encouraged or required to match neighboring housing standards. Features In a greater sense, the streetcar suburbs of the early 20th century worked well for a variety of reasons. * While most cities grew in a piecemeal fashion, without any real plan for future development, streetcar suburbs were highly planned communities that were organized under single ownership and control. Indeed, they would often be the first such developments in their respective cities. * Most lots in streetcar suburbs were quite small by post-World War II suburban standards, allowing for a compact and walkable neighborhood, as well as convenient access to public transport (the streetcar line). * Most streetcar suburbs were laid out in a grid plan, although designers of these suburbs often modified the grid pattern to suit the site context with curvilinear streets. Additionally, most of these pre-automobile suburbs included alleys with a noticeable absence of front-yard driveways. * In terms of transportation, the streetcar provided the primary means for residents to get to work, shopping, and social activities. Yet, at either end of the streetcar trip, walking remained as the primary means of getting around. As a result, even in these early suburbs, the overall city remained very pedestrian friendly. This was not always the case for other vehicles. At the turn of the 20th century, the bicycle was also a popular form of mobility for many urban dwellers of the era. (However, when the streetcar rail tracks were encased in the asphalt of a street the resulting trench, for the flanges of the steel wheels, created a dangerous hazard for cyclists, being big enough to trap bicycle wheels but not large enough to get out of easily.) * Because of the pedestrian-oriented nature of these communities, sidewalks were necessary in order to avoid an unacceptable and muddy walk to the streetcar on an unpaved street. Trees lining the streets were also seen as critical to a healthy and attractive neighborhood. While such developments often occurred on farmland or other cleared sites, the evidence of the street trees planted can be seen today in the large, overarching canopies found in these attractive post-turn-of-the-20th-century communities. Examples of streetcar suburbs in North America Atlanta *Adair Park started developing in the 1890s as an all-white streetcar suburb and is now majority African-American area, with strong community commitment to preservation. The Wren's Nest, the home of Joel Chandler Harris, the writer of the Uncle Remus stories, can be visited here. *Inman Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and became Atlanta's first streetcar suburb in 1889. The trolley line is gone, but the trolley barn is still standing, renovated *Virginia Highland developed starting in 1911, located at the end of Atlanta's legendary Nine-Mile Circle trolley line *Kirkwood was founded in 1899 as an independent city, which grew around a streetcar line between Atlanta and Decatur Austin *Hyde Park in Austin, Texas, traces its origins back to 1891 and is considered to be Austin's first suburb. The neighborhood was originally developed by Monroe Martin Shipe in 1891 as a \\"white only\\" streetcar suburb with a large artificial lake, but it has since become one of the most densely populated areas in the city's urban core. Boston *Roxbury *Dorchester *Brighton became a streetcar suburb when transit lines were laid in 1889. *Roslindale *Brookline *Somerville was studied with respect to the social mobility in streetcar suburbs. *Classic book on the topic in Boston: Sam Bass Warner, Streetcar Suburbs *Winchester *Arlington *Belmont *Newton *Melrose *Malden Cleveland *Cleveland Heights *Fairview Park *Lakewood *Rocky River *Shaker Heights was initially planned by the Van Sweringen brothers. Known chiefly for their railroad interests, the brothers linked their community to Downtown Cleveland with their Shaker Heights Rapid Transit which operates to this day. Columbus *Bexley is the location of the Ohio Governor's Mansion, along with a number of other large Tudor and Colonial style mansions. *Grandview Heights *Old Beechwold *Upper Arlington, specifically the original section south of Lane Avenue, was mapped out and developed around the Scioto Country Club, beginning just after WWI. Dallas * The neighborhood of Highland Park was mapped out specifically for such reasons, and attracted the wealthiest citizens of the city at the time. Detroit *The Grosse Pointe neighbourhoods were conceived of in the early 1890s as a retreat for wealthy Detroit businessmen and families. A passenger rail line that connected Detroit to Mt. Clemens, along the coast, was operational by the late 1890s, passing through what would become Grosse Pointe, making the area more accessible. *Many of the neighborhoods of Detroit were built as streetcar suburbs. They are characterized by mostly single- and 2-family houses on 30 or 45-foot lots with a few townhouses and multifamily apartments scattered about. These include Springwells Village, Southwest Detroit, Michigan-Martin, Arden Park, and Boston‚ÄìEdison. Edmonton *The Glenora neighbourhood waited for 10 years before it developed, because it was waiting for the street car tracks to come to the area. Instead of the edges of many cities at this time having infrequent streetcar service, Glenora was easily accessible via streetcar. Houston * The Houston Heights neighborhood was created in 1891 by millionaire Oscar Martin Carter and a group of investors who established the Omaha and South Texas Land Company. It was its own municipality until the City of Houston annexed the Heights in 1919. * Neartown was originally envisioned as a planned community and streetcar suburb dating back to the early 20th century before the development of River Oaks by developer J. W. Link and his Houston Land Corporation. Link built his own home in Montrose, known as the Link-Lee Mansion, which is now part of the University of St. Thomas campus. Indianapolis *Irvington, founded in 1870 five miles (8 km) east of downtown Indianapolis, prospered as a streetcar suburb in the 1890s, leading to Indianapolis annexing the community in 1902. Knoxville *Fourth and Gill, established in the 1880s, still contains most of its original houses and streetscapes. *Oakwood, Knoxville, was studied as an example of a working- class, as opposed to middle-class, streetcar suburb. *Old North Knoxville, established as a separate town in the 1880s. Los Angeles *Angelino Heights, built around the Temple Street horsecar (later upgraded to electric streetcar as part of the Los Angeles Railway Yellow Car system), was the first suburban development outside of downtown Los Angeles. *Highland Park developed along the Figueroa Street trolley lines and railroads linking downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. The old right-of-way was reopened in 2003 as part of the Los Angeles County Transit Authority Metro Gold Line light rail. *Leimert Park, a later streetcar suburb planned by the Olmsted Brothers firm, touted both its automobile accessibility and location along the 6 line of the Yellow Car. *Much of South Central Los Angeles first developed as streetcar suburbia, served by the Yellow Car's Vermont Avenue, Broadway, and Central Avenue lines. *Southeast Los Angeles, including the neighborhoods of Huntington Park and Walnut Park, also served by the Yellow Car lines. *West Hollywood was marketed by developers in the late 19th and early 20th century for its proximity, by streetcar, both to downtown Los Angeles and Pacific Ocean beaches. Miami *Miami's Coral Gables neighborhoods were built in the 1920s as the earliest suburbs of Downtown Miami by early Miami developers. Coral Gables was connected to Downtown, by a series of streetcars down Coral Way. Today, Coral Gables homes are some of the most expensive single-family homes in Miami, as the vast majority of them have been preserved since the 1920s. Within Coral Gables, Miracle Mile has urbanized over the decades, becoming a dense, urban neighborhood with numerous high rise apartment and office towers. Milwaukee *Shorewood was served by the numbers 10 and 15 streetcars on the north side until the mid-1950s, when it was converted to bus. *Whitefish Bay was served by the number 15 streetcar on the north side until the mid-1950s, when it was converted to bus. *Cudahy was served by the 15 and 16 streetcars on the south side. *South Milwaukee was served by the 15 and 16 streetcars on the south side. *Wauwatosa was served by the 10, 16 and 17 streetcars on the west side. *West Allis was served by the 10, 18 and 19 streetcars on the west side. Montreal After the streetcars were built in the late 19th century & expanded in the early 20th century many new areas were developed. http://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4753.shtml One if these was Park-Extension, which was at the end of a railcar road leading directly from downtown along Park Avenue and ending at a train station. http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/sashamd/7062975697/ Newark *Many communities in Essex County, New Jersey were served by the Public Service Railway lines that fed into the Newark City Subway and the Newark Public Service Terminal including Irvington, Maplewood, Montclair, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge and The Oranges. Some of these routes remain today as NJ Transit Bus routes including the 21, 25, 27, 29 and 39. Omaha Soon after the city's founding in 1856, many different companies provided horse-drawn cars, streetcars and eventually busing throughout the city. Streetcar service stopped on March 4, 1955. Some of the communities served exclusively as streetcar suburbs included: * Kountze Place * Dundee * Benson * South Omaha Ottawa * After the Bank St. streetcar to Lansdowne Park was installed, the Glebe began attracting upper-middle class residents, particularly those whose homes were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1900. * The extension of the streetcar system along Richmond Road from Rochesterville to Britannia Park created the streetcar suburbs of Hintonburg, Westboro and Britannia Village. Philadelphia *Aldan *Camden *Cheltenham *Clifton Heights *Collingdale *Collingswood *Darby *Haddonfield *Media *Merchantville *Millbourne *Norristown *Sharon Hill *Springfield (Delco) *Upper Darby *West Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District Phoenix *The F. Q. Story Neighborhood Historic District was developed in the 1920s as one of Phoenix's streetcar suburbs. Piedmont * Piedmont, California real estate developments and the Key System (or Key Route) street car lines were built and managed by Francis Marion Smith and Frank Colton Havens. Pittsburgh 1920s tract houses in Mt Lebanon, on narrow lots backing onto the streetcar line *Many of Pittsburgh's more affluent areas began as streetcar suburbs, including Friendship, Highland Park, Squirrel Hill, and Regent Square, primarily residential neighborhoods located east of the city's center. Outside city limits, the construction of streetcar tracks caused communities such as Edgewood, Sewickley, and Aspinwall to become heavily developed sanctuaries for the city's upper middle class. *The T light rail, Pittsburgh's only current rail transit, encompasses former streetcar lines and connects the streetcar suburbs of Dormont, Mt. Lebanon, and Castle Shannon. Although the communities at the end of the line (Bethel Park and South Park) are mainly 1940s-60s automobile-dependent suburbs, some neighborhoods within them near the rail line reflect the character of streetcar communities, such as the neighborhood of Library. * A streetcar in Pittsburgh also is known as a \\"trolley,\\" and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, a children's public television show (1968-2001) originating in Pittsburgh, used a toy trolley as transition between reality and a \\"Neighborhood of Make-Believe\\" show segment, as trolleys would be familiar to local children in 1968. Portland, Oregon *Lents was a separate community connected to Portland by streetcar when it was platted in 1892. Richmond, Virginia *Barton Heights * Bellevue *Ginter Park *Hermitage *Laburnum Park *Highland Park *Highland Springs *Sherwood Park *Washington Park *Westover Hills *Woodland Heights St. Louis *Maplewood a bedroom community established at the end of a streetcar line from St. Louis. An early suburb of the city, touted for its fresh air in an era when St. Louis tended to have high smog levels from coal burning. *University City formed in 1903, at the end of St. Louis' streetcar line to that area. One year before the 1904 World's Fair, which was held nearby in Forest Park, spurred further development. A prominent area in University City is known as \\"the Loop\\" to this day, a reference to the streetcar lines which ended in a turnaround loop near the town hall. The Loop Trolley, a new historic streetcar line was built in this area. (2018). Salt Lake City *SugarHouse is a neighborhood southeast of downtown Salt Lake City. It was originally established in 1853, however, saw its biggest expansion upon the completion of the Salt Lake City streetcar system. It was originally isolated from the region, as much of the city's growth took place in and around downtown Salt Lake. But after the Utah Prison moved to the area and retail development took over 2100 South it become one of the most active areas of the city. Today it is home to SugarHouse Park, Westminster College, and a revived downtown area filled with mostly local and regional businesses. A modern streetcar line, the S-Line, was opened in 2013 by the city and the Utah Transit Authority, with plans to build a whole streetcar \\"Park\\" and modern transit-oriented development. San Jose * Hanchett Residence Park was San Jose's first streetcar suburb. It was built in 1907 by Lewis E. Hanchett, who connected his streetcar system directly into the neighborhood using formal entrance gates, separate automobile entrances, and two of the earliest roundabout traffic circles built in America. The layout was designed by famed San Francisco Golden Gate Park designer John McLaren. San Jose's Alum Park and Venodome Hotel were also on different spurs of the streetcar line connecting downtown. Seattle * Columbia City was established as an independent town in 1891 along the Rainier Avenue Electric Railway. * Eastlake * Ravenna was established adjacent to Ravenna Park after a streetcar line was built by the Rainier Power and Railway Company in 1891. * Wallingford *Alaska Junction (West Seattle) Toronto *West Hill, Cliffside, Birch Cliff, Riverdale, The Beaches, North Toronto, Parkdale, New Toronto, Mimico and Long Branch are all streetcar suburbs. The Scarborough neighbourhoods of West Hill and Cliffside lost their radial streetcar service in 1936. Birch Cliff lost its streetcar service in 1954. Streetcar service was also provided far outside of the modern Toronto areas, into Port Credit west of Long Branch on the lakefront, which is now part of the city of Mississauga. Washington, D.C. During the late-1800s, streetcars spurred development in numerous villages in Washington County, D.C., including Brightwood, Mount Pleasant, Tenleytown, Chevy Chase, LeDroit Park, Uniontown, and Brookland. All lost streetcar service by the mid-1960s., From the late 1880s to the end of the streetcar era, transit lines spread out of Washington and into the surrounding areas of Montgomery and Prince George's counties in Maryland, heading out to Rockville, Forest Glen, Kensington, Takoma Park, and Berwyn Heights. In particular, the streetcar helped shape the development of the Gateway Arts District from Mount Rainier through Hyattsville and Riverdale Park and beyond through College Park to Laurel. Australia Kelburn in New Zealand is served by the Wellington Cable Car, and Karori transport once linked to it. The inner suburbs of many Australian cities were planned around tram lines. Melbourne's existing extensive tram network includes some examples of existing tram suburbs where tram was the dominant form of early transportation and still a major form of transport, including Carlton, Fitzroy, St Kilda, Albert Park, South Melbourne, and Brunswick.  Old World  In the Old World, many residential neighborhoods were developed in the early days of industrial urbanization before electric streetcars/trams were invented. However, in much of Europe tram systems eventually came to play a much larger role in public transportation than in most of the New World. Here, therefore, the term \\"streetcar suburb\\" is not needed as distinct concept as most neighborhoods in many European cities are tram-oriented, especially in those countries which still had a lower rate of private automobile ownership in the 20th century, such as in the ex-communist East. An example is the city of Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. Prague has built many new suburban roads since the fall of communism and also has an extensive metro and bus system, but because its central core is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city authorities limit new road construction in historic areas. Instead the tram system is the backbone of the transportation system, with many pre- communist and communist-era neighborhoods featuring brick and plaster walk-up apartment buildings lining roads that are served by several tram routes which run into the centre of the city. This is broadly similar to many mid-sized European cities. As housing was scarce in much of the Eastern bloc, new construction mostly occurred in the Plattenbau/Panel√°k style and new neighborhoods were planned from the outset with a tram connection to enable easy commuting. Examples include the planned developments of Berlin Marzahn, Halle-Neustadt or Dresden-Gorbitz. In the west, streetcars had lost much of their importance so similar neighborhoods were built along much more car- dependent lines or - in the case of N√ºrnberg Langwasser - with a new subway that was built from Langwasser inwards to link the new neighborhoods to jobs and shopping in downtown Nuremberg.

This configuration of steam locomotive is most often referred to as a Mikado', frequently shortened to Mike. At times it was also referred to on some railroads in the United States of America as the McAdoo Mikado and, during the Second World War, the MacArthur. The notation 2-8-2T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement, the \\"T\\" suffix indicating a locomotive on which the water is carried in side-tanks mounted on the engine rather than in an attached tender. Overview The 2-8-2 wheel arrangement allowed the locomotive's firebox to be placed behind instead of above the driving wheels, thereby allowing a larger firebox that could be both wide and deep. This supported a greater rate of combustion and thus a greater capacity for steam generation, allowing for more power at higher speeds. Allied with the larger driving wheel diameter which was possible when they did not impinge on the firebox, it meant that the 2-8-2 was capable of higher speeds than a with a heavy train. These locomotives did not suffer from the imbalance of reciprocating parts as much as did the 2-6-2 or the , because the center of gravity was between the second and third drivers instead of above the centre driver. The first 2-8-2 locomotive was built in 1884. It was originally named Calumet by Angus Sinclair, in reference to the engines built for the Chicago & Calumet Terminal Railway (C&CT;). However, this name did not take hold.LeMassena, Robert. (1993). America's Workhorse Locomotive: the 2-8-2. Quadrant Press, Inc., p. 6. The wheel arrangement name \\"Mikado\\" originated from a group of Japanese type 9700 2-8-2 locomotives that were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works for the gauge Nippon Railway of Japan in 1897. In the 19th century, the Emperor of Japan was often referred to as \\"the Mikado\\" in English. Also, the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Mikado had premiered in 1885 and achieved great popularity in both Britain and America.Japan Railway & Transport Review No. 29 - retrieved 26 October 2006. Archived 21 June 2013. The 2-8-2 was one of the more common configurations in the first half of the 20th century, before dieselisation. Between 1917 and 1944, nearly 2,200 of this type were constructed by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO), Lima Locomotive Works and Baldwin, based on designs by the United States Railroad Administration (USRA). It was also known as the \\"McAdoo Mikado\\" in the United States, after William Gibbs McAdoo who was appointed as Director General of Railroads when the United States commenced hostilities during the latter part of the First World War and the USRA was established. Of all of the USRA designs, the Mikado proved to be the most popular. The total American production was about 14,000, of which 9,500 were for local customers and the rest exported.Bruce, Alfred. (1952). The Steam Locomotive in America: Its Development in the Twentieth Century. W.W. Norton, pp. 296‚Äì298. \\"Mikado\\" remained the type name until the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Seeking a more American name, \\"MacArthur\\" came into use to describe the locomotive type in the United States, after General Douglas MacArthur.

The 2-8-2 type was particularly popular in North America, but was also used extensively in Continental Europe and elsewhere. Argentina  broad gauge The Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway bought eighteen 2-8-2T locomotives in three batches of six as their class 701 class. The first two batches came from North British Locomotive Company in 1908 and 1912, the third from Henschel & Sohn in 1913. The BA&P; also bought eight 2-8-2 tender locomotives from Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1928 as their 3001 class. The Central Argentine Railway (FCCA) bought fifteen 2-8-2T locomotives as their class C7 in 1912; they were built by Robert Stephenson and Company with works numbers 3506 to 3520. The FCCA also bought sixty 2-8-2 locomotives: twenty class CS8A from Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1926, and another twenty in 1928 from Robert Stephenson and Company. The final twenty to class class CS9A were supplied by Vulcan Foundry in 1930. Both classes were cross-compound locomotives with one high-pressure cylinder with a bore of and one low-pressure cylinder with a bore of , with a stroke of . The earlier class had coupled wheels with a diameter of , whereas on the later class they were . Standard gauge The East Argentine Railway bought four 2-8-2 locomotives from Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1924. As class X they were numbered 70 to 74; they became General Urquiza Railway 701 to 704 in the 1948 nationalisation. Baldwin had classified them as 12-30-- E.  gauge The Province of Buenos Aires Railway bought a single 2-8-2 locomotive from Hanomag of Germany in 1910. Numbered 251 and classified as class E, it was the only 2-8-2 on that railway's system. The Central Northern Railway (FCCN) bought seven classes of 2-8-2 locomotives totalling 134 locomotives. The first 100 were all bought in 1911: Fifteen from Borsig (class C7, numbered 700‚Äì714), 25 from Henschel & Sohn (class C8, 715‚Äì739), 10 from Hanomag (class C9, 740‚Äì749) and 50 from North British Locomotive (class C10, 750‚Äì799).. The next 25 came from Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1920; they were Baldwin class 12-30--E, 55 to 79, FCCN class C11, numbered 7000‚Äì7024. The last nine new locomotives were built by Henschel between 1928 and 1930 (class C13, numbers 7025‚Äì7033, and class C13A, number 7034).. In addition the FCCN rebuilt 20 4-8-0 locomotives of classes C6 and C7 into 2-8-2s between 1938 and 1940. The C√≥rdoba Central Railway (FCCC) bought 31 locomotives in four classes. The first was a solitary locomotive, numbered 800, class C6A built by Alco's Brooks Works in 1910. It was nearly a decade before they bought any more with a dozen class C9A locomotives, numbered 1451 to 1462, coming from Montreal Locomotive Works, half in 1919 and half in 1920.. MLW delivered another 15 Mikados later that same year; as class C10A they were numbered 1463 to 1477.. FCCC's final three came from Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, they were Baldwin class 12-26--E; FCCC numbered them 1501 to 1503, class C11A. When the FCCC was taken over by the FCCN in 1939, their new owner changed the classification by adding 20 to the FCCC's old classification; the locomotives kept their old numbers, except for FCCC 800 which became FCCN 1400.  gauge On the Ferrocarriles Patag√≥nicos, 75 locomotives were bought in 1922. Fifty were built by Henschel & Sohn, numbered 101 to 150 and class 75H; 25 were built by Baldwin, numbered 1 to 25, class 75B with Baldwin classifying then as 12-18--E. Australia Australian gauge-convertible X class Possibly the world's first 2-8-2T was the South Maitland Railways 10 Class, first delivered in 1911, by Beyer-Peacock, and spasmodically continuing delivery until 1925, then totaling 14 in the class. The requirement for locomotives that could be converted from to without major re-engineering led to the introduction of Mikado locomotives by the Victorian Railways (VR) in the 1920s. Whereas previous 2-8-0 Consolidation type locomotives featured long, narrow fireboxes between the frames that made gauge conversion impractical, the N class light lines and X class heavy goods locomotives both featured wide fireboxes positioned behind the coupled wheels and above the frames.Pearce et al. (1980). North Williamstown Railway Museum. Melbourne: ARHS, p. 14. The South Australian Railways (SAR) employed four distinct classes of 2-8-2 locomotive, the locally designed 700 and 710 class, the 740 class that was originally built for China by Clyde Engineering and purchased by the SAR after the order was cancelled in the wake of the Chinese Communist Revolution, and the 750 class, a group of ten surplus VR N class locomotives.National Railway Museum - Port Adelaide page 752 - retrieved 21 October 2006 To assist with the postwar rebuilding of Australian railways, American-designed Mikado locomotives were also introduced after the Second World War, such as the Baldwin-built New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) D59 class and the Queensland Rail (QR) AC16 class.

Belgian Congo Katanga Mikado no. 201, c. 1917 In 1917, 24 Mikado type steam locomotives were built for the Chemins de Fer du Bas Congo √° Katanga (BCK), a new line from the Northern Rhodesian border to Port Francqui in the Belgian Congo. Since the line was just being completed at the time, the full complement of locomotives were not required immediately and four, possibly six, of them were temporarily leased to the South African Railways to alleviate a wartime shortage of locomotives. In South Africa, they were known as the Katanga Mikado. Six more of these engines were leased to the Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways (BMR), which operated between Umtali in Southern Rhodesia and Beira in Mozambique.

Canada The Canadian National Railway (CN) operated a few Mikado locomotives: * One locomotive in the R-1 class, number 3000. * Thirty locomotives in the R-2 class, numbered 300 to 329. * Several locomotives in the S-1 and S-4 classes, numbered in the range between 3200-3524 and 3198-3199 and 3525-3599 and 3700-3757 and 3800-3805 . The Canadian Pacific (CP) used Mikado locomotives for passenger and freight trains throughout Canada. Most worked in the Rocky Mountains, where the standard 4-6-2 Pacifics and 4-6-4 Hudsons could not provide enough traction to handle the steep mountain grades. The Temiskaming & Northern Ontario (renamed Ontario Northland Railway in 1946) operated seventeen Mikados, all ordered from Canadian Locomotive Company in three batches, the first six in 1916, second batch of four in 1921, and the final seven in 1923 to 1925. They were scrapped between 1955 and 1957 when the Ontario Northland was completely dieselized, except for three wrecked and scrapped in the 1940s. The Temiskaming & Northern Ontario operated its Mikados on both freight and passenger service, and were fitted with smoke deflectors.

They were nicknamed Paikku, which means local. The Class Pr1 was operational from 1924 to 1972. Numbered 761 to 776, they were built by Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG (Hanomag) in Germany and also by Finnish locomotive builders Tampella and Lokomo. The last one, no. 776, is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum. The Finnish Class Tr1 (or R1) tender locomotive was built by Tampella, Lokomo and German locomotive builders Arnold Jung from 1940 and remained in service until 1975.

Tender locomotives Of the pre-nationalisation railway companies that existed before the formation of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de fer Fran√ßais (SNCF), the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (PLM) had the most Mikados. Their first twelve were initially numbered from 1001 to 1012 and later renumbered to 141.A.1 to 141.A.12. The PLM's second series, numbered from 1013 to 1129 and later renumbered 141.B.1 to 141.B.117, were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States. Their third and largest class was numbered from 141.C.1 to 141.C.680. Of these latter locomotives, those fitted with feedwater heaters bore the class letter D. The PLM also rebuilt forty-four 141.C and 141.D class locomotives to 141.E class. The SNCF modified the PLM numbers by adding the regional prefix digit \\"5\\". The PLM's 141.A class Mikados were copied by the Chemins de Fer du Nord, who had fifty, numbered from 4.1101 to 4.1150, which became 2-141.A.1 to 2-141.A.50 on the SNCF. The Chemins de Fer de l'√âtat also had a class of 250 Mikados, numbered from 141-001 to 141-250. These later became the 141.B class on the SNCF and were renumbered 3-141.B.1 to 3-141.B.250. After modifications, the 141.B class locomotives became the 141.C class, as well as one 141.D class (no. 141.D.136) and one 141.E class (no. 141.E.113). No. has been preserved and designated a Monument historique. SNCF 141P Class The most powerful French Mikado was the SNCF 141.P class. At about , these engines were among the most efficient steam locomotives in the world, thanks to their compound design.Westwood, J.N. (1977). Locomotive designers in the age of steam. They could burn 30% less fuel and use 40% less water than their 141.R class counterparts, but could not compete when it came to reliability. Every locomotive of this 318-strong class has been scrapped. SNCF 141R Class no. 568 The most numerous steam locomotive class France had, was the American and Canadian-built 141.R class. Of the 1,340 locomotives ordered, however, only 1,323 entered service since sixteen engines were lost at sea during a storm off the coast of Newfoundland while being shipped to France, while one more was lost in Marseille harbour. They were praised for being easy to maintain and proved to be very reliable, which may account for the fact that they remained in service until the very end of the steam era in 1975. Twelve of these locomotives have been preserved. Tank locomotives The Chemins de fer d'Alsace et de Lorraine had a class of forty 2-8-2T locomotives, the T 14 class, later numbered SNCF to . They were identical to Germany's Prussian T 14 class locomotive and were built between 1914 and 1918. (Also see Germany) The Chemins de fer de l'Est had two Mikado classes. The first was numbered from 4401 to 4512, later renumbered 141.401 to 141.512 and finally SNCF 1-141.TB.401 to 1-141.TB.512. The other was numbered from 141.701 to 141.742 and later SNCF 1-141.TC.701 to 1-141.TC.742. The Chemin de Fer du Nord also had two 2-8-2T classes. The first, consisting of only two locomotives, was numbered 4.1201 and 4.1202, later renumbered 4.1701 and 4.1702 and finally SNCF 2-141.TB.1 and 2-141.TB.2. The second, with 72 locomotives, was numbered from 4.1201 to 4.1272 and later SNCF 2-141.TC.1 to 2-141.TC.72. The Chemins de Fer de l'√âtat also had two Mikado classes. The first, numbered from to , later became the SNCF 141.TC class and were renumbered 3-141.TC.1 to 3-141.TC.20. The second, numbered from to , later became the SNCF 141TD class and were renumbered to . They were copies of the series of the Chemins de fer de l'Est. The Chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans (PO) also had two classes. The first was numbered from 5301 to 5490 and later SNCF to . The second was numbered from 5616 to 5740 and later 4-SNCF to . Germany German 2-8-2 tender locomotives were built in both passenger and freight versions. * An Express-service locomotive was the DRG Class 19 ‚ÄûSachsenstolz‚Äú (Saxon's Pride), developed by the Royal Saxon State Railways as type XX \\\\textstyle \\\\mathfrak{H}\\\\textstyle \\\\mathfrak{V} (Roman Numeral 20; superheated steam (H); compound (V)) to provide express service in the Saxonian Bohemian Massif. * The passenger locomotive was the DRG Class 39, initially the Class P 10 of the Prussian state railways, which was built for hauling heavy express trains in the hilly and mountainous terrain of the Mittelgebirge. When they were assimilated into the Deutsche Reichsbahn- Gesellschaft (DRG), they were designated as DRG Class 39. DRB Class 41 freight locomotive * Although going out of production when the DRB consolidated their production into 2-10-0 1'E DRB Class 52 Kriegslok designs, the DRB Class 41 ‚ÄûOchsenlok‚Äú (Oxen Loco) was a successful 1'D1 2-8-2 freight locomotive also used for commuter trains. They were operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB) and were built from 1937 to 1941, gaining notoriety as the German steam locomotive with the highest efficiency Œ∑ of 10%. Both standard gauge and narrow gauge 1D1 2-8-2 tank locomotive classes were used in Germany. * The DRG Class 93.0-4 was a German 2-8-2T goods train tank locomotive that was used by the Prussian state railways as well as the French Chemins de fer d'Alsace et de Lorraine, designated as Class T14 by both railways. The Prussian locomotives were later incorporated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and designated Class 93.0-4 under the DRG renumbering plan. Altogether 457 locomotives of this class were built for the Prussian state railways between 1914 and 1918. (Also see France - Tank locomotives) * The DRG Class 86 was a standard goods train tank locomotive of the DRG. It was intended for duties on branch lines and was manufactured by almost all the locomotive building firms producing for the DRG. From 1942, a simplified wartime version was built, on which the most obvious changes were the omission of the second side windows in the cab and the solid disc carrying wheels. * The Molli railway (Mollibahn), a narrow- gauge steam-powered railway in Mecklenburg running on gauge track, operates three 2-8-2T locomotives built by Orenstein & Koppel in 1932. India Broad gauge On the gauge, the Class XD was the first 2-8-2 in India to be built in quantity. Introduced in 1927, 78 were built before the Second World War by Vulcan Foundry, North British Locomotive Company (NBL), Armstrong Whitworth and ≈†koda Works. Production resumed after the war, and 110 were built by NBL in 1945 and 1946, while Vulcan Foundry built the last six in 1948. MLW-built Class X-Dominion (Class CWD) There was also a Class XE that was built by William Beardmore and Company and Vulcan Foundry. Wartime designs included the Class AWD and Class AWE, built by American company Baldwin Locomotive Works, and the Class X-Dominion (later Class CWD) built as part of Canada's Mutual Aid program by two Canadian companies, the Canadian Locomotive Company and Montreal Locomotive Works.Hughes, Hugh. (1996). Indian Locomotives, Part 4 ‚Äì 1941-1990. Harrow, Middlesex: Continental Railway Circle, pp. 19-20, 24. Class WG no. 9616 9619 at Agra After the war, a new design was produced and placed in production in 1950. The Class WG was the main post-war broad gauge freight locomotive type of the Indian Railways (IR). The first order of 200 was split evenly between NBL and Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW). Apart from Indian manufacture, examples were also built in England, Scotland, Germany, Austria, the United States, Japan and Italy. By the time production ceased in 1970, 2,450 Class WG locomotives had been built. Metre gauge After the First World War, an Indian Railway Standards (IRS) 2-8-2 class became the main heavy freight locomotive on the . While two versions were designed, the Class YD with a 10-ton axle load and the Class YE with a 12-ton axle load, none was built of the latter class.Hughes, Hugh. (1992). Indian Locomotives, Part 2 ‚Äì Metre Gauge 1872-1940. Harrow, Middlesex: Continental Railway Circle, p. 19. During the Second World War, many of the war-time United States Army Transportation Corps (USATC) S118 class locomotives were sent to India and 33 more were ordered after the war. The post-Second World War Mikado design was the Class YG, of which 1,074 were built between 1949 and 1972, with nearly half of them being manufactured in India. Narrow gauges Two narrow track gauges were in use in India. The gauge was the more widely used while the gauge was used by the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway and the Scindia State Railway. Mikado type locomotives were used by the following: * The Bengal Nagpur Railway used a saturated steam B class, a superheated BS class, and a BC class comprising B class locomotives that had been converted from saturated to superheated. * The Barsi Light Railway used an F class of thirteen locomotives, ten built by Nasmyth, Wilson and Company between 1926 and 1929, and three built by Hunslet Engine Company in 1949. * The Great Indian Peninsula Railway used a B/1 class of seven locomotives, four built by NBL in 1917, one more by NBL in 1922, and two by Nasmyth, Wilson and Company in 1926. * The Scindia State Railway used sixteen locomotives of five classes, the Classes NH/1 through NH/5, built between 1914 and 1959.Hughes, Hugh & Jux, Frank. (1980). Steam Locomotives in India, Part 1 ‚Äì Narrow Gauge. Harrow, Middlesex: Continental Railway Circle, p. 29. The standard narrow gauge 2-8-2 locomotive was the ZE class, with 65 engines built by five companies between 1928 and 1954. Nasmyth, Wilson built ten in 1928, Hanomag built sixteen in 1931, Corpet-Louvet built twelve in 1950, Krauss- Maffei built fifteen in 1952 and another ten in 1954, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries built ten in 1954. In 1957 and 1958, six ZD class locomotives were also built by Nippon Sharyo in Japan. Indonesia Before 1945, the Dutch East Indies Railway Administration, Staatspoorwegen (SS), introduced two types of locomotives with a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, the class 1500 tender engine of 1920, later renumbered as class D51, and the class 1400 tank engine of 1921-22, later renumbered as class D14. The class 1500 was originally used on the Hedjaz Railway, but was later diverted to Java prior to the First World War.Durrant, A. E. (1972) PNKA Power Parade. Harrow, Middlesex: Railway Continental Circle. p. 44. After the independence of Indonesia in 1945, the government of Indonesia nationalised all of the Dutch-owned railway companies, including the SS whose name was later changed to Djawatan Kereta Api (DKA), the Departmental Agency of Railway. Shortly after, the DKA bought 100 new steam locomotives with a Mikado wheel arrangement from Krupp in Germany. These locomotives, designated the D52 type, were the most modern steam locomotive in Indonesia at that time, with a large physical appearance and equipped with electric lighting. It was similar to the Class 41 locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. In Java, the D52 locomotives were placed in passenger service, but was occasionally also used as freight locomotives. Some people even idolized the D52 because of its loyalty in taking passengers anywhere, as happened on the Rapih Dhoho Train from Madiun to Kertosono. The D52 was a mainstay for this train until the end of steam operation in Indonesia. In contrast to the Java-based units, Sumatra-based D52 locomotives were used for hauling freight trains, mainly coal trains from the Tanjung Enim coal mine, now owned by the PT Bukit Asam mining company, to the coal dumping sites at Kertapati and Tarahan. The D52 locomotives were initially coal-fired but, from mid-1956, 28 locomotives, numbers D52002 to D52029, were converted to oil burners. The work was done in stages over five years by the locomotive repair shop at Madiun. One locomotive from this class was written off from service near Linggapura station after a boiler explosion that killed its driver, as a result of steam pipe failure. The only one of the original 100 locomotives that survived into the 21st century is D52 number D52099, which is on display at the Transport Museum in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. Italy Italian railways relied primarily on 2-6-2s for fast passenger services, while heavy passenger service was assigned to 2-8-0s of the classes 744 and 745. Although Mikado types had little opportunity for development in Italy, Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) commissioned the class 746 for heavy passenger service on the Adriatic route. To serve local branches and mountain lines where tank locomotives were more suitable, FS derived the new class 940 from the 2-8-0 class 740, with the same dimensions but adding a rear Bissel truck to support the coal bunker behind the cab to make it a 2-8-2. Japan The Japanese Government Railways (JGR) built the Class D51 Mikado tender locomotive for use on the gauge lines on the Japanese mainland and in its former colonies. (Also see Soviet Union.) One is plinthed at Kiso-Fukushima station on the Nagoya - Nagano line. New Zealand Only one 2-8-2 locomotive ever operated on New Zealand's national rail network, and it was not even ordered by the New Zealand Railways Department, who ran almost the entire network. The locomotive was ordered in 1901 from Baldwin Locomotive Works by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) for use on their main line's steep section between Wellington and Paekakariki. It entered service on 10 June 1902 as the WMR's no. 17. At the time, it was the most powerful locomotive in New Zealand and successfully performed its intended tasks. When the WMR was incorporated into the national network in 1908, the Railways Department reclassified no. 17 as the solitary member of the BC class, no. BC 463, and the locomotive continued to operate on the Wellington-Paekakariki line until it was withdrawn on 31 March 1927. South Africa Only six Mikado locomotive classes saw service in South Africa, five on Cape gauge and one on narrow gauge. The type was rare, with only two of these classes built in quantity. Cape gauge NGR Havelock, c. 1888 During 1887, designs for a 2-8-2 Mikado type tank-and-tender locomotive were prepared by the Natal Government Railways. The single locomotive was built in the Durban workshops and entered service in 1888, named Havelock, but was soon rebuilt to a Pacific configuration. The engine Havelock was the first locomotive to be designed and built in South Africa and also the first to have eight-coupled wheels. In 1903, the Cape Government Railways (CGR) placed two Cape Class 9 2-8-2 locomotives in service, designed by H.M. Beatty, Locomotive Superintendent of the CGR from 1896 to 1910, and built by Kitson and Company. They had bar frames, Stephenson's link motion valve gear and used saturated steam. In comparison with the Cape Class 8 2-8-0 locomotive of 1901, however, it was found that their maintenance costs were much higher without any advantage in terms of efficiency. As a result, no more of the type were ordered. In 1912, when these locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR), they were classified as Class Experimental 4.Classification of S.A.R. Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, Pretoria, January 1912, pp. 9, 12, 15, 36-37 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) SAR Class 11 no. 933 In 1904, the Central South African Railways (CSAR) placed 36 Class 11 Mikados in service. Built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL), it was designed by P.A. Hyde, Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CSAR from 1902 to 1904, for goods train service on the Witwatersrand. It was superheated, with a Belpaire firebox, Walschaerts valve gear and plate frame. The Class 11 designation was retained when the CSAR was amalgamated into the SAR in 1912. SAR Class Experimental 5 In 1906, the CGR placed a single experimental 2-8-2 in service, designed by H.M. Beatty and built by Kitson. It was a larger version of the Cape Class 9 in all respects, also with a bar frame, Stephenson's link motion valve gear and using saturated steam. The locomotive was not classified and was simply referred to as \\"the Mikado\\". On the CGR it was exceeded in size only by the Kitson-Meyer 0-6-0+0-6-0 of 1904. At the time, it was considered as a big advance in motive power, but the design was never repeated and the Cape Mikado remained unique. In 1912, it was classified as Class Experimental 5 on the SAR. In 1917, the South African Railways placed at least four, possibly six, Mikado type steam locomotives in service. They had been built for the Chemins de Fer du Bas Congo √° Katanga in the Belgian Congo and were obtained on temporary lease, to alleviate the critical shortage of locomotives as a result of the First World War's disruption of locomotive production in Europe and the United Kingdom. The Katanga Mikados, as the locomotives were known on the SAR, were all forwarded to the Belgian Congo after the war. (Also see Belgian Congo) Narrow gauge SAR Class NG15 crossing the Van Stadens river bridge Between 1931 and 1958, 21 narrow gauge Class NG15 Mikados, developed from the Class Hd and Class NG5 of South West Africa (SWA), were acquired for the Otavi Railway in SWA. Designed by the SAR, it was built by Henschel & Son and Soci√©t√© Franco- Belge. A major improvement on the earlier locomotives was the use of a Krauss- Helmholtz bogie, with the leading pair of driving wheels linked to the leading pony truck. The leading driving wheels had a limited amount of sideplay while the axle still remained parallel to the other three driving axles at all times, thus allowing the locomotive to negotiate sharper curves than its two predecessors. When the SWA narrow gauge line was regauged to Cape gauge in 1960, all these locomotives were transferred to the Eastern Cape for further service on the Langkloof narrow gauge line from Port Elizabeth to Avontuur. Here they were nicknamed the Kalahari. South West Africa (Namibia) Two very similar Mikado classes saw service on the narrow gauge Otavi Railway in South West Africa (SWA). SAR Class NG5, c. 1960 In 1912, the German administration in Deutsch-S√ºdwest-Afrika acquired three locomotives for use on the line from Swakopmund to Karibib. They were built by Henschel & Son and were designated Class Hd. The locomotives were superheated, with Heusinger valve gear, piston valves and outside plate frames. Since they did not have separate bogie trucks, the leading and trailing carrying wheels were arranged as radial axles to allow for sideways motion of the wheels with respect to the locomotive frame. After the First World War, they were taken onto the roster of the South African Railways (SAR) and later reclassified as Class NG5 along with the similar locomotives of 1922.South African Railways and Harbours Narrow Gauge Locomotive Diagram Book, 2‚Äô0\\" Gauge, S.A.R. Mechanical Dept. Drawing Office, Pretoria, 28 November 1932 In 1922, the SAR placed six Class NG5 locomotives in service on the Otavi branch in SWA, also built by Henschel. They were built to the same design as the Class Hd, but had a different coupled wheel suspension arrangement, different boilers and slide valves. In service, they were operated in a common pool with the Class Hd locomotives until they were all withdrawn from service when the SWA system was regauged to Cape gauge in 1960.South African Railways and Harbours Locomotive Diagram Book, 2‚Äô0\\" & 3‚Äô6\\" Gauge Steam Locomotives, 15 August 1941, as amended Soviet Union JNR Class D51-22 on Sakhalin Island At the end of the Second World War, several gauge Japanese Class D51 locomotives were left behind on Russia's Sakhalin island, formerly Karafuto, by retreating Japanese forces. In addition, two Class D51 wrecks were abandoned to the north of the city. Until 1979, the serviceable Japanese locomotives were used on the island by the Soviet Railways. One was then plinthed outside the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk railway station, and another is still in running condition and is kept at the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk railway station. The Sakhalin Railway has a connection with the mainland via a train ferry operating between Kholmsk on the island and Vanino on the mainland. The Japanese gauge still remains in use on the island, although in 2004 conversion began to the Russian gauge. (Also see Japan) Spain The network of Spain used one Mikado tank locomotive and two versions of tender locomotives. The Spanish manufacturer MTM delivered six 2-8-2T locomotives to the Madrid-Caceres-Portugal line in 1925. A project at MTM in 1942 to build a big 2-8-2 never realised. The first tender version was built by two American companies in 1917, fifteen by Brooks Locomotive Works and forty by Schenectady Locomotive Works. They were numbered from 4501 to 4555 and were a slightly smaller version of the USRA Light Mikado. The locomotives served well in the Norte system, where they were nicknamed Chalecos. In 1953, RENFE (acronym of REd Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Espa√±oles), the nationalised railway company, acquired twenty-five locomotives of the second tender version from North British Locomotive Company (NBL) of Glasgow. Spanish builders MTM, MACOSA and Euskalduna and the American Babcock & Wilcox built 213 more between 1953 and 1960, with only minor detail differences such as double chimneys, Llubera sanders, ACFI feedwater heaters and oil-burning. Their empty weight was and they had diameter coupled wheels. They performed well in both freight and passenger service and lasted until the official end of steam in common service in 1975. One Norte and eighteen RENFE locomotives are preserved, three of them in good working condition. Thailand (Siam) Mikado 950, imported to Thailand 1950 on exhibition before the old Bangkok-Thonburi Station. The first Mikado locomotives of the Royal State Railways of Siam (RSR), the predecessor of the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), were acquired from 1923 as standard locomotives for express and mixed trains, to supersede the E-Class locomotives which had been commissioned between 1915 and 1921. The first Siamese Mikado class was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1923, Nasmyth, Wilson and Company in 1924 and Batignolles-Ch√¢tillon, France in 1925. However, it was not until the first batch of eight of Thailand's second class of 2-8-2 locomotives, numbers 351 to 358, was imported from Japan in 1936 that Mikado locomotives really became successful in Thailand. The RSR imported more Mikado standard locomotives to meet railways as well as military demands between 1938 and 1945. After the Second World War, in 1946, the RSR imported fifty used United States Army Transportation Corps S118 Class locomotives, the so-called MacArthur Locomotives. Another eighteen new engines of the same Class were purchased around 1948-1949 to meet the post-war demand. The last type of Mikado steam locomotives for Thailand were seventy engines imported by SRT from Japan between 1949 and 1951, numbered 901 to 970. Of these, only Mikado no. 953 is still serviceable, even though it is no longer actively in use.The Railways of Thailand / R. Ramaer., White Lotus, 1993 United Kingdom The 2-8-2 wheel arrangement was rarely, but successfully, used on British rails. Sir Nigel Gresley of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) designed two Mikado types of note: * The Class P1 was a freight derivative of his famed Class A1 4-6-2, inspired by the Pennsylvania Railroad's twin K4s 4-6-2 and L1s locomotives. Two were built, but there was never really much call for their ability and they remained under-utilised throughout their short existence.LNER Encyclopedia - The Gresley P1 Mineral 2-8-2 (Mikado) Locomotives - retrieved 26 October 2006. Archived 21 June 2013. * Gresley's other class of Mikados was his Class P2. These were express passenger locomotives, rather more inspired by European influences than American. They were built to haul heavy express trains in hilly terrain north of Edinburgh, where Gresley thought the additional adhesion possible with a 2-8-2 might serve well. Unfortunately, poor self-centering on the leading truck meant that the leading driving wheels wore against the rails on tighter curves, being hard on both track and wheels. Gresley's successor Edward Thompson converted the Class P2s into 4-6-2 Pacifics that were rather unattractive, in most opinions.LNER Encyclopedia - The Gresley P2 Passenger 2-8-2 (Mikado) Locomotives - retrieved 26 October 2006 In June 2014, a new Class P2 Mikado locomotive, no. 2007 The Prince of Wales, intended to work both on mainline and preserved railways, was under construction by the P2 Steam Locomotive Company.Welcome to the project to build the new Gresley class P2 No. 2007 Prince of Wales (Accessed on 29 September 2016 The Great Western Railway (GWR) operated a class of 54 2-8-2T engines that had been rebuilt from 2-8-0T locomotives by Charles Collett, chief mechanical engineer of the GWR. As early as 1906, the chief mechanical engineer at the time, G. J. Churchward, planned a class of Mikado tank engines to handle heavy coal trains in South Wales. The plan was abandoned, however, as it was feared they would be unable to handle the sharp curves present on Welsh mineral branches. Instead, Churchward designed the 4200 Class of 2-8-0 tank engines, of which nearly 200 were built. Collett 7200 Class no. 7221 In the 1930s, coal traffic declined with the result that many of these engines stood idle, since their limited operating range prevented them from being allocated to other mainline duties. Collett, as Churchward's successor, decided to rebuild some of the 4200 Class engines as 2-8-2Ts. The addition of a trailing axle increased the engine's operating range by allowing an increased coal and water storage capacity. Altogether 54 locomotives were modified in this manner. The 7200 Class tank engines, as they were known, remained in service until the end of steam in Britain in the early 1960s. United States of America USRA Heavy Mikado The 2-8-2 saw great success in the United States, mostly as a freight locomotive. In the 1910s it largely replaced the 2-8-0 Consolidation as the main heavy freight locomotive type. Its tractive effort was similar to that of the best 2-8-0s, but a developing requirement for higher speed freight trains drove the shift to the 2-8-2 wheel arrangement. PRR L1s no. 520 at the Pennsylvania Railroad Museum, Strasburg, Pennsylvania The Mikado type was, in turn, ousted from the top-flight trains by larger freight locomotive wheel arrangements such as the 2-8-4, 2-10-2, 2-10-4 and articulated locomotives, but no successor type became ubiquitous and the Mike remained the most common road freight locomotive with most railroads until the end of steam. More than 14,000 were built in the United States, about 9500 of these for North American service, constituting about one-fifth of all locomotives in service there at the time. The heaviest Mikados were the Great Northern's class O-8, with an axle load of . Almost all North American railroads rostered the type, notable exceptions being the Boston and Maine, the Delaware and Hudson, the Cotton Belt and the Norfolk and Western. The largest users included the New York Central with 715 locomotives, the Baltimore and Ohio with 610, the Pennsylvania Railroad with 579, the Illinois Central with 565, the Milwaukee Road with 500 and the Southern with 435. Yugoslavia Borsig-built 2-8-2s were delivered to the railway of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1930. These became the JDZ class 06, of which a few remain in the former Yugoslav nations.

After graduating from college,\\"Andrew Lippa and David Bloch\\", The New York Times, July 20, 2008 Lippa moved to New York City in 1987 and became a middle school music teacher at Columbia Grammar and Prep School (CGPS) on the Upper West Side. He was promoted his second year at CGPS to dean of 7th and 8th grade students ‚Äì an assistant principal position ‚Äì and held that post, in addition to teaching music, until June 1991. In 1988 Lippa was accepted into the celebrated BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop as a composer. There he met his future collaborator Tom Greenwald (John & Jen). He later pursued a career in musical composition. Musical theatre career Lippa began his professional theatrical career at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut. He was hired in early 1992 to be the pianist for a production of It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman but quickly rose to become the dance arranger and assistant music director. He then stayed on for the remainder of the season in that capacity. Following the Goodspeed, Lippa worked at various theatres as music director and/or pianist in addition to being an increasingly in-demand arranger. The Goodspeed produced Lippa‚Äôs first musical, John & Jen (book by Tom Greenwald), in 1993 at the Norma Terris Theatre in Chester, Connecticut. That production was followed by a workshop production the following year at the Berkshire Theatre Festival and, ultimately, a nearly 6-month run at Lamb's Theatre in New York City. The show was produced by Carolyn Rossi Copeland. Lippa then went on to write the book, music, and lyrics for The Wild Party. He began work in 1996, and the Manhattan Theatre Club presented a reading of the first act later that year. Julia Murney, who later played the lead role of Queenie, was in the ensemble of that reading. The Wild Party had a two-week development at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Connecticut in the summer of 1997.

Marked largely with brick, it winds between Boston Common to the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown. Stops along the trail include simple explanatory ground markers, graveyards, notable churches and buildings, and a historic naval frigate. While most of the sites are free or suggest donations, the Old South Meeting House, the Old State House, and the Paul Revere House charge admission. The Freedom Trail is overseen by the City of Boston's Freedom Trail Commission and is supported in part by grants from various nonprofits and foundations, private philanthropy, and Boston National Historical Park. The Freedom Trail was conceived by local journalist William Schofield, who in 1951 suggested building a pedestrian trail to link important local landmarks. Boston mayor John Hynes decided to put Schofield's idea into action. By 1953, 40,000 people were walking the trail annually., The National Park Service operates a visitor's center on the first floor of Faneuil Hall, where they offer tours, provide free maps of the Freedom Trail and other historic sites, and sell books about Boston and United States history. Some observers have noted the tendency of the Freedom Trail's narrative frame to omit certain historical locations, such as the sites of the Boston Tea Party and the Liberty Tree. Members of the Boy Scouts of America who hike or camp along the Freedom Trail may be eligible for the Historic Trails Award. Official trail sites The official trail sites are (generally from south- to-north): # Boston Common # Massachusetts State House # Park Street Church # Granary Burying Ground # King's Chapel and Burying Ground # Benjamin Franklin statue and former site of Boston Latin School # Old Corner Bookstore # Old South Meeting House # Old State House # Site of the Boston Massacre # Faneuil Hall # Paul Revere House # Old North Church # Copp's Hill Burying Ground # # Bunker Hill Monument The Black Heritage Trail crosses the Freedom Trail between the Massachusetts State House and Park Street Church. The Boston Irish Famine Memorial is also located along the Freedom Trail.  Self-Guided Audio Tour  The visitor center at the Freedom Trail also offers GPS enabled self- guided audio tour guide app for both iPhone and Android. It works offline; the password to access the Tour/App can be purchased at the visitor center. Each point of interest along the tour has a narrated story, narrated directions, and helpful images. As you walk along the path and approach a pin, its story automatically pops-up and starts playing professionally narrated stories (prepared by local guides). The self-guided tour eliminates the need to follow any scheduled tour timings, one can skip crowded groups.

They are backless and open-toed, essentially an open-toed mule. Slides can be high-heeled, flat-heeled or somewhere in between, and may cover nearly the entire foot from ankle to toe, or may have only one or two narrow straps. They usually include a single strap or a sequence of straps across the toes and the lower half of the foot to hold the shoe on the foot. The term is descriptive in that this shoe is easy to 'slide' on and off the foot when the wearer wants to do so. Slides do not have a ‚ÄúY‚Äù shaped strap, like the flip flop. As of August 2019, slides are trending because of the desire for a more comfortable shoe that still allows participation in activities and sports.  History  Slides can be traced back to Ancient Rome, Italy. Though they are often thought to come from as far back as Ancient Egypt or Ancient Greece, there is a lack of documentation to further prove that. The popularity of slides in the United States started in the late 1960s, when vibrant, colorful aesthetics, such as cheery flower motifs, were followed. Across the world in Germany the brand Birkenstock created the first fitness slide, a simple design made from contoured cork with a single buckled leather strap. Another German company, Adidas invented the well-known Adilette pool slide.  Use  Slides are typically employed in casual situations. They are a unisex footwear worn by both men and women.

Seahorse was laid down on 1 August 1942 by the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California. The vessel was launched on 9 January 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Chester C. Smith, and commissioned on 31 March 1943, Commander Donald McGregor in command.  First war patrol, August ‚Äì September 1943  Following shakedown along the California coast, Seahorse sailed to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii and, on 3 August 1943, got underway for her maiden war patrol, conducted off the Palau Islands. On the morning of 29 August, while the submarine was gaining attack position on a Japanese convoy, she was detected by escorting destroyers and suffered minor damage from a depth charge attack. Seahorse scored three torpedo hits on a transport on 6 September, and then went deep to evade a depth charge attack that caused severe leaks and put her number four torpedo tube out of commission. A week later, she expended eight torpedoes in an unsuccessful attempt to sink a large tanker. The submarine terminated her first patrol at Midway on 27 September. During this patrol, Seahorses commanding officer ignored several potential targets, rather than face sonar-equipped escorts,Holwitt, Joel I. \\"Execute Against Japan\\", Ph.D. dissertation, Ohio State University, 2005, p.157fn81. which unrealistic prewar training indicated was virtual suicide.Holwitt, p.157.  Second war patrol, October ‚Äì December 1943  Following refit, Seahorse sailed on 20 October for her second war patrol with her new skipper, Slade Cutter, the executive officer of the first patrol. Between 29 October and 31 October, the submarine sank three enemy trawlers in surface actions and then commenced a two-day attack on a 17-ship convoy. Early on the morning of 2 November, following an attack on the convoy by another United States submarine, Seahorse evaded three escort ships and launched three torpedoes into two freighters. Four hours later, she again attacked, sending three torpedoes toward a tanker and another spread at a third freighter. Flames burst from each target as two Japanese destroyers turned toward Seahorse but too late to catch the rapidly departing submarine. Sunk in this action were the 7,089-ton cargo ship Chihaya Maru, and the 5,859-ton cargo ship, Ume Maru. Seahorse later closed again on the convoy but was driven down by depth charges and departed the vicinity. On 22 November, Seahorse maneuvered past three enemy escorts, launched four torpedoes from periscope depth, and sank the cargo ship, Daishu Maru. On 26 November, the submarine contacted another enemy convoy and began to close the range. Determined to mount an attack before the targets entered the mined Tsushima Strait, the submarine launched four torpedoes at long range quickly sinking a cargo ship; and then, dodging enemy escorts, let go four stern shots at a second target. The results seemed disappointing‚Äîuntil a sudden blast sent flames and debris mushrooming high into the air, completely destroying the 7,309-ton tanker, San Ramon Maru. Seahorse expended the last of her torpedoes on the night of 30 November and 1 December. After maneuvering for several hours, the submarine was finally able to fire her stern tubes at an enemy convoy. However, one torpedo exploded just after it left the tube, and the entire convoy opened fire on the vicinity of the submarine. With so many explosions around her, it was impossible for Seahorse to determine whether any torpedoes had hit. Low on fuel and out of torpedoes, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 December from a successful second patrol, with four ships and three trawlers sunk.  Third war patrol, January ‚Äì February 1944  Seahorse departed Pearl Harbor on 6 January 1944 for her third war patrol. On 16 January, while en route to the Palaus, she evaded four escorts and destroyed the 784-ton cargo ship, Nikk≈ç Maru, with three torpedo hits. She spent 21 January tracking two enemy cargo ships in company with three escorts. In the late evening, she pressed home four consecutive attacks to sink the 3,025-ton cargo ship, Yasukuni Maru, and the 3,156-ton passenger-cargo ship, Ikoma Maru. On the evening of 28 January, Seahorse began an 80-hour chase of an enemy convoy off the Palaus. After being continually harassed by escorts and aircraft throughout the next day, Seahorse launched three torpedoes at the cargo ship, Toko Maru. After the sinking, the submarine lost contact with the convoy for several hours, but again had it in sight at dawn on 31 January. Early on the morning of 1 February, Seahorse launched four torpedoes for no hits followed by two more, again without result. With the crew exhausted from the extended chase, the submarine fired her final two torpedoes and headed for deeper water. After evading the escorts, she surfaced in time to see the results of her latest attack as the cargo ship, Toei Maru, slipped beneath the waves. Seahorse terminated her third patrol at Pearl Harbor on 16 February.  Fourth war patrol, March ‚Äì May 1944  Seahorses fourth war patrol was conducted in the Marianas. She departed Pearl Harbor on 16 March and intercepted a large enemy convoy on 8 April. After nightfall, the submarine launched four torpedoes at overlapping targets, sinking the converted seaplane tender, . Shortly thereafter, her second spread of torpedoes sank the cargo ship, Kizugawa Maru. Although a counterattack by escorting destroyers drove the submarine from the vicinity, she quickly regained contact and continued the chase into the following day, sinking the cargo ship, Bisaku Maru. Seahorse took up lifeguard station for the carrier airstrikes on Saipan that commenced on 12 April and, while west of Saipan on 20 April, sighted and sank the Japanese submarine, . In the same vicinity a week later, Seahorse sank the 5,244-ton cargo ship, Akigawa Maru. The submarine departed her lifeguard station on 3 May to refuel at Milne Bay, New Guinea, and arrived at Brisbane, Australia, on 11 May.  Fifth and sixth war patrols, June ‚Äì October 1944  Seahorse put to sea for her fifth war patrol on 11 June 1944, patrolling between Formosa and Luzon. On the morning of 27 June, she sank the tanker, Medan Maru, and damaged two other enemy vessels. On 3 July, close to midnight, she spotted convoy No. 91 en route from Takao to Hong Kong consisting of four transport/cargo ships and two escorts (the Kuri and the Hatsukari). She torpedoed and sank the transport Nitto Maru and the cargo ship Gyoyu Maru (the ex-British Joan Moller) and then soon after midnight on the 4th, she expended the last of her torpedoes and sank the cargo ship, Kyodo Maru No. 28. The convoy's only remaining transport, (the ex-British Ethel Moller), and its two escorts, were able to reach Hong Kong without further incident on 5 July. On 19 July Seahorse returned to Pearl Harbor. Seahorse spent the first part of her sixth war patrol supporting the capture of the Palaus and then headed for the Luzon Strait. Despite intensive efforts, the submarine could locate only one worthwhile target, Coast Defense Vessel No. 21, a frigate of 800 tons, which she sank. Five days later, Seahorse took up lifeguard station for the carrier airstrike on northern Luzon and then returned to Midway on 18 October.  Seventh and eighth war patrols, March ‚Äì August 1945  Upon completion of an overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, Seahorse put to sea on 9 March 1945 for her seventh war patrol. Following patrol in the Tsushima Strait, she sank a small junk with gunfire on 8 April. On 18 April, an attack by two patrol boats (CD-14 and CD-132) left the submarine's interior a shambles of broken glass, smashed instruments, and spilled hydraulic oil. Seahorse made hasty repairs and headed for Apra Harbor, Guam, and then to Pearl Harbor for overhaul. Seahorse put to sea for her eighth and final war patrol on 12 July. When hostilities ceased on 15 August, the submarine was on station southeast of Hachij≈ç-jima. Following her return to Midway, Seahorse sailed for Mare Island where she was decommissioned on 2 March 1946. She was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet and remained inactive for the remainder of her career. She was reclassified an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-304, on 6 November 1962, struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1967, and sold on 14 December 1968 to Zidell Explorations Inc., Portland, Oregon, for scrapping. Seahorse (SS-304) received nine battle stars for World War II service.

The parish contains the adjacent settlement of Haxton. Fittleton and Haxton are situated on the east bank of the River Avon and just across the river from the village and parish of Netheravon. History Several bowl barrows are evidence of prehistoric activity in the area. On Coombe Down, a site partly within the parish was occupied in the early Iron Age, became a Romano-British settlement, and was the site of a house in the fifth or sixth century. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a settlement of 24 households at Vitelstone. Later, Fittleton and Haxton were tithings of the parish, with populations of similar size. The Manor House at Fittleton is a two-storey, five-bay house from the late 17th or early 18th century. Its stable block is from the 16th and 18th centuries, with timber framing on the north side, under a thatched roof. Much of the downland in the parish was bought by the War Office around 1898 for military training and today forms part of the Tidworth ranges within the Salisbury Plain Training Area. A small school was built at Fittleton in 1722, which expanded and became a National School in 1870. There were about 50 pupils in 1859 and 43 in 1906; children of all ages attended until 1926 when it became a junior school. In 1964 the school amalgamated with Netheravon school, and the older children from both parishes were educated here until the Fittleton building closed in 1989, on the opening of a new building at Netheravon. Church All Saints' Church The Church of England parish church of All Saints is of flint and stone, partly rendered, with a west tower. It was begun in the 13th century and the chancel arch survives from that time. The building was enlarged in the 15th century and the south porch was added in the 16th. There is a 12th-century font, mounted on a shaft and base from a restoration undertaken in 1903. Of the six bells in the tower, three are 17th-century and three are from 1903. The church has a memorial window for HMS Fittleton, a minesweeper of the Royal Naval Reserve which sunk in the North Sea in 1976 with the loss of twelve lives. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1964. Today Fittleton is part of the Avon River Team of parishes. Airfield Netheravon Airfield was created for the Royal Flying Corps in 1913 from farmland in the southwest of the parish, and in 1918 became RAF Netheravon, an operational and training base. It was the home of No. 1 Flying Training School RAF from 1919 until 1931, and during the Second World War was used again for training and as a short-term base for operational squadrons, with glider and parachute activity from 1941. In 1963 the airfield and camp were transferred to the Army, and became AAC Netheravon (Army Air Corps) from 1966 until 2012. Part of the site is today used as a parachute centre, on weekdays for the Joint Services Parachute Centre (JSPC) and at weekends for the Army Parachute Association (APA). Local government Fittleton elects a parish council. It falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for almost all significant local government functions.

The front gate of the State House, located on Beacon Street. 1827 drawing by Alexander Jackson Davis The State House displaying a banner in honor of the Boston Red Sox's 2013 World Series appearance The Massachusetts State House, also known as the Massachusetts Statehouse or the New State House, is the state capitol and seat of government for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, located in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. The building houses the Massachusetts General Court (state legislature) and the offices of the Governor of Massachusetts. The building, designed by architect Charles Bulfinch, was completed in January 1798 at a cost of $133,333 (more than five times the budget), and has repeatedly been enlarged since. It is considered a masterpiece of Federal architecture and among Bulfinch's finest works, and was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architectural significance. Building and grounds The building is situated on 6.7 acres (27,000 m2) of land on top of Beacon Hill in Boston, opposite the Boston Common on Beacon Street. It was built on land once owned by John Hancock, Massachusetts's first elected governor. The Masonic cornerstone ceremony took place on July 4, 1795, with Paul Revere, Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, presiding. Before the current State House was completed in 1798, Massachusetts's government house was the Old State House on what is now Washington Street. For the building's design, architect Charles Bulfinch made use of two existing buildings in London: William Chambers's Somerset House, and James Wyatt's Pantheon.. After Maine separated from Massachusetts and became an independent state in 1820, Charles Bulfinch designed Maine's capitol building with architectural influence of the Massachusetts Capitol building with a simplified Greek Revival influence. The Commonwealth completed a major expansion of the original building in 1895. The architect for the annex was Bostonian Charles Brigham. In 1917, the east and west wings, designed by architects Sturgis, Bryant, Chapman & Andrews, were completed. In July 2016, Governor Charlie Baker proposed to the state legislature to sell of permanent easement on the west side of the State House lawn to a neighboring condominium. The land in question was once pasture owned by John Hancock and the easement would allow for the addition of au pair units. Dome The original wood dome, which leaked, was covered with copper in 1802 by Paul Revere's Revere Copper Company. Revere was the first American to roll copper successfully into sheets (for copper sheathing) in a commercially viable manner. The dome was first painted gray and then light yellow before being gilded with gold leaf in 1874. During World War II, the dome was painted gray once again, to prevent reflection during blackouts and to protect the city and building from bombing attacks. In 1997, at a cost of more than $300,000, the dome was re-gilded, in 23k gold. The dome is topped with a gilded, wooden pine cone, symbolizing both the importance of Boston's lumber industry during early colonial times and of the state of Maine, which was a district of the Commonwealth when the Bulfinch section of the building was completed. Statuary In front of the building is an equestrian statue of General Joseph Hooker. Other statues in front of the building include Daniel Webster, educator Horace Mann, and former US President John F. Kennedy. The statues of Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer are located on the lawns below the east and west wings. Inside the building Reading room of the State Library of Massachusetts Memorial to U.S. Civil War nurses The original red-brick Bulfinch building contains the Governor's offices (on the west end) with the Massachusetts Senate occupying the former House of Representatives Chamber under the dome. The Massachusetts House of Representatives occupies a chamber on the west side of the Brigham addition. Hanging over this chamber is the \\"Sacred Cod\\", which was given to the House of Representatives in 1784 by a Boston merchant. The Sacred Cod symbolizes the importance of the fishing industry to the early Massachusetts economy.Massachusetts State House, via cityofboston.gov The House Chamber is decorated with murals by Albert Herter, father of Massachusetts Gov. Christian Herter. Murals on the second floor under the dome were painted by artist Edward Brodney. Brodney won a competition to paint the first mural in a contest sponsored by the Works Progress Administration in 1936. It is entitled \\"Columbia Knighting Her World War Disabled\\". Brodney could not afford to pay models, and friends and family posed. The model for Columbia was Brodney's sister Norma Brodney Cohen, and the model for the soldier on one knee in the foreground was his brother Fred Brodney. In 1938, he painted a second mural under the dome called \\"World War Mothers\\". The models were again primarily friends and family members, with sister Norma sitting beside their mother Sarah Brodney. The New York Times notes that the murals are relatively rare examples of military art with women as their subjects. A staircase in front of the Bulfinch building leads from Beacon Street to Doric Hall inside the building. The large main doors inside Doric Hall are only opened on three occasions: # When the President of the United States or a foreign head of state visits. # When the Governor exits the building on his or her last day in office. This tradition is known as the Long Walk and begins when the Governor, alone, exits the Executive Chamber, walks down to the second floor, through Doric Hall, and out the main doors. He or she then descends the staircase, crosses Beacon Street, and enters Boston Common, symbolically rejoining the people of Massachusetts as a private citizen. The tradition has been interrupted during recent years. Governor William Weld descended the staircase on his last day in office July 29, 1997, meeting his successor then-Lt. Governor A. Paul Cellucci on the stairs. Four years later, then-Governor Cellucci was deprived of his symbolic chance to descend the State House steps because of ongoing renovations to the front of the building. Acting Governor Jane Swift elected to walk down the stairs with her family before departing for the Berkshire Mountains. On January 4, 2007, Deval Patrick chose to be sworn in on the staircase and give his inaugural address there, forcing outgoing Governor Mitt Romney to take the Long Walk the day before his last in office. # When a regimental flag is returned from battle. Since the regimental flags now return to Washington, D.C., this has not been done since the Vietnam War. The Samuel Adams and Paul Revere time capsule is a metal box located in a cornerstone of the State House, placed there in the late 18th century and rediscovered in 2014. The contents include coins, newspaper clippings and other historical artifacts. Offices Constitutional Officers The State House contains the primary offices of all the commonwealth's Constitutional officers with exception of the Attorney General, who is based at the nearby McCormack Building. *Governor and Lieutenant Governor (Room 360) *Governor's Council (Room 184) *Secretary of the Commonwealth (Room 340) *Treasurer and Receiver-General (Room 227) *Auditor (Room 230) Legislature The majority of State House office space is given over to the Legislature.

Other offices include the House and Senate clerks, House and Senate counsel, and Legislative Information Services. Fourth Estate One corridor of the building's fourth floor is a sort of Newspaper Row, anchored by the large Press Gallery suite where reporters from a range of publications maintain desks. The central Press Gallery room was given to use of reporters by the Legislature in 1909. The Massachusetts State House Press Association, established in 1909, governs these shared workspaces. Some individual news outlets have separate offices. *Press Gallery -- Headquarters of State House reporters for Associated Press, WWLP-TV, the Eagle-Tribune papers, Lowell Sun, WGBH-FM, Springfield Republican/Masslive, and Politico *State House News Service newsroom *WBUR-FM State House bureau *Boston Globe State House bureau *Kevin McNicholas Room, a shared space for broadcast stations Veterans' Organizations A suite of rooms on the fifth floor is home to the Massachusetts headquarters of several veterans' groups, including the American Legion, American Legion Auxiliary, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Italian American War Veterans of the United States, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, Korean War Veterans, Marine Corps League, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Persian Gulf Era Veterans, Polish Legion of American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam Veterans of America.

One of Boston's most enduring nicknames, \\"The Hub of the Universe\\", is from a remark by Oliver Wendell Holmes from his 1858 book The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table in which he mentions the State House (emphasis added): Films In the 1982 film The Verdict, the State House interior is used as both a court house and hospital. The State House is featured prominently in the 2006 film The Departed as a symbol of the ambition of the antagonist, Colin Sullivan. Video games In the 2013 game The Last of Us, both the interior and exterior of the building are depicted, which has been partially destroyed. The State House is featured in Fallout 4, a video game by Bethesda Softworks.

The band has been through various line-up changes since its formation in 1999. Its fanbase is mostly in the UK. Its sound consists of passionate vocals set against heavy rock beats. Vocalist Tairrie B Murphy has cultivated a reputation both on and off the stage for her aggressive performances and acerbic vocal style. Over the decade since the band's formation, the sound has evolved and become heavier with each record, with Mick Murphy's guitar playing becoming a prominent feature along with his solos and riffs. My Ruin are a DIY band who have control over every aspect of their output. In the past they have released several of their records via their own imprint, Rovena Recordings. These records include; The Brutal Language (2005), Throat Full of Heart (2008), and live album Alive On the Other Side (2008). They have also been signed to numerous record labels, including Snapper, Spitfire, Century Media, Undergroove Records, Rovena Recordings and Tiefdruck Musik. History Formation of My Ruin solo project and debut release; Speak and Destroy (1999-2000) My Ruin was founded by frontwoman Tairrie B in February 1999, shortly after her previous outfit, Tura Satana, disbanded in late 1998 after the release of their 2nd studio album Relief Through Release. Tairrie immediately started making plans for her next musical incarnation, which would be a solo project. Of the project in early 1999, Tairrie stated: \\"The band won't just be called Tairrie B, but it will be a solo thing ‚Äì just like Nine Inch Nails is really just Trent Reznor‚Ä¶ It's all down to me now. If it fails, then I won't have anyone else to blame.\\"Kerrang!, September 4, 1999, Issue 766 Recording for Speak and Destroy started in February 1999. Speak and Destroy, released on August 23, 1999 in the UK and Europe, would see Tairrie explore previously uncharted musical territory. The album would be an experimental amalgamation of styles, part Spoken word, part metal, part industrial with electronic stylings. There are even some Rap metal style verses thrown in for good measure, perhaps as homage to Tairrie's days in hardcore rap metal outfit Manhole. The album received highly favorable reviews from the mainstream rock press, with the likes of Kerrang! rating the album 4k's out of 5. Also, many journalists noted that the album was the perfect showcase for the \\"multi- faceted character\\" of Tairrie B and her perceived volatile persona, Kerrang! magazine stated: \\"With My Ruin the volatile vocalist has finally found a worthy platform for her talents.\\" The album and subsequent singles also charted high in the UK charts. The collage of different styles on the record may have been due in part to the fact that the recording took place in four different locations around the world, with different musicians and bands contributing to the recording, writing and production. At the time in an interview, Tairrie said: \\"Bushaq recorded some of the songs here in England, Mel and I did some with Joe Bishara, Ares from downset. did some and Joe Bishara did some with Tura Satana. So there were four completely different scenarios.\\" Amidst the chaos, Tairrie found her main song-writing partner and guitarist in Melanie Makaiwi. Of the partnership and friendship that formed between the pair Tairrie said: \\"I probably enjoyed doing the stuff with Mel most of all. It was generally me going, 'okay, this is the scenario. What do I need to do?'. Melanie was writer, producer, artist, therapist, mentor, best friend, drink technician and drug partner on this album. She was everything a girl could be.\\" Further to this, Tairrie cited Makaiwi as the one who led Tairrie to explore a more restrained vocal style than what she was used to: \\"Working with Melanie was a very cool influence because when we started working together it started as a very casual, experimental vibe. She'd say, 'You don't need to scream on everything, you need to try something different'.\\" Sick with It and the 8MM film soundtrack The track Sick With It went on to feature on the soundtrack for the Nicolas Cage blockbuster hit 8MM. The track was written with Tairrie's previous musical cohorts Tura Satana for inclusion on Speak and Destroy. In an early interview promoting Speak and Destroy, Tairrie revealed that she and her Tura Satana bandmates were still on good terms: \\"It's not like when we fired Scott (Udea, former Tura Satana guitarist). Me and the guys still hang out together.\\" In another interview regarding the song, Tairrie revealed that there are two versions of the song, the one on Speak and Destroy and the one on 8MM soundtrack: \\"The three Tura Satana guys [bassist Rico Villasenor, guitarist Brian Harrah and drummer Marcelo Palomino] are involved, and I've got Grady Avenell [vocals] and Michael Martin [bass] from Will Haven [who've just finished recording their second album ‚ÄòWHVN] on a track called ‚ÄòSick With It. This was written by Brian Harrah, and a different version is on the soundtrack for the new Nicolas Cage movie 8MM.\\" Singles: \\"Terror\\" and \\"Tainted Love\\" Speak and Destroy spawned two singles: \\"Tainted Love\\" backed with \\"Blasphemous Girl\\", released in July 1999 and Terror backed with June 10, released in October 1999. The singles were released on both CD and limited edition numbered vinyl. 1,000 copies of the Tainted Love single was released on red vinyl and 1,000 copies of the Terror single were released on standard vinyl. The Tainted Love CD single was a three track single featuring the Tainted Love cover \\"Blasphemous Girl\\" and spoken word track \\"Scars\\". The Terror CD single was a three track single of remixed versions of \\"Terror\\" (Trilogy Edit), \\"June 10\\" (Martyr Edit) and also a live studio recording of the Snot track, \\"Stoopid\\". The track \\"Terror\\" somewhat bridged the gap between Tairrie's previous album, because it was a re-working of a hidden spoken word track at the end of Relief Through Release. The track also served as a statement of intent, kicking against the naysayers who said she was crazy for splitting up Tura Satana and that it would ultimately be her ruin. At the end of Terror, Tairrie states: \\"No one is going to ruin me; if I have to, I will ruin myself‚Äîand it will be My Ruin.\\" This has served as a personal mantra for Tairrie through the years regarding the band. Tainted Love and Stoopid covers Following the tradition of recording and performing the occasional cover song throughout Tairrie's career, going back as far as Tairrie's days in Manhole, where she covered the song Hard Times by punk/thrash band Cro-Mags, the band covered Tainted Love and Stoopid. Another cover which featured on Tairrie's Relief Through Release record was Negative Creep by Nirvana. For Speak and Destroy, Tairrie would do her own interpretation of the much covered song Tainted Love. The song would go on to haunt the band many years later with fans requesting it live and Tairrie and Mick refusing and showing disdain for the song, which no longer fit with the ethos, vibe or feel of the band. This was made clear in many interviews. In an interview in 1999, when asked why she did the cover of Tainted Love Tairrie simply stated: \\"I wanted to piss everybody off. We were listening to an old ‚Äò80s tape on the way to the studio and I thought it suited what we were doing.\\" The track was originally made famous by Gloria Jones in 1965 and perhaps more memorably by Soft Cell in 1981. Marilyn Manson would later cover the song in 2001. The cover of Stoopid was a tribute to Tairrie's very good friend Lynn Strait, Snot front-man, who had died in December 1998. In an interview with Kerrang! in 2000, Tairrie said of the cover: \\"When Lynn died on the same day as my Grandfather my band decided to cover ‚ÄòStoopid' when we went on tour. That was kind of my way of dealing with the grief that I was feeling.\\" Terror video and possible existence of unseen June 10 video In a Kerrang! magazine feature from 1999, the magazine revealed that My Ruin had been busy recording two videos in London's Electrowerkz. The two videos and tracks in question were single Terror which was released to coincide with the release of the single and June 10, which to date has never surfaced. Both videos were said to be directed by photographer Paul Harries. The June 10 video was mentioned again on myruin.com, when Tairrie was answering fan questions sent to her via email and on the then myruin.com message board. She said in relation to a tour video/DVD documenting the My Beautiful Pain Tour: \\"I might be going back to England mid November to edit down the tour video. I will be doing it with the guys who did the \\"TERROR\\" video with me. This is not for sure because I kind of want to stay in LA and edit but it may not be an option. The video will include lots of live footage, fans, backstage, and the bands we were with on tour, also the unedited versions of \\"TERROR\\" as well as making of the video footage and possibly June Tenth footage.\\" Live line-up When it came to the final line-up of the band, the first incarnation of My Ruin was: *Melanie Makaiwi (Guitar) *Lance Webber (Guitar) *Meghan Mattox (Bass) *Marcelo Palomino (Drums) *Todd Osenbaugh (Keyboards and Samples) Marcelo Palomino had been the drummer for Tura Satana. At the time, Tairrie stated: \\"When I first walked out of Tura Satana, Marcelo was one of the reasons I left, so it's funny he's with me again now. I asked him to do this project because I really respect him as a musician. He is my backbone, he is my strength and without him I simply don't think I could do it. He's the best friend I've got.\\" Palomino would become a recurring member of My Ruin and he joined the live band once again for their Tell Your God Tour in 2008 whilst promoting the band's fifth studio album, Throat Full of Heart. He would also feature on the artwork and recordings of the 2nd live album, titled Alive on the Other Side, that followed in late 2008. In 2011, Palomino collaborated with the band again and co-directed the band's video for the track Tennessee Elegy from the seventh studio album A Southern Revelation. A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish (2000-2002) In 2000, the band would take on a new line-up, which saw the addition of former Movement vocalist/guitarist and longtime My Ruin guitarist/composer Mick Murphy. Mick would go on to be the band's longest serving member after Tairrie and became the sole songwriter. In an interview many years later, Tairrie said: \\"I released my first album under the name My Ruin and it was called \\"Speak and Destroy\\" on Snapper Music back in 1999. Soon after touring that album I actually met Mick Murphy, who is now my husband, my partner of ten years and my guitar player. He came in and we started dating and we got involved musically. It was the first time that's ever happened to me.\\" In a 2006 interview Mick said of meeting Tairrie: \\"I met Tairrie in February of 2000 at a party in Hollywood. We clicked right when we met and started hanging and got serious pretty fast. We also started writing \\"A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish,\\" which was our first time working together musically, soon after that so it was a crazy, exciting, life changing kinda time.\\" Meghan Mattox would carry on playing bass and contributed to the songwriting process, but the rest of the band including Melanie Makaiwi would no longer be part of the My Ruin project. Regarding her departure in an interview, Tairrie stated that \\"Melanie had written a few songs with me. But we had to get a second guitarist in because she wasn't really a metal guitarist. She was really cool as she was the first woman I ever worked with. But when it came down to playing the heavier stuff live, it really wasn't her thing.\\" The \\"Prayer Under Pressure‚Ä¶\\" era saw My Ruin become a fully realized band and unit of contributing members, rather than being just Tairrie's solo project. During this time Tairrie stated: \\"This is the real deal. Not to sound like I'm dissing anyone but the truth is that I needed to break free of my past and although Marcelo is a good friend and awesome drummer his heart was not in it. Melanie was really cool but she did not understand the heavier side of things or \\"The Metal!\\" Lance and Toddy were basically just hired musicians for the tour.\\" Drumming duties on the album were undertaken by downset Drummer Chris Hamilton. 2000 also saw the addition of live drummer Yael, who would remain in the band until 2005. Yael went on to contribute to the band's The Shape of Things to Come... EP and The Horror of Beauty record. In an interview with Kerrang!, Mick gave us a peek into the band's future which would take on a whole new sound through the years due to Mick's musicianship. He said: \\"I like the more old-school rock vibe...The fuzzy guitars, the big thick sounds, a lot of low-end power. Not that digital-sounding dance-metal.\\" The band underwent a winter 2000 concert tour of the UK in to promote A Prayer Under Pressure, supported by SugarComa. In an interview on the penultimate night of the tour, Tairrie explained her inspiration for the record's title: \\"The title comes from a couple of different prayer books I've been reading, in different parts. I kind of put it together, I read \\"A Prayer Under Pressure\\" in an old 1800s prayer book and then I read \\"Of Violent Anguish\\" somewhere else and I thought \\"That sounds kinda like my life and what we're doing\\" so I put them together and liked it.\\" A Prayer Under Pressure not only saw a change in line- up, but also a shift musically and a return to Tairrie's heavier roots. The record combined the harsher more abrasive elements of Speak and Destroy with Mick's trademark southern sounding guitar playing. Mick's style of playing would go on to play a major focal point in the years and records to come down the line. When comparing the heaviosity of A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish with Speak and Destroy, in an interview, Tairrie said: \\"Mick came in and had a lot of ideas that were really, really cool and a lot heavier.\\" In the same interview Mick commented: \\"I jumped into this band head first. I had a lot of musical ideas. I like to write, I like to write a lot. I like to be in control of what's going on musically, and we pushed her, encouraged her to do a heavy record.\\" He also went on to say that: \\"We did it because that's just the way I write music. One thing led to another, and before you know it we've got this brutally heavy album. I'm totally happy about that because I think metal needs to be raw, and not necessarily easy to listen to. I think that this record is truly heavy, so I'm proud of it.\\" The album was met with favourable reviews worldwide, with Kerrang! grading it 4 K's out of 5 and Metal Hammer grading it 8 out of 10. A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish was released in September 2000. While the band were busy releasing A Prayer Under Pressure Of Violent Anguish in the UK and Europe via Snapper Music, Speak and Destroy was simultaneously released in the US via Spitfire Records. A year later in 2001, A Prayer Under Pressure Of Violent Anguish was released in the US via Spitfire Records. Cover songs: Do You Love Me? And My War For this record, the band would cover two songs. The first being Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Do You Love Me? and hidden track, My War originally by Black Flag (band). It has been well documented throughout Tairrie's career in interviews that she is a big fan of Nick Cave. Mick has also stated that Black Flag (band) is a big inspiration of his and that he previously covered the song My War in his prior band Movement. Tairrie liked the sound of it so they decided to cover the song, which became a duet between the two. Mick and Tairrie would occasionally duet on a couple of songs through the vast My Ruin back catalogue. Such duets include the 2005 cover of Mudhoney's Touch Me I'm Sick which featured on the band's The Brutal Language record and more recently Repose from the band's Ghosts and Good Stories record. In the Kerrang! review for the album, both covers were praised: \\"A couple of starkly contrasting covers helps to keep My Ruin sounding fresh. A bleak reading of Nick Cave's Do You Love Me? is perfectly suited to Miss B's sultry drawl and loses none of its dark atmosphere in the translation. Black Flag's My War, on the other hand, is a breakneck blast that collapses into a dense wall of noise that Henry Rollins would be proud of.\\" Beauty Fiend single In the year 2000, UK magazine Kerrang!, reviewed the band's hit single Beauty Fiend, taken from the A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish record, of which both received favorable reviews worldwide, with Kerrang! grading the single 3 Ks out of 5. However, as is often the case, the review didn't come without its derogatory/backhanded comments regarding Tairrie's looks and body. The review opened with; \\"Despite being afforded far more attention this side of the Atlantic than a pretty face and a pair of tits warrants, Miss B is far from incapable of coming up with the goods every now and again.\\" The single became somewhat of an anthem among fans, challenging the oppressive, patriarchal and misogynist world of music and the media in general. The song would go on to be a My Ruin classic, fan favourite and set staple. In response to the review and speaking about the song in an interview with the same magazine, Tairrie stated: \\"This is exactly what Beauty Fiend is about! It's stating that I'm not gorgeous,, I'm not some f**cking beauty. It's nice to be called sexy and it's nice to be called pretty‚Ä¶It's always a compliment. Next week they'll call me f**cking ugly. That's nice too. But for the cover of the single, I've got all my make-up smeared and messed at the very end of a photoshoot. I know that I look like a hag, but it [the lyrics] kinda says it all: ‚Äòforgive me for not being pretty‚Ä¶ Quit talking about my ass and my tits. Who gives a f**ck? I don't look at men like that. I don't look at Phil Anselmo and see a cock.'\\" Despite such abuse, Tairrie has continued to break down barriers for women in rock and metal for over two decades. In a 2001 interview she stated: \\"My opinion is what it is... mine. Take it or leave it. Respect it or not. I will always have my own opinions and I am never be afraid to voice them. I don't want to revolutionize anything but myself. The more I learn, the more I change and the more I grow. I would rather be responsible for helping to open doors for women rather than closing them\\". Furthermore, of the song Beauty Fiend, she stated: \\"Beauty Fiend is meant to be a real ‚Äòf**ck you' of a song...I'm not here to be your sex symbol, I'm not here to be your pretty girl on the cover. I'm here to be honest and to be beautiful on the inside while i'm ugly on the outside. What I'm giving you is pure. It's not f**cking fake or contrived. That's what real beauty is.\\" The single was released on CD and limited edition 7\\" vinyl, with 1000 numbered copies being produced. The CD release was backed with the tracks Masochrist and the Black Flag cover of My War. Ghosts and Good Stories (2010-2011) During October 2009 in a press release, the band revealed that they had signed with the Tiefdruck Musik record label. The 6th studio album, titled Ghosts and Good Stories, was much neglected in terms of promotion and its hindered and botched release riddled with problems. These issues were due to their now ex record label, German based Tiefdruck Musik. Despite the issues surrounding the record behind the scenes the album went on to become the band's most critically acclaimed album to date. Reviews far and wide saw the band receive exposure in many European publications where the album was met with favorable reviews. Kerrang! rated Ghosts and Good Stories 4 K's out of 5. Journalist Paul Travers wrote in his review: \\"As the singer and figurehead of Manhole and Tura Satana in the 90's, Tairrie B was among the first to channel screaming metallic rage through a female perspective... the vocalist gives vent to her inner demons, it's clear she's not mellowing with age... My Ruin create an abrasive, sludgy noise, punctuated by moments of melody and calm. It's stark, confrontational and aggressive, but also fiercely intelligent, ensuring the duo stay one step ahead of the screaming angst-ridden pack.\\" Metal Hammer UK and Italy came to the same conclusion regarding the album, with both grading it 8 out of 10. Dom Lawson of Metal Hammer Uk wrote; \\"an exhilarating barrage of warped stoner metal riffs and blister-razing gutter-punk that lurches from harrowing, slow- motion menace (Diggin' For Ghosts) to floored-accelerator sludgecore (Long Dark Night); the whole scabrous din held together by its creators' unswerving passion. Easily the filthiest, heaviest and most exciting thing that Tairrie has put her scream to.\\" Excommunicated and Long Dark Night Videos On May 21, 2011 the band announced the video for the song Excommunicated. The video was filmed and edited by Tor Burrows of Notorious Design who had worked with the band previously on their other videos for their live Rick Derringer cover of Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo and Me Without You from the band's Throat Full Of Heart album. The Excommunicated video officially premiered via the band's website on May 22, 2011, to coincide with the 2011 end times prediction of Harold Camping. Tor Burrows would later go on to direct and edit the video for Long Dark Night which premiered on the band's official site on August 8, 2011. The video contains live footage shot in the UK by Tor, mixed with footage shot in LA at the Whisky a Go Go shot by former My Ruin and Tura Satana drummer Marcelo Palomino as well as home footage shot of Tairrie herself. There are also various pieces of public domain stock footage and most strikingly of all, Hill of Crosses footage given to the band by film-maker Asatuurs Keim. The Hill of Crosses is a Catholic pilgrimage site in northern Lithuania where, over many years Catholic pilgrims have left crosses and other religious paraphernalia. Tairrie stated she had always been intrigued by this religious site; \\"For some it is seen as a place of peace and power, for others a devotion and memorial. For me however, it is simply a scene of beauty whose landscape speaks to me on an otherworldly level when I view its images in photographs. It wasn't until Tor came across the footage shot by Asatuurs that this place began to speak to me subconsciously inviting me to have my own personal connection to it within this song, breathing a new scenery into my language.\\" This revelation led to Tairrie reaching out to Asatuurs and writing him an email in which she asked if she could use the footage in the video for Long Dark Night, to this Asatuurs agreed. The footage goes hand in hand with the religious imagery with which the band have become notorious for using throughout their body work. In keeping with the band's DIY ethic, Tairrie stated: \\"we had no budget to make this video. We are a DIY band and have always had to figure out a way to do it ourselves. With that in mind, we can say that it was a true labor of love made purely with passion, along with Premiere, After Effects and many long nights of editing and chatting on Skype from LA to the UK while cutting and pasting files, photos and footage into a shared folder in Dropbox and writing each other suggestions back and forth on Facebook. Welcome to the digital age! This video was made with no money but a million dollars worth of creativity and an artistic vision between two women who understand each other, the music one makes and the other one listens to.\\" Ghosts and Good Stories Tour In May 2010 the band started releasing details of US, UK and German tour dates in order to promote the Ghosts and Good Stories album. But in early August 2010, the band issued a statement to press which revealed the cancellation of the tour dates. Of the decision to cancel the dates at the time the band said; \\"As you know, My Ruin takes pride in being an independent and professional band with a strong DIY ethic and we realize [as we know you do] things like this happen all the time to bands both big and small but this is the first time in the 10-year history of our band that we have had to cancel a tour not to mention two very special shows in LA & London‚Ä¶Thank you all for your continued love and support. We are both sorry about this situation and hope you will understand that we did everything within our power to prevent this from happening.\\" The band went on to tour the album successfully after taking logistics into their own hands as they have done before without the help of a label. Late in August 2010, the band released information regarding the rescheduled dates for what would be the 10 date 2011 Ghosts and Good Stories Tour. In December 2010, the band released information on the live rhythm section for the tour. The two new band members to join the band were announced as Luciano Ferrea of the LA based band Beggars Ball and familiar face Matt LeChevalier. Matt had previously recorded with the band on the Throat Full of Heart album in 2008. He also toured with the band during The Brutal Language Tour and Summer of Hell Tour in 2006. Record label issues A year after the release of Ghosts and Good Stories when unveiling details for 7th studio album A Southern Revelation, the band spoke out about the issues surrounding the botched Ghosts and Good Stories release, Tiefdruck Musik and the label boss himself. A statement issued by the band revealed that: \\"We had begun to confirm shows for a European tour and were looking forward to working with our new label when suddenly there was a strange and unexpected turn of events and Daniel Heerdmann changed from being our biggest supporter into our most vicious adversary overnight. We had no idea why or where this sudden shift in attitude had come from. We were now dealing with a completely different man and it was scary. We quickly began to discover many of his promises had been lies regarding money transfers, marketing, promotion and tour support. This led to our being forced for the first time in our career to cancel our tour as chaos and confusion set in. Our album release was delayed in every territory and our once friendly mutual respectful relationship was now done. To date My Ruin has never received any accounting from Tiefdruck Musik for album sales.\\" These lies resulted in the album release being delayed many times and the cancellation of the Ghosts and Good stories Tour, which was to be rescheduled for the following year. Always turning a positive into a negative the drama with Tiefdruck Musik and owner Daniel Heerdmann would go on to inspire the band's most critically lauded album A Southern Revelation. Side projects The duo also pursue other projects which include The LVRS, a spoken word side project of \\"spoken word dirges set to music\\", Neanderthal, Mick's instrumental metal side project and Tairrie's Blasphemous Girl Designs. The LVRS This project involves both Tairrie and Mick. The LVRS project formed in 2003 when the couple self-released The Murder of Miss Hollywood via their official website. They then went on to self-release the 2nd album The Secret Life of Lola Burns in 2004, again through their own website. Due to the praise and success of the project from the fans, the duo decided to find an official home for the recordings. The first official CD release was titled; Death Has Become Her (2006) via record label Undergroove Records and was later re-released, digitally in 2009 via bandcamp.com. In a review for Death Has Become Her, Morley Seaver wrote; \\"The material is a m√©lange of autobiographical material courtesy of Tairrie B, and pieces of fiction inspired by several sources; the poet Virginia Woolf's suicide along with the Black Dahlia murder of 1947. Fittingly the material reflects the roots of the band's (as it were) name. The topics of Love, Violence, Religion and Sex figure prominently in these stories (look at the first letter in each of those words if you haven't caught on already) sometimes simultaneously.\\" The 2nd official, digital only release is: Lady Speaks the Bruise (2010) also released via bandcamp.com. Both official releases were put together from the original recordings with the addition of new tracks. On February 14, 2012, Valentine's Day, The LVRS announced via www.myruin.net that they would be making both Death Has Become Her and Lady Speaks the Bruise albums available as a free digital only download via www.bandcamp.com. Neanderthal Another side project is Mick Murphy's side project Neanderthal. This is a solo outing, often described by the man himself as instrumental-metal in which Mick writes, performs, records and produces all that is heard. The first album, Start a Fire With Rock, was released in 2006 as a 14-song CD and 2nd album Take The Ride, was released in 2007. Both were also available as a USB wristband in the band's merchandise store. They have since been re-mastered and re-released online via bandcamp.com along with a number of other recordings. Blasphemous Girl Designs Blasphemous Girl Designs initially focused on My Ruin band merchandise and de- constructed clothing. The brand later went on to focus primarily on jewellery and wearable art. Blasphemous Girl Designs was founded in 2001 and an online store was opened in 2009. Tairrie hand makes everything herself again in keeping with her DIY ethic. In recent years the brands tagline has been; \\"Wearable art for the individual at heart\\". In an interview in September 2011, Tairrie expressed plans to grow her BGD brand: \\"When the time is right it might be nice to take it to the next level at some point and get a few of my ideas backed by a larger company.\\" Band members * Tairrie B Murphy - vocals * Mick Murphy - guitar, bass, drums Discography Studio albums * Speak and Destroy (1999) * A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish (2000) * The Horror of Beauty (2003) * The Brutal Language (2005) * Throat Full of Heart (2008) * Ghosts and Good Stories (2010) * A Southern Revelation (2011) * The Sacred Mood (2013) Live albums * To Britain with Love & Bruises (2001) * Alive on the Other Side (2008) Compilation albums * Blasphemous Girl (2002) * Ruined & Recalled (2003) Singles * \\"Terror/June 10\\" (1999) * \\"Tainted Love/Blasphemous Girl\\" (1999) * \\"Beauty Fiend/Masochrist\\" (2000) EPs * The Shape of Things to Come...

(NYSE: ROK), is an American provider of industrial automation and information technology. Brands include Allen-Bradley and FactoryTalk software. Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Rockwell Automation employs over 23,000 people and has customers in more than 100 countries worldwide. The Fortune 500 company reported fiscal year 2019 global sales at $6.69 billion. History Early years Rockwell Automation traces its origins to 1903 and the formation of the Compression Rheostat Company, founded by Lynde Bradley and Dr. Stanton Allen with an initial investment of $1000. https://www.axcontrol.com/blog/2020/the-winding-history-of-rockwell- automation/17/07/ In 1904, 19-year-old Harry Bradley joined his brother in the business. The company's first patented product was a carbon disc compression- type motor controller for industrial cranes. The crane controller was demonstrated at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. In 1909, the company was renamed the Allen-Bradley Company. https://www.axcontrol.com/blog/2020/the- winding-history-of-rockwell-automation/17/07/ Allen-Bradley expanded rapidly during World War I in response to government-contracted work. Its product line grew to include automatic starters and switches, circuit breakers, relays and other electric equipment. In 1914, Fred Loock established the company's first sales office in New York. Upon co-founder Stanton Allen's death in 1916, Lynde Bradley became president. Harry Bradley was appointed vice president and attorney Louis Quarles was named corporate secretary. In 1918 Allen-Bradley hired its first female factory worker, Julia Bizewski Polczynski, who was promoted to foreman the following year. During the 1920s, the company grew its miniature rheostat business to support the burgeoning radio industry. By the middle of this decade, nearly 50 percent of the company's sales were attributed to the radio department. The decade closed with record company sales of $3 million. By 1932, the Great Depression had taken its toll and the company posted record losses. Amid growing economic pressure, Allen-Bradley reduced its workforce from 800 to 550 and cut wages by 50 percent. To lessen the financial burden, Lynde and Harry Bradley implemented a unique program: the company replaced employees‚Äô lost wages with preferred stock. Eventually, the company bought back all stock at six percent interest. Throughout this period, Lynde Bradley supported an aggressive research and development approach intended to \\"develop the company out of the Depression.\\" Lynde Bradley's R&D; strategy was successful. By 1937, Allen-Bradley employment had rebounded to pre-Depression levels and company sales reached an all-time high of nearly $4 million. Mid-20th century Following the death of Lynde Bradley in 1942, Harry Bradley became company president and Fred Loock was promoted to vice president. The Lynde Bradley Foundation, a charitable trust, was established with Lynde Bradley's assets. The foundation's first gift of $12,500 was made to Milwaukee's Community Fund, predecessor of the United Way. World War II fueled unprecedented levels of production, with 80 percent of the company's orders being war-related. Wartime orders were centered on two broad lines of products ‚Äì industrial controls to speed production and electrical components or \\"radio parts\\" used in a wide range of military equipment. Allen- Bradley expanded its facilities numerous times during the 1940s to meet war- time production needs. With Fred Loock serving as president and Harry Bradley as chairman, the company began a major $1 million, two-year expansion project in 1947. The company completed additional expansions at its Milwaukee facilities in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Allen-Bradley clock tower. The clock tower has since been renamed, and is known today as the Rockwell Automation clock tower. Harry Bradley died in 1965. Fred Loock retired in 1967 and died in 1973. Late 20th century During the 1970s, the company expanded its production facilities and markets and entered the 1980s as a global company. With president J. Tracy O'Rourke (1981‚Äì89) at the helm, the company introduced a new line of programmable logic controllers, the PLC in 1981 followed by the PLC-2 Family(1982)(2/30, 2/05/ 2/16&2/17) PLC-3(1982) SLC-100 Family(1986) SLC-500(1986) PLC-5 Family (1985). Earlier PLC developments were the MAC, PLC-4. In 1985 privately owned Allen-Bradley set a new fiscal record with sales of $1 billion. On February 20, 1985 Rockwell International purchased Allen-Bradley for $1.651 billion; this was the largest acquisition in Wisconsin's history to date. For all intents and purposes, Allen-Bradley took over Rockwell's industrial automation division. The 1990s featured continued technology development, including the company's launch of its software business, Rockwell Software (1994), the Logix control platform (1997) and the Integrated Architecture system (1999). Rockwell International developed PowerFlex, a manufacturing software and technology in the 1990s. During this decade, Rockwell International also acquired a power systems business, composed of Reliance Electric and Dodge. These two brands, combined with control systems brands Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software, were marketed as Rockwell Automation. In 1998, Keith Nosbusch was named president of Rockwell Automation Control Systems. Rockwell International Corporation headquarters was moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the same year. 21st century Previous logo In 2001, Rockwell International split into two companies. The industrial automation division became Rockwell Automation, while the avionics division became Rockwell Collins. The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off. Rockwell Automation retains Rockwell International's stock price history, and continues to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \\"ROK\\". Keith Nosbusch was named chief executive officer in 2004. In 2007, Rockwell Automation sold the Power Systems division for $1.8 billion to Baldor Electric Company to focus on its core competencies in automation and information technology. In April 2016, it was announced that Keith Nosbusch would be replaced by Blake Moret, effective July 1, 2016. Nosbusch would remain with Rockwell Automation as chairman. Moret was previously the senior vice president of the Control Products and Solutions segment of the company. Effective January 1, 2018, Keith Nosbusch will step down as Chairman. Blake Moret was elected the incoming Chairman by the board of directors. On June 11, 2018, Rockwell Automation made a $1bn equity investment in PTC acquiring an 8.4% ownership stake. On January 8, 2020, Rockwell Automation announced the acquisition of Israeli-based cybersecurity provider Avnet Data Security, LTD.https://ir.rockwellautomation.com/press- releases/press-releases-details/2020/Rockwell-Automation-to-Acquire-Avnet-to- Expand-Cybersecurity-Expertise/default.aspx Operations Business segments Rockwell Automation operates its business through two segments ‚Äì Architecture and Software, and Control Products and Solutions. *The Architecture and Software segment contains key elements of the Rockwell Automation control and information platforms, software applications and automation components. *Control Products and Solutions consists of motor control products and services.

Lee, Mississippi Department of Archives and History Prior to that, he was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army in the Eastern and Western theaters of the American Civil War.Biography: Stephen D. Lee , Civil War Trust Early life and education Stephen Dill Lee was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on September 22, 1833, the son of Thomas Lee and his wife Caroline Allison.Wakelyn, 282. He was raised in Abbeville, South Carolina. He possibly volunteered for service with the United States Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.Eicher, p. 345. Lee entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1850, graduating four years later and standing 17th out of 46 cadets. On July 1, 1854, Lee was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 4th Infantry Regiment. Lee was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant on October 31, 1856. He served as the 4th Regiment's Quartermaster from September 18, 1857, to February 8, 1861. he was serving as adjutant of Florida as well as his regiment's quartermaster in 1857 during the Seminole Wars. From 1858 to 1861 he was assigned to the western frontier, posted in Kansas and then in the newly created Dakota Territory. Lee then resigned his U.S. Army commission twelve days later to enter the Confederate service.Warner, 183. American Civil War After resigning from the U.S. Army in 1861, Lee entered the Confederate forces as a captain in the South Carolina Militia. (Unlike many Confederate officers called Lee, he was not related to Robert E. Lee.) On March 6 he was assigned as the Assistant Adjutant General and Assistant Inspector General of the Forces at Charleston, and on March 16 he was appointed a captain in the Regular Confederate States Artillery. Beginning on April 11 Lee was aide-de-camp to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard. That same day he delivered an ultimatum from Beauregard to Union Maj. Robert Anderson, demanding the evacuation of Fort Sumter, which was refused and after bombardment the fort fell on April 14, precipitating the start of the Civil War. According to Carl Sandburg (Abraham Lincoln, vol. 3, pp. 208‚Äì9), Captain Lee and 3 other men with full power from Beauregard to decide what to answer Anderson heard him say he would be starved out in a few days. Anderson offered to \\"evacuate Fort Sumter in 3 days and avoid the useless effusion of blood.\\" They could have taken Anderson's reply back to Beauregard, have it telegraphed to Jefferson Davis to see if they would wait 3 days more to see if Anderson would surrender after his food was gone. \\"It seemed almost as though the 4 men had decided before they came what they would say, which was: \\"Beauregard will open fire on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time.\\" This probably was not, as it seems, the last opportunity to avoid war because \\"Sumpter was a symbol, a Chip on the Shoulder.\\" It was \\"framed\\" by Lincoln and the South was eager to meet the challenge. (ibid, p. 206) Sandburg calls this war \\"the Second American Revolution.\\" (ibid, p. vii, p. 26). When Beauregard received permission to organize two regular companies of artillery on May 11, Lee was assigned to command one of them (the other went to Capt. Charles S. Winder.) Lee's company was assigned to Castle Pinckney until May 30, when it was sent to Fort Palmetto on Cole's Island, arriving June 1.Weinert, pp. 83‚Äì4. Map of the Battle of Antietam In June 1861 Lee resumed his position in the South Carolina Militia, and then in November he was promoted to the rank of major in the Confederate Army. Lee commanded a light battery in Hampton's Legion in Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army later in 1861. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1862, and was the artillery chief for Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division of the Army of Northern Virginia from April to June 17, and then in the same role under Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder until July. Lee participated in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, notably during the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1, the Battle of Savage's Station on June 29, during the Seven Days Battles from June 25 to July 1, and the Battle of Malvern Hill also on July 1.Dupuy, p. 432; Wakelyn, p. 282; Warner, p. 183. He briefly served in the 4th Virginia Cavalry in July, was promoted to colonel on July 9, and assumed command of an artillery battalion of Maj. Gen. James Longstreet's Corps that same month. Under Longstreet, Lee fought in the Second Battle of Manassas that August and then Battle of Sharpsburg on September 17, where his guns played a prominent role in defending the ground near the famed Dunker Church.Wakelyn, p. 282. \\"...serving with distinction as artillery commander at Sharpsburg...\\" The following is a summary of Lee's involvement at Sharpsburg: On November 6, 1862, Lee was promoted to the rank of brigadier- general.Wright, p. 98. Appointed from South Carolina on November 6, 1862, to rank from that date, and confirmed by the Confederate Congress on April 22, 1863. Leaving the artillery branch, Lee briefly led an infantry division during the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou from December 26-29, where he repulsed the attacks of Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman.Dupuy, p. 432; Wakelyn, p. 282. Beginning in January 1863 he led a brigade in the Department of Mississippi & Eastern Louisiana until that May, when he was ordered to take command of Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton's artillery defending access to the Mississippi River at Vicksburg. Lee fought notably during the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, where he was wounded when he was hit in a shoulder. Military historian Jon L. Wakelyn praises Lee's performance in this action, saying \\"he was the hero of the battle of Champion Hills.\\" Lee served throughout the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg until Pemberton's surrender to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant on July 4, becoming a prisoner of war. While on parole, he was promoted to the rank of major-general on August 3, 1863.Eicher, p. 345; Wakelyn, p. 282. Beginning on August 16 Lee was assigned to command the cavalry of Department of Mississippi & Eastern Louisiana, and he was officially exchanged on October 13. During that time, General Joseph E. Johnston sent Lee's small cavalry force of 2,500 men to Tennessee to reenforce General Braxton Bragg, who was beginning to lay siege to Federal-occupied Chattanooga. Lee rode from northern Mississippi into northern Alabama, where he met Confederate cavalry commander Joseph Wheeler who had just conducted a raid through central Tennessee and convinced Lee his plans would be hopeless against the great number of Union troops in the region.Johnston, Chapter VIII Lee was then given command of the Department of Alabama & East Louisiana on May 9, 1864. Troops in Lee's department under Maj. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest scored a victory at the Battle of Brice's Crossroads on June 10, and seriously threatened Union supply lines supporting Sherman in Georgia. Lee personally reinforced Forrest but the combined Confederate force was defeated at the Battle of Tupelo, ensuring the safety of Sherman's supply lines. Lee was promoted to lieutenant-general on June 23, 1864, making Lee the youngest at this grade in the Confederate States Army.Warner, p. 183; Eicher, p. 345. On July 26 he was assigned to lead the Second Corps, Army of Tennessee, commanded by John B. Hood. During the Atlanta Campaign, Lee fought at the Battle of Ezra Church on July 28 and was in command of the extended line in south west Atlanta in August 1864. His troops with the attachment of William B. Bate's Division and a Brigade of Georgia Militia defeated Schofield's movement to break the railroad lines at East Point at Utoy Creek. For this action he published a general order recognizing Bate's Division for defeating the attack of the combined US XXIII and XIV Corps. He was also in command of his corps at the Battle of Jonesborough on August 31 and September 1. Lee fought in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign and was severely wounded in the foot at the Battle of Spring Hill on November 29, but did not give up the command until an organized rearguard took over the post of danger. In regard to the confused and disappointing fight at Spring Hill, Lee considered it \\"one of the most disgraceful and lamentable occurrences of the war, one that is in my opinion unpardonable.\\"Winker, p. 332. He then participated in the Battle of Franklin on November 30. Lee's men arrived at Franklin at 4 p.m. with orders from Hood to support Benjamin F. Cheatham's force if necessary. Meeting with Cheatham, Lee decided the situation was dire and attacked at 9 p.m., taking serious losses from the Union position and from Confederate artillery as well.Garrison, pp. 293‚Äì4. Following the campaign's Battle of Nashville on December 15-16, Lee kept his troops closed up and well in hand despite the general rout of the rest of the Confederate forces. For three consecutive days, they would form the fighting rearguard of the otherwise disintegrated Army of Tennessee. Lee was wounded in the foot by shell fragments on December 17. Upon recovery, Lee joined Gen. Joseph E. Johnston during the 1865 Carolinas Campaign. On February 9 he married Regina Harrison, with whom Lee would have one child, a son named Blewett Harrison Lee. When the remnants of Johnston's Army of Tennessee was re-organized in early 1865, Lee was left without a command matching his rank, and his commission as a lieutenant- general was canceled on February 23; however, on March 23 he was appointed a \\"temporary\\" lieutenant-general. Lee surrendered at that rank with Johnston's forces in April and was paroled on May 1. Later life Lee in later life After the war Lee settled in Columbus, Mississippi, which was his wife's home state and during the greater part of the war his own territorial command, and devoted himself to planting. He served in the Mississippi State Senate in 1878, and was the first president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Mississippi (modern-day Mississippi State University) from 1880 to 1899. Lee served as a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1890. In 1895 Lee was the first chairman of the Vicksburg National Park Association and was instrumental in the congressional passage of the law creating the national park in 1899.Winschel, Terrence J. \\"A Soldier's Legacy: William T. Rigby and the Establishment of Vicksburg National Military Park\\". The Journal of Mississippi History. LXXV (Winter 2013). 4, p. 97ff. He also was an active member (and from 1904 commander-in-chief) of the United Confederate Veterans society.Wakelyn, p. 282; Eicher, p. 345; Warner, p. 184. On March 2, 1900, the subject was president of the Mississippi Historical Society who under an act of the state legislature of that date, was given authority to appoint the Mississippi Historical Commission, a forerunner of the state agency to act as custodian of the official records and historical materials of the state. In 1902, Lee, himself, became a trustee of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.Rowland, Dunbar. (1925). History of Mississippi : the heart of the South. Chicago: The S.J. Clarke Publishing Company. v.2, pp. 284‚Äì285. In 1887 Lee wrote an article for the first volume of Battles and Leaders of the Civil War,Johnson, pp. 74‚Äì81. and he published Sherman's Meridian Expedition and Sooy Smith's Raid to West Point in 1880. Lee died in 1908 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and was buried in Friendship Cemetery located in Columbus. He fell sick after giving a speech to former Union soldiers from Wisconsin and Iowa, four of the regiments whom he had faced in battle 45 years earlier at Vicksburg. The cause of his death was attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage. At the time Lee was also planning the next reunion of the United Confederate Veterans, held on June 9, 1908. Legacy commander-in-chief of the United Confederate Veterans Based on Lee's familiarity with the three major arms of a Civil War-era army, military historian Ezra J. Warner summarized him as an able and versatile corps commander, saying \\"Despite his youth and comparative lack of experience, Lee's prior close acquaintanceship with all three branches of the service --artillery, cavalry, and infantry-- rendered him one of the most capable corps commanders in the army.\\"Warner, 184. He was entered into the Mississippi Hall of Fame.Hall of Fame: Stephen Dill Lee, Mississippi Department of Archives and HistoryThe Mississippi Hall of Fame Archive Lee is also memorialized with a statue by Henry Hudson Kitson in the Vicksburg National Military Park dedicated in 1909,Lee's Vicksburg National Military Park statue, National Park Service as well busts in the center of the Drill Field at Mississippi State University and Friendship Cemetery in Columbus. Lee Hall at Mississippi State University is also named in his honor. Some colleagues have called him 'the father of industrial education in the South'.University of Mississippi. (1910).

The battle went on for 21 days from August 23 to September 13, 1921, close to the banks of the Sakarya River in the immediate vicinity of Polatlƒ±, which is today a district of the Ankara Province. The battle line stretched over 62 miles (100 km).Edmund Schopen: Die neue T√ºrkei, Wilhelm Goldmann Verlag, 1938, page 95.

Operational theater The Greek offensive under King Constantine as Supreme Commander of the Greek Forces in Asia was committed on July 16, 1921, and was skilfully executed. A feint towards the Turkish right flank at Eski≈üehir distracted Ismet Pasha just as the major assault fell on the left at Kara Hisar. The Greeks then wheeled their axis to the north and swept towards Eski≈üehir, rolling up the Turkish defence in a series of frontal assaults combined with flanking movements.Christopher Chant \\"Warfare of the 20th. Century ‚Äì Armed Conflicts Outside the Two World Wars\\" Chartwell Books Inc. New Jersey 1988. , p. 22 Eski≈üehir fell on July 17, despite a vigorous counter-attack by Ismet Pasha who was determined to fight to the finish. The saner counsels of Mustafa Kemal prevailed, however, and Ismet disengaged with great losses to reach the comparative safety of the Sakarya River, some 30 miles (48 km) to the north and only 50 miles (80 km) from Ankara. The battle took place along the Sakarya River around the vicinity of Polatlƒ±, stretching a 62 miles long battle line. The determining feature of the terrain was the river itself, which flows eastward across the plateau, suddenly curves north and then turns back westwards describing a great loop that forms a natural barrier. The river banks are awkward and steep, and bridges were few, there being only two on the frontal section of the loop. East of the loop, the landscape rises before an invader in rocky, barren ridges and hills towards Ankara. It was here in these hills, east of the river that the Turks dug in their defensive positions. The front followed the hills east of the Sakarya River from a point near Polatlƒ± southwards to where the G√∂k River joins the Sakarya, and then swung at rightangles eastwards following the line of the G√∂k River. It was an excellent defensive ground.Michael Llewellyn Smith, p. 227 For the Greeks, the question on whether to dig in and rest on their previous gains, or to advance towards Ankara in great effort and destroy the Army of the Grand National Assembly was difficult to resolve, posing the eternal problems that the Greek staff had to deal with since the beginning of the war. The dangers of extending the lines of communications still further in such an inhospitable terrain that killed horses, caused vehicles to break down and prevented the movement of heavy artillery were obvious. The present front that gave the Greeks the control of the essential strategic railway was tactically most favourable. But because the Army of the Grand National Assembly had escaped encirclement at K√ºtahya, nothing had been settled; therefore the temptation of achieving a ‚Äúknock-out-blow‚Äù became irresistible.Michael Llewellyn Smith, p. 228 Battle The Greek 9th infantry division marches through the steppe Turkish POW during the Battle of Sakarya On August 10, Constantine finally committed his forces to an assault against the Sakarya Line. The Greeks marched hard for nine days before making contact with the enemy. This march included an outflanking manoeuvre through the northern part of Anatolia through the Salt Desert where food and water scarcely existed, so the advancing infantry foraged the poor Turkish villages for maize and water or obtain meat from the flocks which were pastured on the fringe of the desert.Michael Llewellyn Smith, p. 233 On August 23, battle was finally joined when Greeks made contact with advanced Turkish positions south of the G√∂k River. The Turkish Staff had made their headquarters at Polatlƒ± on the railway a few miles east of the coast of the Sakarya River and the troops were prepared to resist. On August 26, the Greeks attacked all along the line. Crossing the shallow G√∂k, the infantry fought its way step up onto the heights where every ridge and hill top had to be stormed against strong entrenchments and withering fire. By September 2 the commanding heights of the key Mount Chal were in Greek hands, but once the Greek enveloping movement against the Turkish left flank had failed, the Battle of the Sakarya River descended to a typical head-on confrontation of infantry, machine-guns and artillery. The Greeks launched their main effort in the centre, pushing forward some 10 miles (16 km) in 10 days, through the Turkish Second Line of defense. Some Greek units came as close as 31 miles (50 km) to the city of Ankara.√ñsterreichische Milit√§rische Zeitschrift, Verlag C. Ueberreuter, 1976, page 131. This was the summit of their achievement in the Asia Minor Campaign. For days during the battle neither ammunition nor food had reached the front, owing to successful harassment of the Greek lines of communications and raids behind the Greek lines by Turkish cavalry. All the Greek troops were committed to the battle, while fresh Turkish drafts were still arriving throughout the campaign in response to the Nationals mobilization. For all these reasons the impetus of the Greek attack was gone. For a few days there was a lull in the fighting in which neither exhausted army could press an attack.Michael Llewellyn Smith, p. 233‚Äì234 The Greek king Constantine I, who commanded the battle personally, was almost taken prisoner by a Turkish patrol.Johannes Glasneck: Kemal Atat√ºrk und die moderne T√ºrkei, 2010, Ahriman-Verlag GmbH, , page 133. Astute as ever at the decisive moment, Mustafa Kemal assumed personal command and led a small counter-attack against the Greek left and around the Mount Chal on September 8. The Greek line held and the attack itself achieved a limited military success,Michael Llewellyn Smith \\"Ionian Vision\\" Hurst & Company London 1973 , pg. 233‚Äì234 but in fear that this presaged a major Turkish effort to outflank their forces as the severity of winter was approaching, Constantine broke off the Greek assault on September 14, 1921.Christopher Chant, p. 23 Consequently, Anastasios Papoulas ordered a general retreat towards Eski≈üehir and Afyonkarahisar. The Greek troops evacuated the Mount Chal which had been taken at such cost and retired unmolested across the Sakarya River to the positions they have left a month before, taking with them their guns and equipment. In the line of the retreating army nothing was left that could benefit the Turks. Railways and bridges were blown up, the same way villages were burnt.Michael Llewellyn Smith, p. 234 After Greek retreat, Turkish forces managed to retake Sivrihisar on September 20, Aziziye on September 22, Bolvadin and √áay on September 24. Aftermath Map of Greek and Turkish offensives. The retreat from Sakarya marked the end of the Greek hopes of imposing settlement on Turkey by force of arms. In May 1922 General Papoulas and his complete staff resigned and was replaced by General Georgios Hatzianestis, who proved much more inept than his predecessor.Christopher Chant \\"Warfare of the 20th. Century ‚Äì Armed Conflicts Outside the Two World Wars\\" Chartwell Books Inc. New Jersey 1988. , p. 23 On the other hand, Mustafa Kemal returned in triumph to Ankara where the Grand National Assembly awarded him the rank of Field Marshal of the Army, as well as the title of Gazi rendering honours as the saviour of the Turkish nation.Shaw, Stanford Jay (1976), \\"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey\\", Cambridge University Press, , p. 357 According to the speech that was delivered years later before the same National Assembly at the Second General Conference of the Republican People's Party which took part from October 15 to October 20, 1927; Kemal was said to have ordered that \\" ... not an inch of the country should be abandoned until it was drenched with the blood of the citizens...,\\" upon realizing that the Turkish army was losing ground rapidly, with virtually no natural defenses left between the battle line and Ankara.Turkish: Dedim ki: ¬´Hatt-ƒ± m√ºdafaa yoktur, Saht-ƒ± m√ºdafaa vardƒ±r.

Plant, 1963, p. 521. Lord Curzon argued that the military situation became a stalemate with time tending in favour of the Turks. The Turkish position within the British views was improving. In his opinion, the Turkish Nationalists were at that point more ready to treat.Michael Llewellyn Smith, p. 240 After this, the Ankara government signed the Treaty of Kars with the Russians, and the most important Treaty of Ankara with the French, thus reducing the enemy's front notably in the Cilician theatre and concentrating against the Greeks on the West.Michael Llewellyn Smith, p. 241 For the Turkish troops it was the turning point of the war, which would develop in a series of victorious clashes against the Greeks, driving out the invaders from the whole Asia Minor in the Turkish War of Independence.Shaw, Stanford Jay; , p. 362 The Greeks could do nothing but retreat. As by August 26. 1922 Turkish offensive started with Battle of Dumlupƒ±nar. Kemal dispatched his army on a drive to the coast of the Aegean Sea pursuing the shattered Greek army, which would culminate in the direct assault of Smyrna between September 9 and 11th 1922. The war would be over and sealed with the defeat of the Greeks, formalized by the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923.

They appear in the short story collections Nine Stories, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction and Franny and Zooey. Members The Glass family, from eldest to youngest: *Les and Bessie Glass (n√©e Gallagher): Retired vaudeville performers. Les is Australian (mentioned in \\"Hapworth 16, 1924\\") and Jewish, and is in the entertainment business. He is not mentioned often in the stories, but is criticized by Seymour in \\"Hapworth 16, 1924.\\" Bessie, the matriarch, is Irish, and is characterized as consistently worried about the fact that her children are talented and yet largely unable to assimilate into society. They are the parents of the seven children: * Seymour Glass (February 1917 ‚Äì March 18, 1948The Glass Family Chronology): The eldest, Seymour is featured in Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction and Franny and Zooey. He is the author of the letter that comprises \\"Hapworth 16, 1924\\" and is the main character in \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish.\\" Seymour was a spiritual savant and brilliant intellectual, and became a professor at Columbia at 20. Along with his siblings he was a regular star on the radio program It's a Wise Child. He fought in the European Theatre of World War II, and was deeply scarred by the experience. In 1941 he attempts suicide by slitting his wrists, but fails, as described in Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: an Introduction. He elopes with Muriel Fedder on June 4, 1942. In \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish,\\" he commits suicide while the couple are on a second honeymoon in Florida. Muriel is asleep on the bed beside him at the time. However, in Seymour: An Introduction his younger brother Buddy (who claims authorship of the story) suggests the depiction of Seymour in \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" more closely resembles Buddy than Seymour. * Webb Gallagher \\"Buddy\\" Glass (born 1919): The narrator of Zooey and protagonist in Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction. It is revealed in the latter that he wrote at least three stories collected in Nine Stories: \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish,\\" \\"Down at the Dinghy\\" and \\"Teddy.\\" He also claims credit for \\"Franny,\\" and it is suggested in Seymour that he wrote The Catcher in the Rye. Buddy is often considered to be Salinger's alter ego. He lives in upstate New York and teaches English at a rural women's college. He also volunteers his time to instruct some of the faculty of his college in Mahayana Buddhism. Buddy and Seymour were born only two years apart, spent most of their youths living together, and were very close before Seymour's suicide in 1948. * Beatrice \\"Boo Boo\\" Glass Tannenbaum (born 1920): Married, mother of three children, appears centrally in \\"Down at the Dinghy,\\" is mentioned in \\"Hapworth 16, 1924,\\" and is often referenced in Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters as the \\"seafaring\\" sibling currently occupying the New York apartment where much of the story's action takes place. She \\"modestly prefers to be referred to as a Tuckahoe homemaker.\\" * Walter F. \\"Walt\\" Glass (1921 ‚Äì 1945): The twin brother of Waker Glass. He was an American soldier who died in Occupied Japan in late fall of 1945, at the age of 22, when a stove he was packaging exploded, an event that Buddy Glass refuses to address. Walt is described by his girlfriend in \\"Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut.\\" He was also described in \\"Franny and Zooey\\" as being the only truly \\"lighthearted\\" son in the family. * Waker Glass (born 1921): The twin brother, born twelve minutes after Walter. A Roman Catholic monk of the Carthusian order. Little is known about Waker, because, though he is mentioned in many of the stories, none have been written specifically about him. * Zachary Martin \\"Zooey\\" Glass (born 1929): Title character of Zooey, in which he is 25 years old. He is an actor, and (according to himself) the most attractive of all the children. Zooey also says that he and Buddy were \\"too clever\\" for their own good. Boo Boo describes Zooey as \\"the blue-eyed Jewish- Irish Mohican scout who died in your arms at the roulette table at Monte Carlo.\\" He is portrayed as being rather arrogant and particularly insensitive to his mother, Bessie, frequently swearing at her and calling her \\"fatty.\\" He is misanthropic, which he attributes to Seymour and Buddy's imposition of their college-age infatuation with Eastern mysticism on him and Franny as children. * Frances \\"Franny\\" Glass (born 1934): The title character of Franny, in which she is a 20-year-old college student and actress. In Franny and Zooey, she is depicted reading The Way of a Pilgrim, an anonymous Orthodox Christian classic, which contributes to her spiritual and emotional breakdown. All the children are precocious, and appeared on fictional radio quiz show It's a Wise Child, which, according to the stories, sent all seven Glass children through college. At least one of the children appeared on the show from 1927 to 1943, beginning with Seymour and Buddy. \\"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters\\" says that each child appeared on the show under a pseudonym as the Black children.Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters, Little, Brown Books, p. 43. Seymour was known as Billy Black, and Walt was Georgie Black. The Glass family lives in New York City; the children spent most of their childhood in an apartment on the Upper East Side.

A subdistrict of the French Quarter/CBD area, its boundaries, as defined by the City Planning Commission, are Iberville, Decatur and Canal Streets to the north; the Mississippi River to the east; the New Orleans Morial Convention Center, Julia and Magazine Streets, and the Pontchartrain Expressway to the south; and South Claiborne Avenue, Cleveland Street, and South and North Derbigny Streets to the west. It is the equivalent of what many cities call their downtown, although in New Orleans \\"downtown\\" or \\"down town\\" was historically used to mean all portions of the city downriver from Canal Street (in the direction of flow of the Mississippi River). In recent decades, however, use of the catch-all \\"downtown\\" adjective to describe neighborhoods downriver from Canal Street has largely ceased, having been replaced in usage by individual neighborhood names (such as Bywater). Originally developed as the largely-residential Faubourg Ste. Marie (English: St. Mary Suburb) in the late 18th century, the modern Central Business District is today a dynamic, mixed-use neighborhood, the home of professional offices in skyscrapers, specialty and neighborhood retail stores, numerous restaurants and clubs, and thousands of residents inhabiting restored, historic commercial and industrial buildings. Geography The Central Business District is located at and has an elevation of . As is true of most of metropolitan New Orleans, the parts of the district nearer the river are higher in elevation than areas further removed from it. According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of . of which is land and (10.17%) of which is water. Adjacent neighborhoods * Iberville Development (north) * French Quarter (north) * Lower Garden District (south) * Central City (south) * Tulane/Gravier (west) Boundaries The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of the Central Business District as these streets: Iberville Street, Decatur Street, Canal Street, the Mississippi River, the New Orleans Morial Convention Center, Julia Street, Magazine Street, the Pontchartrain Expressway, South Claiborne Avenue, Cleveland Avenue, South Derbigny Street and North Derbigny Street. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 3,435 inhabitants of the census tracts best corresponding to the boundaries of the New Orleans Downtown Development District. The population density was 1,692 /mi¬≤ (664 /km¬≤). Another 4,142 inhabitants of the adjacent French Quarter neighborhood were recorded in the 2000 Census. The CBD, its subdistricts (e.g., the Warehouse District), and the bordering neighborhoods of Trem√©, the French Quarter, and the Lower Garden District possessed 21,630 residents, according to the 2000 Census. History Streets in the Central Business District (originally Faubourg Ste. Marie) were initially platted in the late 18th century, representing the first expansion of New Orleans beyond its original French Quarter footprint. Significant investment began in earnest following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, as people from other parts of the United States flocked to the city. Consequently, the district began to be referred to as the American Sector. While traditionally Canal Street was viewed as the dividing line between the French Quarter and the American Sector, legally both sides of Canal Street are today considered part of the Central Business District for zoning and regulatory purposes. Through the 19th and into the 20th century, the Central Business District continued developing almost without pause. By the mid-20th century, most professional offices in the region were located downtown, the hub of a well-developed public transit system. Canal Street was the primary retail destination for New Orleanians, as well as for residents of the surrounding region. Local and regional department stores Maison Blanche, D.H. Holmes, Godchaux's, Gus Mayer, Labiche's, Kreeger's, and Krauss anchored numerous well-known specialty retailers, such as Rubenstein Bros., Adler's Jewelry, Koslow's, Rapp's, and Werlein's Music. National retailers, like Kress, Woolworth, and Walgreens were present alongside local drugstore K&B.; Sears operated a large store one block off Canal, on Baronne Street. Bookstores, theaters, and movie palaces also abounded, with the neon marquees of the Saenger, Loews State, RKO Orpheum, Joy, and Civic theaters nightly casting multi-colored lights onto surrounding sidewalks. In the 1950s, six- lane Loyola Avenue was constructed as an extension of Elk Place, cutting a swath through a low-income residential district and initially hosting the city's new civic center complex. The late-1960s widening of Poydras Street was undertaken to create another six-lane central area circulator for vehicular traffic, as well as to accommodate modern high-rise construction. The City of New Orleans partook in transforming the district from 1973 to 1993, in a collaboration between public and private sectors to spark active community participation. The portion of the CBD closer to the Mississippi River and upriver from Poydras Street is known as the Warehouse District, because it was heavily devoted to warehousing and manufacturing before shipping became containerized. The 1984 World's Fair drew attention to the then semi-derelict district, resulting in steady investment and redevelopment from the mid-1980s onward. Many of the old 19th-century warehouses have been converted into hotels, restaurants, condominiums, and art galleries. Notable structures in the CBD include the Greek Revival Gallier Hall (the city's former city hall); the Mercedes-Benz Superdome; the New Orleans Arena; the city's present-day, International style city hall; and One Shell Square, the city's tallest building and headquarters for Royal Dutch Shell's Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Production. Other significant attractions include the postmodern Piazza d'Italia, Harrah's Casino, the World Trade Center New Orleans, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, St. Patrick's Church, the Hibernia Bank Building, and the former New Orleans Cotton Exchange. The principal public park in the CBD is Lafayette Square, upon which face both Gallier Hall and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Other public spaces include Duncan Plaza, Elk Place, the Piazza d'Italia, Lee Circle, Mississippi River Heritage Park, Spanish Plaza, and the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Plaza. Museums include the National World War II Museum, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the Louisiana Children's Museum, the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center and Confederate Memorial Hall Museum. New Orleans CBD was one of the few areas of New Orleans that escaped the catastrophic flooding of 2005's Hurricane Katrina. Government and infrastructure The New Orleans City Hall and surrounding structures, including the circa-1960, architecturally award- winning Main Branch of the New Orleans Public Library face Duncan Plaza, an exercise in 1950s-style urban renewal embodying then-mayor Chep Morrison's desire to create a modern civic center. The New Orleans Civic Center is today much diminished, with the Louisiana Supreme Court building having been torn down in the wake of the court's 2004 departure for the French Quarter,History of the Louisiana Supreme Court, retrieved 16 April 2017. the Louisiana State office building having suffered the same fate, and Duncan Plaza itself having been fenced off.

The Union Passenger Terminal is the terminus for three of Amtrak's long- distance trains, the City of New Orleans, the Crescent and, since 2005, the Sunset Limited (with the elimination, due to Katrina damage, of the eastbound portion of the Sunset Limited route), and also offers inter-city bus service via Greyhound Lines. Interstate Highway access is provided by I-10, via the Claiborne and Pontchartrain Expressways. When I-10 curves to the east by the Louisiana Superdome and becomes the Claiborne Expressway, elevated above N. Claiborne Avenue, the Pontchartrain Expressway continues as U.S. Route 90 Business and crosses the Mississippi River on the twin-bridge Crescent City Connection. Significant thoroughfares in the CBD include St. Charles Avenue, Camp Street, Carondelet Street, Gravier Street, Poydras Street, Tchoupitoulas Street, Howard Avenue, and Canal Street. Prior to the 1980s, the intersection of Gravier and Carondelet streets was the de facto heart of the city's financial district. Though still a vibrant area, that part of the CBD witnessed the migration of much business slightly upriver to Poydras Street, as many modern high-rise office towers were constructed there in the 1970s and 1980s. The widening of Loyola Avenue, Poydras Street and O'Keefe Avenue aimed to simultaneously create an effective downtown circulator high capacity road network for automobile traffic and make room for large-scale redevelopment (e.g., Duncan Plaza, Superdome). However, many of the development sites created in the wake of these improvements were never built upon, leaving a noticeable and unfortunate quantity of surface parking lots along these widened streets.

History Park Street Church is a stop on Boston's Freedom Trail. The founding of the church is dated to 1804 when the \\"Religious Improvement Society\\" began weekly meetings with lectures and prayer. The society organized the church on February 27, 1809. Twenty-six local people, mostly former members of the Old South Meeting House, wanted to create a church with orthodox Trinitarian theology. Park St. Church, 1904 The church's cornerstone was laid on May 1, 1809, and construction was completed by the end of the year, under the guidance of Peter Banner (architect), Benajah Young (chief mason) and Solomon Willard (woodcarver). Banner took inspiration from several early pattern books, and his design is reminiscent of a London church by Christopher Wren. Park Street church's steeple rises to , and remains a landmark visible from several Boston neighborhoods.The preservation of Park Street Church, p. 12 The church was the tallest building in the United States from 1810 to 1828. For much of the early 19th century, it was the first landmark travelers saw when approaching Boston. The church is next to the historic Granary Burying Ground. The first worship service was held on January 10, 1810. The church became known as \\"Brimstone Corner\\", in part because of the fervent missionary character of its preaching,Roff, Sandra. \\"The Beecher Tradition: Edward Beecher.\\" http://newman.baruch.cuny.edu/digital/2001/beecher/edward.htm and in part because of the storage of gunpowder during the War of 1812.\\"Park Street Church: Our Beginnings\\" Park Street Church has a strong tradition of missions, evangelical doctrine, and application of Scripture to social issues, as well as a notable list of firsts. Edward Dorr Griffin (1770‚Äì1837) served as the first pastor of the Park Street Church and preached a famous series of Sunday evening sermons attacking the New Divinity.Old, Hughes Oliphant. The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church: Volume 6, The Modern Age. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007: 164. In 1816, Park Street Church joined with Old South Church to form the City Mission Society, a social service society to serve Boston's urban poor. The Park Street steeple in 2017 In 1826, Edward Beecher, the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe and son of Lyman Beecher, a notable abolitionist, became pastor of the church. On July 4, 1829, William Lloyd Garrison delivered his Address to the Colonization Society at Park Street, making his first major public statement against slavery. From 1829‚Äì1831, Lowell Mason, a notable Christian composer, served as choirmaster and organist. The church hosted the debut of \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\", also known as \\"America\\", by Samuel Francis Smith on July 4, 1831.Howe, Daniel Walker, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1848. , p. 641. Park Street also played a role in founding the first \\"Homeland\\" or American Mission to the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), where that church still stands; the Handel and Haydn Society started there. Benjamin E. Bates, an industrialist who founded Bates College in Maine in 1855, was a Sunday school teacher and active attendant of Park Street in the mid-19th century. In 1857‚Äì58, evangelist Charles Finney led a revival at Park Street which led the pastor, Andrew Leete Stone, to experience a spiritual awakening. Gleason Archer, a prominent inerrantist theologian was the assistant pastor of Park Street from 1945 to 1948, and his father, Suffolk University founder Gleason Archer, Sr., served as president of the Park Street Men's Club in the 1920s. In 1949, Billy Graham's first transcontinental mid- century crusade began at Park Street. Harold J. Ockenga, notable theologian and co-architect of the (Neo-)Evangelical movement was the senior pastor from 1936 to 1969, and during this time co-founded Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary with Billy Graham, co-founded Fuller Theological Seminary, the National Association of Evangelicals, War Relief (which later became World Relief), and the Christian publication Christianity Today. In 1974, the church built a Church Ministries Building at 1 Park Street beside the main edifice. Designed in a modernist architectural style by Stahl/Bennett Associates with a concrete structure, window-walls and purplish brick facing, the building is described by the Boston Preservation Alliance as follows: \\"The Church Ministries Building Addition to Park Street Church breaks dramatically with its surroundings in style, while relating coherently to it in materials.

There are many affinity groups including ministries for young adults, college students, international students and scholars, children and teens, as well as introductory classes on Christianity and various adult education classes. There is also a ministry called Alive in Christ, an affiliate of Hope for Wholeness. Park Street is an international congregation, with members from more than 60 countries. The church attracts many regular worshipers from among the undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty at Boston-area universities. Park Street believes strongly in education integrated with faith, so it is associated with Park Street Kids, Park Street School, and Boston Trinity Academy, as well as partnering with Campus Crusade for Christ and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship for undergraduate and graduate ministries, and a long-time partnership with Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.

Coldfall Wood, London It is a deciduous small to medium-size tree reaching heights of , rarely , and often has a fluted and crooked trunk. The bark is smooth and greenish-grey, even in old trees. The buds, unlike those of the beech, are long at the most, and pressed close to the twig. The leaves are alternate, long, with prominent veins giving a distinctive corrugated texture, and a serrated margin. It is monoecious, and the wind-pollinated male and female catkins appear in early summer after the leaves. The fruit is a small long nut, partially surrounded by a three-pointed leafy involucre long; it matures in autumn. The wood is heavy and hard, and is used for tools and building constructions. It also burns hot and slowly, making it very suitable for firewood.http://www.gardeningcentral.org/hornbeam_tree/hornbeam_tree.html Tree Profile for Hornbeam This was the reason for lopping and hence indirectly the saving of Epping Forest, where the hornbeam was a favoured pollarding tree. Hornbeam was frequently coppiced and pollarded in the past in England. It is still infrequently managed using these traditional methods, but mainly for non-commercial conservation purposes. As a woodland tree traditionally managed in this way, it is particularly frequent in the ancient woodlands of south Essex, Hertfordshire and north Kent where it typically occupies more than half of most ancient woods and wood pastures. The leaves provide food for some animals, including Lepidoptera such as the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. There are a number of notable forests where C. betulus is a dominant tree species, among which are: *Epping Forest, Essex/London, UK *Halltorp Nature Reserve, √ñland, Sweden Ecology In England, trees appear to prefer soils with a pH from 3.6 to 4.6 but tolerate up to 7.6. They are found on soils with moderate clay content and avoid soils with particularly high or low clay content.

It has a shallow, wide-spreading root system and is marked by the production of stump sprouts when cut back. Because it stands up well to cutting back and has dense foliage, it has been much used in landscape gardening, mainly as tall hedges and for topiary. The seeds often do not germinate till the spring of the second year after sowing. The hornbeam is a prolific seeder and is marked by vigorous natural regeneration.

Description Alnus incana var. tenuifolia male flowers in early spring along the Columbia River It is a small- to medium-sized tree tall with smooth grey bark even in old age, its life span being a maximum of 60 to 100 years. The leaves are matte green, ovoid, long and broad. The flowers are catkins, appearing early in spring before the leaves emerge, the male catkins pendulous and long, the female catkins long and one cm broad when mature in late autumn. The seeds are small, long, and light brown with a narrow encircling wing. The grey alder has a shallow root system, and is marked not only by vigorous production of stump suckers, but also by root suckers, especially in the northern parts of its range. The wood resembles that of the black alder (Alnus glutinosa), but is somewhat paler and of little economic value. Subspecies There are four to six subspecies, some treated as separate species by some authors: * Alnus incana subsp. incana; grey alder ‚Äî Northern Europe and northwestern Asia, and central and southern Europe in mountains, mainly in the regions of the Alps, Carpathians and the Caucasus * Alnus incana subsp. hirsuta (=A. hirsuta ); Manchurian alder ‚Äî In mountains of Northeast Asia and Central Asia * Alnus incana subsp. kolaensis ‚Äî Subarctic northeast Europe * Alnus incana subsp. oblongifolia (=Alnus oblongifolia); Arizona alder ‚Äî Madrean Sky Islands of southwestern North America, in Arizona, New Mexico, and Northwestern Mexico * Alnus incana subsp. rugosa (=A. rugosa ); speckled alder ‚Äî Much of Canada below the tree line, and the Northeastern United States * Alnus incana subsp. tenuifolia (=A. tenuifolia ); mountain alder, or thinleaf alder ‚Äî Western North America, including New Mexico to California and Alaska; the roots have nitrogen fixing nodules.

In central Europe, it is a colonist of alluvial land alongside mountain brooks and streams, occurring at elevations up to . However, it does not require moist soil, and will also colonize screes and shallow stony slopes. In the northern part of its range, it is a common tree species at sea level in forests, abandoned fields and on lakeshores. Several species of Lepidoptera use grey alder as a food plant for their caterpillars. See List of Lepidoptera that feed on alders. In the boreal forest area of Canada, A. incana is often associated with black spruce in the forest type termed black spruce-speckled alder. The larvae of the alder woolly sawfly sometimes cause considerable defoliation to the grey alder. A. rugosa provides cover for wildlife, is browsed by deer and moose, and the seeds are eaten by birds. Chemistry Pedunculagin is an ellagitannin found in the Manchurian alder (A. hirsuta var. microphylla). Uses The tree is cultivated in parks and gardens. The cultivar 'Aurea', with green-gold leaves, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is sometimes used for afforestation on non-fertile soils which it enriches by means of nitrogen fixing bacteria in its root nodules.

In 1634, Russian Cossacks, headed by Voin Shakhov, established a winter settlement at the confluence of the rivers Vilyuy and Tyukyan. This settlement served as the administrative center of the area for several decades, after which it was moved to the Yolyonnyokh area down by the Vilyuy, where the ostrog (fortified settlement) of Olensk (now Vilyuysk) was founded in 1773. In the 1950s diamond deposits were discovered in the area, about from its mouth.

Her keel was laid down on 14 July 1943 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 27 October 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Charles A. Plumley, and commissioned on 4 March 1944 with Commander O. C. Robbins in command. Following fitting-out and shakedown training, Sterlet departed Key West, Florida, on 1 May to join the Pacific Fleet. The submarine reached Pearl Harbor on 13 June, and she immediately plunged into another round of training exercises to prepare for her first war patrol.  First war patrol  On 4 July 1944, she put to sea to prey on Japanese shipping. The patrol lasted 53 days; and Sterlet spent 34 of them in her assigned patrol area, the Bonin Islands. By the time she put into Midway Island for refit on 26 August, the submarine was a battle-proven veteran, claiming to have sunk four enemy ships. She even brought in a prisoner ‚Äî a survivor from a Japanese convoy destroyed by American aircraft carrier planes three weeks earlier.  Second war patrol  The submarine remained at Midway for just over three weeks; then headed for its patrol area in the Nansei Shoto on 18 September. After sinking a small Japanese fishing boat on 9 October, Sterlet rescued six downed airmen off Okinawa. On 18 October, she made an unsuccessful attempt to close and attack one of six destroyers escorting three cruisers. Two days later, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a Japanese cargo ship, but all three missed. She made a third fruitless approach on 25 October and unleashed four torpedoes on small convoy. Results: four misses. Not to be denied, Sterlet made another approach on the convoy. This time, four of the six torpedoes she launched scored. Three hit a large gasoline tanker, and the fourth plowed into a freighter. The tanker, Jinei Maru, is known definitely to have gone down. Sterlet spent the remainder of the day evading the attacks of the escorts. That night, she allowed a hospital ship to pass unmolested. She attacked a small freighter with four torpedoes on 29 October, but had to surface and sink it with her deck gun. On 31 October, she made a night surface attack on a tanker previously damaged by and apparently sank it with a spread of six torpedoes. Sterlet then joined Trigger in escorting the damaged into Saipan. From there, Sterlet put to sea on 10 November with six other submarines in a coordinated attack group. On the night of 15 November, she, Trigger, and engaged in a gun duel with an enemy sub chaser. Sterlet completely depleted her supply of five-inch (127 mm) shells in the battle and was forced to sink the enemy craft with torpedoes early the following morning. On 30 November, the submarine returned to the Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor.  Third war patrol  Following almost two months in Hawaii, Sterlet embarked on her third war patrol on 25 January 1945. Her assigned area was off Honsh≈´, Japan, particularly the area off Tokyo Bay, where she stood lifeguard duty for Fifth Fleet pilots attacking Tokyo. She made reconnaissance sweeps of the Japanese Fleet and patrolled with a \\"wolfpack\\" that also included , , , and . During this cruise, she made two torpedo attacks, one each on 1 March and 5 March, and claimed two sinkings, a freighter and a tanker. She ended the war patrol at Midway on 4 April.  Fourth War Patrol  Sterlet‚Äôs fourth war patrol lasted from 29 April to 10 June and took her north of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk and the vicinity of the Kuril Islands. On this cruise, her proximity to Soviet territory and the port of Vladivostok complicated her mission. Though Soviet ships were advised to remain out of the war zone around Japan, Sterlet had to be extremely vigilant in her identification of potential targets lest she send some of the United States's allies in the European war to a wet, chilly grave. Lack of certainty in identification forced the submarine to pass up several inviting targets. To further cloud the issue, Japanese ships probably attempted to disguise themselves as Soviets on several occasions to escape American submarines. Sterlet, however, managed to emerge victorious over two enemy ships. In the late afternoon of 29 May, she encountered a large and a small freighter, escorted by three patrol frigates. At 16:41, the submarine tried for a good setup, but failed due to the convoy's rapid change in course. She lost sound contact around 1720 and, 40 minutes later surfaced for a daylight end-around. At 1822, the lookouts sighted smoke; and, by 21:53, the submarine was in position to launch a night surface radar attack. She launched six torpedoes, three at each freighter. Two minutes later, one of the escorts peeled off and made for Sterlet. She immediately went right full rudder, all ahead at flank speed. In another two minutes, two torpedoes plowed into each of the two targets‚Äîfour explosions within 20 seconds. At 22:05, the enemy frigate began random depth charge attacks. Three minutes later, the smaller of the two targets sank by the stern. At 22:11, Sterlet unleashed four torpedoes at the pursuing escort. The setup was hasty at best. All four missed, and she prudently opened range to reload and prepare for another attack on the damaged freighter still afloat. As she approached, her quarry was dead in the water, down by the stern, and partially enveloped by smoke. Two of the escorts were thrashing about the surrounding waters, indiscriminately shooting and dropping depth charges. At 22:35, one of them passed between Sterlet and her victim. The submarine shifted her sights on him and, four minutes later, sent three torpedoes streaking at him. The frigate sighted the wakes, immediately turned into them, and rapidly closed on Sterlet. This pursuit forced Sterlet to retire; and, after more than an hour of running from the frigate and undergoing his bombardment, she managed to open range by firing four torpedoes \\"down the throat\\" at him. This tactic did not allow her to escape, and the chase continued until the frigate turned broadside to fire both his forward and after guns in salvo. That curious maneuver allowed Sterlet to open range to at which point, the enemy's radar wavered. Sterlet shut her radar down, came hard to starboard and opened out. A minute before midnight, Sterlet turned her radar back on. The screen was clear; she had escaped. The submarine had one more anxious moment during the patrol, when she encountered a Q-ship screened by a small escort. She launched six torpedoes at the \\"freighter,\\" which disconcertingly turned and closed Sterlet. She succeeded in evading that aquatic chameleon and returned to Midway on 10 June.  Fifth war patrol  Sterlet‚Äôs final war patrol commenced on 5 July when she departed Midway for the vicinity of Kii Suido and Bungo Suido. Except for one occasion when she shelled oil storage tanks and a power plant near Shingu on Honsh≈´, this whole patrol was given over to lifeguard duty for the crews of carrier planes and B-29 Superfortresses attacking Japan. Sterlet rescued a New Zealander and a Briton, one was near the Kii Channel between Shikoku and Honshu. When Japanese capitulation brought an end to the patrol, Sterlet returned to Midway on 23 August. On 6 September, she sailed for the United States reaching San Diego Naval Base ten days later.  Post- war activities  Sterlet remained on the West Coast until the end of February 1946, at San Diego until 13 November and at San Francisco, California, thereafter. On 26 February 1946, she started back to the western Pacific and after briefly stopping at Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Subic Bay, arrived in Tsingtao, China, on 20 April. She operated out of Tsingtao until the end of May, participating in the Navy's show of force along the northern China coast. She spent the first ten days of June in Shanghai and then got underway for Pearl. Sterlet reached Oahu on 22 June and conducted operations in the Hawaiian Islands for the next 16 months. She headed west again on 15 November 1947 and reached Brisbane, Australia, on 1 December. Five days later, the submarine shaped a course for Guam, arriving there on 14 December. She departed Guam on 2 January 1948, stopped at Okinawa from 6 January to 10 January, and arrived in the Sasebo operating area on 12 January. For the rest of the month, she operated in the vicinity of Sasebo and Yokosuka, visiting both ports. On 28 January, she sailed for the California coast and, after a brief stop at Midway and a six-week layover in Pearl Harbor, reached San Francisco on 30 April. On 1 May, she reported to the Pacific Reserve Fleet for inactivation. She was placed out of commission, in reserve on 18 September 1948 and berthed at Mare Island, California. Just under two years later, on 7 August 1950, Sterlet was ordered reactivated. She was recommissioned at Mare Island on 26 August 1950 with Lieutenant Commander George W. Kittredge in command. On 25 September, she headed for San Diego where she conducted a month of training. In December, she shifted to Long Beach, California, where she became one of the stars in the motion picture Submarine Command with William Holden and William Bendix. Sterlet resumed operations along the West Coast early in 1951 and that employment continued until January 1953, when she was deployed to the Far East. On this cruise, she joined in hunter-killer exercises, visited Chichi Jima, Atami, Japan, and Buckner Bay, Okinawa; and conducted photographic reconnaissance on Marcus Island. She returned to San Diego, California, on 23 June and resumed West Coast operations. In August 1954, Sterlet exchanged crews and homeports with . On 13 September, she reported for duty to Submarine Squadron 1 at Pearl Harbor. For the remainder of her Navy career, Sterlet was home ported at Pearl Harbor. Between 1954 and 1968, she alternated operations in the Hawaiian Islands with nine deployments to the western Pacific with the Seventh Fleet. On these cruises, usually of approximately six months duration, she participated in a host of exercises and war game problems and visited most major ports in the Far East, particularly those in Japan, Taiwan, China and in some of the Central Pacific islands. After her return from her final deployment in the summer of 1968, Sterlet was found to be unfit for further naval service. Accordingly, she was decommissioned on 30 September 1968, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on the following day. She rendered her last service to the Navy on 31 January 1969 when she was sunk as a target by the nuclear-powered submarine USS . Honors and awards Sterlet was awarded six battle stars for World War II service.

It grows mostly in riparian zones, from southern Ontario, west to southeast South Dakota, south to Georgia, northern Florida and southwest to central Texas. Wild trees in the upper Ottawa Valley may be an isolated native population or may have derived from planted trees. Black walnut is an important tree commercially, as the wood is a deep brown color and easily worked. The fruits, walnuts, are cultivated for their distinctive and desirable taste. Often, trees are grown for both lumber and walnuts simultaneously and many cultivars have been developed for improved quality nuts or wood. Black walnut is currently under pressure from the thousand cankers disease that is causing decline of walnuts in some areas. Black walnut is known for being allelopathic, which means that it releases chemicals from its roots and other tissues that harm some other organisms and give the tree a competitive advantage.  Description  *Odor Most parts of the tree including leaves, stems, and fruit husks have a very characteristic pungent or spicy odor. This odor is lacking in the nut itself. *Trunk Height . Under forest competition, it develops a tall and straight trunk. When grown in an open area it has a short trunk and broad crown. *Bark The bark is typically grey-black and deeply furrowed into thin ridges that gives the bark a diamond shaped pattern. *Pith The pith of the twigs is chambered and light brown. *Buds The buds are pale silky and covered in downy hairs. The terminal buds are ovate, and long, and slightly longer than broad, the lateral buds are smaller and superposed. *Leaves The leaves are pinnately compound and alternately arranged on the stem. They are long, typically even-pinnate but there is heavy variation among leaves. The stems have 15‚Äì23 leaflets, when terminal leaf is included, with the largest leaflets located in the center, long and broad. The leaflets have a rounded base and a long pointed (acuminate) tip as well as having a serrated edge. The leaves are overall dark green in color and are typically hairy on the underside. *Leaf scar The leaf scar has 3 prominent bundle scars and has a notch on the side that points toward the tip of the branch (distal side) *Flowers Black walnut is monoecious. The male (staminate) flowers are in drooping catkins long. These are borne from axilary buds on the previous year's growth. The female (pistillate) flowers are terminal, in clusters of two to five on the current year's growth. *Fruit Ripens during the summer/autumn into a spherical fruit (nut) with a brownish-green, semifleshy husk and a brown, corrugated nut. The whole fruit, including the husk falls in October; the seed is relatively small and very hard. The fruit production tends to occur irregularly with some years producing larger crops than others (see mast year). Fruiting may begin when the tree is 4‚Äì6 years old, but large crops take 20 years. Total lifespan of J. nigra is about 130 years. Like other trees of the order Fagales, such as oaks, hickories, chestnuts, and birches, it is monoecious, with wind-pollinated catkins. Male and female flowers are in separate spikes, and the female flowers typically appear before the male on a single tree (dichogamy). As a consequence, self-pollination is unlikely. However, individual trees are commonly self-compatible; if they are not pollinated by neighboring trees, they may set self-fertilized seeds. For maximum seed germination, the seeds should be cold-moist stratified for 3‚Äì4 months, although the exact time depends on the seed source. The seedlings emerge in April or May. While most trees with taproots have a reputation for slow growth, black walnut is an exception and can achieve very rapid growth in the seedling stage, typically their first year and even more in the 2nd year. Black walnut will not leaf out until temperatures have warmed sufficiently. Leafout in spring is initiated when daytime highs reach approximately 70¬∞F (21¬∞C) and leaf drop in fall when daytime highs fall below 65¬∞F (15¬∞C). As such, the exact timing will vary in different regions of the US and depending on the weather conditions from year to year, leafout is typically early April in the southern part of its range and sometimes not until the end of May or beginning of June in cooler areas. Leaf drop in fall may begin in late September in cooler regions and not until November in southern areas. Black walnut has a strong taproot, which makes the seedlings resilient, but difficult to transplant. Black walnut is more resistant to frost than the English or Persian walnut, but thrives best in the warmer regions of fertile, lowland soils with high water tables, although it will also grow in drier soils, but much more slowly. Some soils preferred by black walnut include Alfisol and Entisol soil types. Black walnut grows best on sandy loam, loam, or silt loam type soils but will also grow well on silty clay loam soils. It prefers these soils because they hold large quantities of water, which the tree draws from during rainless periods. Visually, black walnut is similar to the butternut (Juglans cinerea) in leaf shape, and the range also overlaps significantly. The fruits are quite different, and their presence makes an identification easy, as black walnut fruits are round (spherical) and butternuts are more oval-oblong shaped. When a fruit is not available, two species can be differentiated based on the leaf scars, or the place where the leaf meets the stem: butternut has a leaf scar with a flat upper edge and with a velvety ridge above that flat part, but black walnut has an indented leaf scar with no hairy ridge.  Ecology  Black walnut is primarily a pioneer species similar to red and silver maple and black cherry. Because of this, black walnut is a common weed tree found along roadsides, fields, and forest edges in the eastern US. It will grow in closed forests, but is classified as shade intolerant; this means it requires full sun for optimal growth and nut production. Black walnut's native range extends across much of the eastern US. It is absent from the coastal plain south of North Carolina as well as the Mississippi Valley, and does not occur in the northern tier of the eastern US, where the frost-free season is too short for the nuts to develop. Its western range extends all the way to the eastern Great Plains, after which climate conditions become too dry for it. Black walnut is one of the most abundant trees in the eastern US, particularly the Northeast, and its numbers are increasing due to epidemics that have affected other tree species, including emerald ash borer, chestnut blight, butternut canker, wooly hemlock adelgid, dogwood anthracnose, Dutch elm disease, and Gypsy moth infestations. Widespread clear-cutting of oaks due to Gypsy moth damage in the 1970s-80s particularly aided in the tree's spread. The aggressive competitive strategy of black walnut such as its fast growth, alleopathic chemicals, and rodent- dispersed seeds, have also contributed. The nuts are food for many rodents and make up to 10% of the diet of eastern fox squirrels. The nuts are also eaten by species of birds. The leaves are browsed by white tailed deer, although they are not a preferred food. Squirrels benefit this species by distributing and burying the seeds; if the seeds are not reclaimed by the squirrel, they will germinate and help disperse the species. Where the range of the eastern black walnut overlaps that of the Texas black walnut (J. microcarpa), the two species sometimes interbreed, producing populations with characteristics intermediate between the two species. J.nigra and J. cinerea often grow in the same range as well but they do not hybridize naturally. The tree's roots often form endomycorrhizal relationships with fungi in the genus Glomus. Some endomycorrhizal relations improve the plant's growth. Species often associated with J. nigra include yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana), black cherry (Prunus serotina), basswood (Tilia americana), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), oaks (Quercus spp.), and hickories (Carya spp.). Near the western edge of its range, black walnut may be confined to floodplains, where it grows either with American elm (Ulmus americana), common hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and boxelder (Acer negundo), or with basswood and red oak (Quercus rubra) on lower slopes and other favorable sites.  Uses   Planting  While its primary native region is the Midwest and east- central United States, the black walnut was introduced into Europe in 1629 and is also cultivated in Hawaii. It is cultivated there and in North America as a forest tree for its high-quality wood. Black walnut plantings can be made to produce timber, nuts, or both timber and nuts. Patented timber-type trees were selected and released from Purdue University in the early 1990s. These trees have been sporadically available from nurseries. Varieties include Purdue #1, which can be used for both timber and nut production, though nut quality is poor compared to varieties selected specifically as nut producers. Autumn foliage Grafted, nut-producing trees are available from several nurseries operating in the U.S. Selections worth considering include Thomas, Neel #1, Thomas Myers, Pounds #2, Stoker, Surprise, Emma K, Sparrow, S127, and McGinnis. Several older varieties, such as Kwik Krop, are still in cultivation; while they make decent nuts, they would not be recommended for commercial planting. A variety index and characteristics guide is available from Missouri Extension. Pollination requirements should be considered when planting black walnuts. As is typical of many species in Juglandaceae, Juglans nigra trees tend to be monoecious, i.e.. produce pollen first and then pistillate flowers or else produce pistillate flowers and then pollen. An early pollen-producer should be grouped with other varieties that produce pistillate flowers so all varieties benefit from overlap. Cranz, Thomas, and Neel #1 make a good pollination trio. A similar group for more northern climates would be Sparrow, S127, and Mintle. Sometimes black walnut is planted as part of reclaiming mines. When growing young trees weed control is critical for healthy establishment of the trees, without weed control the young trees are harmed significantly in their growth rate. Ornamental J. nigra is also grown as a specimen ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, growing to tall by broad. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Food  A bowl of black walnut kernels, shelled Black walnut nuts are shelled commercially in the United States. About 65% of the annual wild harvest comes from the U.S. state of Missouri, and the largest processing plant is operated by Hammons Products in Stockton, Missouri. The nutmeats provide a robust, distinctive, natural flavor and crunch as a food ingredient. Popular uses include ice cream, bakery goods and confections. Consumers include black walnuts in traditional treats, such as cakes, cookies, fudge, and pies, during the fall holiday season. The nuts' nutritional profile leads to uses in other foods, such as salads, fish, pork, chicken, vegetables and pasta dishes. Nutritionally similar to the milder-tasting English walnut, the black walnut kernel is high in unsaturated fat and protein. An analysis of nut oil from five named J. nigra cultivars ('Ogden', 'Sparrow', 'Baugh', 'Carter' and 'Thomas') showed the most prevalent fatty acid in J. nigra oil is linoleic acid (27.80‚Äì33.34 g/100g dry kernel), followed (in the same units) by oleic acid (14.52‚Äì24.40), linolenic acid (1.61‚Äì3.23), palmitic acid (1.61‚Äì2.15), and stearic acid (1.07‚Äì1.69). The oil from the cultivar 'Carter' had the highest mol percentage of linoleate (61.6), linolenate (5.97%), and palmitate (3.98%); the oil from the cultivar 'Baugh' had the highest mol percentage of oleate (42.7%); the oil from the cultivar 'Ogden' has the highest mol percentage of stearate (2.98%). Tapped in spring, the tree yields a sweet sap that can be drunk or concentrated into syrup or sugar that is not unlike the sap of sugar maple.  Nut processing by hand  Hands after removing the husks from 500 black walnuts The extraction of the kernel from the fruit of the black walnut is difficult. The thick, hard shell is tightly bound by tall ridges to a thick husk. Rolling the nut underfoot on a hard surface such as a driveway is a common method; commercial huskers use a car tire rotating against a metal mesh. Some take a thick plywood board and drill a nut-sized hole in it (from one to two inches in diameter) and smash the nut through using a hammer. The nut goes through and the husk remains behind. While the flavor of the Juglans nigra kernel is prized, the difficulty in preparing it may account for the wider popularity and availability of the English walnut.  Dye  Black walnut drupes contain juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), plumbagin (yellow quinone pigments), and tannin. These compounds cause walnuts to stain cars, sidewalks, porches, and patios, in addition to the hands of anyone attempting to shell them. The brownish-black dye was used by early American settlers to dye hair. According to Eastern Trees in the Petersen Guide series, black walnuts make a yellowish- brown dye, not brownish-black. The apparent confusion is easily explained by the fact that the liquid (dye) obtained from the inner husk becomes increasingly darker over time, as the outer skin darkens from light green to black. Extracts of the outer, soft part of the drupe are still used as a natural dye for handicrafts.Black Walnut Basket Dye The tannins present in walnuts act as a mordant, aiding in the dyeing process, and are usable as a dark ink or wood stain.Making Walnut Ink. Madame Elizabeth de Nevell.  Industrial  Walnut shells are often used as an abrasive in sand blasting or other circumstances where a medium hardness grit is required. The hard black walnut shell is also used commercially in abrasive cleaning, a filtering agent in scrubbers in smoke stacks, cleaning jet engines, cosmetics, and oil well drilling and water filtration.  Wood  Black walnut wood showing the color and grain Juglans nigra wood in cross section Black walnut is highly prized for its dark-colored, straight grained, true heartwood. It is heavy, strong, shock resistant and yet can be easily split and worked. Along with cedars (Thuja spp.), chestnut (Castanea spp.), and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) black walnut is one of the most durable hardwoods in the US. The wood can be kiln dried and holds its shape well after seasoning, which makes this wood even more attractive for wood working. Walnut wood has historically been used for gun stocks, furniture, flooring, paddles, coffins, and a variety of other wood products. Due to its value, forestry officials often are called on to track down walnut poachers; in 2004, DNA testing was used to solve one such poaching case, involving a 55-foot (16-m) tree worth US$2,500. Black walnut has a density of 660 kg per cubic meter (41.2 lb/cubic foot),Niche Timbers Black Walnut which makes it less dense than oak.  Pests  Maggots (larvae of Rhagoletis completa and Rhagoletis suavis) in the husk are common, though more a nuisance than a serious problem for amateurs, who may simply remove the affected husk as soon as infestation is noticed. The maggots develop entirely within the husk, thus the quality of the nutmeat is not affected.Walnut Husk Maggot, Rhagoletis suavis (Loew) and Walnut Husk Fly, Rhagoletis completa Cresson However, infestations of maggots are undesirable because they make the husk difficult to remove and are unsightly. Maggots can be serious for commercial walnut growers, who tend to use chemical treatments to prevent damage to the crop.Walnut Husk Maggot . Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Some non-chemical controls also exist, such as removing and disposing of infested nuts. The walnut weevil (Conotrachelus retentus) grows to long as an adult. The adult sucks plant juices through a snout. The eggs are laid in fruits in the spring and summer. Many nuts are lost due to damage from the larvae, which burrow through the nut shell. Black walnut is affected by European canker (Neonectria galligena). The infection spreads slowly but infected trees eventually die. The walnut caterpillar (Datana integerrima) and fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) are two of the most serious pests, they commonly eat the foliage in midsummer and continue into autumn. Codling moth (Cydia pomonella) larvae eat walnut kernels, as well as apple and pear seeds. Important leaf sucking insects include species of aphids and plant lice including (Monellia spp. and Monelliopsis spp.), which suck the juices from leaves and often deposit a sticky substance called \\"honey-dew\\" on the leaf surface that may turn black and prevent photosynthesis; and the walnut lace bug (Corythucha juglandis), which causes damage when the adults and nymphs suck the sap from the lower surfaces of walnut leaflets. A disease complex known as thousand cankers disease has been threatening black walnut in several western states. This disease has recently been discovered in Tennessee, and could potentially have devastating effects on the species in the eastern United States. Vectored by the walnut twig beetle (Pityophthorus juglandis), a fungus, Geosmithia morbida spreads into the wood around the galleries carved by the small beetles. The fungus causes cankers that inhibit the movement of nutrients in black walnut, leading to crown and branch dieback, and ultimately death.  Allelopathy  Black walnut is allelopathic, as it excretes chemicals into its environment that harm competition. While many species of plants are allelopathic, walnuts are particularly famous for it, records of walnut toxicity to other plants have been observed as far back as the first century when Pliny the Elder wrote: \\"The shadow of walnut trees is poison to all plants within its compass.\\" Walnuts have since been observed as being toxic to many plants including herbaceous and woody plants. Like other walnuts, the roots, inner bark, nut husks, and leaves contain a nontoxic chemical called hydrojuglone, when exposed to air or soil compounds it is oxidized into juglone that is biologically active and acts as a respiratory inhibitor to some plants. Juglone is poorly soluble in water and does not move far in the soil and will stay most concentrated in the soil directly beneath the tree. Even after a tree is removed the soil where the roots once were will still contain juglone for several years after the tree is removed as more juglone will be released as the roots decay. Well drained and aerated soils will host a healthy community of soil microbes and these microbes will help to break down the juglone. Symptoms of juglone poisoning include foliar yellowing and wilting. A number of plants are particularly sensitive. Apples, tomatoes, pines, and birch are poisoned by juglone, and should not be planted in proximity to a black walnut.  Interaction with horses  Horses are susceptible to laminitis from exposure to black walnut wood in bedding.  Largest trees  The largest known living black walnut tree is on Sauvie Island, Oregon.

Tacamahaca) are a group of about 10 species of poplars, indigenous to North America and eastern Asia, distinguished by the balsam scent of their buds, the whitish undersides of their leaves, and the leaf petiole being round (not flattened) in cross-section. They are large deciduous trees, 30-60 m tall, with leaves with a rounded base, pointed apex, and a whitish waxy coating on the underside of the leaf; this latter distinguishes them from most other poplars. The name is derived from the pleasant balsam smell of the opening buds and leaves in spring, produced by a sticky gum on the buds which also helps protect the buds from insect damage. The balsam poplars are light-demanding trees that require considerable moisture. Poplars are tolerant of very cold conditions, occurring further north than other poplars except for the aspens. The poplars in Southern California are tolerant of 100 plus degree heat. They grow along dry washes and dry riverbed‚Äòs. The dry washes and dry riverbeds will have flowing water when it rains sufficiently. Their leaves hang down and are at an edge to the sun. This may be another factor why they can take the high heat. Their leaves tremble in the slightest breeze like the quaking aspen Species The balsam poplar P. balsamifera (= P. tacamahaca, P. candicans) is a native of North America, where it grows on alluvial bottomlands in the northeastern United States and Canada. It grows to a height of 30 metres and has yellow-grey bark, thick and furrowed, and coloured blackish at the base of the trunk. The twigs are yellow-brown to brown, the buds covered with a layer of balsam resin. The flowers and fruit are very much like those of the white poplar (P. alba) which is a relative of the aspens (Populus sect. Populus). Large western balsam poplar The western balsam poplar, black cottonwood, or California poplar P. trichocarpa is native to western North America, from Alaska south to northern California. It is the largest species of poplar, recorded to 65 m tall. It is also a very important species in plant biology. It was announced on 15 September 2006 in the journal Science that P. trichocarpa became the first tree species to have its entire genome sequenced.Nature: First tree joins genome clubScience:Seeking the Genome for the Trees In the mountains of interior western North America, it is replaced by the willow-leaved poplar or narrowleaf cottonwood, P. angustifolia. P. trichocarpa is sometimes treated within P. balsamifera as P. balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa. Simon's poplar (P. simonii), a native of northwestern China, is frequently planted as a shade tree in northern European cities. It is an attractive ornamental tree with whitish bark, and nearly rhombic, 6-10 cm long leaves which appear on the tree in early spring. Maximowicz' poplar or Japanese poplar (P. maximowiczii) and the Ussuri poplar (P. ussuriensis = P. maximowiczii var. barbinervis) are similar, occurring in northeastern China, Japan, Korea, and eastern Siberia; they have broader leaves. Another similar species is the laurel-leaf poplar (P. laurifolia from Mongolia), which differs from its relatives in narrower leaves shaped like a bay laurel leaf. Another putative member of this group is the Korean poplar (P. koreana). Whether the northeast Asian Sichuan poplar (P. szechuanica) and P. tristis belong here or with the aspens is not yet resolved. Likewise, the affiliation of P. cathayana and the Yunnan poplar (P. yunnanensis) are in need of further study, though these may well be balsam poplars. There are other species not listed here. How to classify Populus into species, at least for Chinese populations, is not yet settled. Use by humans Balsam poplars are cultivated mainly in parks for their ornamental, light-coloured bark and pleasant scent in spring. Western balsam poplar is also planted as a timber crop. The wood is soft, very light in weight, but strong for its weight, coarse and fibrous, does not polish or plane easily, and is used for pallet boxes and other similar rough uses. Several hybrids between balsam poplars (particularly western balsam poplar) and the cottonwoods have also been developed for lumber production or for use as shade trees. These hybrids are selected for exceptionally fast growth and disease resistance. Poplars are also of potential use for biofuels because of their fast growth. Researchers are aiming to use genetic techniques to make poplars grow fatter, with a smaller canopy, so that more trees can be grown more quickly in a small space, and to make the plants contain a higher proportion of cellulose to lignin. The increased cellulose content would make them easier to convert into sugars and ethanol for biofuel or for pulp in paper mills. The buds of various balsam poplars have long been combined with a lard base to make the vulnerary ointment Balm of Gilead.Angier, Bradford. Field Guide to Medicinal Wild Plants.

It was a decisive French victory and is considered to mark the end of the Hundred Years' War. On the day of the battle, English commander John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury led his army into a fortified French encampment without waiting for reinforcements, believing that the enemy was retreating. Talbot then refused to withdraw even after realizing the strength of the French position, causing his men to suffer extensive casualties from the French artillery. Castillon is considered the first major battle won through the extensive use of field artillery. The battle resulted in the English loss of almost all its holding in France especially Gascony (Aquitaine), an English possession for three centuries. There was a shift in the balance of power in Europe, and political instability in England.Burne, 1953. Background The term \\"Hundred Years' War\\" is misleading, as the fighting between the English and the French during the period of 1337 to 1453 was more a series of conflicts than a single prolonged war. Thus, the conflict(s) can be examined from the vantage point of various stages.Curry 1993, pp. 151‚Äì55 The breakdown of the 1420 Treaty of Troyes began the final stage of the Hundred Years' War.Wagner 2006, p. 127 This period from 1420 to 1453 is characterized by Anne Curry as the \\"wars of the Treaty of Troyes\\" for control of the crown of France.Curry 1993, p. 155 After the 1451 French capture of Bordeaux by the armies of Charles VII, the Hundred Years' War appeared to be at an end. The English primarily focused on reinforcing their only remaining possession, Calais, and watching over the seas.Curry 1993, p. 115 After three hundred years of Plantagenet rule, the citizens of Bordeaux considered themselves subjects of the English monarch and sent messengers to Henry VI of England demanding that he recapture the province.Pollard 1983, p. 135 On 17 October 1452, John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury landed near Bordeaux with a force of 3,000 men.Seward 1978, p. 159 A feared and famous military leader, Talbot was rumoured to be seventy-five or eighty years old, but it is more likely that he was around sixty-six at the time.Pollard 1983, p. 1, With the cooperation of the townspeople, Talbot easily took the city on 23 October.Pollard 1983, p. 136 The English subsequently took control over most of Western Gascony by the end of the year. The French knew an expedition was coming, but had expected it to come through Normandy. After this surprise, Charles VII prepared his forces over the winter, and by early 1453 he was ready to counter-attack. Prelude Charles invaded Guyenne with three separate armies, all headed for Bordeaux. Talbot received 3,000 additional reinforcements from his fourth and favourite son, John, the Viscount Lisle. The French laid siege to Castillon (approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) East of Bordeaux) on 8 July.Pollard 1983, p. 137 Talbot acceded to the pleas of the town commanders, abandoning his original plan to wait for reinforcements at Bordeaux, and set out to relieve the garrison. The French army was commanded by committee; Charles VII's ordnance officer, Jean Bureau laid out the camp to maximize French artillery strength. In a defensive setup, Bureau's forces built an artillery park out of range from Castillon's guns. According to Desmond Seward, the park \\"consisted of a deep trench with a wall of earth behind it which was strengthened by tree-trunks; its most remarkable feature was the irregular, wavy line of the ditch and earthwork, which enabled the guns to enfilade any attackers\\".Seward 1978, pp. 259‚Äì60 The park included up to 300 guns of various sizes, and was protected by a ditch and palisade on three sides and a steep bank of the River Lidoire on the fourth. Talbot left Bordeaux on 16 July. He outdistanced a majority of his forces, arriving at Libourne by sunset with only 500 men-at-arms and 800 mounted archers. The following day, this force defeated a small French detachment of archers stationed at a priory near Castillon. Despite earlier plans to wait for reinforcements, Talbot pressed his men onward to the French camp, believing his reinforcements would arrive soon. Battle Painting depicting the Battle of Castillon (1453) by the French painter Charles-Philippe Larivi√®re (1798‚Äì1876). (Galerie des Batailles, Palace of Versailles). John Talbot is falling from his wounded horse. Along with the morale boost of victory at the priory, Talbot also pushed forward because of reports that the French were retreating. The cloud of dust leaving the camp which the townsmen indicated as a retreat was created by camp followers leaving before the upcoming battle. The English advanced, but they ran into the full force of the French army. Despite being outnumbered and in a vulnerable position, Talbot ordered them to continue the fighting.Pollard 1983, pp. 137‚Äì38 Historian A.J. Pollard suggests this seemingly reckless behaviour from Talbot may be due to the fact that his \\"pride and honour were at stake for he had already ordered his men to battle when he discovered the strength of the French position\\".Pollard 1983, p. 139 The only Englishman who remained mounted in the battle, he also did not wear armour due to previous agreements with the French when he was released from captivity in Normandy. According to David Nicolle, the battle itself was \\"highly characteristic of the period\\" with the strong field fortification of the French and the small-arms fighting of the battle.Nicolle 2012, p. 52 In many ways, this battle played out like the Battle of Cr√©cy in \\"reverse\\". The French guns obliterated the advancing soldiers. It is reported each shot killed six men at a time.Seward 1978, p. 261Lace 1994, p. 94 Talbot's reinforcements continued to arrive at the battle, only to suffer the same fate. Despite the odds against the English, the battle lasted over an hour until a thousand-strong Breton cavalry force led by Peter II, the Duke of Brittany, crashed into their right flank, sending them into retreat.Seward 1978, pp. 261‚Äì262 In the end, the French routed the English. Both Talbot and his son died in the battle. There is some debate over the exact circumstances of Talbot's death, but it appears as though his horse was killed by a projectile, its mass pinned him down, and then a French archer killed him with an axe.Lace 1994, p. 93Seward 1978, p. 262Pollard 1983, pp. 137‚Äì138 Aftermath With Talbot's death, English authority in Gascony eroded and the French retook Bordeaux on 19 October. It was not apparent to either side that the period of conflict was over.Curry 1993, pp. 115‚Äì116 In hindsight, the battle marks a decisive turning point in history, and is cited as the endpoint of the period known as the Hundred Years' War. Henry VI of England lost his mental capacity in late 1453, which led to the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in England. Some have speculated that learning of the defeat at Castillon led to his mental collapse. The English Crown lost all its continental possessions except for the Pale of Calais, which was the last English possession in mainland France, and the Channel Islands, historically part of the Duchy of Normandy and thus of the Kingdom of France. Calais was lost in 1558.Curry 1993, p. 120 The Channel Islands have remained British Crown Dependencies to the present day. A casualty after the battle of Castillon was Pierre II de Montferrand, husband of Mary Plantagenet, illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Bedford and a granddaughter of Henry IV of England. While returning to France, after being exiled in England, Montferrand was arrested and taken to Poitiers where he was tried by a commission. Having been found guilty he was beheaded and quartered, possibly on the orders of Charles VII, at Poitiers, in July 1454. Montferrand was one of only a few nobles known to have been executed for treason during the reign of Charles VII.Cutler 1981, pp. 205‚Äì206Richardson 2004, p. 550 Notes References *Curry, Anne.

Christchurch, New Zealand, Botany Division, D.S.I.R. silverleaf poplar, or white poplar, is a species of poplar, most closely related to the aspens (Populus sect. Populus). It is native to Morocco and then Spain through central Europe (north to Germany and Poland) to central Asia. It grows in moist sites, often by watersides, in regions with hot summers and cold to mild winters.Flora Europaea: Populus albaRushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins .  Description  It is a medium-sized deciduous tree, growing to heights of up to (rarely more), with a trunk up to in diameter and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is smooth and greenish-white to greyish-white with characteristic diamond-shaped dark marks on young trees, becoming blackish and fissured at the base of old trees. The young shoots are covered with whitish-grey down, including the small buds. The leaves are long, five-lobed, with a thick covering of white scurfy down on both sides, but thicker underneath; this layer wears off long, produced in early spring; they are dioecious, with male and female catkins on separate trees; the male catkins are grey with conspicuous dark red stamens, the female catkins are greyish-green. The female catkins lengthen to after pollination, with several green seed capsules, maturing in late spring to early summer. It also propagates by means of root suckers growing from the lateral roots, often as far as from the trunk, to form extensive clonal colonies.Flora of NW Europe: Populus alba  Hybridization  Alley of grey poplars White poplar hybridizes with the closely related common aspen Populus tremula; the resulting hybrid, known as grey poplar (Populus √ó canescens), is intermediate between its parents, with a thin, grey, downy coating on the leaves, which are also much less deeply lobed than white poplar leaves. It is a very vigorous tree with marked hybrid vigour, reaching tall and a trunk diameter over , much larger than either of its parents. Most grey poplars in cultivation are male, but female trees occur naturally and some of these are also propagated.  Cultivation and uses  Populus alba Pyramidalis White poplar requires abundant light and ample moisture, and stands up well to flood water and slightly acidic soils. Its green-and-white leaves make it an effective ornamental tree, but the root suckers may cause problems in some situations. It is very attractive as an open-grown tree in water meadows, and because of its extensive root system and tolerance of salt, is also planted to strengthen coastal sand dunes.Vedel, H., & Lange, J. (1960). Trees and Bushes in Wood and Hedgerow. Metheun & Co. Ltd., London. The majority of white poplars in cultivation in northern Europe are female trees. White poplar was first introduced to North America in 1748 and has a long history in cultivation. It is now found in 43 states throughout the contiguous U.S. It has come to be considered weedy or invasive; it has been banned in Connecticut and is the most common introduced tree species on Cape Breton Island.Keeler, H.

Charles Scribner's Sons, New YorkUS invasive state location map In US intensive forest management, it is being replaced by various Populus sect. Aigeiros hybrids. The wood is soft, and used for cellulose and to make cheap boxes. A conical cultivar from Turkestan, Populus alba 'Pyramidalis' (Bolle's poplar; syn. P. bolleana) is sometimes planted in parks. A yellow dye is produced from the bark of the white poplar., s.v. Populus alba  Sculpture  The wood is soft but close-grained and easy to carve, shrinking very little during seasoning. It has been used for sculpture from Europe to China and the US.R≈°sch, Petra, Chinese Wood Sculptures of the 11th to 13th centuries: Images of Water-moon Guanyin in Northern Chinese Temples and Western Collections, pp. 179-180, 2007, Columbia University Press, , 9783838256627; The Penitent Magdalene by Donatello is one 15th-century example.  History  An Old English name abele, now never used, is derived from the Latin albellus, white, by way of Old French aubel and Low German name abeel. Leuce/Leuka, the \\"White Poplar\\"; Leuce or Leuka (Ancient Greek: ŒõŒµœçŒ∫Œ∑) (\\"White\\" or specifically \\"White Poplar\\") was the most beautiful of the nymphs and an Oceanid, a daughter of Oceanus. Pluto fell in love with her and abducted her to the underworld. She lived out the span of her life in his realm, and when she died, the god sought consolation by creating a suitable memorial of their love: In the Elysian Fields, where the pious spend their afterlives, he brought forth a white tree into existence from her body, which became sacred for him from that moment on. In Ancient Greco-Roman mythology, it is a symbol of a peaceful afterlife and a memory of those we love who have died, and in the language of flowers, its meaning is \\"time\\". Herakles crowned himself with this tree to celebrate his return from the underworld. According to ancient Roman mythology, the white poplar was consecrated to Hercules because he destroyed Cacus in a cavern adjoining the Aventine Hill, which was covered with these trees; in the moment of his triumph, he bound his brows with a branch of white poplar as a token of his victory. Persons offering sacrifices to Hercules were always crowned with branches of this tree, and all who had gloriously conquered their enemies in battle wore garlands of it, in imitation of Hercules. Homer in Iliad compares the fall of Simoisius when killed by Ajax to that of a poplar. Ovid mentions that Paris had carved the name of √Ünone on a poplar, as Shakespeare has Orlando carve the name of Rosalind upon the trees of the forest of Arden. Virgil gives directions for the culture of this tree and Horace speaks of the white poplar as delighting to grow on the banks of rivers.  Invasive potential  The white poplar is an invasive species in many parts of Australia. In Western Australia, it has formed dense stands in disturbed wetlands from Perth to Albany and it is considered a threat to riparian vegetation in Victoria. It has spread along the Murrumbidgee River and in wet areas in rural parts of the Australian Capital Territory. Despite that, it is still sold in nurseries around Australia. White poplar is also an environmental weed in South Africa.

There are two basic components to a craft's identity: its designation, and its common name. A vehicle designation is sometimes referred to as a Mission Design Series (MDS), referring to the three main parts of the designation, that combine to form a unique profile for each vehicle. The first series of letters (up to four) determine the type of craft and designed mission. A series number identifies major types which are of the same type and mission, and finally a series of variant and block identifiers clarify the exact configuration of the vehicle. The name is a matter of less specific construction, but is aimed at providing an official common name which eases identification and communication regarding the vehicle. The common name is not used in internal publications (an official internal report would refer to the \\"F-16\\" and \\"AIM-9\\" but not mention the names \\"Fighting Falcon\\" or \\"Sidewinder\\"). Pilots often have their own nicknames for their aircraft which may bear only coincidental resemblance (if that) to the official common name, although some pilot nicknames are similar or even derived from the official common name (such as \\"Bug\\" and \\"Super Bug\\" for the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet). The current regulations and procedures relating to employing this system are laid out in DoD and branch documents, including Air Force Joint Instruction 16-401 , and are not classified. These regulations replaced the previous regulations which were originally introduced in 1962 (See 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system).  Components  There are 10 potential components of a system's designation, comprising the three basic parts of the designation. ;Status Prefix: Optional prefix to denote vehicles with unique status, such as non-flying or experimental. ;Modified Mission: Optional additional mission identifier which clarifies or notes modification of the basic mission. ;Launch Environment: Identifies method of launch for missiles and rockets. ;Mission: The most basic component of the initial part of the designation, identifies the basic design mission of the craft. ;Vehicle Type: Identifies non-standard vehicle types. ;Design Number: Serial number assigned to each design of the same mission type, with a dash separating the mission and number. ;Series: A letter suffix to indicate which series within a design the vehicle belongs to. ;Configuration Number: For missiles and rockets, an identifier to designate specific changes in missile configuration. ;Block: For aircraft, a defined configuration within a series or design. ;Serial Number: Individual examples have a serial number to identify them.  Status prefix  Status prefix is an optional prefix not often used for vehicles in regular service. If used, it is the first letter in the MDS. Authorized current status prefixes are: ;C: Captive. Only used for rockets and missiles, C applies to missiles designed to be carried in their launch environment but are incapable of actual launch. ;D: Dummy. Only used for rockets and missiles which are non-flying, primarily for ground training. ;G: Grounded. Applied to aircraft which are permanently grounded, most often used for ground training of crews and support. This is only applied as a permanent designation. Use is rare. ;J: Temporary Special Test. Applied to craft involved with special testing of temporarily installed equipment. The J Prefix is used for aircraft that can be reasonably returned to their original configuration following tests. An example is aircraft used as testbeds for new electronics, but which will or may not retain that equipment after tests are complete. ;N: Permanent Special Test. Applied to craft involved with special testing on a permanent basis, with modifications to their configuration that make return to original configuration impractical. Many military aircraft transferred to NASA for aeronautical research carry this designation. ;X: Experimental. Applied to craft which are not yet accepted for service, or to prototypes for which standard configuration has not been finalized. Most prototypes of the past carried this prefix, but it should not be confused with craft given an X basic mission symbol. The X status prefix is for designs for other missions, but at an experimental stage of the design process. ;Y: Prototype. Originally applied to demonstration craft where configuration had been determined, but from the 1970s on applied to all prototypes of aircraft intended for production. ;Z: Planning. Applied to designs in the planning/pre- development phase.  Modified mission symbols  Many craft have been designed for more specific missions than their basic mission symbol would indicate, and many design series have been designed for different missions than the original design, and may or may not still maintain capability for the original mission. The modified mission symbol provides the services the ability to accurately indicate a craft's mission without losing commonality with the basic design MDS. If utilized, the modified mission symbol is placed directly in front of the basic mission symbol. Modified mission symbols are not used for rockets and missiles. Currently authorized modified mission symbols are: ;A: Attack. Similar to the basic mission symbol, A applies to aircraft modified to attack land or sea targets. Example is the AC-130U Spectre, a transport modified for ground attack missions. ;C: Cargo. Similar to the basic mission symbol, C applies to aircraft modified to carry cargo and passengers. ;D: Director. Applies to aircraft modified to control unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones. ;E: Electronics. Applies to aircraft modified with addition of extensive electronic equipment, either for enhancement of their basic mission, or as a platform for specifically electronic missions such as providing electronic countermeasures (ECM), airborne early warning (AEW), airborne command and control (ACC), or communications relay. Example is the EP-3A Orion, a patrol aircraft outfitted with special electronics to collect electronic data. ;F: Fighter. Similar to the basic mission symbol, F applies to aircraft modified to engage in air combat. Used on many American fightercraft. ;H: Search and Rescue. Similar to the basic mission symbol, H applies to aircraft modified to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations. Example is the HU-25 Guardian, a utility transport modified for Coast Guard search and rescue coordination. ;K: Tanker. Applies to aircraft modified to carry and transfer aviation fuel in flight to other aircraft. Example is the KA-6D Intruder, an attack aircraft modified with tanks and hoses to provide aerial refueling. ;L: Cold Weather. Applies to aircraft modified to operate in Arctic or Antarctic environments. Example is the LC-130, a transport modified to deliver logistics support to Antarctic stations. ;M: Multi-Mission. Applies to aircraft modified to perform various missions, in particular special operations modifications. Also used as a catch all for missions that neither fit in any category, nor warrant their own. ;O: Observation. Applies to aircraft modified to perform observation of enemy or potential enemy positions, and patrol borders or areas of potential infiltration. Example is the OA-10A, an attack aircraft modified to provide observation of enemy territory. ;P: Patrol. Similar to the basic mission symbol, P applies to aircraft modified to perform maritime patrol. ;Q: Drone. Applies to craft modified to operate unmanned, under control of ground or air directors or autonomously. Example is the QF-106 Delta Dart, a fighter modified to fly under remote control as a target for missile testing. ;R: Reconnaissance. Similar to the basic mission symbol, R applies to aircraft modified to perform air reconnaissance of enemy forces, territory, and facilities. Example is the RF-5E Tiger II, a fighter with added reconnaissance cameras and equipment for photographing enemy positions. ;S: Anti-Submarine. Similar to the basic mission symbol, S applies to aircraft modified to search for, locate, and attack enemy submarines. ;T: Training. Similar to the basic mission symbol, T applies to aircraft modified for use as trainers, both initial and operational. Examples are two-seat operational training versions of single- seat aircraft, such as the TA-4J and TF-102. Fully combat-capable two-seaters are usually simply assigned a new series letter. ;U: Utility. Similar to the basic mission symbol, U applies to aircraft modified to allow use as utility and base support aircraft. Example is the UP-3 Orion, a patrol plane modified for transportation of staff, mail, and operations in support of bases and installations. ;V: Staff/VIP. Applied to aircraft modified for transport of staff and ranking personnel with furnishment of comfortable accommodations. Example is the VC-25, a 747 modified to serve as the Presidential transport, or Air Force One. ;W: Weather. Applied to aircraft modified for weather monitoring and air sampling. Example is the WC-135, a transport modified with special equipment for air sampling. The W designation covers air sampling to detect nuclear, biological, and chemical contamination, and for intelligence gathering on foreign nuclear testing.  Basic mission symbol  The basic mission symbol is the heart of the mission part of the designation. No designation is without it, and some designations consist of only a basic mission symbol for the mission part, such as the F-14 or C-130. The following are the officially authorized basic mission symbols: ;A: Attack. Attack craft are designed to directly attack enemy land or sea targets, interdict enemy movements and support, and strike precision targets. Examples are the A-6 Intruder and A-10 Thunderbolt II. ;B: Bomber. Bombers are designed to attack strategic and tactical targets with heavy bomb loads and missiles. They carry heavy loads of free-fall and stand-off weaponry. Examples are the B-52 Stratofortress and B-2A Spirit. ;C: Cargo. Transports are designed to carry cargo and passengers to provide tactical logistical support and strategic mobility to other forces. Examples are the C-2 Greyhound and C-130 Hercules. ;E: Electronic. Electronics craft are designed explicitly to fulfill electronic specialty missions such as ECM, ACC, AEW, and communications. Examples are the E-2 Hawkeye and E-3 Sentry. ;F: Fighter. Fighters are designed to intercept and engage enemy aircraft and missiles. It is also a catch-all for multi-mission aircraft, even if it is primarily designed for ground-attack purpose. Examples are the F-22 Raptor and F-16 Fighting Falcon. ;AL: Airborne Laser. Laser craft are those who are primarily designed to employ laser weaponry against air and ground targets. This is a very new designation, and only applies to the AL-1 ABL program. ;O: Observation. Observation craft are designed to maintain observation over land, primarily territory either held by enemy forces or susceptible to infiltration. Unlike reconnaissance craft, they loiter over area providing observation over time. Examples are the O-1 Bird Dog and OV-10 Bronco. ;P: Patrol. Patrol craft are designed for maritime reconnaissance missions, including anti-submarine warfare. Example is the P-3 Orion. ;Q: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Examples are the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-8 Fire Scout. ;R: Reconnaissance: Reconnaissance craft are designed to conduct reconnaissance through photographic and electrical means. Example SR-71, special or strategic reconnaissance ;S: Anti-submarine: Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) craft are designed to locate and attack enemy submarines. Example is the S-3 Viking. ;T: Trainer: Trainers are aircraft used to train aircrews. Examples are the T-6 Texan II and T-45 Goshawk. ;U: Utility: Utility craft are utilized for miscellaneous missions and base support. Example, reconnaissance jet, but for disinformation named U U-2 ;X: Research: Research craft are designed for experimental and developmental research programs. Unlike the X mission modifier, the X basic mission symbol is used for craft solely designed for this purpose, with no operational mission intended or feasible. Examples are the entire series of X-planes from the Bell X-1 on.  Vehicle type symbols  For non-standard vehicle types (vehicles other than piloted, fixed-wing and self-propelled aircraft which are wholly supported by aerodynamic lift from liftoff to touchdown), a final symbol is added after the basic mission symbol to identify the vehicle type. Current applicable symbols are as follow: ;G: Glider. A glider is a fixed-wing aircraft designed to use air currents for normal lift, although it may have an engine. ;H: Helicopter. A helicopter is any rotary-wing aircraft. ;Q: Unmanned. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is any aircraft without capacity for a human pilot, but not merely a missile or rocket. ;S: Spaceplane. A spaceplane is a vehicle designed to fly beyond earth's atmosphere and return. This vehicle code was poorly chosen, as it conflicts with the mission code S (Anti-Submarine Warfare). \\"ES\\" could equally designate a spaceplane designed specifically for electronic warfare or an anti-submarine plane modified for that purpose. ;V: V/STOL. A Vertical and/or Short Takeoff and Landing aircraft is designed to take-off and land vertically, but not rely on rotary-wing lift for flight. This includes vectored thrust aircraft such as the AV-8 Harrier and tiltrotors such as the V-22 Osprey. It also applies to aircraft of the normal fixed-wing configuration that are capable of taking off and landing in a short runway space, such as the OV-10 Bronco. ;Z: Lighter than air. A lighter than air craft is designed to remain aloft through buoyancy of lighter than air gases. Such craft include blimps and balloons. Rockets/missiles  Rocket/missile launch environment  All rockets and missiles contain a symbol to indicate the launch method, be it from the air, ground, sea, etc. The following are the currently authorized symbols for launch environments. These are not used for other aerospace vehicles. ;A: Air-launched. The missile is launched from an airborne vehicle. Example is the AIM-9 Sidewinder dogfighting missile. ;B: Multiple. The missile can be launched from various environments. The BGM-109 Tomahawk, for instance, can launch from a ground unit, aircraft, or ship-mounted launcher. ;C: Coffin. Stored in an unhardened horizontal container (less than 45 degree angle) at ground level and either launched horizontally or raised vertical for launch. Coffin launchers may be either on land or at sea. For an example, see the early versions of the Atlas ICBM. ;F: Individual. The missile is launched by an individual soldier in the field, otherwise referred to as man-portable. Example is the FIM-92 Stinger, a light man-portable surface-to-air missile (SAM). ;G: Ground. The missile is launched directly from the ground surface, including runways. ;H: Silo-Stored. The missile stored vertically in a silo but raised to ground level for launch. An example is the Atlas-F. ;L: Silo-Launched. The missile is launched from its storage silo, buried in the ground. ;M: Mobile. The missile is launched from a mobile ground vehicle. ;P: Pad. Like a traditional space rocket, the missile is stored and launched from an unprotected ground facility. ;R: Ship. The missile is launched from a ship or barge. ;S: Space. The missile is launched from a spacecraft. This is so far used only for the upper stage of another rocket like the SSB-8 Centaur. ;U: Underwater. The missile is launched from a submarine or underwater device.  Rocket/missile mission symbol  Rockets and missiles are assigned a single mission symbol, which usually denotes the intended target type of the missile. For most types of missile, the combination of launch environment and mission symbols form a from-to combination (surface-to-air, ship-to-submarine) that gives one a good idea of the potential uses for the missile. ;C: Transport. Applies to vehicles designed to carry cargo and deliver it to a location. This can also be used to designate a carrier for electronics or weapons systems. ;D: Decoy. Applies to vehicles that function as decoys for defeating enemy anti-aircraft and anti- missile defenses. ;E: Electronics. Applies to vehicles that carry out electronic missions such as communications or countermeasures. ;G: Ground. Applies to vehicles designed to attack surface targets, including vehicles. ;I: Intercept. Applies to vehicles designed to attack aerial targets, including both aircraft and missiles. ;L: Launch detection. Applies to vehicles designed to detect launch of missiles and track and identify enemy aircraft and missiles. This also applies to detection and monitoring of space launches and re-entry. ;M: Scientific. Applies to vehicles designed to collect scientific data. ;N: Navigation. Applies to navigational assistance designs. ;Q: Drone. Applies to a vehicle designed to be remotely controlled. ;S: Space support. Applies to vehicles designed to support space programs and activities. ;T: Training. Applies to training designs. ;U: Underwater. Applies to vehicles designed to attack submarines and underwater targets. ;W: Weather. Applies to vehicles designed to obtain weather data and collect aerial samples.  Vehicle type symbol  For rockets and missiles, the vehicle type symbol identifies the basic vehicle type and will be the final symbol in the mission part of the MDS. ;B: Booster. Boosters are primary or auxiliary propulsion units for other vehicles. ;M: Missile. Guided missiles are unmanned vehicles flying a path controlled by a guidance system. ;N: Probe. Probes are non-orbital unmanned vehicles designed primarily to collect data within the aerospace environment. ;R: Rocket. Rockets are single-use unmanned vehicles without guidance after launch. ;S: Satellite. Satellites are space vehicles which orbit the earth. Exceptions * The F/A-18 Hornet uses an unofficial designation to highlight the fact that its multi-role capabilities were built in from the earliest stages (as opposed to a hypothetical AF-18: a fighter modified for the attack role), however other comparable aircraft, such as the F-16 and later F-15s do not seem to have even gained a modified mission A, instead remaining with their F designation. This is the case even with the F-15E Strike Eagle, an F-15 variant used primarily in the attack role. It should also be noted that the system specifically forbids the use of slashes and other characters, and the Hornet is referred to in official documentation as the FA-18, which implies an attack aircraft modified for the fighter role. The F-22 Raptor was designated \\"F/A-22\\" for two years from 2003-2005 before being redesignated F-22 immediately before being transitioned to active service status. A strike version of the F-22 was mooted with the designation FB-22.RS21848, \\"Air Force FB-22 Bomber Concept\\". CRS, 5 June 2006. Retrieved: 25 July 2009. * The F-117 Nighthawk has no practical air-to-air capability because several treaties the U.S. signed place restrictions on the addition of new bombers into its military inventory. * Although the mission letters of the AV-8 Harrier's designation are correct, the series number is not. The Ryan XV-8 (\\"Fleep\\") had already existed, so the V designation should have been AV-14. * The original designation of the SR-71 Blackbird, RS-71 was specifically allowed for in the original system, standing for Reconnaissance and Surveillance - or, it is sometimes said, Reconnaissance and Strike. USAF Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay simply liked the sound of SR-71 better that RS-71, and had the speech changed. The SR was explained as Strategic Reconnaissance. * The Boeing 747 has three different designations in U.S. service - E-4, (V)C-25 and AL-1 - something which violates the basic purpose of the system. * The CC-130J Hercules referred to the stretched C-130J-30 Hercules. The -30 suffix was not supportable in the system, so a modified mission letter had to be added. Hence, the CC-130J is a cargo aircraft \\"modified\\" for the cargo role. This was later dropped. The CC-130J should not be confused with the CC-130 Hercules operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force. The first \\"C\\" identifies the aircraft as a Canadian asset. Canada later acquired C-130Js as CC-130Js. * Many manufacturers have used non-standard modifiers for commercial purposes; for instance, the Spanish F/A-18 Hornets were 'designated' EF-18 by McDonnell Douglas (the E standing for \\"Espa√±a\\"), and AH-64D Apache helicopters were designated WAH-64 by licensed manufacturer Westland. Non-standard series letters, especially ones the U.S. Air Force has no intention of progressing to, are often used to designate the intended country of use, such as I (Israel - e.g. F-15I), J (Japan), K (South Korea or United Kingdom), S (Saudi Arabia) and SG (Singapore).

The chapel building, completed in 1754, is one of the finest designs of the noted colonial architect Peter Harrison, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for its architectural significance. Despite its name, the adjacent King's Chapel Burying Ground is not affiliated with the chapel or any other church; it pre- dates the present church by over a century. History The King's Chapel congregation was founded by Royal Governor Sir Edmund Andros in 1686 as the first Anglican Church in colonial New England during the reign of King James II. The original King's Chapel was a wooden church built in 1688 at the corner of Tremont and School Streets, where the church stands today. It was situated on the public burying ground, now King's Chapel Burying Ground, because no resident would sell land for a church that was not Congregationalist (at the time, the Congregational church was the official religion of Massachusetts). 1688 King's Chapel building (demolished) In 1749, construction began on the current stone structure, which was designed by Peter Harrison and completed in 1754. The stone church was built around the wooden church. When the stone church was complete, the wooden church was disassembled and removed through the windows of the new church. The wood was then shipped to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, where it was used to construct St. John's Anglican Church. That church was destroyed by fire on Halloween night, 2001. It has since been rebuilt. Originally, there were plans to add a steeple, although funding shortfalls prevented this from happening. Original King's Chapel after reconstruction as the St. John's Anglican Church in Nova Scotia (1754) During the American Revolution, the chapel sat vacant and was referred to as the \\"Stone Chapel\\". The Loyalist families left for Nova Scotia and England, and those who remained reopened the church in 1782. It became Unitarian under the ministry of James Freeman, who revised the Book of Common Prayer along Unitarian lines in 1785. Although Freeman still considered King's Chapel to be Episcopalian, the Episcopal Church refused to ordain him. The church still follows its own Anglican/Unitarian hybrid liturgy today. It is a member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Association. Tremont Street, c. 1843, with view of King's Chapel. Painting by Philip Harry (courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) Inside, the church is characterized by wooden columns with Corinthian capitals that were hand-carved by William Burbeck and his apprentices in 1758. Seating is accommodated by box pews, most of which were originally owned by the member families who paid pew rent and decorated the pews to their personal tastes. The coveted Pew No. 30 is the Governor's Pew (reserved for Jonathan Belcher, the Royal Governor) was, on October 27, 1789, occupied by George Washington. Belcher's son, Jonathan Jr., was wed in the chapel in 1756. The current uniform appearance of the pews dates from the 1920s. Music has long been an important part of King's Chapel, which acquired its first organ in 1713, bequeathed to the congregation by Puritan minister Thomas Brattle. The present organ, the sixth installed in King's Chapel, was built by C.B. Fisk in 1964. It is decorated with miters and carvings from the Bridge organ of 1756, and it is slightly below average in size compared with most mid-1900s European chapel organs.Cohen, Paul M. Survey of Smaller mid-1900s European Chapel Pipe Organs: And The Small-Footed People who Play Them. 2nd edition. London: Palgrave, 1998. For forty-two years, the eminent American composer Daniel Pinkham was the organist and music director at King's Chapel. He was succeeded by Heinrich Christensen. The King's Chapel bell, cast in England, was hung in 1772. In 1814 it cracked, was recast by Paul Revere and Sons, and was rehung. It is the largest bell cast by the Revere foundry, and the last one cast during Paul Revere's lifetime. It has been rung at services ever since. Within King's Chapel is a monument to Samuel Vassall, brother of the colonist William Vassall, a patentee of the Massachusetts Bay Company, and an early deputy of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Samuel Vassall of London was also named a member of the Company in its 1629 Royal Charter but never sailed for New England, instead remaining in London to tend to business affairs; his brother William frequently clashed with John Winthrop, and eventually removed himself to Scituate, Massachusetts.Apparently even Scituate wasn't far enough away from Winthrop and the Massachusetts authorities to suit Vassall, who departed Scituate after a decade for Barbados, where he died. The monument to Vassall, London merchant, mentions his resistance to King Charles's taxes imposed on Tonnage and Poundage, especially as Parliament had refused the King's request for a lifetime extension. Vassall subsequently represented the City of London as a Member of Parliament (1640‚Äì1641), which restored some of Vassall's estate. Later Vassalls in Massachusetts, including William Vassall for whom Vassalboro, Maine was named, were Loyalists and fled to England during the American Revolutionary War.Annals of King's Chapel from the Puritan Age of New England to the Present Day, Vol. I, Henry Wilder Foote, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1900 Ministers * Robert Ratcliff, rector 1686‚Äì1689Foote.

Beginning her career as an activist in the Women's Social and Political Union, Marsden eventually broke off from the suffragist organization in order to found a journal that would provide a space for more radical voices in the movement. Her prime importance lies with her contributions to the suffrage movement, her criticism of the Pankhursts' WSPU, and her radical feminism, via The Freewoman. There are those who also claim she has relevance to the emergence of literary modernism, while others value her contribution to the understanding of Egoism.  Early life  Dora Marsden was born on 5 March 1882 to working-class parents, Fred and Hannah, in Marsden, Yorkshire. Economic setbacks in Fred's business forced him to emigrate to the U.S. in 1890, settling in Philadelphia with his eldest son. Hannah worked as a seamstress to support her remaining children, which left the family living in poverty when Marsden was a child.\\"Dora Marsden\\". Spartacus Education. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 February 2013. Among one of the first generations to benefit from the Elementary Education Act of 1870, Marsden was able to attend school as a child despite her impoverished circumstances.Clarke, Bruce. \\"Dora Marsden and Ezra Pound: \\"The New Freewoman\\" and \\"The Serious Artist\\".\\" University of Wisconsin Press 33.1 (1992): 91‚Äì112. Web. 24 February 2013. She proved a successful student, working as a tutor at the age of thirteen before receiving a Queen's Scholarship at the age of eighteen, which enabled her to attend Owens College in Manchester (later the Victoria University of Manchester). In 1903, Marsden graduated from college and taught school for several years, eventually becoming headmistress of the Altrincham Teacher-Pupil Center in 1908. During her time at Owens College, Marsden made the acquaintance of Christabel Pankhurst, Teresa Billington-Greig, and other prominent early feminists, and she became involved with the women's suffrage movement then gathering steam in Manchester. Marsden established a reputation with the militant wing of the movement for fierce devotion to the cause, leading one contemporary to call her \\"a brave and beautiful spirit,\\" a phrase to which the title of Les Garner's biography of Marsden refers. This devotion extended to extra-legal acts of sabotage on more than one occasion. The arrest of Miss Dora Marsden, 30th march 1909 In October 1909, Marsden was arrested with several other members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) for dressing in full academic regalia and interrupting a speech by the chancellor of their alma mater, demanding that he speak out against the force-feeding of imprisoned suffragist alumni who were on hunger strike. A few months later, she broke into the Southport Empire Theatre and hoisted herself into the cupola, where she waited 15 hours in order to heckle Winston Churchill, who was soon to become Home Secretary, while he was speaking at an election rally. Marsden was arrested with a deputation to Parliament which was widely reported at the time. Marsden's commitment to the cause earned her an administrative position in Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst‚Äôs WSPU, for which she left her teaching position in 1909.Franklin, Cary (2002): Marketing edwardian feminism: Dora Marsden, votes for women and the freewoman, Women's History Review, 11:4, 631‚Äì642. Although she was dedicated to the early feminist movement, Marsden's strong theoretical principles and independent disposition often brought her into conflict with WSPU leadership, who found her unmanageable. In 1911, Marsden mutually agreed with the Pankhursts to resign her position with the WSPU. Disaffected by the organization, but still committed to the women's movement, she was determined to find ways to support alternative voices relevant to the cause. Work as editor Marsden was not the only English suffragette to balk at the rigid hierarchy of the WSPU under the Pankhursts, and she decided to begin publishing a journal, The Freewoman, that would showcase a wide range of dissenting voices from the women's movement initially, and eventually from other radical movements as well. This was the first of three successive journals that Marsden would start between 1911 and 1918, with the publication dates of each magazine running as follows: The Freewoman, November 1911 ‚Äì October 1912; The New Freewoman, June 1913 ‚Äì December 1913; The Egoist, January 1914 ‚Äì December 1919. With continuous publication between the second and third, and only a short break between the first and second, critics have had difficulty deciding to what extent the journals should be considered part of the same intellectual project. Consensus seems to rest on the sense that the journals reflect Marsden's shifting political and aesthetic interests, so that the three journals are closely related, but not identical projects, with The New Freewoman closer in spirit to The Egoist than either was to the original journal. In 1911, Marsden was becoming increasingly interested in egoism and individualist anarchism, an intellectual shift whose development is plainly visible in her editorial columns, where, as the issues progress, the scope of discussion widens to include a wide range of topics pertinent to anarchist theoreticians of the time. Many anarchist thinkers of the time were drawn to emergent avant-garde movements that would later be brought together under the term \\"modernism,\\" and Marsden was no exception. While literary reviews and write-ups of cultural events occasionally occurred in The Freewoman, by 1913 Marsden's journals were actively publishing and publicizing new literary material. The later two magazines would serially publish James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Wyndham Lewis's Tarr, several early versions of episodes from Joyce's Ulysses, and an array of important early works by, among others, Ezra Pound, H.D., William Carlos Williams, Richard Aldington, Amy Lowell, D. H. Lawrence, and T. S. Eliot. The Freewoman The Freewoman was short-lived magazine that Marsden founded in order to voice her thoughts and critiques of the WSPU under Pankhurst. She argued that the organization was far too narrowly focused on middle class women. The journal also explored London's literary background and provided a medium for cultural debate among feminists and other opinionated groups.Storch, Margret. \\"Dora Marsden & Early Modernism.\\" Project Muse 41.1 (1998): 91‚Äì94. Web. 23 February 2013. This journal was famous for its overtly feminist advertisements that were scattered throughout the pages. At the beginning of publications it had advertisements that were for businesses such as patent agencies that were geared towards \\"Women Patentees\\", a bank that took care of the \\"Going Stock Business\\", and the International Suffrage Shop. The magazine dealt with controversial issues such as marriage and free love, with Marsden and other authors writing in support of the latter. Marsden held that monogamy had four corner stones: men's hypocrisy; the spinster's dumb resignation; the Prostitute's unsightly degradation; and the married woman's monopoly. Writers such as Rebecca West wrote that by giving her body to a man to be owned by him for the rest of their life, while binding the man to support her for the rest of her life, a woman strikes a disgraceful ‚Äòbargain‚Äô. This magazine also issued a five-part series on morality written by Marsden. She explored the idea that women had been taught to restrain their passions for life, resulting in an existence only used for reproduction. This brought her back to her critique of the Suffrage Movement, and their image of purity and the middle class woman. After its financial collapse, it soon emerged into the New Freewoman. The New Freewoman The New Freewoman shifted the view of The Freewoman, which was a radical feminist view, to an idealistic anarchism and literary experimentalism. The bold advertisements were changed to text only adds, and the magazine took on a much different approach. This developed into Marsden's view on egoism as a philosophy, which was heavily influenced by Ezra Pound.Clarke, Bruce. Dora Marsden and Early Moderism. Michigan: University of Michigan Press, 1996. Web. 28 February 2013. These two journals became heavily influenced by Rebecca West and Mary Gawthorpe. The two women set out to increase the audience of The New Freewoman, by increasing their literary content. This would result in more writers expressing interest in the journal, and resulting in more readers. Although The New Freewoman did not last very long itself, it progressed into a very popular journal The Egoist.Difference in View: Women and Modernism. N.p.: Taylor & Francis, 2005. Web. 25 February 2013. The Egoist The Egoist was partially inspired by the nineteenth- century philosophical egoist Max Stirner. Though many assume the magazine's new title was suggested by Ezra Pound, it was actually Marsden's invention seconded by Pound in print. Pound's early association with Marsden and The Egoist encouraged Pound's nascent interest in the relationship between poetry and politics. The term \\"egoist\\" was in circulation at the time, associated with writers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Maurice Barr√®s. When Stirner's book The Ego and its Own was published, Marsden never fully reviewed it. She did, however, praise Stirner's work and wrote at least two editorials following Stirner's ideas. In the September 1913 issue of The New Freewoman, Marsden proclaimed Stirner's book \\"the most powerful work that has ever emerged from a single human mind.\\" Later, however, she later partly dismissed it, mostly on the ground that she disagreed with Stirner about the nature of God: Stirner saw God as a repressive idea, imposed from the outside, from society, so it could control the individual. Alternatively, Marsden claimed that god was an invention of the self in its attempt to encompass the world and rule over it, hence, a positive, freeing idea. Marsden's philosophical legacy In 1920 Marsden withdrew from the literary and political scene and spent fifteen years in seclusion, completing a \\"magnum opus\\" drawing from philosophy, mathematics, physics, biology and theology. It was eventually published by Harriet Shaw Weaver in two volumes as The Definition of the Godhead in 1928 and Mysteries of Christianity in 1930. This large body of work produced by Marsden was not well received (not even by her former supporters) and she suffered a psychological breakdown in 1930, which was further deepened by the death of her mother in 1935. It is said that her moods fluctuated between very optimistic or pessimistic views of her work and that she developed delusional beliefs. In 1935 Marsden was admitted to the Crichton Royal Hospital located in Dumfries where she lived for the rest of her life. The hospital classified her as severely depressed. Marsden died of a heart attack in 1960.

The parish is on the Wiltshire-West Berkshire border, and the village lies on the A4 national route about 3 miles (4.8 km) west of Hungerford and 7.5 miles (12 km) east of Marlborough. Froxfield village is on a stream that is a tributary of the River Dun. The road between London and Bristol follows the valley of the stream and passes through the village, having followed this course since at least the 13th century.Crowley, 1999, pages 149‚Äì165 Since the 1920s it has been classified as the A4 road. The Kennet and Avon Canal follows the Dun valley through Froxfield parish, passing within of the village. The canal has a series of locks in the parish, from Oakhill Down Lock to Froxfield Bottom Lock. The Reading to Taunton railway line also follows the river through the parish below the village. Archaeology There used to be three bowl barrows in the south-west part of the parish, close to the boundary with Chisbury parish. These suggest human occupation in the area some time in the Neolithic or Bronze Age. In 1725 the remains of a Roman villa were found at Rudge Coppice about north-west of the village.Pevsner & Cherry, 1975, page 252 Remains excavated on the site include a Roman mosaic floor depicting the figure of a man, coins, human burials, a stone statuette of Attis and a champlev√©-enamelled bronze bowl known as the Rudge Cup, that appears to depict Hadrian's Wall.  History  The Kennet and Avon Canal was opened through Froxfield parish in 1799, and the Berks and Hants Extension Railway took the same route, immediately north of the canal, in 1862. The nearest station was some southwest of Froxfield village, at Great Bedwyn. The canal was restored in the 1970s; the railway and station are still in use. The population of Froxfield parish peaked at 625 at the 1841 census, owing to stagecoach activity along the Bath road; numbers declined steadily as traffic took to the railways. Between 1951 and 1981 the population was below 300, then increased after housebuilding during the 1980s. RAF Ramsbury, used by the United States Army Air Forces between 1942 and 1946, extended into the extreme north of the parish. Manor Between AD 801 and 805 one Byrhtelm granted land at Froxfield to Ealhmund, Bishop of Winchester. There is no further record of Froxfield's manorial tenure from then until the 13th century. The Domesday Book of 1086 does not mention Froxfield, and may therefore have included the manor as part of another landholding. Froxfield reappears in the historical record in 1242‚Äì43, when Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon was its feudal overlord. In 1275 the overlord was Baldwin's heir Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon, but there is no evidence of Froxfield passing to her heirs. John de Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham was overlord in 1389, but there is no record of Froxfield's overlordship thereafter. Manorial tenants of Froxfield included Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke (died 1245) and John Droxford, who was Bishop of Bath and Wells 1309‚Äì1329. In 1390 Sir William Sturmy gave the manor to Easton Priory, which then held Froxfield until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1536 the Crown granted the manor to Sir Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, who in 1547 made himself Duke of Somerset. After the death of John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset in 1675, his widow Sarah Seymour, Duchess of Somerset married Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine. However, when she died in 1694 she left most of Froxfield Manor as an endowment to found the Broad Town charity and Duchess of Somerset's Hospital almshouses (see below). The hospital sold most of its lands in the parish in 1920‚Äì22. In 1922 Sir Ernest Wills, 3rd Baronet, part-owner of the W.D. & H.O. Wills tobacco company, bought Froxfield Manor Farm, before purchasing the adjacent Elizabethan country house, Littlecote House, in 1929. In 1965 William Geoffrey Rootes, 2nd Baron Rootes bought some other parts of the manor lands and added them to his estate of North Standen and Oakhill. In 1995 Wills's grandson Sir Seton Wills, 5th Baronet still held part of the original estate north of London Road. Church and chapel The Church of England parish church of All Saints is from the 12th century and is built of flint and sarsen. The chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century with Early English Gothic lancet windows. In the 14th new windows were inserted in the nave and a new north door was added. The Perpendicular Gothic west window is 15th century, as is the partly timber- framed porch. In 1891‚Äì92 All Saints' was restored under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect Ewan Christian. His alterations included replacing the bell-turret with a more elaborate one, replacing a plain south window in the nave with an elaborate one in 15th-century style and replacing the vestry with a larger vestry and organ chamber in the style of a north transept. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1966. Today it is part of the Whitton Team, a group of six churches. A Methodist congregation was established in Froxfield by 1834, when two houses in the village were licensed for Wesleyan Methodist worship. A small red-brick Primitive Methodist chapel was built on Brewhouse Hill in 1909; it closed for worship in about 1962. Somerset charities Dedication plaque When Sarah Seymour, Duchess of Somerset (see above) died in 1694, her will of 1686 created two charities. The Broad Town charity was to help young men with their education or to enter apprenticeships. It is now the Broad Town Trust, and since 1990 it has been open to young women applicants as well as young men.Broad Town Trust The Duchess also willed that almshouses and a chapel be built at Froxfield for 30 widows from Berkshire, Somerset, Wiltshire, London and Westminster, of whom half were to be widows of clergy. She willed that the Rector of Huish was to either serve as chaplain or provide another clergyman to do so; in practice the parish priest of Froxfield has usually served the Hospital in his place. The Duchess left the estate of Froxfield Manor as an endowment to the almshouses, called the Duchess of Somerset's Hospital.Duchess of Somerset's Hospital One of the trustees of the Duchess's will was her brother-in-law, Sir Samuel Grimston, 3rd Baronet, who refused to convey the prescribed lands and income to the Hospital until he was ordered to do so by the Court of Chancery. The Somerset Hospital The original almshouses are built of brick around a quadrangle, with the chapel in the centre. In 1772‚Äì75 one range of seven almshouses was demolished and the Hospital was enlarged to a length of 37 bays. This enabled it to accommodate 50 widows and eligibility was extended from its original geographical catchment area to include widows from anywhere in England within 150 miles of London. In 1813 or 1814 Charles Brudenell- Bruce, 1st Marquess of Ailesbury paid for the original chapel to be demolished and replaced by a new, presumably larger one built in its place, designed by the architect Thomas Baldwin of Bath. A new gateway to the Hospital was added at the same time. The gateway and chapel are of ashlar masonry in a Georgian Gothick style. The gatehouse The Hospital's investment income began to decline and from 1851 it made successive reductions to the resident widows' pensions. From 1882 it started to leave vacant almshouses unoccupied to save money and in 1892 parishes in London and Westminster complained that they were not being given their allocation of places at the Hospital. In 1897 the Charity Commission found the Hospital was housing only 16 widows, and by 1921 this number had fallen to 13. In 1920‚Äì22 the Hospital sold its lands and increased its income by investing the capital. By 1922 it had increased its residents to 25 and increased their pensions. In 1963 the chapel was restored. In 1966 the Hospital broadened eligibility to any poor woman over 55. Gifts from other charities, public bodies and private donations were invested in maintaining and improving the almshouses. By 1995 it provided 45 houses and four flats for widows and one house reserved for guests. The dwellings and gatehouse were designated as Grade II* listed in 1966, as was the chapel. School In the early part of the 19th century, most children from Froxfield who attended school did so in Little Bedwyn, Hungerford or Great Bedwyn. By 1871 a school had opened in Froxfield, but in 1884 it served only as an infants' school for children under six. It was rebuilt in 1885 to accommodate older children but was closed in 1907. A new school was built near the parish church and opened in 1910, taking children of all ages from five upwards, until 1948 when those over 11 were transferred to Marlborough Secondary Modern School. Falling pupil numbers led to closure of the school in 1963. Amenities The village has a public house, the Pelican Inn; the 18th-century building to the east of the village was originally a terrace of three cottages.

Apart from the 1860 publication of his book Poems, which included approximately two-fifths of his lifetime sonnet output and other poetic works in a variety of forms, the remainder of his poetry was published posthumously in the 20th century. Attempts by several 20th century scholars and critics to spark wider interest in his life and works have met with some success and Tuckerman is now included in several important anthologies of American poetry. Though his works appear in 19th century anthologies of American poetry and sonnets, this reclusive contemporary of Emily Dickinson, sometime correspondent of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and acquaintance of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, remains in relative obscurity. Early life Frederick Goddard Tuckerman was born on February 4, 1821 in Boston, Massachusetts to Edward Francis Tuckerman (1775‚Äì1843) and Sophia May (1784‚Äì1870), a prosperous and distinguished Boston family. His siblings included: Hannah Parkman Tuckerman (1805‚Äì1859), Edward Tuckerman (1817‚Äì1886), the botanist, Samuel Parkman Tuckerman (1819‚Äì1890), the composer, and Sophie Mary Tuckerman (1823‚Äì1874). His first cousin was Henry Theodore Tuckerman (1813‚Äì1871), an American writer, essayist and critic. He entered Harvard University in 1841, but did not remain long, due to an eye problem, as recalled in a family genealogy, privately printed in 1917 by a relative, Bayard Tuckerman. After Harvard, he entered the law school, graduating in 1842, and was admitted to the Suffolk Bar, reading with Edward D. Sohier (1810‚Äì1888). He later abandoned the practice of law, saying that it was distasteful. He then devoted himself to the pursuit of his favorite studies, literature, botany and astronomy. In 1847, he moved to Greenfield, in western Massachusetts due to his love of nature and began a living a life of relative seclusion and retirement, which was considered strange one for a man in his middle twenties. Career While Tuckerman preferred isolation, he traveled abroad, meeting at least one famous poet, and communicated with several other American writers of note. According to N. Scott Momaday, \\"In 1851, and again in 1854, Tuckerman journeyed abroad. On the first of these excursions he met Alfred, Lord Tennyson; on the second he was Tennyson's guest at Farringford. The friendship between the two men appears to have been fast and of long standing. We do not know what Tennyson thought of Tuckerman's poetry. On the second visit with Tennyson, the poet laureate gave him the original manuscript of Locksley Hall. Tuckerman published Poems in 1860; it was his only poetry collection published in his lifetime.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 48. \\"The American writers to whom Tuckerman sent complimentary copies of the 1860 Poems are an impressive lot. The list of recipients includes the names of Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Bryant, and Jones Very.\\" The responses he received were polite and favorable. They generally distinguished \\"the intrinsic merit of Tuckerman's work and 'external success'\\", the likelihood of it meeting popular success \\"with the world\\". \\"The printing of Tuckerman's volume of poems in 1860 was the high point of his public career. When he had made his claim on the attention of the most respected literary men of his day, he returned to his seclusion. He continued to write, indeed, the best of his work was yet to come, but he never again exposed himself to the world.\\" Poetry Momaday offers a general estimation of the poet and the poetry: \\"Tuckerman was a man who made herbariums. He had an eye for the minutest aspects of the world. When he wished to focus upon the veins of a leaf, or to find a metaphor for the appearance of an evergreen spine, he could do so with extraordinary skill. His poems are remarkable, point-blank descriptions of nature; they are filled with small, precise, and whole things: purring bees and vervain spikes, shives and amaryllis, wind flowers and stramony. But Tuckerman has more to recommend him than an eye and a nomenclature. His sensibilities are refined; his sensitivity is acute. His experience is pervaded by an always apparent sense of grief. He knows well the side of Man that is most vulnerable to pain, and he treats of it throughout his work with respect and compassion, often with great power and beauty. But he was also a poet of the nineteenth century, and one who admired Tennyson above others. There is a good deal of bad writing in Tuckerman, and there are many obscurities... [the faults] occur for the most part in the longer poems, especially those of narrative character. Often they are marred by a tediousness of expression and an overwrought consistency of mood.\\" Edmund Wilson comments on the issue of Tuckerman's obscurity: \\"One of the queerest features of Tuckerman's work is his habit of alluding, not merely to characters from Biblical or classical antiquity so obscure that one cannot believe they are real till one finds them in a concordance or a classical dictionary, but also to personages who cannot be found because their names have been made up by the poet.\\" Wilson draws a comparison between Tuckerman and the work of Emily Dickinson and wonders at the missed intersection between the lives and work of these two reclusive, western Massachusetts poets, as well as with the correspondent and literary mentor of Dickinson, Thomas Wentworth Higginson: \\"Tuckerman's occasional obscurity, like that of Emily Dickinson, contributes to one's general impression of a soliloquy not quite overheard. It is interesting that Emily Dickinson should have known Frederick's brother Edward, who taught botany at Amherst College, and also Tuckerman's son and his son's wife. There is a good deal about the Tuckermans in Emily's letters; but‚Äîthough Greenfield is not far from Amherst ‚Äî there is no mention of Frederick Goddard. Did Emily know that the father of her friend, almost as much a recluse as herself, was writing remarkable poetry? Had Tuckerman ever been told that Emily Dickinson wrote? Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson‚Äîthough he and Tuckerman had been classmates at Harvard‚Äîhad no notion of Tuckerman's talent. Old Higginson was still alive when Tuckerman was rediscovered [see below], and in response to an inquiry by Witter Bynner, he explained that he remembered his contemporary 'as a refined and gentlemanly fellow, but I did not then know him as a poet'.\\" Romanticism Eugene England discusses Tuckerman's position as a Romantic poet and his work in relation to that of Ralph Waldo Emerson: \\"He is not merely a Romantic, nor yet exclusively an anti-Romantic; not just influenced by Emerson or simply reacting against Emerson's excesses... With the Romantics, Tuckerman yearned to be at home in the universe, to feel himself deeply related to its central reality, and he understood and participated in various efforts to bring that about‚Äîincluding the Emersonian temptation to assert a pantheism that would make everything divine and thus destroy all ethical distinctions and exalt simple merging, including the final merge of death. But Tuckerman also realized that alienation is part of the price we pay for our humanness, for conscious life and perceived feeling, that the void between the mind and the world remains, unless we destroy the mind in primitivism or death‚Äîor do away with the world in some form of subjectivism. Revival of interest In 1909, Walter Prichard Eaton, drama critic and essayist, wrote an article in Forum about Tuckerman and his poetry, after seeing two sonnets in an unpublished manuscript of an anthology of American poems written by Louis How. This article inspired Witter Bynner to enter into correspondence with one of the poet's grandchildren, thereby finding the manuscripts for the remaining sonnets. He published the results in 1931. N. Scott Momaday brought out the most complete edition available of Tuckerman's works in 1965, with a quirky (\\"Winters's heretical, obdurate foreword\\") Critical Foreword by Yvor Winters and a biographical/critical introduction by Momaday. Another writer cited by Momaday in his survey of the revival of interest in Tuckerman's poetry is Edmund Wilson, in his work Patriotic Gore. In that work, Wilson predicted a permanent revival of Tuckerman and his works after the publication of his most famous ode: \\"A further posthumous poem, The Cricket, was printed, in 1950, as a leaflet by the Cummington Press of Cummington, Massachusetts. So Tuckerman has emerged at last from the obscurity which the retirement of his life invited.\\" Wilson also provides an appreciative short summary of Tuckerman and his works, citing several poems in their entirety. The only recent critical work of significant length on Tuckerman and his work is Beyond Romanticism: Tuckerman's Life and Poetry (1991), by Eugene England. A selection of Tuckerman's poetry appears in Three American Poets (2003), edited by Jonathan Bean. His sonnets are sprinkled through several American poetry and sonnet anthologies. The Library of America's American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2 (1993) contains over 20 selections. The most recent selection is Selected Poems of Frederick Goddard Tuckerman (The John Harvard Library) (2010), edited by Ben Mazer. Personal life In 1847, coinciding with his move to Greenfield, he married Hannah Lucinda Jones (1827‚Äì1857), a dark- haired, gentle woman, whose disposition was well suited to his own. Ten years later, Hannah died, after the birth of her third child. It has been said that her death was the deepest hurt of Tuckerman's life and the \\"beginning of his final solitude.\\" *Infant Daughter (1848‚Äì1848) *Edward Tuckerman (1850‚Äì1871) *Anna Tuckerman (1853‚Äì1954) Tuckerman died May 9, 1873, in Greenfield.

The speech is sometimes known by that name. Background This was Churchill's first speechHansard debate, 13 May 1940 \\"HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT\\" on 13 May 1940 to the House of Commons after having been offered the King's commission the previous Friday, to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the first year of World War II. Churchill had replaced Neville Chamberlain on 10 May, and in this speech he asked the House to declare its confidence in his Government. The motion passed unanimously. This was the first of three speeches which he gave during the period of the Battle of France, which commenced with the German invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May. History Churchill had used similar phrases earlier, such as \\"Their sweat, their tears, their blood\\" in 1931,Bohle, Bruce. Quoted in and \\"new structures of national life erected upon blood, sweat, and tears\\". Churchill's sentence, \\"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat,\\" has been called a paraphrase of one uttered on 2 July 1849 by Giuseppe Garibaldi when rallying his revolutionary forces in Rome: \\"I offer hunger, thirst, forced marches, battle, and death.\\" As a young man, Churchill had considered writing a biography of Garibaldi.John Lukacs. 2008. Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat: The Dire Warning: Churchill's First Speech as Prime Minister. New York: Basic Books, p. 47. \\"Offro fame, sete, marce forzate, battaglie e morte.\\" Garibaldi's line has appeared in other versions. The circumstances under which Garibaldi made that speech‚Äîwith the revolutionary Roman Republic being overwhelmed and Garibaldi needing to maintain the morale of his troops towards a highly hazardous retreat through the Apennine mountains‚Äîwas in some ways comparable to Britain's situation with France being overwhelmed by the German offensive. Theodore Roosevelt uttered a phrase similar to Churchill's in an address to the United States Naval War College on 2 June 1897, following his appointment as federal Assistant Secretary of the Navy: \\"Every man among us is more fit to meet the duties and responsibilities of citizenship because of the perils over which, in the past, the nation has triumphed; because of the blood and sweat and tears, the labor and the anguish, through which, in the days that have gone, our forefathers moved on to triumph.\\"James A. Billington. 2010. Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations Courier Dover Publications, p. 6. Churchill's line has been called a \\"direct quotation\\" from Roosevelt's speech.Walker, Martin. 2000. Makers of the American Century. London: Chatto and Windus, p. 6 Churchill, a man with an American mother and a keen soldier, was likely to have read works by Theodore Roosevelt, who was a widely published military historian; it is also possible he read the speech after being appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, a position similar to Roosevelt's. Other versions of the phrase are \\"It [poetry] is forged slowly and painfully, link by link, with blood and sweat and tears\\" (Lord Alfred Douglas, 1919), \\"Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions\\" (Lord Byron, 1823), and \\"...mollifie/ It with thy teares, or sweat, or blood\\" (John Donne, 1611). In Latin, Cicero and Livy had used the phrase \\"sweat and blood\\".  Excerpts  > We are in the preliminary stage of one of the greatest battles in > history.... That we are in action at many points‚Äîin Norway and in Holland‚Äî, > that we have to be prepared in the Mediterranean. That the air battle is > continuous, and that many preparations have to be made here at home. I would > say to the House as I said to those who have joined this government: \\"I have > nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat\\". We have before us an > ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months > of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is > to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the > strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, > never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is > our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory. > Victory at all costs‚ÄîVictory in spite of all terror‚ÄîVictory, however long > and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival. (Text as given in Hansard)  Reaction  Churchill had not been the preferred choice of most Conservatives to succeed Chamberlain, but the motion on 13 May \\"That this House welcomes the formation of a Government representing the united and inflexible resolve of the nation to prosecute the war with Germany to a victorious conclusion\\" passed unanimously. He had been unpopular in many circles since the 1930s and MPs had ignored or heckled his speeches denouncing the prime minister's appeasement policy toward Germany; even others who opposed Chamberlain avoided him. One historian has described the speech's effect on Parliament, however, as \\"electrifying ... He was still speaking at the House of Commons, but it was now listening, and cheering.\\" (However, Churchill himself subsequently held that many Conservative MPs had still regarded him with reserve and it was not until his speech of 4 July 1940 announcing British action against the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir that he could feel he had the full support of the whole House) Other great speeches followed, including the \\"We shall fight on the beaches\\" speech of 4 June and the \\"This was their finest hour\\" speech of 18 June, and were a great inspiration and unifying force to Britain after its defeats in the first year of the war.  Legacy  On 26 April 2013, the Bank of England announced that beneath a portrait of Churchill the phrase \\"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.\\" was to adorn the new 5-pound note.

The congregation, currently standing at approximately 4,000 households, was founded in 1733.American Antiquarian Society - A South East View of Boston - Landmark 52 Five services are offered each Sunday, and weekday services are offered three times a week from September through June. Within the spectrum of worship styles in the Anglican tradition, Trinity Church has historically been considered a Broad Church parish. In addition to worship, the parish is actively involved in service to the community, pastoral care, programs for children and teenagers, and Christian education for all ages. The church is home to several high-level choirs, including the Trinity Choir, Trinity Schola, Trinity Choristers, and Trinity Chamber Choir. The building is currently under study for becoming a Boston Landmark.https://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/PETSTATS_June2016_tcm3-53570.pdf History Interior panorama After its former site on Summer Street burned in the Great Boston Fire of 1872, the current church complex was erected under the direction of Rector Phillips Brooks (1835‚Äì1893), one of the best-known and most charismatic preachers of his time. The church and parish house were designed by Henry Hobson Richardson and construction took place from 1872 to 1877, when the complex was consecrated. Situated on Copley Square in Back Bay, Trinity Church is the building that established Richardson's reputation. It is the birthplace and archetype of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, characterized by a clay roof, polychromy, rough stone, heavy arches, and a massive tower. This style was soon adopted for a number of public buildings across the United States. The stone used was Dedham Granite. According to L.C. Norton, the inventor of door checks, the heavy main entrance doors of Trinity Church were the first to be fitted with a quiet and effective means to resist slamming.http://idighardware.com/2011/08/how-i-discovered-door-checks- part-1-by-l-c-norton/ This led to a patented pneumatic door check that was seen throughout the 1880s to 1910s. Norton's door check device would eventually evolve into the modern door closer with his guidance in both the Norton Door Controls and LCN companies.http://idighardware.com/2012/01/how-i- discovered-door-checks-part-3-by-l-c-norton/ Music Choirs The sanctuary at Trinity Church. Each December, the choirs of Trinity offer three iterations of a service of Candlelight Carols. These are a \\"Boston tradition\\", and very popular events, drawing nearly 5,000 attendees from as far away as Maine. A traditional scene in Copley Square in December is that of a long line of people waiting to enter the church for the free event. The service is based on the Nine Lessons and Carols model developed at King's College, Cambridge. In addition to their primary function of supporting worship, the choirs of Trinity Church are fixtures in the rich musical landscape of Boston. The Trinity Choir has toured extensively, and can be heard on several critically acclaimed recordings. The Trinity Choristers are a group of children who learn music and sing in the tradition of the Royal School of Church Music. The current Director of Music and Organist is Richard Webster. The Trinity Choir and Trinity Choristers tour England every three years, serving as choirs-in- residence at major houses of worship such as Ely Cathedral, Chichester Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey (summer 2016). Organs Gallery-Organ by Hilborne L. Roosevelt *1876: The original organ at Trinity was built by Hilborne L. Roosevelt in 1876, his Opus 29. It had mechanical action, assisted by Barker levers on all divisions and an electrically controlled Echo division, but its location in the chancel proved unsatisfactory, and the organ was moved to the gallery. *1903: Hutchings-Votey built a new instrument for the chancel and made both organs playable from a single console. *1924: Ernest M. Skinner undertook a rebuilding project, Opus 479, involving changes to both the Roosevelt and Hutchings-Votey instruments, but by 1926 it had expanded to Opus 573 as a virtually new organ in the gallery, as well as a new chancel console. *1956: Aeolian-Skinner provided a new console in 1956 and, in 1960, installed a new chancel organ. *1962: The gallery organ was extensively rebuilt, and major tonal modifications were made by Jason McKown, who maintained the organs for many years. *1987: Jack Steinkampf' installed a rank of horizontal trumpet pipes under the west gallery window. This festival trumpet is given in memory of Paul Albert Merrill. *Late 1990s: In conjunction with the parish's building campaign, a plan was set out with Foley-Baker, Inc., for the cleaning and refurbishment of both organs and their joint console. *Late 2010s: Since 2012, the Church has slowly acquired a stockpile of Skinner and Aeolian-Skinner pipes from the general period of Trinity‚Äôs organ. The pipes were installed and the organ reworked in an attempt to recapture the original Skinner sound. This work was a collaboration of Trinity‚Äôs former and current organ curators: Foley-Baker Inc., of Tolland, Connecticut (who renovated the nave organ in 1999-2001, and the chancel organ in 2007), and Jonathan Ambrosino, who also maintains the organs at Old South Church and Church of the Advent. In 2018 a new four-manual organ console was built by Richard Houghten of Milan, Michigan, and J. Zamberlan & Co., in Wintersville, Ohio. The nave and chancel organs feature 121 stops, 113 ranks, and 6898 pipes. Worship Trinity Church offers five services on Sundays, including a now rarely heard modified version of Rite I Morning Prayer including a sermon and extra anthem, as well as a service of sung Compline in the late evening. Weekday services include Wednesday Evensong and Thursday Holy Eucharist with Prayers for Healing. Trinity has played host to many special services over the years, due mainly to its central location in Boston, large seating capacity, and reputation as a parish willing to open its doors and be \\"Boston's church.\\" These services have included interfaith (Christian, Jewish, Muslim) services immediately following the 9/11 attacks, a similar service following the July 2005 London bombings, and many prominent funerals, consecrations of bishops, and the like. Community Service The parish supports many forms of community outreach and social justice ministry. These include partnerships with Rosie's Place, the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, Pine Street Inn, Habitat for Humanity, Community Servings, the Walk for Hunger, the Rodman Ride for Kids, and others. The Trinity Boston Foundation is a nonprofit organization with a mission to support the social and emotional well-being and development of young people. Formed in 2007, it grew out of several of Trinity Church's outreach ministries, and now functions as a separately incorporated subsidiary organization that directly serves approximately 500 young people in the Boston community. The Trinity Boston Foundation's programs honor and respect people of all faith traditions, including those with no faith tradition.http://www.trinityinspires.org/about- us/ Rectors In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Rector is the priest elected to head a self-supporting parish. Because of the importance of Trinity Church in the life of the city of Boston, the Rectors had great influence in the political and social sphere, especially in the early years of the church through the mid-1900s. Phillips Brooks, who was Rector from 1869-1891 has been memorialized in the official calendar of the Episcopal Church. His feast day in the calendar according to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer is January 23. His statue is located on the left exterior of the church. The following are the Rectors of Trinity Church from its founding to the present day: Art and architecture Exterior staircase The building's plan is a modified Greek Cross with four arms extending outwards from the central tower, which stands 64 m (211 ft) tall. The church is situated in Copley Square, in the shadow of the John Hancock Tower. Having been built in Boston's Back Bay, which was originally a mud flat, Trinity rests on some 4,500 wooden piles, each driven through 30 feet of gravel fill, silt, and clay, and constantly wetted by the water table of the Back Bay as they will rot if exposed to air. \\"David's Charge to Solomon\\" (1882), a stained-glass window by Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris, in Trinity Church. Its interior murals, which cover over were completed entirely by American artists. Richardson and Brooks decided that a richly colored interior was essential and turned to John La Farge (1835‚Äì1910) for help. La Farge had never performed a commission on this scale, but realized its importance and asked only for his costs to be covered. The results established La Farge's reputation. The church's windows were originally clear glass at consecration in 1877, with one exception, but soon major windows were added. Four windows were designed by Edward Burne-Jones and executed by the studio of William Morris. Another four windows were exceptional commissions by John La Farge, and revolutionized window glass with their layering of opalescent glass. The suter window was painted by Charles Mills. Albumen print of Trinity Church detail, ca. 1877‚Äì1898 Trinity Church is the only church in the United States and the only building in Boston that has been honored as one of the \\"Ten Most Significant Buildings in the United States\\" by the American Institute of Architects (AIA). In 1885, architects voted Trinity Church as the most important building in the U.S.; Trinity Church is the only building from the original 1885 list still included in the AIA's current top ten list. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 30, 1970. The church also houses sculptures by Daniel Chester French and Augustus Saint-Gaudens In popular culture Interior scenes from The Boondock Saints were filmed within Trinity Church.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/trivia The church was featured in the 2015 video game Fallout 4.

It was published by Electronic Arts and released for the Nintendo 64 on October 17, 2000, shortly before the release of its PlayStation counterpart. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of MI6 agent James Bond as he fights to stop a terrorist from triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul. It includes a split-screen multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch and objective-based games. The game runs on an engine that was adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission which takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects, but a Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game. The World Is Not Enough received generally positive reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth frame rate, but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold more than one million copies. Gameplay first-person perspective. The green and blue bars at the top left corner represent the player's health and armor levels respectively. Ammunition information is also displayed at the bottom right corner. The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter based on MGM's 1999 James Bond film of the same name, where the player assumes the role of James Bond through 14 missions with three difficulty settings. The player has the ability to run, jump, crouch, swim and dive underwater for a short period of time. One mission is played as a rail shooter in which the player skis down a mountain. In each mission, the player must complete a number of objectives while encountering enemies controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to destroying vehicles and collecting items. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, the Keypad Decrypter can be used to decode lock systems, while the ID scanner is useful to copy fingerprints. Mission objectives vary in quantity and length depending on the difficulty setting chosen. Difficulty settings also affect enemy accuracy and damage, and the availability of the game's optional automatic aiming assistance. The player can use several weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher. Weapons must be reloaded after a certain number of shots and have alternate fire modes. For example, the Wolfram P2K can be used with or without a silencer. In addition, the player always carries a wristwatch which may be used to stun enemies, fire tranquilizer darts, throw a grappling hook, or emit a laser beam to open locks. In some missions, the player can also use night vision or X-ray vision glasses to outsmart enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although body armors can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game. In addition to the single-player missions, The World Is Not Enough features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete against each other in different game types, ranging from the traditional deathmatch to objective-based games such as capture the flag or king of the hill. Other game types include Last Agent Standing, where players begin the game with a finite number of lives and must survive until the opposing players exhaust their lives, and Uplink, in which players must find and touch uplink units scattered in key locations of the map to score points. Multiplayer games can be played on 14 different maps and can also include bots. Bots' appearance and amount of health can be changed to match player preference. Plot The game closely follows the plot of the film. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Bilbao, Spain to meet a Swiss banker and retrieve money for Robert King, a friend of M who purchased a classified report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department. The report, which was taken from a dead MI6 agent, is believed to contain information about terrorists who have attacked King's oil pipeline in Kazakhstan. Bond asks the banker who killed the MI6 agent, but he is unexpectedly killed by an assassin. Bond escapes with the money and takes it to the MI6 headquarters in London. A terrorist group then launches an attack on the MI6 headquarters, prompting Bond to pursue the assassin through a London Underground station. Bond offers her protection, but she ultimately kills herself by exploding a hot air balloon. The MI6 traces the recovered money to a KGB agent-turned-terrorist known as Renard, who previously kidnapped King's daughter, Elektra. M assigns Bond to protect Elektra, who is about to oversee the construction of an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Bond suspects the attack was caused by Elektra's head of security, Davidov, and decides to kill him before taking his place on a flight to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond meets nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and learns that Renard managed to steal plutonium from a nuclear warhead. To get a lead on where Renard might be hiding, Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine currently being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden's Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra and boards the submarine. Ultimately, Bond finds Renard in the submarine's reactor and kills him before escaping with Jones. Development The World Is Not Enough runs on an engine that takes advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. The World Is Not Enough was developed by Eurocom and published by Electronic Arts, which had formed a partnership with MGM in late 1998 to produce games based on MGM's intellectual properties. At the time, Eurocom had started development on a \\"very scalable\\" first-person 3D engine intended for sixth generation platforms like the GameCube. After Electronic Arts acquired the James Bond game licence, Eurocom showed them their engine and soon both companies started working together to produce the next Bond-licensed game. This happened when Eurocom was still working on the Nintendo 64 version of Mortal Kombat 4. The engine was created and adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. It is capable of delivering a fast and smooth frame rate while offering particle explosions, dynamic lighting effects, long draw distances, and other environmental effects like fog or smoke. It also supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects. Focusing on the game's frame rate and technical aspects was a major priority because developers wanted The World Is Not Enough to be the fastest first-person game on the Nintendo 64 system. According to Eurocom, \\"[we] don't think we could push it much more than we have\\". In addition, with The World Is Not Enough being Eurocom's last Nintendo 64 game, the company saw it as \\"a nice swan song to go out on.\\" To help Eurocom authentically recreate the environments of the film, the film makers provided Eurocom with original production material, including concept drawings, blueprints, and photographs of the film's sets. Although the game closely follows the plot of the film, the developers added elements to help the game design. For example, the London Underground level, where the player must rescue several hostages, is not part of the film. However, the boat chase scene is not playable in the game due to limitations in the Nintendo 64 cartridge size. According to the game's producer Bill Beacham, vehicle-based gameplay would require the creation of a separate engine that would possibly compromise the game's base first-person engine. The characters' faces were digitised from the film's actors, but impersonators provided voiced dialogue. One exception was English actor John Cleese, who reprised his role as R. Electronic Arts secured a \\"Teen\\" rating from the ESRB to avoid intense portrayals of violence because they felt that fast action and memorable spy moments were what the Bond legacy had always stood for. In May 2000, the game was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. At the time, development of the game was nearly 75% complete. The game was released on a 32MB cartridge and includes over 500 lines of speech, which was compressed using Factor 5's technology. The game was initially intended to be released on November 20, 2000 in North America, but was ultimately released one month earlier on October 17, 2000 because Eurocom managed to finish work on the game quicker than expected. In Europe, the game was released on December 8, 2000. A different game, also titled The World Is Not Enough, was released for the PlayStation in November 2000. Reception The World Is Not Enough received generally positive reviews from critics, who frequently compared it to Rare's critically acclaimed Nintendo 64 games GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Matt Casamassina of IGN felt that Eurocom did \\"an amazing job recreating the cinema experience for the Nintendo 64 owner, perhaps more so than any other movie-to-game license to date.\\" In a less positive review, Shane Satterfield of GameSpot stated that The World Is Not Enough \\"belongs in the upper echelon of Nintendo 64 software\\", but it lacks the gameplay delicacy of GoldenEye 007 to reach classic status. Edge concluded that, while the game lacks innovative elements, it \\"still offers plenty of enjoyment for those who have exhausted Rare's masterpieces.\\" Next Generation agreed, stating that The World Is Not Enough is far from a bad game. The game's graphics were widely praised for their long draw distance and smooth frame rate. Critics also noted the game's believable environments, texture quality, animations, and highly detailed explosions and particle effects. The soundtrack and sound effects received similar praise. Game Revolution said that the background themes \\"make for excellent espionage\\", while Nintendo Power observed that the spoken dialogue \\"adds a cinematic touch\\" that GoldenEye 007 does not feature. GamePro stated similar pros, but criticised the plot for being confusing and \\"too complex for its own good.\\" IGN praised the single-player missions for their variety and great enemy placement, noting that each scenario is different in both design and gameplay mechanics. The reviewer especially highlighted the last mission due to its underwater sections, as it requires players to find hidden air pockets so that Bond can breathe and stay alive. In contrast, Mark Green of N64 Magazine remarked that the missions were fairly scripted, limiting the player's options and experimentation. Similarly, Edge said that the game's \\"on the fly\\" mission objectives give the game a fair amount of rigidity. The reviewer explained that, while GoldenEye 007 or Perfect Dark set their mission objectives at the beginning of each level, thus giving players a chance to tackle the mission as they wish, The World Is Not Enough \\"cannonballs\\" the player \\"from one objective to the next with little room for invention of improvisation.\\" Nevertheless, he highlighted the Night Watch level for being \\"fantastically stealth-centric\\". The game's weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence was a common subject of criticism. GameSpot described the behaviour of enemies as \\"They see, they run, they shoot - and that's about it\\", while N64 Magazine noted that they regularly fail to spot the player even when standing next to them. The gadgetry was seen as a useful gameplay feature, with AllGame noting that players need to figure out the proper way to use each gadget. Although GameZone highlighted the multiplayer mode for its replay value and teamplay options, critics agreed that the game felt short in comparison to Perfect Dark. The artificial intelligence of multiplayer bots was also a frequent criticism. According to GameSpot, \\"they generally amount to nothing more than fragging\\".

Description The VTech Laser 128 has 128 KB of RAM. Like the Apple IIc, it is a one-piece semi-portable design with a carrying handle and a single built-in 5¬º-inch floppy disk drive, uses the 65C02 microprocessor, and supports Apple II graphics. Unlike the Apple IIc, it has a numeric keypad, a Centronics printer port, and two Laser 128-only graphics modes. The Laser 128 also has a single Apple IIe-compatible expansion slot, which gives it better expansion capabilities than a IIc, but cards remain exposed; the slot is intended for an $80 expansion chassis with two slots compatible with the Apple's Slot 5 and Slot 7. The computer also has a separate internal memory-expansion slot. History Announced in early 1986, VTech sold the Laser 128 in the US at a suggested retail price of $479, while Central Point Software sold it by mail for $395; by comparison, the Apple IIe sold for $945 in April 1986. Apple filed a lawsuit to stop distribution but VTech obtained United States Customs approval to export the Laser 128 to the United States in 1986, and the lawsuit reportedly had no effect on demand for the computer. Central Point‚Äîthe most prominent dealer‚Äîsold the Laser 128 and accessories with full-page magazine advertisements, claiming that \\"a computer without expansion slots is a dead- end that stays behind as technology advances\\". It even advertised the Laser 128 in Commodore computer magazines; the name was, Central Point president Mike Brown said, \\"chosen to sound like the Commodore 128\\", and the company intended to appeal to those who wanted to use the large Apple software library with a computer that cost the same as the Commodore. By late 1986 other mail- order firms also sold the Laser 128, and at least one peripheral maker advertised its product's compatibility with the clone. By 1988, VTech had purchased a majority share in Central Point Software and formed Laser Computer as a division of the company. It ended Central Point's mail order sales of the 128, only selling through dealers such as Sears. inCider magazine wrote that year that \\"Laser will never sell as many computers or have as big a distribution network as Apple, but there's no doubt that the 128 [has] won a place in the Apple market, and irritated Apple in the process\\". Apple countered the Laser 128 with the Apple IIc Plus. VTech responded with the Laser 128EX (1987), with a 3.6 MHz CPU, and the $549 Laser 128EX/2 (1988), with a 3.5-inch disk drive and MIDI port. (A $499 version of the 128EX/2 with a 5.25-inch drive was available.) Compatibility Unlike the Apple II clones from Franklin, VTech reverse-engineered the Apple Monitor ROM using a clean room design rather than copying it. The company licensed an Applesoft BASIC- compatible version of Microsoft BASIC. Apple carefully studied the Laser 128 but unlike its efforts directed at Franklin, Apple was unable to force the Laser 128 off the market. Apple claimed in 1984 that the IIc was compatible with 90% of all Apple II software. Despite its physical resemblance to the IIc, software sees the Laser 128 as an enhanced IIe with 128K RAM and Extended 80-Column Text Card. Central Point claimed in 1986 that testing had found that only Choplifter, David's Midnight Magic, and Serpentine did not run on the clone, because of Broderbund's copy protection. InfoWorld found that the Laser 128 was incompatible with 12% of 129 tested software packages, mostly educational software or games. Compatible software included AppleWorks, Quicken, Apple Writer, VisiCalc, Flight Simulator II, The Print Shop, and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, sometimes with slightly different colors. While incompatible with some hardware, the magazine noted that the expansion slot and parallel port let the Laser 128 use other products incompatible with the IIc. inCider called the computer \\"amazingly Apple- compatible\\", estimating 95% compatibility. Programs that successfully ran on the Laser 128 included F-15 Strike Eagle, Fantavision, WordPerfect, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the magazine noted that it was easy to install $25 upgraded ROM chips if necessary to improve compatibility. A+ similarly found that the computer was compatible with 28 of 30 popular Apple II programs, while only about half worked with the Franklin Ace. BYTEs tests were less favorable. Most expansion cards worked properly but the magazine found \\"mixed results\\" with software compatibility, stating that \\"graphics programs I tested revealed flaws in the Laser 128's compatibility with both the Apple IIc and II+\\". The Laser 128's popularity ensured that most major software companies tested their software on the Laser as well as on Apple hardware. Licensing BASIC greatly reduced the amount of code that had to be reimplemented. Applesoft BASIC constitutes the largest and most complex part of an Apple II's ROM contents. Microsoft made most of its money by keeping the rights to the software that it sold to others. Like IBM with PC DOS, Apple did not have an exclusive license for the Applesoft dialect of BASIC, and VTech was free to license it. Much Apple software depends on various machine code routines that are a part of BASIC in ROM, and it is likely that the Laser would not have been as successful had it not had compatible ROM entry points. Reception InfoWorld in May 1986 stated that \\"we can see why\\" Apple opposed the Laser 128's importation to the United States. It stated that other than the keyboard feel, the computer's external features (the expansion slot, numeric keypad, and Centronics port) improved on the IIc. Given the high degree of compatibility and a price less than half that of the IIc, the magazine concluded that the Laser 128 \\"is a real bargain\\". Writing that \\"it's cheap and it works\\", inCider in December 1986 stated that the Laser 128 \\"[deserved] a look from anyone considering a Commodore. Or, to be blunt, anyone considering an Apple IIc\\". The magazine also disliked the keyboard's feel and called the computer \\"homely\\", but concluded that \\"The Laser is a remarkably compatible, competent performer. The Apple market isn't known for hardware bargains, but it has one now\\". BYTE in January 1987 preferred the Laser 128's keyboard, including the keypad and cursor keys' locations, to that of the Apple IIc and approved of the documentation's quality. Despite describing the software incompatibility issues as \\"disappointing\\" the magazine concluded that its \\"technical issues are relatively minor\\", and that its low price made the computer \\"perfect for someone looking for a second computer or an inexpensive first computer that runs the largest pool of software available today\\". inCider in November 1988 stated that the Laser 128EX/2 \\"has everything you can possibly put into an 8-bit Apple II ... in terms of standard equipment, it's more than a match for the IIc Plus\\". The Apple product was slightly faster and the difference in price between the two computers was much smaller than the IIc's more than $300 premium over the Laser 128, but the 128EX/2's memory was more easily expandable, important to AppleWorks users. The magazine concluded that while the \\"128EX/2 is a slick machine, the most fully loaded II compatible you can buy\\", the 5 1/4-inch version of the EX/2‚Äîor the older EX for those who did not need a 3 1/2-inch drive‚Äî\\"may be bargain hunters' best bet\\".

Artistic career Roger is first heard of in connection with Stavelot Abbey in the Meuse valley, a centre of Mosan art, and especially goldsmith's work. He worked between 1100 and 1107 in St. Pantaleon's church in Cologne. At least two portable altars made by him are in the treasury of Paderborn Cathedral. In 1107 he moved to Helmarshausen Abbey, where he established a goldsmith's workshop. In conjunction with the well-known scriptorium, where the Gospels of Henry the Lion were produced later in the 12th century, he created several important works in the Romanesque style, including various illuminated codices, as well as many pieces of jewellery. De diversis artibus Roger has been proposed by a number of academics (for example, Albert Ilg (1874) and C. R. Dodwell (1961)) as the real author of the important medieval treatise De diversis artibus (also Schedula diversarum artium), which is ascribed to the pseudonymous Theophilus Presbyter. This suggestion is not universally accepted, but has been supported by other academics, including Cyril Stanley Smith (1963 and 1974), Lynn White Jr. (1964) and Eckhard Freise (1981).

The original SARGON from 1978 was written in assembly language by Dan and Kathleen \\"Kathe\\" Spracklen for the Z80-based Wavemate Jupiter III. History SARGON was introduced at the 1978 West Coast Computer Faire where it won the first computer chess tournament held strictly for microcomputers, with a score of 5‚Äì0. This success encouraged the authors to seek financial income by selling the program directly to customers. Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte magazine selling for $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer. Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines.Sargon source code on madscientistroom.org For example, the March‚ÄìApril 1979 issue of Recreational Computing describes a project that converted Sargon to an 8080 program by using macros. Later the Spracklens were contacted by Hayden Books and a book was published. Commercialization The notation screen from Sargon I for the Apple II When magnetic media publishing became widely available, a US Navy petty officer, Paul Lohnes, ported Sargon to the TRS-80, altering the graphics, input, and housekeeping routines but leaving the Spracklens' chess-playing algorithm intact. Paul consulted with the Spracklens, who were both living in San Diego at the time, to make the TRS-80 version an instant success with the help of Hayden Book's newly established software division: Hayden Software. Paul was not involved in further refinements to the TRS-80 version due to his reassignment to sea duty shortly after signing the deal with Hayden Software. In the early 1980s, SARGON CHESS was ported to the Nascom (by Bits & PCs, 1981), Exidy Sorcerer, and Sharp MZ 80K.http://www.sharpmz.org/mz-80k/sargonchess.html A complete rewrite was necessary later for the Apple II, programmed by Kathleen's brother Gary Shannon. Both were published by Hayden Software. Improved versions The Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program and released Sargon II. Sargon 2.5, sold as a ROM module for the Chafitz Modular Game System, was identical to Sargon II but incorporated pondering. It received a 1641 rating at the Paul Masson tournament in June‚ÄìJuly 1979, and 1736 at the San Jose City College Open in January 1980. Sargon 3.0 finished in seventh place at the October 1979 North American Computer Chess Championship. The competition had improved, but 3.0 drew against Cray Blitz and easily defeated Mychess, its main microcomputer rival. In December, 3.0 easily won the second microcomputer championship in London. Sargon III was a complete rewrite from scratch. Instead of an exchange evaluator, this version used a capture search algorithm. Also included was a chess opening repertoire. This third version was written originally for the 6502 assembler and was commercially published by Hayden Software in 1983. Apple contacted the Spracklens and, after a port for 68000 assembly, Sargon III was the first third-party executable software for the Macintosh. Reception Video magazine listed Sargon III third on its list of best-selling video games in February 1985, and fourth on the best-seller list in March 1985, with II Computing listing the game second on its list of top Apple II games in October‚ÄìNovember of the same year. PC Magazine rated Sargon III 13.5 points out of 18. The reviewer criticized the \\"too abstractly drawn\\" pieces but praised the game's speed and skill, describing himself as \\"not a bad player\\" but only winning 10% of games at the lowest difficulty level. Legacy After the demise of Hayden Software, later chess programs were also released under the name Sargon, including Sargon IV (Spinnaker Software), Sargon V (Activision) and a CD-i title simply named Sargon Chess. The Spracklens concurrently wrote the engines for the dedicated chess computers produced by Fidelity Electronics, which won the first four World Microcomputer Chess Championships. The Botvinnik game The three-time world chess champion Mikhail Botvinnik played a game with Sargon in 1983 at Hamburg. He did not play his best moves but only tested the program's capabilities. Botvinnik himself was also involved in chess program development.

It is 8 miles north of Liverpool city centre and is located on the coast near the boundary of the Mersey Estuary and Liverpool Bay. The River Alt joins the sea at this point and forms an estuary. There is a pumping station on the River Alt at Altmouth, built 1972, as part of a programme to alleviate flooding in the area.A Guide to Merseyside's Industrial Past, Paul Rees, 1st ed.

The village is featured in 'Lancashire Life' magazine, May 2004 'Tales of the sea at Hightown, near Southport' pp. 150‚Äì154 by Harold Brough, photographs by John Cocks. History A dictionary of English Place-Names, A. D. Mills (OUP, Oxford, 1991) lists only a Hightown as a part of Congleton in Cheshire (there is also part of Banbury in Oxfordshire called Hightown). However specific books on Lancashire place names do list this Hightown in what was formerly Lancashire. Altmouth as a settlement features on many old maps prior to the 18th Century,For example on Morden's 1695 map, http://www.roydenhistory.co.uk/halewood/maps/maps/morden1695.jpg; neither place is recorded on Thomas Moule's 1837 map at 8 miles to the inch (Moule's County Maps, the North of England, Bracken Books, London, 1994) north of where the village is now, bordering Altcar parish.Much history of Altcar, north of the River Alt, is included in 'The parish and township of Altcar', in A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 3, ed. William Farrer and J Brownbill (London, 1907), pp. 221-226. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/lancs/vol3/pp221-226 [accessed 18 March 2018]. Alt Grange is recorded as 13th Century. David Mills in his book \\"The place-names of Lancashire\\" does give High Town dated 1702. However he gives no source or reference. Understandably Mills appears to have not visited the small West Lancashire coastal village or he would not have given the description \\"the major town .. The name appears to be modern and self- explanatory\\". The first recorded mention of the place name Hightown is in Nicholas Blundell's Diaries. Nicholas Blundell's Diaries, Vol. 3 1720 (published 1972) refers to visiting High-Town Greene on the 18 May 1722 (p. 77). There is still a village green today (oddly triangular) near the pub and railway station but unlike when Nicholas Blundell visited there are no cattle pens on it. However the earliest record of the place is probably in a probate record for Richard Riding of Moorhouses in Little Crosby husbandman from 1715. Moorhouses was a hamlet on the shore where Hightown is today, it is remembered in the name of one of the modern closes. The inventory for Richard Riding's property records it as being of the property of ‚ÄúRichard Rydeing of the Hytown within Crosbie Parava.‚Äù copy in Crosby Library.

Hightown beach is the site of a former wartime military base known as Fort Crosby.Much of the history is told in the booklet Forgotten Fort Crosby: Dune Heritage Revealed by Alison Burns. Published by Sefton Coast Landscape Partnership October 2015 Available to download at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283300960_Forgotten_Fort_Crosby_Dune_Heritage_Revealed. The fort was situated midway between Hightown and Hall Road and housed a number of Italian and German POW's during WWII. Following its decommission at the end of the war a small cinema screen within the complex was reputedly used by local residents for a number of years until the camp was finally demolished in the mid-1960s. Remains of many of the buildings, pathways and fences can still be seen today. During the early part of the 20th century the village formed its own voluntary fire service following a number of deaths and injuries resulting from the excessive time taken for the Crosby Fire Service to reach the village. The most notable of these incidents was the loss of a family during a blaze within the lighthouse which once stood close to the site of Fort Crosby. The lighthouse was built in 1839. The most prominent buildings at the turn of the 20th Century were the Truant School, next to the railway line, and the Hightown Hotel (the village pub). In 1901 ‚ÄúThere were 20 officials and 114 boys in the truant school at Hightown, belonging to the Liverpool education authority.‚Äù 1907 entry on Little Crosby at pp.85-91.

When Sefton Council upgraded the Sefton Coastal Footpath they blocked up two gun emplacements that remained of the Fort Crosby site. A former resident alleged in 2011 that Sefton Council had deliberately neglected the World War II heritage at Hightown, but there is no evidence of deliberate neglect. An exhibition by artist Tom Fairclough 'Collateral' contained peaceful but evocative pictures of the rubble that make up the sea defences at the mouth of the Alt.

Prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished with its northern parts, including Hightown, being merged with the Eastern parts of Sefton that were formerly part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency, to form the new constituency of Sefton Central, which is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson. For elections to Sefton Council the village and Civil parish of Hightown is within the Manor electoral ward and is represented by three councillors. The councillors of Manor ward are Martyn Barber of the Conservative Party, John Gibson of the Liberal Democrats, and Steve McGinnity of the Labour Party.

Kellermann was one of the first women to wear a one-piece bathing costume, instead of the then-accepted pantaloons, and inspired others to follow her example. Kellerman's swimming costumes became so popular that she started her own fashion line of one-piece bathing suits. Kellermann helped popularize the sport of synchronised swimming, and authored a swimming manual. She appeared in several movies, usually with aquatic themes, and as the star of A Daughter of the Gods was the first major actress to appear nude in a Hollywood production. Kellermann was an advocate of health, fitness, and natural beauty throughout her life.  Early life  Annette Kellermann (sometimes recorded as \\"Kellerman\\") was born in Marrickville, New South Wales, Australia, on 6 July 1887, to Australian-born violinist Frederick William Kellermann, and his French wife, Alice Ellen Charbonnet, a pianist and music teacher. At the age of six, a weakness in Kellermann's legs necessitated the wearing of steel braces to strengthen them. To further overcome her disability, her parents enrolled her in swimming classes at Cavill's Baths, a tidal swimming pool in the North Sydney suburb of Lavender Bay. By the age of 13, her legs were practically normal, and by 15, she had mastered all the swimming strokes and won her first race. At this time she was also giving diving displays.  Swimming career  Annette Kellermann, early 1900s In 1902, Kellermann won the ladies' 100 yards and mile championships of New South Wales in the record times of 1 minute, 22 seconds and 33 minutes, 49 seconds respectively. In that same year, her parents decided to move to Melbourne, Victoria, and she was enrolled at Mentone Girls' Grammar School, where her mother had accepted a music teaching position. During her time at school, Kellermann gave exhibitions of swimming and diving at the main Melbourne baths, performed a mermaid act at Princes Court entertainment centre, and did two shows a day swimming with fish in a glass tank at the Exhibition Aquarium. In June and July 1903, she performed sensational high dives in the Coogee scene of Bland Holt's spectacular, The Breaking of the Drought, at the Melbourne Theatre Royal. Kellermann and Beatrice Kerr, who was billed as \\"Australia's Champion Lady Swimmer and Diver\\", were rivals, although Kerr's public challenges to Kellermann to meet in a competitive race went unanswered. On 24 August 1905, aged 19, Kellermann was one of the first women to attempt to swim the English Channel. After three unsuccessful swims she declared, \\"I had the endurance but not the brute strength.\\" The first woman to attempt a Channel crossing had been Austrian Baroness Walburga von Isacescu, in September 1900. Kellermann later challenged and defeated Isacescu in a Danube race. Kellermann helped popularize the sport of synchronised swimming after her 1907 performance of the first water ballet in a glass tank at the New York Hippodrome. Swimwear line Kellermann advocated for the right of women to wear a one-piece bathing suit, which was controversial at the time.Reader's Digest Services, \\"Record- breaking swimmers\\", Australia's Yesterdays: a Look at Our Recent Past, 2nd edition, 1974 p. 193 According to an Australian magazine, \\"In the early 1900s, women were expected to wear cumbersome dress and pantaloon combinations when swimming. In 1907, at the height of her popularity, Kellermann was arrested on Revere Beach, Massachusetts, for indecency ‚Äì she was wearing one of her fitted one-piece costumes.\\" The popularity of her one-piece suits resulted in her own line of women's swimwear. The \\"Annette Kellermans\\", as they were known, were the first step towards modern women's swimwear.  Film career  Kellermann and Hugh Thompson in \\"Queen of the Sea\\". In 1916, Kellermann became the first major actress to perform in a nude scene when she appeared fully nude in A Daughter of the Gods. Made by Fox Film Corporation, A Daughter of the Gods was the first million-dollar film production. Like many of Kellermann's other films, this is now considered a lost film, as no copies are known to exist. Kellermann in nude scene from A Daughter of the Gods The majority of Kellermann's films had themes of aquatic adventure. She performed her own stunts including diving from 92 feet into the sea and 60 feet into a pool of crocodiles. Many times she would play mermaids named Annette or variations of her own name. Her \\"fairy tale films\\", as she called them, started with The Mermaid (1911), in which she was the first actress to wear a swimmable mermaid costume on film, paving the way for future screen sirens such as Glynis Johns (Miranda), Esther Williams and Daryl Hannah (Splash). Kellermann designed her own mermaid swimming costumes and sometimes made them herself. Similar designs are still used by The Weeki Wachee Springs Mermaids, including her aquatic fairy costume first introduced in Queen of the Sea (1918)(another Lost film). Kellermann appeared in one of the last films made in Prizma Color, Venus of the South Seas (1924), a US/New Zealand co-production where one reel of the 55-minute film was in colour and underwater. Venus of the South Seas was restored by the Library of Congress in 2004 and is the only feature film starring Kellermann known to exist in its complete form.  Publications  In addition to her film and stage career, Kellermann wrote several books including How to Swim (1918), Physical Beauty: How to Keep It (1919), a book of children's stories titled Fairy Tales of the South Seas (1926), and My Story, an unpublished autobiography. She also wrote numerous mail order booklets on health, beauty, and fitness called The Body Beautiful.  Personal life  Kellermann in her full-length swimwear Kellermann married her American-born manager, James Sullivan, on or around 26 November 1912 at Danbury, Connecticut. A life-long vegetarian, Kellermann owned a health food store in Long Beach, California, later in life. She remained active well into old age, continuing to swim and exercise until a short time before her death. She and her husband returned to live in Australia in 1970, and in 1974, she was honoured by the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Kellermann outlived her husband and died in the hospital at Southport, Queensland, Australia, on 6 November 1975, aged 88. She was cremated with Roman Catholic rites. Her remains were scattered in the Great Barrier Reef. She had no children.  Legacy  Venus of the South Seas poster In 1908, after a study of 3,000 women, Dudley A. Sargent of Harvard University dubbed her the \\"Perfect Woman\\" because of the similarity of her physical attributes to the Venus de Milo.\\"Modern Woman Getting Nearer The Perfect Figure ‚Äì Dr. Dudley Sargent of...\\" ; 4 December 1910; Text: subject of an article on health refers to Kellermann's body as \\"... the most ideal figure\\"; Sunday Magazine; accessed November 2015 Kellermann's large collection of costumes and theatrical memorabilia was bequeathed to the Sydney Opera House. Today, many of her original costumes and personal items are held by the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia.Annette Kellermann Costume Collection; collection; Powerhouse Museum online; retrieved January 2020 The Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales has her archive of personal papers. She was portrayed by Esther Williams in the film Million Dollar Mermaid (1952), and Kellermann's name is on a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, on Hollywood Boulevard. An award-winning Australian documentary called The Original Mermaid, which was about Kellermann, was produced in 2002. A swimming complex in Marrickville which opened December 2010 was named after her. The streets in the suburb of Holt in the Australian capital Canberra are all named after Australian sportspeople, and Kellermann Close was named for Annette Kellermann.

Hornemann was born in Hildesheim, a city in Lower Saxony, Germany, located about 30 km southeast of Hannover. He was a young man when, early in 1796, he offered his services to the African Association of London as an explorer in Africa. The African Association sent him to the University of G√∂ttingen to study Arabic and otherwise prepare for an expedition from the east into the unknown regions of North Africa. In September 1797 he arrived in Egypt, where he continued his studies. When the country was invaded by the French, he was confined in the citadel of Cairo to preserve him from the fanaticism of the populace. Liberated by the French, he received the patronage of Bonaparte. On 5 September 1798 he joined a caravan returning to the Maghreb from Mecca, attaching himself to a party of Fezzan merchants who accompanied the pilgrims. As an avowed Christian would not have been permitted to join the caravan Hornemann assumed the character of a young mamluk trading to Fezzan. He then spoke, but indifferently, both Arabic and Turkish, and he was accompanied as servant and interpreter by Joseph Freudenburg, a German convert to Islam, who had thrice made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Travelling by way of the oases of Siwa and Aujila, a black rocky desert was traversed to Temissa in Fezzan. Murzuk was reached on 17 November 1798. Here Hornemann lived until June 1799, going thence to the city of Tripoli, whence in August of the same year he despatched his journals to London. He then returned to Murzuk. Nothing further is known with certainty concerning him or his companion. In Murzuk Hornemann had collected a great deal of trustworthy information concerning the peoples and countries of the western Sahara and central Sudan, and when he left Tripoli it was his intention to go directly to the Hausa country, which region he was the first European definitely to locate. \\"If I do not perish in my undertaking\\", he wrote in his journal, \\"I hope in five years I shall be able to make the Society better acquainted with the people of whom I have given this short description.\\" The British consul at Tripoli heard from a source believed to be trustworthy that about June 1803 Jusef (Hornemann's Muslim name) was at Caina, i.e. Katsina, in Northern Nigeria, in good health and highly respected as a marabout. A report reached Murzuk in 1819 that the traveller had gone to Noofy (Nupe), and had died there. Hornemann was the first European in modern times to traverse the north-eastern Sahara, and up to 1910 no other explorer had followed his route across the Jebel-es-Suda from Aujila to Temissa. The original text of Hornemann's journal, which was written in German, was printed at Weimar in 1801; an English translation, The Journal of Frederick Hornemann's travels, from Cairo to Mourzouk : the Capital of the Kingdom of Fezzan, in Africa, with maps and dissertations by Major James Rennell, appeared in London in 1802. A French translation of the English work, made by order of the First Consuls and augmented with notes and a memoir on the Egyptian oases by L. Langl√®s, was published in Paris in the following year. The French version is the most valuable of the three. Consult also the Proceedings of the African Association (1810), and The Geographical Journal November 1906.

The term refers to the notion that the period between 1789 and 1914 reflect a progression of ideas which are characteristic to an understanding of the 19th century in Europe.  Background  The concept is an adaption of Fernand Braudel's 1949 notion of le long seizi√®me si√®cle (\\"the long 16th century\\" 1450‚Äì1640).Braudel, F. (1972). The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II (Vol. 1; S. Reynolds, Trans.). New York: Harper & Row and \\"a recognized category of literary history\\", although a period often broadly and diversely defined by different scholars. Numerous authors, before and after Hobsbawm's 1995 publication, have applied similar forms of book titles or descriptions to indicate a selective time frame for their works, such as: S. Kettering, \\"French Society: 1589‚Äì1715 ‚Äì the long seventeenth century\\", E. Anthony Wrigley, \\"British population during the ‚Äòlong‚Äô eighteenth century, 1680‚Äì1840\\", or D. Blackbourn, \\"The long nineteenth century: A history of Germany, 1780‚Äì1918\\". However, the term has been used in support of historical publications in order to \\"connect with broader audiences\\" and is regularly cited in studies and discussions across academic disciplines, such as history, linguistics and the arts. Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789‚Äì1848 (1962), The Age of Capital: 1848‚Äì1875 (1975), and The Age of Empire: 1875‚Äì1914 (1987). Hobsbawm starts his long 19th century with the French Revolution, which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the outbreak of World War I, upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring European power balance of the 19th century proper (1801‚Äì1900) was eliminated. In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914‚Äì1991 (1994), Hobsbawm details the short 20th century beginning with World War I and ending with the fall of the Soviet Union. A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by Peter N. Stearns in the context of the world history school.  Religious history  In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the history of the Catholic Church, the long 19th century was a period of centralization of papal power over the Catholic Church. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals. The church's long 19th century extended from the French Revolution (1789) until the death of Pope Pius XII (1958). This covers the period between the decline of traditional Catholic power and the emergence of secular ideas within states, and the emergence of new thinking within the church after the election of Pope John XXIII.

Besides a village of the same name, the parish has a number of widely spaced small settlements including Bagshot and Stype, to the north, and Rivar and Oxenwood to the south. Before 1895, about half of the parish of Shalbourne (including its church) lay in Berkshire.  History  Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a settlement of 48 households at Saldeborne or Scaldeburne. Under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, Oxenwood tithing was transferred from Berkshire to Wiltshire. Bagshot tithing was transferred in 1895, to complete the consolidation of the parish within Wiltshire.  Parish church  The Anglican Church of St Michael and All Angels is Grade II* listed. Built in flint and stone with tiled roofs, it dates from the 12th or 13th century and was partly rebuilt and extended by G.F. Bodley in 1873. The nave is either 12th century or a 13th-century rebuilding; reconstruction of the south aisle in the 19th century reused two 12th-century doorways. The chancel was rebuilt around 1300, and the tower added in the 15th century. Three of the six bells in the tower are from the 17th century. The east chancel window has 1871 stained glass by Kempe. A window by Henry Haig was added in 1995, from designs of Karl Parsons, who lived at Shalbourne from 1930 until the onset of ill health in 1933. The benefice was united with that of Ham with Buttermere in 1956. Today the parish is part of the Savernake Team, a group of eleven village parishes.  Other buildings  Also Grade II* listed are West Court farmhouse (15th and 17th centuries) and Shalbourne Manor farmhouse (16th century).  Geography  The Shalbourne Stream flows northeast from its spring-fed source near Shalbourne village, to join the River Dun above Hungerford. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Amenities Shalbourne has a primary school and a village hall which was built in 1843 as a schoolroom. Notable people Alexander Chocke of Shalbourne (1594‚Äì1625) was elected to Parliament for Ludgershall in 1621. From 1608 until late 1637, tenants of the parish's Westcourt Manor included William Carpenter and his namesake son, both of whom emigrated to Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1638 on the Bevis from Southampton. The younger William was a founder of Rehoboth, Massachusetts. The Rehoboth Carpenter family's descendants number in the tens of thousands, among whom are two U.S. presidents and a Project Mercury astronaut. William Carpenter [Jr.] married at Shalbourne in 1625 Abigail Briant, whose family had resided in the parish since at least the late 16th century.\\"Carpenter Sketches\\", Eugene Cole Zubrinsky, FASG, (2009; see William1 and William2, Rehoboth section).

This deficiency occurs due to mutations in the HPRT1 gene located on the X chromosome. LNS affects about 1 in 380,000 live births. The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by American medical student Michael Lesch and his mentor, pediatrician William Nyhan, at Johns Hopkins.Ole Daniel Enersen. The HGPRT deficiency causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. The combination of increased synthesis and decreased utilization of purines leads to high levels of uric acid production. This results in both high levels of uric acid in the blood and urine, associated with severe gout and kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderate intellectual disability. These complications usually appear in the first year of life. Beginning in the second year of life, a particularly striking feature of LNS is self-mutilating behaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington's disease. The cause of the neurological abnormalities remains unknown. Because a lack of HGPRT causes the body to poorly utilize vitamin B12, some males may develop megaloblastic anemia. LNS is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner; the gene mutation is usually carried by the mother and passed on to her son, although one-third of all cases arise de novo (from new mutations) and do not have a family history. LNS is present at birth in baby boys. Most, but not all, persons with this deficiency have severe mental and physical problems throughout life. There are a few rare cases in the world of affected females. The symptoms caused by the buildup of uric acid (gout and kidney symptoms) respond well to treatment with medications such as allopurinol that reduce the levels of uric acid in the blood. The mental deficits and self-mutilating behavior do not respond well to treatment. There is no cure, but many affected people live to adulthood. Several new experimental treatments may alleviate symptoms. Signs and symptoms LNS is characterized by three major hallmarks: neurologic dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral disturbances including self-mutilation, and uric acid overproduction (hyperuricemia). Damage to the basal ganglia causes sufferers to adopt a characteristic fencing stance due to the nature of the lesion. Some may also be afflicted with macrocytic anemia. Virtually all patients are male; males suffer delayed growth and puberty, and most develop shrunken testicles or testicular atrophy. Female carriers are at an increased risk for gouty arthritis but are usually otherwise unaffected. Overproduction of uric acid One of the first symptoms of the disease is the presence of sand-like crystals of uric acid in the diapers of the affected infant. Overproduction of uric acid may lead to the development of uric acid crystals or stones in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. Such crystals deposited in joints later in the disease may produce gout-like arthritis, with swelling and tenderness.The overproduction of uric acid is present at birth, but may not be recognized by routine clinical laboratory testing methods. The serum uric acid concentration is often normal, as the excess purines are promptly eliminated in the urine. The crystals usually appear as an orange grainy material, or they may coalesce to form either multiple tiny stones or distinct large stones that are difficult to pass. The stones, or calculi, usually cause hematuria (blood in the urine) and increase the risk of urinary tract infection. Some victims suffer kidney damage due to such kidney stones. Stones may be the presenting feature of the disease, but can go undetected for months or even years. Nervous system impairment The periods before and surrounding birth are typically normal in individuals with LNS. The most common presenting features are abnormally decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and developmental delay, which are evident by three to six months of age. Affected individuals are late in sitting up, while most never crawl or walk. Lack of speech is also a very common trait associated with LNS. Irritability is most often noticed along with the first signs of nervous system impairment. Within the first few years of life, extrapyramidal involvement causes abnormal involuntary muscle contractions such as loss of motor control (dystonia), writhing motions (choreoathetosis), and arching of the spine (opisthotonus). Signs of pyramidal system involvement, including spasticity, overactive reflexes (hyperreflexia) and extensor plantar reflexes, also occur. The resemblance to athetoid cerebral palsy is apparent in the neurologic aspects of LNS. As a result, most individuals are initially diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The motor disability is so extensive that most individuals never walk, and become lifelong wheelchair users. Self-injuring behavior nail biting is sometimes caused by Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome. Persons affected are cognitively impaired and have behavioral disturbances that emerge between two and three years of age. The uncontrollable self-injury associated with LNS also usually begins at three years of age. The self-injury begins with biting of the lips and tongue; as the disease progresses, affected individuals frequently develop finger biting and head banging. The self-injury can increase during times of stress. Self-harm is a distinguishing characteristic of the disease and is apparent in 85% of affected males.Gualtieri, C. Thomas (2002). Brain Injury and Mental Retardation: Psychopharmacology and Neuropsychiatry, p. 257. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. . The majority of individuals are cognitively impaired, which is sometimes difficult to distinguish from other symptoms because of the behavioral disturbances and motor deficits associated with the syndrome. In many ways, the behaviors may be seen as a psychological extension of the compulsion to cause self-injury, and include rejecting desired treats or travel, repaying kindness with coldness or rage, failing to answer test questions correctly despite study and a desire to succeed, provoking anger from caregivers when affection is desired. Compulsive behaviors also occur, including aggressiveness, vomiting, spitting, and coprolalia (involuntary swearing). The development of this type of behavior is sometimes seen within the first year, or in early childhood, but others may not develop it until later in life.  LNS in females  While carrier females are generally an asymptomatic condition, they do experience an increase in uric acid excretion, and some may develop symptoms of hyperuricemia, and suffer from gout in their later years. Testing in this context has no clinical consequence, but it may reveal the possibility of transmitting the trait to male children. Women may also require testing if a male child develops LNS. In this instance, a negative test means the son's disease is the result of a new mutation, and the risk in siblings is not increased. Females who carry one copy of the defective gene are carriers with a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their sons. In order for a female to be affected, she would need to have two copies of the mutated gene, one of which would be inherited from her father. Males affected with LNS do not usually have children due to the debilitating effects of the disease. It is possible for a female to inherit an X chromosome from her unaffected father, who carries a new mutation of the HGPRT gene. Under these circumstances, a girl could be born with LNS, and though there are a few reports of this happening, it is very rare. The overwhelming majority of patients with LNS are male. Less severe forms A less severe, related disease, partial HPRT deficiency, is known as Kelley‚ÄìSeegmiller syndrome (Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome involves total HPRT deficiency). Symptoms generally involve less neurological involvement but the disease still causes gout and kidney stones. Genetics LNS is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion.LNS is due to mutations in the HPRT1 gene,Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome. Genetics Home Reference. Retrieved on 2007-05-24.Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome. NCBI Genes and disease. Retrieved on 2007-04-12 so named because it codes for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT or HGPRT, ). This enzyme is involved in the biochemical pathways the body uses to produce purines, one of the components of DNA and RNA. Defects of this enzyme lead to increased production of uric acid. Since the HPRT gene is located on the X chromosome, LNS is an X-linked inherited disease. The father of an affected male will not be the carrier of the mutant allele, and will not have the disease. An obligate carrier would be a woman who has an affected son and one other affected relative in the maternal line. If a woman is the first in her family with an affected son, Haldane's rule predicts a 2/3 chance that she is a carrier and a 1/3 chance that the son has a new germline mutation. The risk to siblings of an affected individual depends upon the carrier status of the mother herself. A 50% chance is given to any female who is a carrier to transmit the HPRT1 mutation in each pregnancy. Sons who inherit the mutation will be affected while daughters who inherit the mutation are carriers. Therefore, with each pregnancy, a carrier female has a 25% chance of having a male that is affected, a 25% chance of having a female that is a carrier, and a 50% chance of having a normal male or female. Males with LNS do not reproduce due to the characteristics of the disease. However, if a male with a less severe phenotype reproduces, all of his daughters are carriers, and none of his sons will be affected. Pathophysiology Purine metabolism. As in other X-linked diseases, males are affected because they only have one copy of the X chromosome. In Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome, the defective gene is that for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), a participant in the 'recycling' of purine nucleotides. Female carriers have a second X chromosome, which contains a \\"normal\\" copy of HPRT, preventing the disease from developing, though they may have increased risk of hyperuricemia. A large number of mutations of HPRT are known. Mutations that only mildly decrease the enzyme's function do not normally cause the severe form of LNS, but do produce a milder form of the disease which still features purine overproduction accompanied by susceptibility to gout and uric acid nephrolithiasis. Formation of DNA (during cell division) requires nucleotides, molecules that are the building blocks for DNA. The purine bases (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidine bases (thymine and cytosine) are bound to deoxyribose and phosphate and incorporated as necessary. Normally, the nucleotides are synthetized de novo from amino acids and other precursors. A small part, however, is 'recycled' from degraded DNA of broken-down cells. This is termed the \\"salvage pathway\\". HGPRT is the \\"salvage enzyme\\" for the purines: it channels hypoxanthine and guanine back into DNA synthesis. Failure of this enzyme has two results: * Cell breakdown products cannot be reused, and are therefore degraded. This gives rise to increased uric acid, a purine breakdown product. * The de novo pathway is stimulated due to an excess of PRPP (5-phospho-D- ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate or simply phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate). It was previously unclear whether the neurological abnormalities in LNS were due to uric acid neurotoxicity or to a relative shortage in \\"new\\" purine nucleotides during essential synthesis steps. Genetic mutations affecting the enzymes of the de novo synthesis pathway may possibly contribute to the disease, although these are rare or unknown. Uric acid has been suggested as a possible cause of neurotoxicity but this is unproven. Importantly, evidence suggests that one or more lesions in striatal dopaminergic pathways may be central to the neurological deficits, especially the choreoathetoid dyskinesia and self- mutilation. 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity in rodents may be a useful animal model for the syndrome, although this is not proven. However, the link between dopamine and purine synthesis is a nucleotide called guanosine triphosphate or 'GTP'. The first step of dopamine synthesis is GTP cyclohydrolase, and significantly a deficiency of this step produces a syndrome that has a neuropathology similar to LNS. Thus a lack of HGPRT may produce a nucleotide deficiency (specifically: GTP deficiency) disorder, resulting in dopamine deficiency. Another animal model for LNS has been proposed to arise from oxidative damage, caused by the hyperuricemia accompanying LNS. This is based on the theory that uric acid is a powerful reducing agent and likely an important human antioxidant, in high concentration in blood. Thus, it has been suggested that free radicals, oxidative stress, and reactive oxygen species may play some role in the neuropathology of LNS. However, some evidence suggests against a role for uric acid in the neuropathology of Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome: * Hyperuricemia associated with classic primary gout, which is caused by low uric acid renal clearance rather than uric acid overproduction, is not associated with neuropathology. * Hypouricemia occurs in a number of purine disorders, in particular xanthinuria. Despite having complete absence of blood uric acid, xanthinuria patients do not have any neuropathology, nor any other disease states ‚Äì other than the kidney stones caused by accumulation of insoluble xanthine in lieu of uric acid. Similarly, uric acid does not penetrate the blood‚Äìbrain barrier well. However, oxidative stress due to uric acid is now thought to figure in metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, and stroke, all syndromes associated with high uric acid levels. Similarly, Superoxide dismutase ( \\"SOD\\" ) and SOD-mimetics such as TEMPOL ameliorate the effects of hyperuricemia. Likewise, 6-hydroxydopamine (the putative animal model for Lesch‚ÄìNyhan's neuropathy) apparently acts as a neurotoxin by generation of reactive oxygen species. It may be that oxidative stress induced by some other oxypurine such as xanthine causes the disease. Diagnosis When an affected individual has fully developed the three clinical elements of uric acid overproduction, neurologic dysfunction, and cognitive and behavioral disturbances, diagnosis of LNS is easily made. Diagnosis is less easy in the early stages, when the three features are not yet obvious. Signs of self- injurious behavior (SIB), results of pedigree analysis and novel molecular biology with genetic testing (called as Diagnostic triad for LNS), often confirms the diagnosis.https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/irdr/6/1/6_2016.01076/_pdf Suspicion often comes about when the developmental delay of the individual is associated with hyperuricemia. Otherwise, the diagnosis should be alleged when developmental delay is associated with kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) or blood in the urine (hematuria), caused by uric acid stones. For the most part, Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome is first suspected when self-inflicted injury behavior develops. However, self-injurious behaviors occur in other conditions, including nonspecific intellectual disability, autism, Rett syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Tourette syndrome, familial dysautonomia, choreoacanthocytosis, sensory neuropathy including hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1, and several psychiatric conditions. Of these, only individuals with Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome, de Lange syndrome, and familial dysautonomia recurrently display loss of tissue as a consequence. Biting the fingers and lips is a definitive feature of Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome; in other syndromes associated with self-injury, the behaviors usually consist of head banging and nonspecific self-mutilation, but not biting of the cheeks, lips and fingers. Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome ought to be clearly considered only when self-injurious behavior takes place in conjunction with hyperuricemia and neurological dysfunction. Diagnostic approach The urate to creatinine (breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle) concentration ratio in urine is elevated. This is a good indicator of acid overproduction. For children under ten years of age with LNS, a urate to creatinine ratio above two is typically found. Twenty-four-hour urate excretion of more than 20 mg/kg is also typical but is not diagnostic. Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration of >8 mg/dL) is often present but not reliable enough for diagnosis. Activity of the HGPRT enzyme in cells from any type of tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts) that is less than 1.5% of normal enzyme activity confirms the diagnosis of Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome. Molecular genetic studies of the HPRT gene mutations may confirm diagnosis, and are particularly helpful for subsequent 'carrier testing' in at-risk females such as close family relatives on the female side. Testing The use of biochemical testing for the detection of carriers is technically demanding and not often used. Biochemical analyses that have been performed on hair bulbs from at risk women have had a small number of both false positive and false negative outcomes. If only a suspected carrier female is available for mutation testing, it may be appropriate to grow her lymphocytes in 6-thioguanine (a purine analogue), which allows only HGPRT-deficient cells to survive. A mutant frequency of 0.5‚Äì5.0 √ó 10‚àí2 is found in carrier females, while a non-carrier female has a frequency of 1‚Äì20 √ó 10‚àí6. This frequency is usually diagnostic by itself. Molecular genetic testing is the most effective method of testing, as HPRT1 is the only gene known to be associated with LNS. Individuals who display the full Lesch‚ÄìNyhan phenotype all have mutations in the HPRT1 gene. Sequence analysis of mRNA is available clinically and can be utilized in order to detect HPRT1 mutations in males affected with Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome. Techniques such as RT-PCR, multiplex genomic PCR, and sequence analysis (cDNA and genomic DNA), used for the diagnosis of genetic diseases, are performed on a research basis. If RT-PCR tests result in cDNA showing the absence of an entire exon or exons, then multiplex genomic PCR testing is performed. Multiplex genomic PCR testing amplifies the nine exons of the HPRT1 gene as eight PCR products. If the exon in question is deleted, the corresponding band will be missing from the multiplex PCR. However, if the exon is present, the exon is sequenced to identify the mutation, therefore causing exclusion of the exon from cDNA. If no cDNA is created by RT-PCR, then multiplex PCR is performed on the notion that most or all of the gene is obliterated. Treatment Treatment for LNS is symptomatic. Gout can be treated with allopurinol to control excessive amounts of uric acid. Kidney stones may be treated with lithotripsy, a technique for breaking up kidney stones using shock waves or laser beams. There is no standard treatment for the neurological symptoms of LNS. Some may be relieved with the drugs carbidopa/levodopa, diazepam, phenobarbital, or haloperidol. It is essential that the overproduction of uric acid be controlled in order to reduce the risk of nephropathy, nephrolithiasis, and gouty arthritis. The drug allopurinol is utilized to stop the conversion of oxypurines into uric acid, and prevent the development of subsequent arthritic tophi (produced after having chronic gout), kidney stones, and nephropathy, the resulting kidney disease. Allopurinol is taken orally, at a typical dose of 3‚Äì20 mg/kg per day. The dose is then adjusted to bring the uric acid level down into the normal range (<3 mg/dL). Most affected individuals can be treated with allopurinol all through life. No medication is effective in controlling the extrapyramidal motor features of the disease. Spasticity, however, can be reduced by the administration of baclofen or benzodiazepines. There has previously been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with allopurinol develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed by a combination of medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The self- mutilation is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an effective management technique. Because stress increases self- injury, behavioral management through aversive techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self- injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are more at ease when restrained. The Matheny Medical and Educational Center in Peapack, NJ, has six Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome patients, believed to be the largest concentration of LNS cases in one location, and is recognized as the leading source of information on care issues. Treatment for LNS patients, according to Gary E. Eddey, MD, medical director, should include: 1) Judicious use of protective devices; 2) Utilization of a behavioral technique commonly referred to as 'selective ignoring' with redirection of activities; and 3) Occasional use of medications. An article in the August 13, 2007 issue of The New Yorker magazine, written by Richard Preston, discusses \\"deep-brain stimulation\\" as a possible treatment. It has been performed on a few patients with Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome by Dr. Takaomi Taira in Tokyo and by a group in France led by Dr. Philippe Coubes. Some patients experienced a decrease in spastic self-injurious symptoms. The technique was developed for treating people with Parkinson's disease, according to Preston, over 20 years ago. The treatment involves invasive surgery to place wires that carry a continuous electric current into a specific region of the brain. An encouraging advance in the treatment of the neurobehavioural aspects of LNS was the publication in the October, 2006 issue of Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease of an experimental therapy giving oral S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe). This drug is a nucleotide precursor that provides a readily absorbed purine, which is known to be transported across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Administration of SAMe to adult LNS patients was shown to provide improvement in neurobehavioural and other neurological attributes. The drug is available without prescription and has been widely used for depression, but its use for treating LNS should be undertaken only under strict medical supervision, as side effects are known. SAMe has also been used recently to treat another purine nucleotide disease, \\"Art's syndrome\\" (which is a PRPP disorder in common with LNS), with encouraging results. Thus SAMe may be useful for treating purine nucleotide diseases, which include LNS.  Prognosis  The prognosis for individuals with severe LNS is poor. Death is usually due to kidney failure or complications from hypotonia, in the first or second decade of life. Less severe forms have better prognoses. History Michael Lesch was a medical student at Johns Hopkins and William Nyhan, a pediatrician and biochemical geneticist, was his mentor when the two identified LNS and its associated hyperuricemia in two affected brothers, ages 4 and 8. Lesch and Nyhan published their findings in 1964. Within three years, the metabolic cause was identified by J. Edwin Seegmiller and his colleagues at the NIH.

Tobin Memorial Bridge (formerly and still sometimes referred to as the Mystic River Bridge or less often the Mystic/Tobin Bridge) is a cantilever truss bridge that spans more than two miles (3 km) from Boston to Chelsea over the Mystic River in Massachusetts. The bridge is the largest in New England. It is operated by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and carries U.S. Route 1. It was built between 1948 and 1950 and opened to traffic on February 2, 1950, replacing the former Chelsea Street Bridge. The 36-foot (11 m) wide roadway has three lanes of traffic on each of the two levels with Northbound traffic on the lower level and Southbound traffic on the upper level. Description The bridge is a three-span cantilevered truss bridge at 1,525 ft (465 m) in total length. The center span is longest at 800 ft (244 m) and the maximum truss height is 115 ft (35 m). There are 36 approach spans to the North and 32 to the South. The roadway is seven lanes wide between the shortest (439 ft; 134 m) span and the center to accommodate the now-unused toll plaza. The Northbound toll plaza was closed in the 1980s; the Southbound toll plaza was closed on July 21, 2014. History The bridge was originally operated by the Mystic River Bridge Authority. The bridge, according to the statute enacted May 23, 1946, would be turned over to the Massachusetts Department of Public Works once the $27 million in bonds used to finance the bridge's construction was retired. The bridge would then become part of the state highway system to be maintained and operated by the department free of tolls. Operation of the bridge was turned over to the new Massachusetts Port Authority in 1956. Instead of eliminating the tolls, the tolls were increased to 25 cents to cover the closing of the Northbound toll plaza in the 1980s. Starting in the early 1990s the tolls increased sharply to help pay for the Big Dig. As of October 28, 2016, the toll is $1.55 for non- commercial cars traveling in either direction ($1.25 with an E-ZPass issued by any toll agency, and $0.15 for registered residents of Charlestown and Chelsea with an E-ZPass). In 1967, the Mystic River Bridge was renamed in honor of Maurice J. Tobin, former Boston mayor and Massachusetts governor. Construction of the bridge began during his term as governor (1945‚Äì1947). Tobin went on to serve as Secretary of Labor under President Harry Truman before he died in 1953. In 1973, a gravel truck traveling over the lower deck crashed into a support, collapsing the upper deck onto the truck and killing the driver. Later that year, the bridge reopened after more than two months of repair. On January 4, 1990, racial hoaxer and double murderer Charles Stuart committed suicide by leaping from the bridge. Legislation was passed to transfer the bridge from Massport to the new Massachusetts Department of Transportation, effective January 1, 2010.Chapter 25 of the Acts of 2009. Section 144. Section 156(b) reallocates bridge tolls from Massport to MassDOT effective July 1, 2010. On the morning of July 21, 2014, the bridge's tollbooths were closed and eventually removed for an all-electronic and cashless tolling system, and from that point on all toll charges are paid for via either E-ZPass at the current rate, or \\"pay-by-mail\\" where an invoice will be sent to motorists‚Äô homes via license plate number recognition at the former cash toll rate. This inaugurated a 2¬Ω year process by MassDOT which converted all of the toll roads and bridges throughout the Commonwealth to automatic open road tolling. Restorations In September 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation announced a three-year $41.6 million project to restore the bridge deck, steel repairs, and painting a portion of the bridge. The first phase of work will start in April 2018 and run through November 2018 and will be conducted again during the months of April - November for the next two years, ending in 2020. The work will be done by J. F. White Contracting Co.

In accordance with creationism, species were once widely believed to be fixed products of divine creation, but since the mid-19th century, evolution by natural selection has been established by the scientific community as an empirical scientific fact. Any debate is universally considered religious, not scientific, by professional scientific organizations worldwide: in the scientific community, evolution is accepted as factIAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution Joint statement issued by the national science academies of 67 countries, including the United Kingdom's Royal Society (PDF file) and efforts to sustain the traditional view are almost universally regarded as pseudoscience. Whether ID Is Science, p. 83.: \\"Virtually no secular scientists accepted the doctrines of creation science; but that did not deter creation scientists from advancing scientific arguments for their position.\\" While the controversy has a long history, today it has retreated to be mainly over what constitutes good science education, Context, p. 20. with the politics of creationism primarily focusing on the teaching of creationism in public education. Introduction, pp. 7‚Äì9, also Whether ID Is Science, pp. 64‚Äì89, and Promoting Religion, p. 90. Among majority-Christian countries, the debate is most prominent in the United States, where it may be portrayed as part of a culture war. * : \\"One thing that historians delighted in showing is that, contrary to the usually held tale of science and religion being always opposed [Conflict thesis] ... religion and theologically inclined philosophy have frequently been very significant factors in the forward movement of science.\\" Parallel controversies also exist in some other religious communities, such as the more fundamentalist branches of Judaism and Islam. In Europe and elsewhere, creationism is less widespread (notably, the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion both accept evolution), and there is much less pressure to teach it as fact. Christian fundamentalists repudiate the evidence of common descent of humans and other animals as demonstrated in modern paleontology, genetics, histology and cladistics and those other sub-disciplines which are based upon the conclusions of modern evolutionary biology, geology, cosmology, and other related fields. They argue for the Abrahamic accounts of creation, and, in order to attempt to gain a place alongside evolutionary biology in the science classroom, have developed a rhetorical framework of \\"creation science\\". In the landmark Kitzmiller v. Dover, the purported basis of scientific creationism was judged to be a wholly religious construct without formal scientific merit. The Catholic Church now recognizes the existence of evolution (see Catholic Church and evolution). Pope Francis has stated: \\"God is not a demiurge or a magician, but the Creator who brought everything to life...Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.\\" The rules of genetic inheritance were first discovered by a Catholic priest, the Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel, who is known today as the founder of modern genetics. History The creation‚Äìevolution controversy began in Europe and North America in the late 18th century, when new interpretations of geological evidence led to various theories of an ancient Earth, and findings of extinctions demonstrated in the fossil geological sequence prompted early ideas of evolution, notably Lamarckism. In England these ideas of continuing change were at first seen as a threat to the existing \\"fixed\\" social order, and both church and state sought to repress them. Conditions gradually eased, and in 1844 Robert Chambers's controversial Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation popularized the idea of gradual transmutation of species. The scientific establishment at first dismissed it scornfully and the Church of England reacted with fury, but many Unitarians, Quakers and Baptists‚Äîgroups opposed to the privileges of the established church‚Äîfavoured its ideas of God acting through such natural laws. Contemporary reaction to Darwin A satirical image of Darwin as an ape from 1871 reflects part of the social controversy over the common lineage of humans and apes. Asa Gray around the time he published Darwiniana. The publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859 brought scientific credibility to evolution, and made it a respectable field of study. Despite the intense interest in the religious implications of Darwin's book, theological controversy over higher criticism set out in Essays and Reviews (1860) largely diverted the Church of England's attention. Some of the liberal Christian authors of that work expressed support for Darwin, as did many Nonconformists. The Reverend Charles Kingsley, for instance, openly supported the idea of God working through evolution. Other Christians opposed the idea, and even some of Darwin's close friends and supporters‚Äîincluding Charles Lyell and Asa Gray‚Äîinitially expressed reservations about some of his ideas. Gray later became a staunch supporter of Darwin in America, and collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876). These essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, at a time when many on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. * Gray said that investigation of physical causes was not opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it \\"most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies.\\" Thomas Huxley, who strongly promoted Darwin's ideas while campaigning to end the dominance of science by the clergy, coined the term agnostic to describe his position that God's existence is unknowable. Darwin also took this position, but prominent atheists including Edward Aveling and Ludwig B√ºchner also took up evolution and it was criticized, in the words of one reviewer, as \\"tantamount to atheism.\\" Following the lead of figures such as St. George Jackson Mivart and John Augustine Zahm, Roman Catholics in the United States became accepting of evolution itself while ambivalent towards natural selection and stressing humanity's divinely imbued soul. The Catholic Church never condemned evolution, and initially the more conservative-leaning Catholic leadership in Rome held back, but gradually adopted a similar position. During the late 19th century evolutionary ideas were most strongly disputed by the premillennialists, who held to a prophecy of the imminent return of Christ based on a form of Biblical literalism, and were convinced that the Bible would be invalidated if any error in the Scriptures was conceded. However, hardly any of the critics of evolution at that time were as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the Edenic creation to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings. In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth or the progressive nature of the fossil record. Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists. Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of the Book of Genesis, or allowed that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days., noting that this applies to published or public skeptics. Many Christians may have held on to a literal six days of creation, but these views rarely found expression in books and journals. Exceptions are also noted, such as literal interpretations published by Eleazar Lord (1788‚Äì1871), David Nevins Lord (1792‚Äì1880), and E. G. White (1829‚Äì1915). The observation that evolutionary critics had a relaxed interpretation of Genesis is supported by specifically enumerating: Louis Agassiz (1807‚Äì1873); Arnold Henry Guyot (1807‚Äì1884); John William Dawson (1820‚Äì1899); Enoch Fitch Burr (1818‚Äì1907); George D. Armstrong (1813‚Äì1899); Charles Hodge, theologian (1797‚Äì1878); James Dwight Dana (1813‚Äì1895); Edward Hitchcock, clergyman and Amherst College geologist, (1793‚Äì1864); Reverend Herbert W. Morris (1818‚Äì1897); H. L. Hastings (1833?‚Äì1899); Luther T. Townsend (1838‚Äì1922); Alexander Patterson, Presbyterian evangelist. Science professors at liberal northeastern universities almost immediately embraced the theory of evolution and introduced it to their students. However, some people in parts of the south and west of the United States, which had been influenced by the preachings of Christian fundamentalist evangelicals, rejected the theory as immoral. In the United Kingdom, Evangelical creationists were in a tiny minority. The Victoria Institute was formed in 1865 in response to Essays and Reviews and Darwin's On the Origin of Species. It was not officially opposed to evolution theory, but its main founder James Reddie objected to Darwin's work as \\"inharmonious\\" and \\"utterly incredible\\", and Philip Henry Gosse, author of Omphalos, was a vice- president. The institute's membership increased to 1897, then declined sharply. In the 1920s George McCready Price attended and made several presentations of his creationist views, which found little support among the members. In 1927 John Ambrose Fleming was made president; while he insisted on creation of the soul, his acceptance of divinely guided development and of Pre-Adamite humanity meant he was thought of as a theistic evolutionist. Creationism in theology At the beginning of the 19th century debate had started to develop over applying historical methods to Biblical criticism, suggesting a less literal account of the Bible. Simultaneously, the developing science of geology indicated the Earth was ancient, and religious thinkers sought to accommodate this by day-age creationism or gap creationism. Neptunianist catastrophism, which had in the 17th and 18th centuries proposed that a universal flood could explain all geological features, gave way to ideas of geological gradualism (introduced in 1795 by James Hutton) based upon the erosion and depositional cycle over millions of years, which gave a better explanation of the sedimentary column. Biology and the discovery of extinction (first described in the 1750s and put on a firm footing by Georges Cuvier in 1796) challenged ideas of a fixed immutable Aristotelian \\"great chain of being.\\" Natural theology had earlier expected that scientific findings based on empirical evidence would help religious understanding. Emerging differences led some to increasingly regard science and theology as concerned with different, non-competitive domains. When most scientists came to accept evolution (by around 1875), European theologians generally came to accept evolution as an instrument of God. For instance, Pope Leo XIII (in office 1878‚Äì1903) referred to longstanding Christian thought that scriptural interpretations could be reevaluated in the light of new knowledge, and Roman Catholics came around to acceptance of human evolution subject to direct creation of the soul. In the United States the development of the racist Social Darwinian eugenics movement by certain circles led a number of Catholics to reject evolution. In this enterprise they received little aid from conservative Christians in Great Britain and Europe. In Britain this has been attributed to their minority status leading to a more tolerant, less militant theological tradition. This continues to the present. In his speech at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 2014, Pope Francis declared that he accepted the Big Bang theory and the theory of evolution and that God was not \\"a magician with a magic wand\\". Development of creationism in the United States A Fundamentalist cartoon portraying Modernism as the descent from Christianity to atheism, first published in 1922. At first in the U.S., evangelical Christians paid little attention to the developments in geology and biology, being more concerned with the rise of European higher Biblical criticism which questioned the belief in the Bible as literal truth. Those criticizing these approaches took the name \\"fundamentalist\\"‚Äîoriginally coined by its supporters to describe a specific package of theological beliefs that developed into a movement within the Protestant community of the United States in the early part of the 20th century, and which had its roots in the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s. The term in a religious context generally indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs. Up until the early mid-20th century, mainline Christian denominations within the United States showed little official resistance to evolution. Around the start of the 20th century some evangelical scholars had ideas accommodating evolution, such as B. B. Warfield who saw it as a natural law expressing God's will. By then most U.S. high-school and college biology classes taught scientific evolution, but several factors, including the rise of Christian fundamentalism and social factors of changes and insecurity in more traditionalist Bible Belt communities, led to a backlash. The numbers of children receiving secondary education increased rapidly, and parents who had fundamentalist tendencies or who opposed social ideas of what was called \\"survival of the fittest\\" had real concerns about what their children were learning about evolution. British creationism The main British creationist movement in this period, the Evolution Protest Movement (EPM), formed in the 1930s out of the Victoria Institute, or Philosophical Society of Great Britain (founded in 1865 in response to the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859 and of Essays and Reviews in 1860). The Victoria Institute had the stated objective of defending \\"the great truths revealed in Holy Scripture ... against the opposition of Science falsely so called\\". Although it did not officially oppose evolution, it attracted a number of scientists skeptical of Darwinism, including John William Dawson and Arnold Guyot. It reached a high point of 1,246 members in 1897, but quickly plummeted to less than one third of that figure in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Although it opposed evolution at first, the institute joined the theistic evolution camp by the 1920s, which led to the development of the Evolution Protest Movement in reaction. Amateur ornithologist Douglas Dewar, the main driving-force within the EPM, published a booklet entitled Man: A Special Creation (1936) and engaged in public speaking and debates with supporters of evolution. In the late 1930s he resisted American creationists' call for acceptance of flood geology, which later led to conflict within the organization. Despite trying to win the public endorsement of C. S. Lewis (1898‚Äì1963), the most prominent Christian apologist of his day, by the mid-1950s the EPM came under control of schoolmaster/pastor Albert G. Tilney, whose dogmatic and authoritarian style ran the organization \\"as a one-man band\\", rejecting flood geology, unwaveringly promoting gap creationism, and reducing the membership to lethargic inactivity. It was renamed the Creation Science Movement (CSM) in 1980, under the chairmanship of David Rosevear, who holds a Ph.D. in organometallic chemistry from the University of Bristol. By the mid-1980s the CSM had formally incorporated flood geology into its \\"Deed of Trust\\" (which all officers had to sign) and condemned gap creationism and day-age creationism as unscriptural. United States legal challenges and their consequences In 1925 Tennessee passed a statute, the Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution in all schools in the state. Later that year Mississippi passed a similar law, as did Arkansas in 1927. In 1968 the Supreme Court of the United States struck down these \\"anti- monkey\\" laws as unconstitutional, \\"because they established a religious doctrine violating both the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\\" In more recent times religious fundamentalists who accept creationism have struggled to get their rejection of evolution accepted as legitimate science within education institutions in the U.S. A series of important court cases has resulted.  Butler Act and the Scopes monkey trial (1925)  Anti-Evolution League at the Scopes Trial After 1918, in the aftermath of World War I, the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist controversy had brought a surge of opposition to the idea of evolution, and following the campaigning of William Jennings Bryan several states introduced legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution. By 1925, such legislation was being considered in 15 states, and had passed in some states, such as Tennessee.Similar legislation passed in two other states prior to the Scopes trial‚Äîin Oklahoma and in Florida. After the Scopes trial of July 1925 legislators abandoned efforts to enact \\"Butler Acts\\" in other jurisdictions. See: * Describes the Florida and Oklahoma acts. * The American Civil Liberties Union offered to defend anyone who wanted to bring a test case against one of these laws. John T. Scopes accepted, and confessed to teaching his Tennessee class evolution in defiance of the Butler Act, using the textbook by George William Hunter: A Civic Biology: Presented in Problems (1914). The trial, widely publicized by H. L. Mencken among others, is commonly referred to as the Scopes Monkey Trial. The court convicted Scopes, but the widespread publicity galvanized proponents of evolution. Following an appeal of the case to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Court overturned the decision on a technicality (the judge had assessed the minimum $100 fine instead of allowing the jury to assess the fine). The statute required a minimum fine of $100, and the state Constitution required all fines over $50 to be assessed by a jury. Although it overturned the conviction, the Court decided that the Butler Act was not in violation of the Religious Preference provisions of the Tennessee Constitution (Section 3 of Article 1), which stated \\"that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship\\".The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution was not, at the time of the Scopes decision in the 1920s, deemed applicable to the states. Thus, Scopes' constitutional defense on establishment grounds rested solely on the state constitution. See: * . See generally Incorporation doctrine and Everson v. Board of Education (seminal U.S. Supreme Court opinion finally applying the Establishment Clause against states in 1947). * Review of Edward J. Larson's book Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion (1997). ** Cantwell v. Connecticut. 1940 Supreme Court case stating that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and is therefore applicable against the states. ** . Explains incorporation doctrine relative to First Amendment. ** The Court, applying that state constitutional language, held: The interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution up to that time held that the government could not establish a particular religion as the State religion. The Tennessee Supreme Court's decision held in effect that the Butler Act was constitutional under the state Constitution's Religious Preference Clause, because the Act did not establish one religion as the \\"State religion\\".. The Court stated in its opinion that \\"England and Scotland maintained State churches as did some of the Colonies, and it was intended by this clause of the Constitution [the Religious Preference Clause] to prevent any such undertaking in Tennessee.\\" As a result of the holding, the teaching of evolution remained illegal in Tennessee, and continued campaigning succeeded in removing evolution from school textbooks throughout the United States. Context, p. 19.  Epperson v. Arkansas (1968)  In 1968 the United States Supreme Court invalidated a forty-year-old Arkansas statute that prohibited the teaching of evolution in the public schools. A Little Rock, Arkansas, high-school-biology teacher, Susan Epperson, filed suit, charging that the law violated the federal constitutional prohibition against establishment of religion as set forth in the Establishment Clause. The Little Rock Ministerial Association supported Epperson's challenge, declaring, \\"to use the Bible to support an irrational and an archaic concept of static and undeveloping creation is not only to misunderstand the meaning of the Book of Genesis, but to do God and religion a disservice by making both enemies of scientific advancement and academic freedom\\". The Court held that the United States Constitution prohibits a state from requiring, in the words of the majority opinion, \\"that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma\\".* But the Supreme Court decision also suggested that creationism could be taught in addition to evolution.  Daniel v. Waters (1975)  Daniel v. Waters was a 1975 legal case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit struck down Tennessee's law regarding the teaching of \\"equal time\\" of evolution and creationism in public-school science classes because it violated the Establishment Clause. Following this ruling, creationism was stripped of overt biblical references and rebranded \\"Creation Science\\", and several states passed legislative acts requiring that this be given equal time with the teaching of evolution. Creation science Detail of Noah's Ark, oil painting by Edvard Hicks (1846) As biologists grew more and more confident in evolution as the central defining principle of biology, American membership in churches favoring increasingly literal interpretations of scripture also rose, with the Southern Baptist Convention and Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod outpacing all other denominations. With growth and increased finances, these churches became better equipped to promulgate a creationist message, with their own colleges, schools, publishing houses, and broadcast media. In 1961 Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing released the first major modern creationist book: John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris' influential The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications. The authors argued that creation was literally 6 days long, that humans lived concurrently with dinosaurs, and that God created each \\"kind\\" of life individually. On the strength of this, Morris became a popular speaker, spreading anti-evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches, colleges, and conferences. Morris' Creation Science Research Center (CSRC) rushed publication of biology textbooks that promoted creationism. Ultimately, the CSRC broke up over a divide between sensationalism and a more intellectual approach, and Morris founded the Institute for Creation Research, which was promised to be controlled and operated by scientists. During this time, Morris and others who supported flood geology adopted the terms \\"scientific creationism\\" and \\"creation science\\".: \\"Fundamentalists no longer merely denounced Darwinism as false; they offered a scientific-sounding alternative of their own, which they called either 'scientific creationism (as distinct from religious creationism) or 'creation science' (as opposed to evolution science).\\" The \\"flood geology\\" theory effectively co-opted \\"the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views.\\" Court cases =McLean v. Arkansas= In 1982, another case in Arkansas ruled that the Arkansas \\"Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act\\" (Act 590) was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause. Much of the transcript of the case was lost, including evidence from Francisco Ayala. =Edwards v. Aguillard= In the early 1980s, the Louisiana legislature passed a law titled the \\"Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act\\". The act did not require teaching either evolution or creationism as such, but did require that when evolutionary science was taught, creation science had to be taught as well. Creationists had lobbied aggressively for the law, arguing that the act was about academic freedom for teachers, an argument adopted by the state in support of the act. Lower courts ruled that the State's actual purpose was to promote the religious doctrine of creation science, but the State appealed to the Supreme Court. In the similar case of McLean v. Arkansas (see above) the federal trial court had also decided against creationism. Mclean v. Arkansas was not appealed to the federal Circuit Court of Appeals, creationists instead thinking that they had better chances with Edwards v. Aguillard. In 1987 the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Louisiana act was also unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. At the same time, it stated its opinion that \\"teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction\\", leaving open the door for a handful of proponents of creation science to evolve their arguments into the iteration of creationism that later came to be known as intelligent design. Introduction, pp. 7‚Äì9. Intelligent design The Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture used banners based on The Creation of Adam from the Sistine Chapel. Later it used a less religious image, then was renamed the Center for Science and Culture. In response to Edwards v. Aguillard, the neo-creationist intelligent design movement was formed around the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. It makes the claim that \\"certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.\\" It has been viewed as a \\"scientific\\" approach to creationism by creationists, but is widely rejected as pseudoscience by the science community‚Äîprimarily because intelligent design cannot be tested and rejected like scientific hypotheses (see for example, List of scientific bodies explicitly rejecting intelligent design). Kansas evolution hearings In the push by intelligent design advocates to introduce intelligent design in public school science classrooms, the hub of the intelligent design movement, the Discovery Institute, arranged to conduct hearings to review the evidence for evolution in the light of its Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans. The Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in Topeka, Kansas, May 5 to May 12, 2005. The Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted the institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and electioneering on behalf of conservative Republican Party candidates for the Board. On August 1, 2006, four of the six conservative Republicans who approved the Critical Analysis of Evolution classroom standards lost their seats in a primary election. The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board, and on February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. The definition of science was once again limited to \\"the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe.\\" Dover trial Following the Edwards v. Aguillard decision by the United States Supreme Court, in which the Court held that a Louisiana law requiring that creation science be taught in public schools whenever evolution was taught was unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion, creationists renewed their efforts to introduce creationism into public school science classes. This effort resulted in intelligent design, which sought to avoid legal prohibitions by leaving the source of creation to an unnamed and undefined intelligent designer, as opposed to God. This ultimately resulted in the \\"Dover Trial,\\" Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, which went to trial on 26 September 2005 and was decided on 20 December 2005 in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught in public school science classrooms was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The Kitzmiller v. Dover decision held that intelligent design was not a subject of legitimate scientific research, and that it \\"cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and hence religious, antecedents.\\" Curriculum, Conclusion, p. 136. The December 2005 ruling in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial supported the viewpoint of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and other science and education professional organizations who say that proponents of Teach the Controversy seek to undermine the teaching of evolution Disclaimer, p. 49: \\"In summary, the disclaimer singles out the theory of evolution for special treatment, misrepresents its status in the scientific community, causes students to doubt its validity without scientific justification, presents students with a religious alternative masquerading as a scientific theory, directs them to consult a creationist text as though it were a science resource, and instructs students to forgo scientific inquiry in the public school classroom and instead to seek out religious instruction elsewhere.\\" while promoting intelligent design, Dembski's response to Eugenie Scott's February 12, 2001, essay published by Metanexus, \\"The Big Tent and the Camel's Nose.\\" and to advance an education policy for U.S. public schools that introduces creationist explanations for the origin of life to public-school science curricula. Whether ID Is Science, p. 89, support the view that \\"ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID.\\" Curriculum, Conclusion, p. 134. Texas Board of Education support for intelligent design On March 27, 2009, the Texas Board of Education, by a vote of 13 to 2, voted that at least in Texas, textbooks must teach intelligent design alongside evolution, and question the validity of the fossil record. Don McLeroy, a dentist and chair of the board, said, \\"I think the new standards are wonderful ... dogmatism about evolution [has sapped] America's scientific soul.\\" According to Science magazine, \\"Because Texas is the second-largest textbook market in the United States, publishers have a strong incentive to be certified by the board as 'conforming 100% to the state's standards'.\\" The 2009 Texas Board of Education hearings were chronicled in the 2012 documentary The Revisionaries. Recent developments The scientific consensus on the origins and evolution of life continues to be challenged by creationist organizations and religious groups who desire to uphold some form of creationism (usually Young Earth creationism, creation science, Old Earth creationism or intelligent design) as an alternative. Most of these groups are literalist Christians who believe the biblical account is inerrant, and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to evangelize. Some groups see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views that cannot be reconciled. More accommodating viewpoints, held by many mainstream churches and many scientists, consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought (non-overlapping magisteria), which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and posit different avenues for investigating it., and , summarizing Gould. This idea has received criticism from both the non-religious, like the zoologist, evolutionary biologist and religion critic Richard Dawkins, and fundamentalists, who see the idea as both underestimating the ability of methodological naturalism to result in moral conclusions and ignorant or downplaying of the fact claims of religions and scriptures. Studies on the religious beliefs of scientists does support the evidence of a rift between traditional literal fundamentalist religion and experimental science. Three studies of scientific attitudes since 1904 have shown that over 80% of scientists do not believe in a traditional god or the traditional belief in immortality, with disbelief stronger amongst biological scientists than physical scientists. Amongst those not registering such attitudes a high percentage indicated a preference for adhering to a belief concerning mystery than any dogmatic or faith based view. But only 10% of scientists stated that they saw a fundamental clash between science and religion. This study of trends over time suggests that the \\"culture wars\\" between creationism against evolution, are held more strongly by religious literalists than by scientists themselves and are likely to continue, fostering anti-scientific or pseudoscientific attitudes amongst fundamentalist believers. More recently, the intelligent design movement has attempted an anti-evolution position that avoids any direct appeal to religion. Scientists have argued that intelligent design is pseudoscience and does not represent any research program within the mainstream scientific community, and is still essentially creationism. Its leading proponent, the Discovery Institute, made widely publicized claims that it was a new science, although the only paper arguing for it published in a scientific journal was accepted in questionable circumstances and quickly disavowed in the Sternberg peer review controversy, with the Biological Society of Washington stating that it did not meet the journal's scientific standards, was a \\"significant departure\\" from the journal's normal subject area and was published at the former editor's sole discretion, \\"contrary to typical editorial practices.\\" On August 1, 2005, U.S. president George W. Bush commented endorsing the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution \\"I felt like both sides ought to be properly taught ... so people can understand what the debate is about.\\" Viewpoints In the controversy a number of divergent opinions have crystallized regarding both the acceptance of scientific theories and religious doctrine and practice. Young-Earth creationism Young-Earth creationism (YEC) involves the religiously-based belief that God created the Earth within the last 10,000 years, literally as described in Genesis, within the approximate timeframe of biblical genealogies (detailed - for example - in the Ussher chronology). Young-Earth creationists often believe that the universe has a similar age to that of the Earth. Creationist cosmologies result from attempts by some creationists to assign the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other Young- Earth timeframes based on the genealogies. This belief generally has a basis in biblical literalism and completely rejects the scientific methodology of evolutionary biology; creation science is agreed by the scientific community to be a pseudoscience that attempts to prove that Young Earth creationism is consistent with science.NAS 1999, p. ix Compare: Old-Earth creationism Old-Earth creationism holds that God created the physical universe, but that one should not take the creation event of Genesis within 6 days strictly literally. This group generally accepts the age of the Universe and the age of the Earth as described by astronomers and geologists, but regards details of the evolutionary theory as questionable. Old-Earth creationists interpret the Genesis creation-narrative in a number of ways, each differing from the six, consecutive, 24-hour day creation of the Young-Earth creationist view. Neo- creationism and \\"intelligent design\\" Neo-creationists intentionally distance themselves from other forms of creationism, preferring to be known as wholly separate from creationism as a philosophy. They wish to re-frame the debate over the origins of life in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture, and to bring the debate before the public. Neo-creationists may be either Young Earth or Old Earth creationists, and hold a range of underlying theological viewpoints (e.g. on the interpretation of the Bible). , neo- creationism underlies the intelligent-design movement, which has a \\"big tent\\" strategy making it inclusive of many Young-Earth creationists (such as Paul Nelson and Percival Davis) and some sympathetic Old-Earth creationists. Theistic evolution Theistic evolution takes the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about God and creation are compatible with some or all of modern scientific theory, including, specifically, evolution. It generally views evolution as a tool used by a creator god, who is both the first cause and immanent sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well-accepted by people of strong theistic (as opposed to deistic) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the day-age interpretation of the Genesis creation myth; most adherents consider that the first chapters of Genesis should not be interpreted as a \\"literal\\" description, but rather as a literary framework or allegory. This position generally accepts the viewpoint of methodological naturalism, a long-standing convention of the scientific method in science. Many mainline/liberal denominations have long accepted evolution, and it is increasingly finding acceptance among evangelical Christians, who strive to keep traditional Christian theology intact. Theistic evolutionists have frequently been prominent in opposing creationism (including intelligent design). Notable examples have included biologist Kenneth R. Miller and theologian John F. Haught, who testified for the plaintiffs in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005. Another example is the Clergy Letter Project, which has compiled and maintains statements - signed by American Christian and non-Christian clergy of different denominations - rejecting creationism, with specific reference to points raised by intelligent-design proponents. Theistic evolutionists have also been active in Citizens Alliances for Science that oppose the introduction of creationism into public-school science classes (one example being evangelical Christian geologist Keith B. Miller, who is a prominent board member of Kansas Citizens for Science). Agnostic evolution Agnostic evolution is the position of acceptance of biological evolution, combined with the belief that it is not important whether God is, was, or will have been involved. Materialistic evolution Materialistic evolution is the acceptance of biological evolution, combined with the position that if the supernatural exists, it has little to no influence on the material world (a position common to philosophical naturalists, humanists and atheists). The New Atheists champion this view; they argue strongly that the creationist viewpoint is not only dangerous, but is completely rejected by science. Arguments relating to the definition and limits of science Critiques such as those based on the distinction between theory and fact are often leveled against unifying concepts within scientific disciplines. Principles such as uniformitarianism, Occam's razor or parsimony, and the Copernican principle are claimed to be the result of a bias within science toward philosophical naturalism, which is equated by many creationists with atheism.; ; ; . Peters and Hewlett argue that the atheism of many evolutionary supporters must be removed from the debate. In countering this claim, philosophers of science use the term methodological naturalism to refer to the long-standing convention in science of the scientific method. The methodological assumption is that observable events in nature are explained only by natural causes, without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and therefore supernatural explanations for such events are outside the realm of science. Creationists claim that supernatural explanations should not be excluded and that scientific work is paradigmatically close-minded. Because modern science tries to rely on the minimization of a priori assumptions, error, and subjectivity, as well as on avoidance of Baconian idols, it remains neutral on subjects such as religion or morality. Mainstream proponents accuse the creationists of conflating the two in a form of pseudoscience. Theory vs. fact The argument that evolution is a theory, not a fact, has often been made against the exclusive teaching of evolution.   The argument is related to a common misconception about the technical meaning of \\"theory\\" that is used by scientists. In common usage, \\"theory\\" often refers to conjectures, hypotheses, and unproven assumptions. In science, \\"theory\\" usually means \\"a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses.\\"NAS 1999, p. 2 For comparison, the National Academy of Sciences defines a fact as \\"an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true'.\\" It notes, however, that \\"truth in science ... is never final, and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded tomorrow.\\" Exploring this issue, paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote: Falsifiability Karl Popper in the 1980s. Philosopher of science Karl R. Popper set out the concept of falsifiability as a way to distinguish science and pseudoscience: testable theories are scientific, but those that are untestable are not. * In Unended Quest, Popper declared \\"I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a metaphysical research programme, a possible framework for testable scientific theories,\\" while pointing out it had \\"scientific character.\\", quoted in In what one sociologist derisively called \\"Popper-chopping,\\"Unknown sociologist quoted in opponents of evolution seized upon Popper's definition to claim evolution was not a science, and claimed creationism was an equally valid metaphysical research program. as quoted by For example, Duane Gish, a leading Creationist proponent, wrote in a letter to Discover magazine (July 1981): \\"Stephen Jay Gould states that creationists claim creation is a scientific theory. This is a false accusation. Creationists have repeatedly stated that neither creation nor evolution is a scientific theory (and each is equally religious).\\" \\"Stephen Jay Gould states that creationists claim creation is a scientific theory,\\" wrote Gish in a letter to Discover magazine (July 1981). \\"This is a false accusation. Creationists have repeatedly stated that neither creation nor evolution is a scientific theory (and each is equally religious).\\" Popper responded to news that his conclusions were being used by anti-evolutionary forces by affirming that evolutionary theories regarding the origins of life on earth were scientific because \\"their hypotheses can in many cases be tested.\\" Creationists claimed that a key evolutionary concept, that all life on Earth is descended from a single common ancestor, was not mentioned as testable by Popper, and claimed it never would be. In fact, Popper wrote admiringly of the value of Darwin's theory. Only a few years later, Popper wrote, \\"I have in the past described the theory as 'almost tautological' ... I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation.\\" His conclusion, later in the article is \\"The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true.\\" * Debate among some scientists and philosophers of science on the applicability of falsifiability in science continues., which discusses conflicting ideas about science among Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, and their disciples. Simple falsifiability tests for common descent have been offered by some scientists: for instance, biologist and prominent critic of creationism Richard Dawkins and J. B. S. Haldane both pointed out that if fossil rabbits were found in the Precambrian era, a time before most similarly complex lifeforms had evolved, \\"that would completely blow evolution out of the water.\\"As quoted by . Also see and , p. 6. Richard Dawkins quoting J. B. S. Haldane. Falsifiability has caused problems for creationists: in his 1982 decision McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education, Judge William R. Overton used falsifiability as one basis for his ruling against the teaching of creation science in the public schools, ultimately declaring it \\"simply not science.\\" Conflation of science and religion Creationists commonly argue against evolution on the grounds that \\"evolution is a religion; it is not a science,\\" in order to undermine the higher ground biologists claim in debating creationists, and to reframe the debate from being between science (evolution) and religion (creationism) to being between two equally religious beliefs‚Äîor even to argue that evolution is religious while intelligent design is not. Those that oppose evolution frequently refer to supporters of evolution as \\"evolutionists\\" or \\"Darwinists.\\" This is generally argued by analogy, by arguing that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, that supporters of evolution revere Darwin as a prophet, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of- hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neocreationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy. In response, supporters of evolution have argued that no scientist's claims, including Darwin's, are treated as sacrosanct, as shown by the aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years, to form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. Appeal to consequences A number of creationists have blurred the boundaries between their disputes over the truth of the underlying facts, and explanatory theories, of evolution, with their purported philosophical and moral consequences. This type of argument is known as an appeal to consequences, and is a logical fallacy. Examples of these arguments include those of prominent creationists such as Ken Ham \\"Why has the Lord raised up Creation Science ministries worldwide? Why is it necessary to have such organizations? One thing we have come to realize in Creation Science is that the Lord has not just called us to knock down evolution, but to help in restoring the foundation of the Gospel in our society. We believe that if the churches took up the tool of Creation Evangelism in society, not only would we see a stemming of the tide of humanistic philosophy, but we would also see the seeds of revival sown in a culture which is becoming increasingly more pagan each day. [...] It is also worth noting the comment in the book, 'By Their Blood-Christian Martyrs of the 20th Century' (Most Media) by James and Marti Helfi, on page 49 and 50: 'New philosophies and theologies from the West also helped to erode Chinese confidence in Christianity. A new wave of so-called missionaries from mainline Protestant denominations came teaching evolution and a non- supernatural view of the Bible. Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Northern Baptist schools were especially hard hit. Bertrand Russell came from England preaching atheism and socialism. Destructive books brought by such teachers further undermined orthodox Christianity. The Chinese Intelligentsia who had been schooled by Orthodox Evangelical Missionaries were thus softened for the advent of Marxism.' Evolution is destroying the Church and society, and Christians need to be awakened to that fact!\\" [emphasis in the original] and Henry M. Morris. \\"‚Ä¶I want to list seventeen summary statements which, if true, provide abundant reason why the reader should reject evolution and accept special creation as his basic world-view. ‚Ä¶ 13\\\\. Belief in special creation has a salutary influence on mankind, since it encourages responsible obedience to the Creator and considerate recognition of those who were created by Him. ‚Ä¶ 16\\\\. Belief in evolution and animal kinship leads normally to selfishness, aggressiveness, and fighting between groups, as well as animalistic attitudes and behaviour by individuals.\\" ‚Äî Henry M. Morris, The Remarkable Birth of Planet Earth (Creation-Life Publishers, 1972), pp. vi‚Äìviii.\\" Disputes relating to science Many creationists strongly oppose certain scientific theories in a number of ways, including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes, accusations of bias within the scientific community,. Johnson cites three pages spent in Isaac Asimov's New Guide to Science that take creationists to task, while only spending one half page on evidence of evolution. and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis. In response to perceived crises in modern science, creationists claim to have an alternative, typically based on faith, creation science, or intelligent design. The scientific community has responded by pointing out that their conversations are frequently misrepresented (e.g. by quote mining) in order to create the impression of a deeper controversy or crisis, and that the creationists' alternatives are generally pseudoscientific. Biology Disputes relating to evolutionary biology are central to the controversy between creationists and the scientific community. The aspects of evolutionary biology disputed include common descent (and particularly human evolution from common ancestors with other members of the great apes), macroevolution, and the existence of transitional fossils. Common descent A group of organisms is said to have common descent if they have a common ancestor. A theory of universal common descent based on evolutionary principles was proposed by Charles Darwin and is now generally accepted by biologists. The most recent common ancestor of all living organisms is believed to have appeared about 3.9 billion years ago. With a few exceptions (e.g. Michael Behe) the vast majority of creationists rejected this theory in favor of the belief that a common design suggests a common designer (God). Many of these same creationists through the beginning of the 21st century also held that modern species were perpetually fixed from creation. However, now a large amount of creationists allow evolution of species, in the face of undeniable evidence for speciation. They contend, however, that it was specific \\"kinds\\" or baramin that were created initially, from which all present-day species arose. Thus all bear species may have developed from a common ancestor that was separately created to establish a bear-like baramin, by this type of creationism. This type of creationism often acknowledges the existence of evolutionary processes but denies that they demonstrate common ancestry or that evolutionary processes would have produced the diversity of contemporary life. Evidence of common descent includes evidence from genetics, fossil records, comparative anatomy, geographical distribution of species, comparative physiology and comparative biochemistry. =Human evolution= Overview of speciation and hybridization within the genus Homo over the last two million years. Human evolution is the study of the biological evolution of humans as a distinct species from its common ancestors with other animals. Analysis of fossil evidence and genetic distance are two of the means by which scientists understand this evolutionary history. Fossil evidence suggests that humans' earliest hominid ancestors may have split from other primates as early as the late Oligocene, circa 26 to 24 Ma, and that by the early Miocene, the adaptive radiation of many different hominoid forms was well underway. Evidence from the molecular dating of genetic differences indicates that the gibbon lineage (family Hylobatidae) diverged between 18 and 12 Ma, and the orangutan lineage (subfamily Ponginae) diverged about 12 Ma. While there is no fossil evidence thus far clearly documenting the early ancestry of gibbons, fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by Sivapithecus from India and Griphopithecus from Turkey, dated to around 10 Ma. Molecular evidence further suggests that between 8 and 4 Ma, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzee (genus Pan) split from the line leading to the humans. We have no fossil record of this divergence, but distinctively hominid fossils have been found dating to 3.2 Ma (see Lucy) and possibly even earlier, at 6 or 7 Ma (see Touma√Ø). Comparisons of DNA show that 99.4 percent of the coding regions are identical in chimpanzees and humans (95‚Äì96% overall), which is taken as strong evidence of recent common ancestry. * Today, only one distinct human species survives, but many earlier species have been found in the fossil record, including Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Homo neanderthalensis. Creationists dispute there is evidence of shared ancestry in the fossil evidence, and argue either that these are misassigned ape fossils (e.g. that Java Man was a gibbon) or too similar to modern humans to designate them as distinct or transitional forms. Creationists frequently disagree where the dividing lines would be. Creation myths (such as the Book of Genesis) frequently posit a first man (Adam, in the case of Genesis), which has been advocated by creationists as underlying an alternative viewpoint to the scientific account. All these claims and objections are subsequently refuted. Creationists also dispute the scientific community's interpretation of genetic evidence in the study of human evolution. They argue that it is a \\"dubious assumption\\" that genetic similarities between various animals imply a common ancestral relationship, and that scientists are coming to this interpretation only because they have preconceived notions that such shared relationships exist. Creationists also argue that genetic mutations are strong evidence against evolutionary theory because, they assert, the mutations required for major changes to occur would almost certainly be detrimental. However, most mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another. Macroevolution A phylogenetic tree showing the three-domain system. Eukaryotes are colored red, archaea green, and bacteria blue. In biology, macroevolution refers to evolution at and above the species level, including most of fossil history and much of systematics. microevolution refers to the process in evolution within populations, including adaptive and neutral evolution. However, there is no fundamental distinction between these processes; small changes compound over time and eventually lead to speciation. Creationists argue that a finite number of discrete kinds were created, as described in the Book of Genesis, and these kinds determine the limits of variation. Early Creationists equated kinds with species, but most now accept that speciation can occur: not only is the evidence overwhelming for speciation, but the millions of species now in existence could not have fit in Noah's Ark, as depicted in Genesis. Created kinds identified by creationists are more generally on the level of the family (for example, Canidae), but the genus Homo is a separate kind. A Creationist systematics called Baraminology builds on the idea of created kind, calling it a baramin. While evolutionary systematics is used to explore relationships between organisms by descent, baraminology attempts to find discontinuities between groups of organisms. It employs many of the tools of evolutionary systematics, but Biblical criteria for taxonomy take precedence over all other criteria. This undermines their claim to objectivity: they accept evidence for the common ancestry of cats or dogs but not analogous evidence for the common ancestry of apes and humans. Recent arguments against macroevolution (in the Creationist sense) include the intelligent design (ID) arguments of irreducible complexity and specified complexity. Neither argument has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, and both arguments have been rejected by the scientific community as pseudoscience. When taken to court in an attempt to introduce ID into the classroom, the judge wrote \\"The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory.\\" Transitional fossils It is commonly stated by critics of evolution that there are no known transitional fossils. This position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. It is plausible that a complex feature with one function can adapt a different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been used for gliding, trapping flying prey, or mating display. Today, wings can still have all of these functions, but they are also used in active flight. Reconstruction of Ambulocetus natans As another example, Alan Hayward stated in Creation and Evolution (1985) that \\"Darwinists rarely mention the whale because it presents them with one of their most insoluble problems. They believe that somehow a whale must have evolved from an ordinary land-dwelling animal, which took to the sea and lost its legs ... A land mammal that was in the process of becoming a whale would fall between two stools‚Äîit would not be fitted for life on land or at sea, and would have no hope for survival.\\" Gould quotes from . The evolution of whales has been documented in considerable detail, with Ambulocetus, described as looking like a three-metre long mammalian crocodile, as one of the transitional fossils. Although transitional fossils elucidate the evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due to the special circumstances required for preservation of living beings, only a very small percentage of all life-forms that ever have existed can be expected to be discovered. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but it will never be known in detail. Progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so. Critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient way to explain off the lack of 'snapshot' fossils that show crucial steps between species. The theory of punctuated equilibrium developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils. This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature the size of a mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over 60,000 years, with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime. 60,000 years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record. Experts in evolutionary theory have pointed out that even if it were possible for enough fossils to survive to show a close transitional change critics will never be satisfied, as the discovery of one \\"missing link\\" itself creates two more so-called \\"missing links\\" on either side of the discovery. Richard Dawkins says that the reason for this \\"losing battle\\" is that many of these critics are theists who \\"simply don't want to see the truth.\\" Geology Many believers in Young Earth creationism‚Äîa position held by the majority of proponents of 'flood geology'‚Äîaccept biblical chronogenealogies (such as the Ussher chronology, which in turn is based on the Masoretic version of the Genealogies of Genesis). They believe that God created the universe approximately 6,000 years ago, in the space of six days. Much of creation geology is devoted to debunking the dating methods used in anthropology, geology, and planetary science that give ages in conflict with the young Earth idea. In particular, creationists dispute the reliability of radiometric dating and isochron analysis, both of which are central to mainstream geological theories of the age of the Earth. They usually dispute these methods based on uncertainties concerning initial concentrations of individually considered species and the associated measurement uncertainties caused by diffusion of the parent and daughter isotopes. A full critique of the entire parameter-fitting analysis, which relies on dozens of radionuclei parent and daughter pairs and gives essentially identical or near identical readings, has not been done by creationists hoping to cast doubt on the technique. The consensus of professional scientific organizations worldwide is that no scientific evidence contradicts the age of approximately 4.5 billion years. Young Earth creationists reject these ages on the grounds of what they regard as being tenuous and untestable assumptions in the methodology. They have often quoted apparently inconsistent radiometric dates to cast doubt on the utility and accuracy of the method. Mainstream proponents who get involved in this debate point out that dating methods only rely on the assumptions that the physical laws governing radioactive decay have not been violated since the sample was formed (harking back to Lyell's doctrine of uniformitarianism). They also point out that the \\"problems\\" that creationists publicly mentioned can be shown to either not be problems at all, are issues with known contamination, or simply the result of incorrectly evaluating legitimate data. Other sciences Cosmology While Young Earth creationists believe that the Universe was created by the Judeo-Christian God approximately 6000 years ago, the current scientific consensus is that the Universe as we know it emerged from the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. The recent science of nucleocosmochronology is extending the approaches used for carbon-14 and other radiometric dating to the dating of astronomical features. For example, based upon this emerging science, the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way galaxy is estimated to have been formed 8.3 ¬± 1.8 billion years ago. Nuclear physics Creationists point to experiments they have performed, which they claim demonstrate that 1.5 billion years of nuclear decay took place over a short period, from which they infer that \\"billion-fold speed-ups of nuclear decay\\" have occurred, a massive violation of the principle that radioisotope decay rates are constant, a core principle underlying nuclear physics generally, and radiometric dating in particular. The scientific community points to numerous flaws in these experiments, to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental geochronology. Original version: March 17, 2005; Revisions: November 24, 2005; July 25, 2006 and June 20, 2010. In refutation of Young Earth claims of inconstant decay-rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating, Roger C. Wiens, a physicist specializing in isotope dating states: Misrepresentations of the scientific community The Discovery Institute has a \\"formal declaration\\" titled \\"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\\" which has many evangelicals, people from fields irrelevant to biology and geology and few biologists. Many of the biologists who signed have fields not directly related to evolution. In response, there has been an analogous declaration humorously upholding the consensus, Project Steve, which emphasizes the large amount of scientists supporting the consensus. Quote mining As a means to criticize mainstream science, creationists sometimes quote scientists who ostensibly support the mainstream theories, but appear to acknowledge criticisms similar to those of creationists. These have very often been shown to be quote mines that do not accurately reflect the evidence for evolution or the mainstream scientific community's opinion of it, or are highly out-of-date. Many of the same quotes used by creationists have appeared so frequently in Internet discussions due to the availability of cut and paste functions, that the TalkOrigins Archive has created \\"The Quote Mine Project\\" for quick reference to the original context of these quotations. Creationists often quote mine Darwin, especially with regard to the seeming improbability of the evolution of the eye, to give support to their views. Public policy issues The creation‚Äìevolution controversy has grown in importance in recent years, interfacing with other contemporary political issues, primarily those in the United States that involve the Christian right. Science education Creationists promoted the idea that evolution is a theory in crisis with scientists criticizing evolution and claim that fairness and equal time requires educating students about the alleged scientific controversy. Opponents, being the overwhelming majority of the scientific community and science education organizations,See: * List of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design * Whether ID Is Science, p. 83. * The Discovery Institute's A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism petition begun in 2001 has been signed by \\"over 700 scientists\\" as of August 20, 2006. The four-day A Scientific Support for Darwinism petition gained 7,733 signatories from scientists opposing ID. * AAAS 2002. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the largest association of scientists in the U.S., has 120,000 members, and firmly rejects ID. * More than 70,000 Australian scientists \\"...urge all Australian governments and educators not to permit the teaching or promulgation of ID as science.\\" * National Center for Science Education: List of statements from scientific professional organizations on the status intelligent design and other forms of creationism in the sciences. reply that there is no scientific controversy and that the controversy exists solely in terms of religion and politics. George Mason University Biology Department introduced a course on the creation/evolution controversy, and apparently as students learn more about biology, they find objections to evolution less convincing, suggesting that \\"teaching the controversy\\" rightly as a separate elective course on philosophy or history of science, or \\"politics of science and religion,\\" would undermine creationists' criticisms, and that the scientific community's resistance to this approach was bad public relations. Freedom of speech Creationists have claimed that preventing them from teaching creationism violates their right of freedom of speech. Court cases (such as Webster v. New Lenox School District (1990) and Bishop v. Aronov (1991)) have upheld school districts' and universities' right to restrict teaching to a specified curriculum. Issues relating to religion Religion and historical scientists Creationists often argue that Christianity and literal belief in the Bible are either foundationally significant or directly responsible for scientific progress. To that end, Institute for Creation Research founder Henry M. Morris has enumerated scientists such as astronomer and philosopher Galileo Galilei, mathematician and theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell, mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal, geneticist monk Gregor Mendel, and Isaac Newton as believers in a biblical creation narrative.* This argument usually involves scientists who were no longer alive when evolution was proposed or whose field of study did not include evolution. The argument is generally rejected as specious by those who oppose creationism. Many of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the modern evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin's theory of evolution with Mendel's theories of inheritance and genetics. Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis. Geneticist and evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky, called the Father of the Modern Synthesis, argued that \\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution,\\" and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs. Ayala stated that \\"Dobzhansky was a religious man.\\" Nevertheless, some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today: Louis Pasteur, for example, opposed the theory of spontaneous generation with biogenesis, an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on chemical evolution and abiogenesis. Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old. The relationship between religion and science was not portrayed in antagonistic terms until the late-19th century, and even then there have been many examples of the two being reconcilable for evolutionary scientists. Many historical scientists wrote books explaining how pursuit of science was seen by them as fulfillment of spiritual duty in line with their religious beliefs. Even so, such professions of faith were not insurance against dogmatic opposition by certain religious people. Forums Debates Many creationists and scientists engage in frequent public debates regarding the origin of human life, hosted by a variety of institutions. However, some scientists disagree with this tactic, arguing that by openly debating supporters of supernatural origin explanations (creationism and intelligent design), scientists are lending credibility and unwarranted publicity to creationists, which could foster an inaccurate public perception and obscure the factual merits of the debate. For example, in May 2004 Michael Shermer debated creationist Kent Hovind in front of a predominantly creationist audience. In Shermer's online reflection while he was explaining that he won the debate with intellectual and scientific evidence he felt it was \\"not an intellectual exercise,\\" but rather it was \\"an emotional drama,\\" with scientists arguing from \\"an impregnable fortress of evidence that converges to an unmistakable conclusion,\\" while for creationists it is \\"a spiritual war.\\" While receiving positive responses from creationist observers, Shermer concluded \\"Unless there is a subject that is truly debatable (evolution v. creation is not), with a format that is fair, in a forum that is balanced, it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion.\\" (see Non-overlapping magisteria). Others, like evolutionary biologist Massimo Pigliucci, have debated Hovind, and have expressed surprise to hear Hovind try \\"to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks\\" and at Hovind's assertion that biologists believe humans \\"evolved from bananas.\\" Bill Nye in 2014. In September 2012, educator and television personality Bill Nye of Bill Nye the Science Guy fame spoke with the Associated Press and aired his fears about acceptance of creationist theory, believing that teaching children that creationism is the only true answer and without letting them understand the way science works will prevent any future innovation in the world of science. In February 2014, Nye defended evolution in the classroom in a debate with creationist Ken Ham on the topic of whether creation is a viable model of origins in today's modern, scientific era. Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the teaching of evolution in the public schools, claimed debates are not the sort of arena to promote science to creationists. Scott says that \\"Evolution is not on trial in the world of science,\\" and \\"the topic of the discussion should not be the scientific legitimacy of evolution\\" but rather should be on the lack of evidence in creationism. Stephen Jay Gould adopted a similar position, explaining: Political lobbying On both sides of the controversy a wide range of organizations are involved at a number of levels in lobbying in an attempt to influence political decisions relating to the teaching of evolution. These include the Discovery Institute, the National Center for Science Education, the National Science Teachers Association, state Citizens Alliances for Science, and numerous national science associations and state academies of science. Media coverage The controversy has been discussed in numerous newspaper articles, reports, op-eds and letters to the editor, as well as a number of radio and television programmes (including the PBS series, Evolution (2001) and Coral Ridge Ministries' Darwin's Deadly Legacy (2006)). This has led some commentators to express a concern at what they see as a highly inaccurate and biased understanding of evolution among the general public. Edward Humes states: Outside the United States Views on human evolution in various countries (2008) While the controversy has been prominent in the United States, it has flared up in other countries as well. Europe Europeans have often regarded the creation‚Äìevolution controversy as an American matter. In recent years the conflict has become an issue in other countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Turkey and Serbia. On September 17, 2007, the Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) issued a report on the attempt by American-inspired creationists to promote creationism in European schools. It concludes \\"If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the Council of Europe... The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right-wing political movements... some advocates of strict creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy.\\" The Council of Europe firmly rejected creationism. Australia Under the former Queensland state government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen, in the 1980s Queensland allowed the teaching of creationism in secondary schools. In 2010, the Queensland state government introduced the topic of creationism into school classes within the \\"ancient history\\" subject where its origins and nature are discussed as a significant controversy. Public lectures have been given in rented rooms at universities, by visiting American speakers. One of the most acrimonious aspects of the Australian debate was featured on the science television program Quantum, about a long-running and ultimately unsuccessful court case by Ian Plimer, Professor of Geology at the University of Melbourne, against an ordained minister, Allen Roberts, who had claimed that there were remnants of Noah's Ark in eastern Turkey. Although the court found that Roberts had made false and misleading claims, they were not made in the course of trade or commerce, so the case failed. Islamic countries In recent times, the controversy has become more prominent in Islamic countries. This article gives a worldwide overview of recent developments on the subject of the controversy. In Egypt, evolution is currently taught in schools, but Saudi Arabia and Sudan have both banned the teaching of evolution in schools. Creation science has also been heavily promoted in Turkey and in immigrant communities in Western Europe, primarily by Harun Yahya. In Iran, traditional practice of Shia Islam isn't preoccupied with Qur'anic literalism as in case of Saudi Wahhabism but ijtihad, many influential Iranian Shi'ite scholars, including several who were closely involved in Iranian Revolution, are not opposed to evolutionary ideas in general, disagreeing that evolution necessarily conflicts with the Muslim mainstream. Iranian pupils since 5th grade of elementary school learn only about evolution, thus portraying geologists and scientists in general as an authoritative voices of scientific knowledge. Asia South Korea In South Korea, most opposition to teaching evolution comes from the local evangelical community. As part of these efforts, the Korean Association for Creation Research (KACR) was established in 1981 by evangelical pastors Kim Y≈ènggil and Ch‚Äòoe Y≈èngsang. In South Korea, according to a 2009 survey, about 30 percent of the population believe in creation science while opposing the teaching of evolution.

The original name planned for the ship was Abadejo, but the name was changed on 24 September 1942 before the keel was laid down. Apogon was laid down on 9 December 1942, by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 10 March 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Helen Lorena Withers (n√©e LaBar), wife of Admiral Thomas Withers, Jr., then Commander of Submarine Forces; and commissioned on 16 July 1943, Lieutenant Commander Walter Paul Schoeni in command. Service history World War II The submarine held shakedown in the waters off the New England coast and departed New London on 13 September, bound for Hawaii. Apogon transited the Panama Canal on 25 September and reported for duty on that date to the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet. She reached Pearl Harbor on 11 October and began three weeks of training. After loading fuel and provisions, Apogon got underway on 3 November for her first war patrol. Her patrol area comprised the waters within a 60-mile (110 km) radius of Moen Island and those along the shipping lanes between Truk and Kwajalein. The submarine was acting in support of Operation Galvanic, the seizure of the Gilbert Islands. After a brief stop at Johnston Island on 5 November to top off her fuel tanks, Apogon continued on to her assigned area. During this patrol, she sighted four contacts deemed worthy of torpedo expenditure and actually attacked three. The only major damage she inflicted occurred on 4 December, when the submarine sank Daido Maru, a former gunboat. On 18 December, she ended her patrol and moored at Midway Atoll. Following a refit there, Apogon proceeded to Pearl Harbor on 26 December for further repairs and training. She left Hawaii on 15 January 1944 for her second patrol, this time in waters surrounding the Mariana Islands. On 1 February, Apogon made the only attack of the patrol. She sighted a six-ship convoy and, soon thereafter, opened fire. The crew heard an explosion and saw their torpedoed target burst into flames. Ten minutes later, the lookout saw about 50 feet of the Japanese ship's stern sticking out of the water, and this soon disappeared. Apogon then attacked another Japanese auxiliary. Although Apogon claimed to have sunk both ships, she was not officially credited with having destroyed either. Apogon ended her patrol after 50 days and returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 March. Apogon moored beside on 10 March to commence refit. The submarine was drydocked at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard from 15‚Äì19 March for the installation of two new propellers. After additional training exercises, she got underway on 2 April. She paused at Johnston Island on 4 April to refuel, and later that day resumed her voyage toward waters south of the Japanese home islands. However, when a crewman was preparing to clean a 20 millimeter machine gun the next day, a live cartridge accidentally left in the chamber discharged and ricocheted into the man's leg. Apogon immediately returned to Johnston Island to transfer the wounded man to the dispensary. The submarine again got underway on 6 April and conducted her entire patrol without encountering any enemy shipping. She finally arrived at Majuro on 22 May. Refitting began on 23 May, and the submarine got underway on 8 June for trials. Apogon began her fourth patrol, which was in the area between Formosa and the Philippines, in company with , , and . On 12 July, Apogon and her wolf pack consorts spotted a nine-ship Japanese convoy sailing with approximately six escorts. The submarines immediately began preparing an attack. The leading Japanese ship of the center column of the formation apparently sighted the wake of Apogon's periscope and turned back to ram the submarine. As Apogon was turning to port to bring her stern tubes to bear, she was struck on the starboard side by the freighter. About eight feet of the main periscope and periscope shears were torn off, and the radar masts were bent and put out of commission. As a result, Apogon prematurely ended her patrol to return for repairs. She arrived at Midway on 22 July, where crews installed additional bracing on the periscope shears before the submarine proceeded on to Pearl Harbor. Having reached Pearl Harbor on 26 July, Apogon was dry-docked. Both tail shafts were replaced and realigned, and the periscope, periscope shears, and the radar masts were replaced. The three main engines were also overhauled. On 12 September, Apogon was underway on yet another wartime patrol. She headed for the Kuril Islands area. The submarine then sunk a Japanese patrol craft on 23 September the 400 ton Choyo Maru No.6.Uboat forum Four days later, she sank Hachirogata Maru. Following this sinking, she rescued two Japanese survivors. The next month proved fruitless, and Apogon arrived at Midway on 28 October, ending her fifth patrol. After a month of refit, Apogon commenced her sixth patrol on 20 November, again sailing for the Kuril Islands. The only action of this patrol was an attack on a tanker, which the submarine hit and damaged with a torpedo December 19, 1944. On 5 January 1945, Apogon arrived in Pearl Harbor for a brief stay before getting underway on 7 January for the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California to undergo a major overhaul. Apogon returned to action on 28 May. Her patrol station was the Kuril Islands-Sea of Okhotsk area. She attacked a convoy of four Japanese ships and escort vessels on 18 June and sank one 2,614-ton transport, Hakuai Maru and sank the guardboat Kusonoki Maru no.2. On 2 July, Apogon severely damaged two small auxiliary submarine chasers Cha 58 and Cha 65. The patrol ended on 14 July at Midway. Apogon began her eighth and final patrol on 7 August. She was assigned to the Marcus Island area. She made no attacks during this patrol because the Japanese capitulated on 15 August. Apogon returned to Pearl Harbor on 2 September and then continued on to San Diego, where she arrived on 11 September. Apogon was placed in reserve and decommissioned there on 1 October. Post-War Operation Crossroads A 21 kiloton underwater nuclear weapons effects test, known as Operation Crossroads (Event Baker), conducted at Bikini Atoll (1946). In January 1946, the submarine sailed for Pearl Harbor where she was to undergo preliminary work and tests in preparation to be used as a target in atomic bomb testing. Following completion of this refitting, Apogon arrived at Bikini Atoll on 31 May. She was sunk at Bikini during atomic bomb test \\"Baker\\" on 25 July 1946. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 February 1947. Awards Apogon received six battle stars for her World War II service.

It is known by a variety of names including Devil's Night, Gate Night, Goosey Night, Moving Night, Cabbage Night and Mat Night. Historical background The earliest reference to Mischief Night is from 1790 when a headmaster encouraged a school play which ended in \\"an Ode to Fun which praises children's tricks on Mischief Night in most approving terms\\". In the United Kingdom, these pranks were originally carried out as part of the May Day celebrations, but shifted to later in the year, dates varying in different areas, some marking it on 30 October, the night before Halloween, others on 4 November, the night before Bonfire Night. According to one historian, \\"May Day and the Green Man had little resonance for children in grimy cities. They looked at the opposite end of the year and found the ideal time, the night before the Gunpowder Plot.\\" However, the shift only happened in the late 19th century and is described by the Opies as \\"one of the mysteries of the folklore calendar\\". Naming variations In the United States and Canada In most of New Jersey, as well as in New Orleans, Philadelphia, Eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, parts of New York State, and Connecticut, it is referred to as \\"Mischief Night\\" or, particularly in the Great Lakes region, \\"Devil's Night\\". In some towns in Northern New Jersey and parts of New York State, it is also known as \\"Goosey Night\\". Meanwhile, in Baltimore, Maryland, it has traditionally been referred to as \\"Moving Night\\" due to the custom of exchanging or stealing porch furniture and other outside items. In Detroit, which was particularly hard-hit by Devil's Night arson and vandalism throughout the 1980s, many citizens take it upon themselves to patrol the streets to deter arsonists and those who may break the law. This is known as \\"Angels' Night\\". Some 40,000 volunteer citizens patrol the city on Angels' Night, which usually runs October 29 through October 31, around the time most Halloween festivities are taking place. In rural Niagara Falls, Ontario, during the 1950s and 1960s, Cabbage Night () referred to the custom of raiding local gardens for leftover rotting cabbages and hurling them about to create mischief in the neighbourhood. Today, the night is still celebrated in Ontario but is also commonly known as \\"Cabbage Night\\" in parts of the United States areas of Vermont; Connecticut; Bergen County, New Jersey; Upstate New York; Northern Kentucky; Newport, Rhode Island; and Western Massachusetts. It is known as \\"Gate Night\\" in New Hampshire, West Kootenay (British Columbia), Vancouver Island, Winnipeg, Thunder Bay (Ontario), Bay City (Michigan), Rockland County (New York), North Dakota and South Dakota; the implication is that the Gates of Hell open the night before Halloween; as \\"Mat Night\\" in English-speaking Quebec; and as \\"Devil's Night\\" in many places throughout Canada, Michigan, and western Pennsylvania. In the United Kingdom In some parts of the country, \\"Mischief Night\\" is held on 30 October, the night before Halloween. The separation of Halloween tricks from treats seems to have only developed in certain areas, often appearing in one region but not at all nearby regions. Mischief Night is known in Yorkshire as \\"Mischievous Night\\" or the shortened \\"'Chievous Night\\" \\"Miggy Night\\", \\"Tick- Tack Night\\", \\"Corn Night\\", \\"Trick Night\\" or \\"Micky Night\\" and is celebrated across Northern England on 4 November the night before Bonfire Night. In some areas of Yorkshire, it is extremely popular among 13-year-olds, as they believe it to be a sort of \\"coming of age ceremony\\" . In and around the city of Liverpool, Mischief Night is known locally as \\"Mizzy Night\\"; trouble spots were being tackled by the Merseyside Police in 2015. Contemporary practice In the United States Mischief Night is generally recognized as a New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan phenomenon. Mischief Night tends to include popular tricks such as toilet papering yards and buildings, powder-bombing and egging cars, people, and homes, using soap to write on windows, \\"forking\\" yards, setting off fireworks, and smashing pumpkins and jack-o'-lanterns. Local grocery stores often refuse to sell eggs to children and teenagers around the time of Halloween for this reason. Occasionally, the damage can escalate to include the spray-painting of buildings and homes. Less destructive is the prank known as \\"Knock, Knock, Ginger\\". In New Orleans in recent years, Mischief Night has included a series of unruly parade-like riots.Crime Bits: Mischief Night Edition According to participants, the Mischief Night \\"krewes\\" follow in New Orleans' carnival's centuries-old tradition of \\"walking parades\\", which mostly transpire in the lead-up to Mardi Gras. Mixing revelry with mindless violence, Mischief Night parades involve thematic floats and costumes as well as targeted vandalism and fires. Targets of vandalism, attacks and arson have included the police, innocent bystanders and property. When asked in an interview from 2017 how Mischief Night in New Orleans fits into the context of carnival, a parader replied \\"Our Carnival traditions are those that actually want to 'turn the world upside down.'\\"New Orleans Mischief Night: An Interview with Revelers After a parade through downtown in 2016 that saw bonfires in the street, police cars hit with paint, and a now-removed white supremacist monument chipped away at with a sledgehammer, another participant wrote: > There is no longer a middle ground; that‚Äôs been seized for luxury condos. > The choice is stark: we either collectively build a more combative spiritual > practice or we collude in ceding our ritual spaces of encounter to the > oppressors.Mischief Night Parade Breaks History In some areas of Queens, New York, Cabbage Night has included throwing rotten fruit at neighbors, cars, and buses. Children and teenagers fill eggs with Neet and Nair hair remover and throw them at unsuspecting individuals. In the mid-1980s, garbage was set on fire and cemeteries were set ablaze. In Camden, New Jersey, Mischief Night escalated to the point that in the 1990s widespread arson was committed, with over 130 arsons on the night of October 30, 1991.Fire and Police Departments Extinguish Pre-Halloween Arson Sprees In popular culture *In the 1994 film The Crow, the protagonist and his fianc√© are murdered on the eve of their Halloween wedding on \\"Devil's Night\\" by a street gang on the orders of Detroit's most notorious crime lord, Top Dollar.

It is situated to the north of Liverpool on the A565 road and to the east of the village of Hightown. There are two associated hamlets of Lady Green and Carr Houses. History Ince Blundell is probably the oldest settlement within the borough of Sefton. The name Ince comes from Hinne a Celtic word meaning \\"island in the marsh\\". This name bears evidence to Ince lying on a sandy ridge in the Alt valley, a place that in the past had been marshland. In the 14th century, John Blundell, whose family were the predominant landowners in the area, added his surname to Ince. This was to distinguish it from the Ince in Cheshire and Ince-in-Makerfield near Wigan. Built from 1720, Ince Blundell Hall was the home of the Blundells of Ince, who became the Weld-Blundells, until 1959. The house is a Grade II* listed building, and is now a nursing home run by the Canonesses of Saint Augustine. Governance From 1997 until 2010 the village and civil parish of Ince Blundell was part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency represented by George Howarth, a Labour Party MP. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency was abolished with Sefton East, including Ince Blundell, being merged with the northern parts of the former Crosby constituency, which was also abolished, to form the new Sefton Central constituency which is represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson. For elections to Sefton Council, the village and civil parish of Ince Blundell is part of Ravenmeols electoral ward which has three councillors. Two are members of the Formby Residents Action Group (FRAG), Bob McCann (who also sits on the Ince Blundell Parish Council), Maria Bennett, and the third councillor, Nina Killen, represents the Labour party. Description There is a village Hall with a cafe attached, The Sunshine cafe open Monday to Friday. On the site of the old Weld Blundell Public house there is now a Euro garage with a Spar, Greggs and. Starbucks attached. There is also a pub, the Pheasant, a short distance away at the other end of Orrell Hill Lane at its junction with Moss Lane. In 2006 and 2007, Ince Blundell entered the North West In Bloom competition, part of the Royal Horticultural Society's Britain in Bloom campaign. Ince Blundell Hall statues Ince Blundell Hall was noted for the collection of marble statues from Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, as well as 17th and 18th-century Italian sculptures by artists such as Carlo Albacini and Bartolomeo Cavaceppi. They were collected by Henry Blundell and housed first in a purpose-built Garden Temple (1792), and later in a scaled-down version of the Pantheon (1802-1804). The ancient sculptures, including some from Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, are now located in the World Museum, Liverpool. Henry Blundell also collected paintings and furniture, some of which is also at the Walker Art Gallery. Henry's estranged son Charles Robert Blundell (1761-1837) made a large collection of drawings many of which are also at the Walker.

E. H. Love, was a mathematician famous for his work on the mathematical theory of elasticity. He also worked on wave propagation and his work on the structure of the Earth in Some Problems of Geodynamics won for him the Adams prize in 1911 when he developed a mathematical model of surface waves known as Love waves. Love also contributed to the theory of tidal locking and introduced the parameters known as Love numbers, which are widely used today. These numbers are also used in problems related to the tidal deformation of the Earth due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun. He was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and in 1881 won a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was at first undecided whether to study classics or mathematics. His successful progress (he was placed Second Wrangler) vindicated his choice of mathematics, and in 1886 he was elected Fellow of the college. In 1899 he was appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Oxford, a position which he retained until his death in 1940. He was also a Fellow of Queen's College. He authored the two volume classic, A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity. He was the author of several articles in the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, including Elasticity and Infinitesimal Calculus His other awards include the Royal Society Royal Medal in 1909 and Sylvester Medal in 1937, the London Mathematical Society De Morgan Medal in 1926.

This law has developed and expanded over time as various incidents of real life unfair play have been legislated against. The first section of Law 41 makes clear that the captains of the two teams have the responsibility for ensuring that play is conducted according to the spirit and traditions of the game, as well as within its Laws. This leads to a statement that the umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. It contains an override of the Laws of Cricket: if either umpire considers an action that is not covered by the laws to be unfair, he can intervene and call the ball dead. Fair and unfair play can also refer simply to conventions of the game that are often seen to conform with the Spirit of Cricket. Ball tampering The state of the ball affects deliveries to a batsman. Even a new cricket ball is not perfectly spherical, but in two parts stitched together to form a seam. How a ball moves depends in part on how much air resistance there is to different parts of the ball, and therefore to what degree the ball has deteriorated. A cricket team will normally seek, for example, to polish one side of the ball and rough up the other side. The resulting variation in air resistance on the ball can have a marked effect. Ball tampering has always been a feature of the sport. Players would use objects to rough up one side of the ball, and use resins and substances like Brylcreem to shine the other. This sort of ball tampering is against the spirit of the game and has always been against the rules. Despite this, it has always gone on with limited sanction, and it can be difficult to spot. The television age has meant that from the 1990s onwards most international games have been televised. Slow motion replays have highlighted a number of incidents of ball tampering: some of which have been widely reported in the press (such as with the Sandpapergate incident). The third section of Law 41 contains the rules and sanctions against ball tampering and requires the umpires to make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball to counter it. It also contains punitive measures against fielders who do tamper with the ball. Match suspensions may be implemented. Some acts that may alter the ball are permitted. A fielder may polish the ball as long as no artificial substance is used, remove mud from the ball under the supervision of the umpire and dry a wet ball on a towel. But no-one may rub the ball on the ground for any reason, interfere with any of the seams or the surface of the ball, use any implement, or take any other action whatsoever which is likely to alter the condition of the ball. If a player illegally changes the condition of the ball, the umpires replace the ball with another one with similar wear to the old ball before the ball tampering. The umpires also award five penalty runs to the opposing team and report the incident to the authorities to which the player is responsible. These authorities are then expected to take further disciplinary action against the player as appropriate. If there is a further incidence of ball tampering in the innings the same procedure is followed, but the bowler of the immediately preceding ball is banned from bowling further in that innings too if the tempering was committed by the fielding side. Distracting the opposition If a member of the fielding side deliberately distracts or attempts to distract the batsman on strike while he is preparing to receive or receiving a delivery, the umpire immediately declares the ball to be dead. The umpire also informs the fielding captain of the incident and awards five penalty runs to the batting side. The batsman may not be dismissed from the delivery, which must be repeated. It is also unfair for a member of the fielding side to deliberately attempt to distract or obstruct either batsman after the striker has received the ball by word or action. If this happens a procedure similar to the procedure for the first instance of ball tampering occurs, although the batting side also scores any runs that they have scored before the attempted (or actual) distraction or obstruction. The case of a batsman obstructing the fielding side is covered by Law 37 of the Laws of Cricket rather than Law 41. A batsman contravening Law 37 may be given out obstructing the field. Unfair bowling The bowling of fast short pitched balls may be judged dangerous by the umpire considering their speed, length, height and direction in relation to the skill of the batsman. The umpire calls no-ball and cautions the bowler. If this happens a second time, the bowler is barred from bowling again in that innings, and is also reported to the responsible authority for possible further action. Even if not judged dangerous, repetitive short-pitched bowling over head height may be judged unfair. Each individual instance is called no-ball (or wide in the professional game) without contextual judgement of fairness, but if the umpire decides too many have been bowled, will intervene with the sequence of warning, suspension and reporting. Professional cricket has several different codes on this, stating how many instances constitutes unfair. High full- pitched balls beamers that pass or would have passed the striker on the full above waist height are deemed dangerous. The same sanctions (no-ball, warning, suspension, reporting) apply as to fast short pitched balls. Beamers occur by mistake, when a ball slips in the bowler's hand at the point of delivery, and bowlers usually immediately apologise to the batsman for their mistake. If one is judged to have been bowled deliberately, no-ball is immediately called, the bowler is removed and is reported to the responsible authority for further disciplinary action. If the umpire considers a bowler has deliberately bowled a front-foot no-ball then the bowler is immediately suspended from bowling in that innings and reported to the authorities for further action. Time wasting Time wasting can be used as a deliberate tactic to affect the result of a game. If rain is forecast, a side that is in a losing position can play slow, with the hope that rain will save them and turn the result into a draw rather than a defeat. Time wasting can also be used tactically elsewhere in the game: for instance, to minimise the number of deliveries between a given time and an interval. Law 41 includes rules to counter unfair time wasting. If the fielding side wastes time, or progresses an over unnecessarily slowly, it is first warned by the umpire. Any further occurrence, there is a further sanction. If the further occurrence happens otherwise than during an over, the batting side is awarded 5 penalty runs. If the further occurrence happens during an over, the bowler is banned from bowling further in the innings. In both instances the relevant Governing Body is informed so it may consider further disciplinary action. In normal circumstances the striker should always be ready to take strike when the bowler is ready to start his run up. If he wastes time, in the first instance the batsman is warned by the umpire. That warning applies to the batting team as a whole and each incoming batsman is informed of that warning. If there is further time wasting by any batsman in that innings, the umpires award the fielding side 5 runs and inform the Governing Body so it may consider further disciplinary action. Damaging the pitch The central portion of the pitch (5 feet from each popping crease, and 1 foot either side of the line joining the centres of the two middle stumps) is designated a protected area (this is the area the ball will most often bounce in). The bowlers from the fielding side should not enter this area during the follow-through of their bowling action, nor should the batsman take guard within it or so close that they would frequently move into it. A bowler will get two warnings should they run into the protected area; should they encroach again, they will be suspended from bowling for the remainder of the innings. A batsman gets one warning and on subsequent transgressions incurs a 5 run penalty. Each side must also avoid deliberate or avoidable damage to the whole of the pitch (there will be unavoidable damage due to the bowler running off the pitch after bowling and the batsman taking his stance by the popping crease). Each side gets on warning for avoidable damage, any subsequent instance of avoidable damage will see a 5 run penalty awarded to the other side. Batsmen stealing runs A bowler may attempt to run out a batsman who leaves his ground before he delivers the ball, but must do so before he reaches the point in his action when he would normally release the ball, with this being known as mankading. It is unfair for batsmen to attempt to steal runs during the bowler's run-up. If they try the umpires will allow the bowler to attempt a run out. Should the bowler not attempt a run out then the umpires will call dead ball, return the batsmen to their previous ends and award a 5 run penalty to the fielding side.

The existence group is concerned with providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs is those of relatedness ‚Äì the desire people have for maintaining important interpersonal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for personal development. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization. Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs. Alderfer also proposed a regression theory to go along with the ERG theory. He said that when needs in a higher category are not met then individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need. For example if self-actualization or self-esteem is not met then individuals will invest more effort in the relatedness category in the hopes of achieving the higher need.Design in the Manufacturing Firm syllabus University of Washington Industrial Engineering course syllabus.

She was the first destroyer in the United States Navy that named for a marine. Description The Wickes class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s.Gardiner & Gray, p. 124 The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load.

Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, p. 45 Construction and career Meredith, named for Jonathan Meredith, was laid down 26 June 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 22 September 1918; sponsored by Mrs. William F. Meredith, wife of the great-grandnephew of Sergeant Meredith; and commissioned at Boston 29 January 1919, Commander H. H. Michaels in command. Assigned to Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, Meredith proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, for torpedoes and 18 February began a shakedown cruise to Cuba. However, she received orders 22 February to join five other destroyers as escort to George Washington, returning President Woodrow Wilson from France to Boston. On 26 February, she resumed her shakedown. Meredith departed New York 1 May for Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, to serve as a guide post for the first transoceanic flight, as Navy Curtis flying boats spanned the Atlantic from Long Island to Plymouth, England. Returning to Boston 22 May, Meredith cruised the east and gulf coasts with Destroyer Flotilla 2 until November, then served out of Newport for training, particularly target practice, until November, when she went into repair at Norfolk. Rejoining her division at Charleston, South Carolina, 26 January 1922, she participated in maneuvers until 5 April when she went into Philadelphia Navy Yard for inactivation. Decommissioned 28 June 1922, Meredith remained at Philadelphia until, in accordance with the London Naval Treaty, she was sold for scrapping 29 September 1936.

News analysts speculated that the release of the video was timed to influence the 2004 U.S. presidential election, which would take place four days later. Content The video is reported to be 18 minutes in length; bin Laden only speaks for 14 minutes 39 seconds. Al-Jazeera released a transcript of the complete tape on November 1, 2004. Bin Laden appears wearing a turban and a white robe partially covered by a golden mantle, standing in front of an almost featureless brown background and reading his comments from papers resting on a podium. He moves both of his arms (dispelling rumors that one of them is limp after having been wounded) and looks healthy as far as can be told, but a bit older and greyer than in his former tapes. His remarks, in Arabic but addressed to citizens of the United States, instruct them that \\"the best way to avoid another Manhattan\\" (a reference to the September 11, 2001 attacks), is to not threaten the security of Muslim nations, such as Palestine and Lebanon. He speaks of his desire to bankrupt the U.S., saying: > [It is] easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we > have to do is to send two mujahidin to the furthest point east to raise a > piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaeda, in order to make the generals > race there and cause America to suffer human, economic, and political > losses. ... This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla > warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, > alongside the mujahidin, bled Russia for 10 years, until it went bankrupt > and was forced to withdraw in defeat. He dismisses as rhetoric claims by U.S. President George W. Bush that the attacks occurred because Islamic extremists \\"hate freedom\\", saying: \\"If Bush says we hate freedom, let him tell us why we didn't attack Sweden, for example. It is known that freedom-haters don't have defiant spirits like those of the 19‚Äîmay God have mercy on them\\". Bin Laden further accuses U.S. President George W. Bush of misleading the American people during the previous three years‚Äî\\"Despite entering the fourth year after September 11, Bush is still deceiving you and hiding the truth from you and therefore the reasons are still there to repeat what happened\\"‚Äîas well as criticizing Bush's actions on the day of the attacks: \\"It never occurred to us that the Commander-in- Chief of the country would leave 50,000 citizens in the two towers to face those horrors alone because he thought listening to a child discussing her goats was more important.\\" Immediate reactions George W. Bush delivered a short statement to the media in front of Air Force One at Toledo, Ohio Express Airport, hours after the tape was broadcast George W. Bush said: > Let me make this very clear: Americans will not be intimidated or influenced > by an enemy of our country. I'm sure Senator Kerry agrees with this. I also > want to say to the American people that we're at war with these terrorists > and I am confident that we will prevail. Presidential candidate Senator John Kerry said: > Let me make it clear, crystal clear: as Americans, we are absolutely united > in our determination to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden and the > terrorists. They are barbarians, and I will stop at absolutely nothing to > hunt down, capture or kill the terrorists wherever they are, whatever it > takes. Period. Intelligence response Even though al Jazeera (when broadcasting the footage on its evening newscast) did not disclose the source of the video, sources within the United States intelligence community have confirmed that the speaker, who appears behind a lectern, is indeed bin Laden. By mentioning 2004 U.S. presidential candidate John Kerry by name, the tape seemed to prove that bin Laden was still alive at least midway through 2004, which was not known with certainty at the time. According to the Agence France-Presse, U.S. diplomats in Qatar were given a copy of a videotape of Osama before it aired on al Jazeera television; the diplomats unsuccessfully sought to prevent the Arabic language network from broadcasting it.\\"US tried to stop Al-Jazeera broadcast\\", Sydney Morning Herald, October 31, 2004 The United States State Department requested that the government of Qatar (where Al Jazeera is located) discourage the station from airing the videotape, according to a senior State Department official. Even though the tape was analyzed by American intelligence to determine if it contains any coded messages to operatives, White House spokesman Scott McClellan commented that there were no plans to raise the U.S. terrorism alert level, as no specific threats were made in the tape. Ron Suskind noted that the CIA analysis of the video led them to the consensus view that the tape was designed strategically to help President Bush win reelection in 2004. Deputy CIA director John E. McLaughlin noted at one meeting, \\"Bin Laden certainly did a nice favor today for the President.\\" Suskind quoted Jami Miscik, CIA deputy associate director for intelligence, as saying \\"Certainly, he would want Bush to keep doing what he's doing for a few more years.\\"Robert Parry, CIA: Osama Helped Bush in '04, Consortiumnews.com, July 4, 2006 The same speculation has been made by Bahukutumbi Raman. Public response The 2004 tape boosted the popularity of George W. Bush. President Bush opened up a six-point lead over his opponent Senator John Kerry in the first opinion poll to include sampling taken after the videotape was broadcast. However, Kerry won the category of people who considered the tape \\"very important\\" 53% to 47% according to CNN's exit poll.http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html See also * Videos and audio recordings of Osama bin Laden * 2007 Osama bin Laden video * October surprise * The One Percent Doctrine References Sources * Complete Arabic text of 2004 Osama bin Laden videotape on al- Jazeera * Complete English translation text of 2004 Osama bin Laden videotape on Al-Jazeera * Michael, Maggie.

Set in Burma, where Orwell (under his real name of Eric Arthur Blair) had served in the British Imperial Police from 1922 to 1927, it describes the execution of a criminal. The story The condemned man is given no name, nor is it explained what crime he has committed. For the British police who supervise his execution, the hanging is an unpleasant but routine piece of business. The narrator takes no active part in the hanging, and appears to be less experienced than his colleagues. As the prisoner is marched and handcuffed to the gallows he steps slightly aside to avoid treading in a puddle of rainwater; the narrator sees this, and reflects: ‚ÄúIt is curious, but till that moment I had never realised what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we are alive. All the organs of his body were working‚Äîbowels digesting food, skin renewing itself, nails growing, tissues forming‚Äîall toiling away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be growing when he stood on the drop, when he was falling through the air with a tenth of a second to live. His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the grey walls, and his brain still remembered, foresaw, reasoned‚Äîeven about puddles. He and we were a party of men walking together, seeing, hearing, feeling, understanding the same world; and in two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone‚Äîone mind less, one world less.‚Äù The sentence is carried out, and all concerned feel a sudden relief as they leave the scene where the dead man still hangs. Context Britain conquered Burma over 62 years (1824‚Äì86), during which three Anglo- Burmese Wars were fought, and incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Britain administered Burma as an Indian province until 1937, when it became a separate, self-governing colony. Burma attained independence in 1948. Veracity When asked about A Hanging, Orwell was unwilling to discuss the subject, and once said that it was \\"only a story.\\"Timothy Garton Ash, \\"The Complete Works of George Orwell\\" book review , The New York Review of Books, 22 October 1998, reproduced at netcharles.com. No known evidence shows specifically where and when he witnessed an execution during his time in Burma.Bernard Crick, George Orwell: A Life, 1980. In his writings, however, he repeated that he had done so.In The Road to Wigan Pier, published in 1937, and again in his \\"As I Please\\" column in Tribune, 3 November 1944. He further reflected upon hanging in his As I Please column for Tribune, 15 November 1946.Orwell, A Kind of Compulsion, p.210 According to Dennis Collings, a friend of Orwell from 1921, when his father became the Blair (Orwell) family doctor, it was certain Orwell would have witnessed a hanging, and that policemen had to see a hanging, 'as a kind of initiation. There had to be police officers present at executions‚Äîand cadets were assigned to that kind of thing.'

Bouquet is best known for his victory over a Native American force at the Battle of Bushy Run, lifting the siege of Fort Pitt during Pontiac's War. During the conflict Bouquet gained lasting infamy in an exchange of letters with his commanding officer Amherst who suggested a form of biological warfare in the use of blankets infected with smallpox which were to be distributed to Native Americans.Postscript of Bouquet's letter to Amherst, 13 July 1763 Despite this indictment historians have praised Bouquet for leading British forces in several demanding campaigns on the Western Frontier in which they \\"protected and rescued\\" settlers from increasingly frequent attacks. Early life Bouquet was born into a moderately wealthy family in Rolle, Swiss Confederacy and the oldest of seven brothers. The son of a Swiss roadhouse owner and his well-to-do wife, he entered military service at the age of 17. Like many military officers of his day, Bouquet traveled between countries serving as a professional soldier. He began his military career in the army of the Dutch Republic and later was in the service of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1748, he was again in Dutch service as lieutenant colonel of the Swiss guards. French and Indian War He entered the British Army in 1754 as a lieutenant colonel in the 60th Regiment of Foot (The Royal American Regiment), a unit made up largely of members of Pennsylvania's German immigrant community. After leading the Royal Americans to Charleston, South Carolina to bolster that city's defences, the regiment was recalled to Philadelphia to take part in General John Forbes' expedition against Fort Duquesne in 1758. While Bouquet travelled down the road from Fort Bedford, his troops were attacked by French and Indians at Loyalhanna, near present Ligonier, Pennsylvania, but the attack was repulsed and they continued on to Fort Duquesne, only to find it razed by the fleeing French. Pontiac's War The Indians returning English captives to Colonel Henry Bouquet in November 1764. In 1763, bands of Native Americans joined forces to remove the British from their territory in what is most often called Pontiac's War. Pontiac, an Ottawa war leader, began urging the Indian tribes that had been allied to the French during the French and Indian War to join together to continue the fight to remove the British from the territory. Pontiac initiated attacks on the westernmost frontier forts and settlements, believing the defeated French would rally and come to their aid. The start of the conflict is usually described as the siege of Fort Detroit on 10 May 1763. Fort Sandusky, Fort Michilimackinac, Fort Presque Isle, and numerous other frontier outposts were quickly overrun. Several frontier forts in the Ohio Country had fallen to the allied tribes, and Fort Pitt, Fort Ligionier, and Fort Bedford along Forbes's road were besieged or threatened. Bouquet, who was in Philadelphia, threw together a hastily organised force of 500 men, mostly Scots Highlanders, to relieve the forts. On 5 August 1763, Bouquet and the relief column were attacked by warriors from the Delaware, Mingo, Shawnee, and Wyandot tribes near a small outpost called Bushy Run, in what is now Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. In a two-day battle, Bouquet defeated the tribes and Fort Pitt was relieved. The battle marked a turning point in the war. It was during Pontiac's War that Bouquet gained a certain lasting infamy. The British Army attempted use of smallpox against Native Americans during the Siege of Fort Pitt in June 1763. During a parley in midst of the siege on June 24, 1763, Captain Simeon Ecuyer gave representatives of the besieging Delawares two blankets and a handkerchief enclosed in small metal boxes that had been exposed to smallpox, in an attempt to spread the disease to the Natives in order to end the siege.Anderson, Crucible of War, 541‚Äì42; Jennings, Empire of Fortune, 447n26. William Trent, the trader turned militia commander who had come up with the plan, sent a bill to the British Army indicating that the purpose of giving the blankets was \\"to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.\\" The invoice's approval confirms that the British command endorsed Trent's actions. A reported outbreak that began the spring before left as many as one hundred Native Americans dead in Ohio Country from 1763 to 1764. It is not clear, however, whether the smallpox was a result of the Fort Pitt incident or the virus was already present among the Delaware people as outbreaks happened on their own every dozen or so years and the delegates were met again later and they seemingly hadn't contracted smallpox. Smallpox was highly contagious among the Native Americans, and ‚Äî together with measles, influenza, chicken pox, and other Old World diseases ‚Äî was a major cause of death since the arrival of Europeans and their animals.Crawford, Native Americans of the Pontiac's War, 245‚Äì250 The journal of William Trent, the commander of the militia at the fort, has provided evidence that this plan was carried out: > [June] 24th [1763] The Turtles Heart a principal Warrior of the Delawares > and Mamaltee a Chief came within a small distance of the Fort Mr. McKee went > out to them and they made a Speech letting us know that all our [POSTS] as > Ligonier was destroyed, that great numbers of Indians [were coming and] that > out of regard to us, they had prevailed on 6 Nations [not to] attack us but > give us time to go down the Country and they desired we would set of > immediately. The Commanding Officer thanked them, let them know that we had > everything we wanted, that we could defend it against all the Indians in the > Woods, that we had three large Armys marching to Chastise those Indians that > had struck us, told them to take care of their Women and Children, but not > to tell any other Natives, they said they would go and speak to their Chiefs > and come and tell us what they said, they returned and said they would hold > fast of the Chain of friendship. Out of our regard to them we gave them two > Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will > have the desired effect. They then told us that Ligonier had been attacked, > but that the Enemy were beat of.William Trent's Journal A month later in a series of letters between Bouquet and his commander, General Jeffery Amherst, the idea of using smallpox blankets was proposed and agreed upon to infect the Indians by giving them infected blankets. Amherst wrote to Bouquet, then in Lancaster, on about 29 June 1763: \\"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among those disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\\"The Conspiracy of Pontiac and the Indian War after the Conquest of Canada, Francis Parkman, 1886 - Vol. II, p. 39 (6th edition) Bouquet agreed, replying to Amherst on 13 July: \\"I will try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself.\\" Amherst responded on 16 July: \\"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race.\\"Amherst's reply to Bouquet, 16 July 1763 By the autumn of 1764, Bouquet had become the commander of Fort Pitt. To subdue the ongoing Indian uprising, he led a force of nearly 1,500 militiamen and regular British soldiers from the fort into the Ohio Country. On 13 October 1764, Bouquet's army reached the Tuscarawas River. Shortly thereafter, representatives from the Shawnees, Senecas, and Delawares came to Bouquet to sue for peace. Bouquet then moved his army from the Tuscarawas River to the Muskingum River at modern-day Coshocton, Ohio. This placed him in the heart of tribal lands and would allow him to quickly strike the natives' villages if they refused to cooperate. As part of the peace treaty, Bouquet demanded the return of all white captives in exchange for a promise not to destroy the Indian villages or seize any of their land. The return of the captives caused much bitterness among the tribesmen, because many of them had been forcibly adopted into Indian families as small children, and living among the Native Americans had been the only life they remembered. Some 'white Indians' such as Rhoda Boyd managed to escape back into the native villages; many others were never exchanged. Bouquet was responsible for the return more than 200 white captives to the settlements back east. Promotion and sudden death In 1765, Bouquet was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of all British forces in the southern colonies. He died in Pensacola, West Florida, on 2 September 1765, probably from yellow fever. In literature Bouquet is referred to in Conrad Richter's 1953 novel The Light in the Forest, which tells the story of one young man returned to his white family as part of the 1764 treaty. The Colonel is also referred to in Paul Muldoon's poem, \\"Meeting the British\\". References External links *Henry Bouquet and Pennsylvania. \\"Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission\\".

The Alto Knights name was derived from the Order of Saint James of Altopascio. In 1957 when Carlo Gambino took over, he renamed the club \\"The Ravenite\\" in honor of his favorite poem by Edgar Allan Poe \\"The Raven.\\" But Gambino stopped habituating the club when he discovered police had a growing interest in survelliance of the club. It then became under the management of Aniello Dellacroce. It was frequented and used as the headquarters of the Gambino crime family in the late 1970s and 1980s. Around 1990, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was able to infiltrate the Mafia using secret electronic surveillance, because John Gotti used an apartment above the Ravenite Social Club; the FBI subsequently sent agents to install voice recorders and other wiretaps inside the apartment. The FBI then used recordings from secret Mafia meetings in that apartment against Gotti. Exterior surveillance also recorded numerous union officials outside the Ravenite Social Club, helping the FBI in connecting the boss of the Gambino crime family to the city's labor unions.

Leverburgh is within the parish of Harris. History In his 30s, English businessman William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme had taken a boat trip and fallen in love with the Western Isles of Scotland. In May 1918, at the age of 66, he bought the Isle of Lewis for ¬£167,000, convinced that he could resurrect the fishing industry. But his investment floundered in 1919 when servicemen, demobilised from the First World War and promised land, started occupying plots on the Isle of Lewis. Leverhulme protested and took legal action against the people he considered squatters, but the Scottish Office took the side of the ex-servicemen, leaving Leverhulme's plan in tatters. Still looking to develop his fishing plan, in late 1919 he purchased the South Harris estate from the Earl of Dunmore for the sum of ¬£36,000. Taking in the fishing village of Obbe (deriving from a Norse word for a bay), he planned to turn it into a consolidated major fishing centre, with fish distributed through the 400+ Mac Fisheries fishmonger shops. He chose the site because it gave access to the waters of both the Minch and the Atlantic Ocean and his boats could always find sheltered fishing waters. In 1920, with local consent, Obbe was renamed Leverburgh, and 300 men started work on a new pier and seashore infrastructure for processing the catch from 50 berthed trawlers. Shore side construction covered an accommodation block, curing sheds, smoke houses, a refrigeration building, store sheds, houses for the managers and a twenty car garage. With a second stage of development planned that would have seen the inner sea loch converted into a harbour to accommodate 200+ trawlers, fitted with a sea lock to ensure a constant depth, Leverhulme paid for upgraded roads to accommodate the additional traffic. After purchasing the London butchers Wall's in 1920, the economic downturn of 1920-21 slowed development, resulting in the London-based Mac Fisheries being incorporated into Lever Brothers Ltd in 1922. By 1924 Leverburgh was ready to start production, and 12 Great Yarmouth drifters landed a quantity of herring so great that extra female employees were taken in from the mainland to handle the catch. After making his last visit to Leverburgh in September 1924, Leverhulme took a trip to Africa, where he developed pneumonia. After his death in 1925, his executors and the board of Lever Brothers had no interest in the Leverburgh project, and so ended all work. They sold off the village and production facilities for ¬£5,000, and the estate for ¬£300, to the Campbell brothers, a local family. It is estimated that the project cost Leverhulme ¬£500,000. Facilities A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service links Leverburgh with Berneray, connected to North Uist by a causeway. The Post Office serving the village was established in 1873 and had its name changed from Obbe to Leverburgh in December 1920. The nearby area is known for its beautiful beaches, especially along the west coast road.

The NMC maintains a register of all nurses, midwives and specialist community public health nurses and nursing associates eligible to practise within the UK. It sets and reviews standards for their education, training, conduct and performance. The NMC also investigates allegations of impaired fitness to practise (i.e. where these standards are not met). It has been a statutory body since 2002, with a stated aim to protect the health and well-being of the public. The NMC is also a charity registered with the Charity Commission, charity number 1091434 and in Scotland with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, charity number SC038362. All Council members are trustees of the charity.  History   UKCC  In 1983, the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) was set up, replacing the General Nursing Council for England and Wales established by the Nurses Registration Act 1919, the Central Midwives Board in London and seven other bodies.Administrative background notes in National Archives entry for the Records of the General Nursing Council for England and Wales Hannah Cooke, Susan Philpin, Sociology in Nursing and Healthcare, Elsevier Health Sciences, 2008 p131 The UKCC was expected to maintain a register of UK nurses, midwives and health visitors, provide guidance to registrants, and handle professional misconduct complaints. At the same time, National Boards were created for each of the UK countries. Their main functions were to monitor the quality of nursing and midwifery education courses, and to maintain the training records of students on these courses.  Establishment of NMC  This structure of the UKCC survived with minor modifications up to April 2002, when the UKCC ceased to exist and its functions were taken over by a new Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). This was legislated for in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, through the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001.Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 The English National Board was also abolished and its quality assurance function was taken on board by the NMC. The other National Boards were also abolished, but new bodies were created in each country to take over their functions.  Council  The NMC Council has two key roles: setting the strategic direction for the NMC and overseeing the work of senior NMC staff. The Council ensures that the NMC complies with all relevant legislation, including the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 and the Charities Act 1993. The Council is made up of 12 lay and registrant members, including one member from each of the four UK countries. They are appointed by the Privy Council. Registrant members are from a nursing or midwifery background; lay members are selected for their expertise in various fields and strategic experience. The current Council took office on 1 May 2013.  Role  The NMC's role is to: * protect the health and wellbeing of the public * set standards of education, training, conduct and performance so that nurses and midwives can deliver high quality healthcare consistently throughout their careers * ensure that nurses and midwives keep their skills and knowledge up to date and uphold the NMC‚Äôs professional standards, and * have clear and transparent processes to investigate nurses and midwives who fall short of the NMC‚Äôs standards.  Activities  The NMC has an annual income in excess of ¬£52 million and employs over 400 staff. To fulfill the activities of the NMC it charges a registration fee to its members.  Education  The NMC set standards, guidance and requirements for nursing and midwifery education across the UK. These standards help to shape the content and design of programmes and state what a registered nurse or midwife needs to know and be able to do. The NMC approves higher education institutions to deliver programmes. They currently accredit 1000 programmes in 79 education institutions across the UK. When students successfully complete their programme, their education institution will let the NMC know that they have met the education and practice standards and are of good health and good character. If they are deemed fit to practise they will then be eligible to apply to join the register. Each year the NMC receives over 22,000 newly qualified nurses and midwives from education institutions.  Registering nurses and midwives  there are 690,773 nurses and midwives on the NMC register, meaning the NMC is the body responsible for regulating the largest number of healthcare professionals in the UK. Nurses and midwives must be on the NMC register to practise in the UK. Anyone is able to search the NMC register.  Registering nursing associates  As of June 2019, there are 1,000 nursing associates on the NMC register.  Setting standards  The NMC's revised code became effective on 31 March 2015. The code contains professional standards of practice and behaviour that all nurses and midwives must keep to. Four key sections describe what nurses and midwives are expected to do: ‚Ä¢ prioritise people ‚Ä¢ practise effectively ‚Ä¢ preserve safety, and ‚Ä¢ promote professionalism and trust. The Code was updated to reflect changes in healthcare and society since its last publication in 2008. The updates include new requirements on the fundamentals of care, the duty of candour, raising concerns and social media use. The introduction to the code states: ‚ÄúWhen joining our register, and then renewing their registration, nurses and midwives commit to upholding these standards. This commitment to professional standards is fundamental to being part of a profession. We can take action if registered nurses or midwives fail to uphold the Code. In serious cases, this can include removing them from the register. The Code should be useful for everyone who cares about good nursing and midwifery.‚Äù  Revalidation  The NMC has committed to developing and implementing a system of revalidation. In October 2015, the NMC introduced the new system which all nurses and midwives in the UK must go through to remain on the NMC register. Nurses and midwives will need to renew their registration every three years and confirm that they continue to remain fit to practise by meeting the principles of the revised Code. They must demonstrate that they have completed the required hours of practice and learning activity through continuing professional development, have used feedback to review and improve the way they work, and have received confirmation from someone well placed to comment on their continuing fitness to practise. The NMC ran a public consultation from January to March 2014 on how revalidation can be applied in practice. Pilots involving over 2,000 nurses and midwives across the UK would inform the final plans. Revalidation for nurses and midwives will start on 1 April 2016, with approximately 16,000 nurses and midwives going through the process initially. All nurses on the NMC register will eventually go through revalidation when their registration is up for renewal. In January 2016, the NMC launched a microsite to assist nurses and midwives through the revalidation process.  Managing complaints about nurses and midwives  The NMC handles complaints made about nurses and midwives, and investigates allegations where appropriate. The NMC has the power to restrict a nurse or midwife's practice or strike them off their register. The NMC produced guidance for nurses and midwives on raising concerns which aims to help them take action in the public interest when needed. It includes information on legislation that offers protection to whistleblowers and information on organisations nurses and midwives can go to for further advice. Helene Donnelly, ambassador for cultural change at Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Partnership NHS Trust, spoke to NMC Council about raising concerns and gave her support to the guidance.  Legislation   Changes to healthcare regulation  On 2 April 2014, the Law Commission published its draft bill, Regulation of Health and Social Care Professionals. The bill aims \\"to aim to sweep away the out-dated and inflexible decision-making processes associated with the current legislation.\\" The bill would give healthcare regulators in the UK more autonomy. The NMC's Chief Executive and Registrar Jackie Smith welcomed the publication of the draft bill, but stated how the NMC needs the bill to become law quickly if it is able to modernise and become an efficient regulator. In its current legislative framework, the NMC spends nearly 80% of its income of fitness to practise hearings. Affecting regulation of professionals within the EU  The revised Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications (MRPQ) Directive, which came into effect 19 January 2016, will bring in a number of changes that aim to further facilitate the free movement of professionals within the EU, including amendments to language controls. The changes will enable the NMC to ensure, on a case-by-case basis, that a nurse or midwife from the EU has sufficient knowledge and command of English to practise safely and effectively.  Criticism   Accusations of bullying and racism  On 11 March 2008 two Members of Parliament Jim Devine and John Smith made accusations in the House of Commons of bullying and racism within the NMC. The accusations have been denied by the NMC. The government set up an independent inquiry asking the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence and the Charity Commission to investigate. The NMC have been accused of nepotism by its members, Nursing Standard, letters-2017. Due to senior members of the NMC also being the instigating officer in cases against nurses, belonging to the same NHS Trust. In one instance a nurse was struck off for a data issue; whereas another nurse witnessed assaulting patients was only suspended for one year. (BFNHST, 2017).  Panorama controversy  On 16 April 2009, nurse Margaret Haywood was barred from practising as a Nurse in the UK following a ruling by the NMC Conduct and Competence committee panel. This followed Haywood's contribution to a BBC Panorama television programme, exposing significant deficiencies in care at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, an acute teaching hospital in Brighton, England. The public and media response was generally antagonistic towards the NMC, the response being described by the Royal College of Nursing as 'unduly harsh'. On 12 October 2009, the striking off order was dropped, and replaced with a one-year caution.  Regulatory criticism  In an early July 2012 report, the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE), now known as the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA), critically examined the leadership of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. In late July 2012, a new chair for the NMC, Mark Addison, was appointed by the privy council, an appointment which was subject to criticism by the NMC Council, who described their \\"grave concern\\" with regard to what they claimed was a \\"lack of an open, transparent and equal opportunities process\\" in regards to the appointment. In contrast, the CHRE stated that they were pleased with the appointment of a new Chair, and that they would \\"look forward to working with Mark Addison\\". On 26 June 2015, the PSA reported in their performance review 2014‚Äì2015 report that the NMC had made overall improvements in their performance.  Data loss  In March 2013 the NMC was fined ¬£150,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office after it admitted that personal data, including \\"highly sensitive\\" information about nurses and about vulnerable children, had been placed on DVD without being encrypted, sent by courier and then lost. The ICO said that \\"it should have been obvious ... that such a contravention would be of a kind likely to cause substantial distress to the data subjects due to the nature of the data involved\\".  Increase in membership cost  The cost charged to remain registered on the NMC has increased from ¬£76 per year in 2013, to ¬£100 in 2014. Since 2015 the registration fee is ¬£120. The annual registration fee to the NMC is an allowable expense for UK income tax, however a survey by the NMC discovered that more than 75 percent of NMC registrants do not claim tax relief on their registration. Morecambe Bay The council was criticised by Bill Kirkup for the way it handled the investigation resulting from events at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust relating to misconduct by two midwives involved in the Furness General Hospital scandal. He said their response to his report had \\"fallen far short of expectations\\". The Professional Standards Authority said the regulator's investigation was \\"deficient\\" because evidence was not presented to the panel by the council, even though it had it in its possession. In 2018 the authority reported that the council had ignored more than 20 concerns raised by Cumbria police in 2012 for two years and that its handling of complaints was ‚Äúfrequently incompetent‚Äù. There was poor behaviour by staff towards families, reluctance to take concerns seriously and a lack of openness about mistakes it had made. The chief executive, Jackie Smith, resigned.  Regulator  The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA), is an independent body accountable to the UK Parliament, which promotes the health and wellbeing of the public and oversees the nine UK healthcare regulators, including the Nursing and Midwifery Council. In 2015 it was suggested that the costs of regulating the Nursing and Midwifery Council would be paid for by the membership of the NMC i.e. nurses and midwives. In 2015 the PSA published the 2014 audit it had undertaken of the NMC which found that whilst it had improved, it was still failing in areas.

Description Situated in the southern part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, north east of the centre of Bootle, Netherton is also north of Litherland and to the west of Aintree. Netherton also neighbours Sefton Village. Netherton is a mostly residential area, comprising the semi-rural Netherton Village, (which consists of privately owned houses set around the old Village Green) and the large council estate built by the former Bootle Borough Council on the other side of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The estate is unusual in the fact that many of the houses are still occupied by the same residents who moved in as young couples with families when the houses were brand new. The social profile of the first resident population does not comply to modern notions of council estate dwellers. Many of these people were hard working people with middle class aspirations, whose lives and careers were interrupted and often changed forever by the Second World War. However, the demographics of the Netherton area have changed significantly over time. A large number of the male residents moved in from all parts of the country to be key skilled workers at the English Electric factory heavy engineering works on Dunnings Bridge Road. The main estate, centred on Marian Square, was built in the mid 1950s to alleviate housing shortages in Bootle after the heavy bombing the town suffered during the Second World War. Historical records show that of about 18,000 houses in Bootle, only about 1,000 survived the German bombings completely intact. A remaining 16,000 houses were partially damaged and over a thousand completely destroyed. The Sefton Estate (which includes Stonyfield, Waterside, Harrops Croft and Higher End Park) was built by Lancashire County Council some ten years after the Netherton estate in the mid 1960s and were the first council houses in the area to have central heating. Marian Square is opposite the health centre in Magdalene Square (the two squares are divided by Glovers Lane, and should not be confused). The first shops (approximately five, including a health clinic and opticians) were built on Magdalene Square and were later demolished when the new shops and first new post office on Marian Square were opened. The original plans for the redevelopment for Magdalene Square, which were on view as a model in Bootle Town Hall in 1965, were for a 22 storey tower block and a leisure complex including swimming pool, neither of which were built (probably due to a lack of further investment in the area). There were also plans for a large ring road to link the motorways at Switch Island, running across fields to the north of the Sefton estate with the centre of Bootle and the landward side of Crosby, along a corridor of land which included the Rimrose Valley. The council purchased land along this corridor but the road was never built. There is a large mound of earth next to the small church near the Cabbage Inn (near the present fire station); which shows the start of the earthworks for the flyover linking the proposed ring road to the goods depot on the railway line near the Girobank building on Netherton Way. The proposed ring road is shown on some old Liverpool A to Z street plans. The unused land in the Rimrose Valley was made into an area of parkland, and new houses are being built on the old allotments at the other end of the Rimrose Valley in Litherland. Notable firms which hold, or once held, premises in Netherton include:- Braby's; English Electric; Forticrete; Metal Box; Movie (cleaning products); National Girobank; Peerless Refining Co.; North West Timber; Porter Chadburn; Post Office Telecommunications (British Telecom.); Scott's Bakery (now part of Allied Bakeries) and now the site of a large trading estate including cinema, Matalan store and a pub called the Bakers Dozen; Wimpey and to Alliance and Leicester. Netherton was formerly the home of the Everton F.C. youth academy, which has now been relocated to Finch Farm. The land was previously a fire station (the old brick building on the site) and the grounds of Littlewoods Social Club. This area has now been turned into a Goals football centre. On 19 August 2015 the Thornton to Switch Island link road (A5758) was opened. History Netherton was anciently a township associated with the parish of Sefton, becoming an independent civil parish in 1866. It became part of Sefton Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894, and then West Lancashire Rural District in 1932.Youngs, Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Volume 2. Netherton parish lost areas to the county borough of Bootle in 1940, 1951 and 1968 (reducing the parish from in 1931 to in 1951). The residual parish no longer exists, forming part of Sefton parish. The area has been a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton since local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974. For parliamentary elections Netherton is within the Bootle constituency represented by the Labour Party MP Peter Dowd. For elections to Sefton Council Netherton is split between the electoral wards of Netherton and Orrell, whose three representatives are Susan Ellen Bradshaw, Robert John Brennan, and Ian Ralph Maher, and St. Oswald, whose three representatives are Paula Spencer, Carla Thomas and Linda Cluskey. All six councillors who represent the Netherton area are members of the Labour Party. Architecture The oldest houses are to be found at the heart of the old hamlet of Netherton, clustered around the green in what is now known as Netherton Village, just north of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The old catholic church of St. Benet nearby was built in 1793.Pevsner, Nikolaus - The Buildings of England: South Lancashire, 1969. Unusually it appears as an ordinary house from the road with the church backing onto what was once open fields. A modern church was built over the road in the 1970s. Nowadays, Netherton is formed with many modern housing, the most recent being the George Wimpey estate, completed in 2000, built just from Netherton Village green. Housing in this part of Netherton is considered rather desirable, unlike the council-owned housing closer to the town's shopping amenities. Education Netherton is home to one secondary school, Savio High School. Formerly there was St Ambrose Barlow High School, Bootle Grammar School and Warwick Bolam County Secondary School as well as a Girl's County Secondary School. In August 2009, Bootle High School closed its doors for the last time as students transferred to Litherland High School. In December 2009, works started to demolish the school on Browns Lane. Now however the properties on the council estate are mostly privately owned and were bought under the right to buy scheme brought in by the conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. St Ambrose Barlow was formerly St. Catherine's Roman Catholic High School and was for girls only, also closed on 11 November 2016. The corresponding boy's school was St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic High School, situated approximately on mile away on the other side of the canal. Transport Netherton is served by two railway-stations: Aintree and Old Roan, on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. The Old Roan station is technically in Aintree, but is on the border between the two areas. Old Roan bus station is next to the railway-station. Buses run from here and Magdalene Square into central Liverpool (those from Magdalene Square also serve parts of Bootle) as well as North to Maghull, Ormskirk and Southport. The area is situated close to the major interchange, Switch Island, at the end of the M57 and M58 motorways. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal flows through Netherton and whilst this provides a local amenity, there is very little boat traffic on this stretch of its course.

Situated to the north east of Crosby, it is a residential area of semi-detached and detached housing which dates mainly from the 1930s. Many of the houses, particularly those around Edge Lane and Water Street, feature notably long gardens. The A565 Liverpool-Southport road serves the area. At the 2001 Census the population of the village and civil parish was recorded as 2,262, falling to 2,139 at the Census 2011. History Historically part of Lancashire. During the compilation of the Domesday Book in 1086, the settlement of Torent√∫n is recorded, along with the settlement of Homer Green, which far outdates any claim that Ince Blundell is the oldest village in Sefton. Thornton was combined with Crosby Village and Blundellsands to form the Great Crosby urban district. The district subsequently became part the municipal borough of Crosby in 1937. Thornton was still served by West Lancashire Council until the formation of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton on 1 April 1974. Thornton still however retains Parish Council status and therefore has a historical boundary. Governance From 1950 until 2010 Thornton was within the boundaries of the Crosby constituency, whose MP from 1997 till 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party, prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MP's elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished with its northern parts, including Thornton, being merged with the Eastern parts of Sefton that were formerly part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency, to form the new constituency of Sefton Central, which is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson. For elections to Sefton Council Thornton is within the Manor electoral ward and is represented by three councillors. The councillors of Manor ward are Martyn Barber of the Conservative Party, John Gibson of the Liberal Democrats, and Steve McGinnity of the Labour Party. Description The Parish Council consists of seven councillors, who are all local residents. They meet every other month at St. Frideswydes Church. Notice of these meetings are displayed on the village notice board by the post office and on the small notice board on the railing surrounding the stocks. There are three schools in Thornton: St William Of York RC Primary School, Holy Family Catholic High School and Thornton College, which is an annexe of Hugh Baird College. In 2003, Cherie Blair QC, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, officially came to Thornton to open Holy Family's new Sixth Form building. There are two churches in Thornton: The King's Church, Drummond Road http://www.thekingschurchmerseyside.org/ and St William Of York RC Church, St William Road. St Frideswydes C of E Church, formerly on Water Street, was demolished in 2012 and merged with All Saints C of E Church at the north end of Great Crosby.http://thorntonpc.org.uk/town- history/ Thornton also has two historical public houses dating back to the early 19th century called the Nags Head, which is situated opposite Water Street, and the Grapes Hotel. Thornton has set of stocks located at the junction of Green Lane & Water Street. These, along with the local sundial, can be dated back to the late 18th century and are Grade II listed monuments. There is another Grade II listed monument located in Back Lane called Brooms Cross. This is a wayside cross which lies on what was the old bridleway that ran from Hightown / Ince Blundell to Sefton Parish Church, St. Helens. It was here that funeral processions would come to rest and have refreshments before continuing to the church. Unfortunately this monument, which was restored to celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee Year of 1977, has become the target of vandals.

He was killed shortly after he departed Timbuktu, some five weeks later. Early life Laing was born in Edinburgh in late 1794. He was educated by his father, William Laing, who was a private teacher of classics, and at the University of Edinburgh. In 1811, he went to Barbados as clerk to his maternal uncle Colonel Gabriel Gordon Military service Through General Sir George Beckwith, the governor of Barbados, he obtained an ensigncy in the York Light Infantry Volunteers in 1813. He was promoted lieutenant without purchase in 1815 and transferred to the 2nd West India Regiment after his former regiment was disbanded in 1817. In 1822 he transferred into the Royal African Colonial Corps as a captain. In that year, while with his regiment at Sierra Leone, he was sent by the governor Sir Charles MacCarthy, to the Mandingo country, with the double object of opening up commerce and endeavouring to abolish the slave trade in that region. Later that year, Laing visited Falaba, the capital of the Solimana country, and ascertained the source of the Rokel. He endeavoured to reach the source of the Niger, but was stopped by the natives. He was, however, able to fix it with approximate accuracy. In 1824 he was granted the local rank of major in Africa only. He took an active part in the Ashanti War of 1823-24, and was sent home with the despatches containing the news of the death in action of Sir Charles MacCarthy. While in England in 1824, Laing prepared a narrative of his journeys, which was published in 1825 and entitled Travels in the Timannee, Kooranko and Soolima Countries, in Western Africa. Trip to Timbuktu Djinguereber and Sidi Yahya mosques Laing believed he had found the source of the Niger and proposed to travel along the river to its delta. Joseph Banks, president of the African Association supported his project, hoping that the expedition would reveal the location of Timbuktu. Henry, 3rd Earl Bathurst, then secretary for the colonies, instructed Captain Laing to undertake a journey, via Tripoli and Timbuktu, to further elucidate the hydrography of the Niger basin. Laing left England in February 1825, and at Tripoli on 14 July he married Emma Warrington, daughter of the British consul. Two days later, leaving his bride behind, he started to cross the Sahara, accompanied by a sheikh who was subsequently accused of planning his murder. Ghadames was reached, by an indirect route, in October 1825, and in December Laing reached In Salah in the Tuat territory, where he was well received by one particular group of Tuareg. On 10 January 1826, he left Tuat and made for Timbuktu across the desert of Tanezrouft. Letters written in May and July told of his suffering from fever and the plundering of his caravan by another group of Tuareg. Laing describes being wounded in 24 places in the fighting. Together with another survivor, he managed to reach Sidi Al Muktar, penniless and having lost his right hand. He joined another caravan and reached Timbuktu, thus becoming the first European to cross the Sahara from north to south. His letter dated from Timbuktu on 21 September announced his arrival in that city on the preceding 18 August, and the insecurity of his position owing to the hostility of the Fula chieftain Bello, then ruling the city. He added that he intended leaving Timbuktu in three days time. No further news was received from the explorer. From information pieced together later, it was ascertained that he left Timbuktu on the day he had planned. He may have been strangled by Tuareg raiderstwo men pulling on each end of a turban wrapped around Laing's neckon or about the night of 26 September 1826. Aftermath Gordon Laing's House in Timbuktu. Laing's papers were never recovered, and his father-in-law, Hanmer Warrington, accused the French (who also wanted to reach Timbuktu) of interference and having procured Laing's journal; however, there has never been any evidence for this. Ren√© Cailli√© reached Timbuktu two years after Laing and by returning alive was able to claim the 10,000-franc prize offered by the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie for the feat. Both men were awarded the Gold Medal of the Society for 1830. In 1903, the French government placed a tablet bearing Laing's name and the date of his visit on the house occupied by him during his 38-day stay in Timbuktu. This house, located in the Djingareiber district, inside the old town, was declared a National Heritage by decree of 18 December 1992.

Along with his brother, Gaspard, he is credited with making French artillery the most effective in the world.Jeff Kinard, Artillery: An Illustrated History of its Impact (ABC-CLIO, 2007), pp. 59‚Äì63. As Master Gunner of Artillery in the armies of Charles VII, Bureau acquired a reputation as an effective artillery officer during the Normandy campaign (1449‚Äì1450), when his bombardments helped capture the towns of Rouen, Harfleur, and Honfleur, and aided in the French victory at Formigny. Bureau commanded the victorious French army at the decisive Battle of Castillon in 1453. Early life and campaigns Bureau was born in Semoine, Champagne, the second son of Simon Bureau, a merchant, and his wife, H√©l√®ne.Bureau Origines. Retrieved: 3 April 2013. In 1420, he moved to Paris to work as a lawyer. He was a legal official at the Ch√¢telet during the occupation of Paris by the Duke of Bedford.Desmond Seward, The Hundred Years War: The English in France 1337‚Äì1453 (Penguin, 1999). Described as a \\"perfectionist with a methodical, mathematical mind,\\" and \\"an imaginative technician who knew how to get the best out of his primitive weapons,\\" Bureau likely learned the artillery trade for its commercial potential. The Bureau brothers were aided by innovations in the manufacture of gunpowder in the late 1420s that generated a more potent powder that could fire projectiles at a much greater velocity, and did not require mixing in the field. Simultaneously, innovations in casting helped create stronger barrels that were less likely to explode. In 1434, the Bureaus offered their services to Charles VII, and quickly asserted themselves as artillery experts. Jean was appointed \\"governor of the French archers\\" and Gaspard was appointed \\"master of ordinance,\\" and by 1439, Jean was the Master Gunner of the French Artillery. Jean was also appointed \\"Receiver of Paris\\" in 1436, \\"Treasurer of France\\" in 1443, and mayor of La Rochelle in 1448. The Bureaus' artillery had an immediate impact, aiding the French in the sieges of Montereau (1437), Meaux (1439), Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1440), and Pontoise (1441). The Bureaus helped suppress the Praguerie rebellion against Charles in 1440. Later campaigns When the Treaty of Tours (which had established a truce between England and France) ended in 1449, Charles VII launched a campaign to retake Normandy in northern France. Bombardments by the Bureaus' artillery aided in the capture of Rouen (October 1449), Harfleur (December 1449), Honfleur (January 1450), and Fresnoy (January 1450). To ensure a continuous bombardment of English-held Cherbourg, the Bureaus placed their guns below the high water mark on the town's seaward side, leaving them submerged during high tide, and returning to resume the bombardment during low tide. On 15 April 1450, a French force led by the Duke of Bourbon clashed with an English force sent to relieve the beleaguered region at the Battle of Formigny. The French initially attempted to charge the English position, but were driven back by English longbowmen. The Bureaus then advanced two cannons (likely two breechloading culverins), and barraged the English position. The barrage was effective, particularly since the cannons had a greater range than English longbows, but the French failed to provide protection for the cannons, and the English were able to charge and capture them. Cavalry reinforcements arrived later in the day to seal a decisive victory for the French, which paved the way for the capture of the remaining English strongholds in Normandy. In 1451, the Bureaus joined the French invasion of Gascony, in southwestern France, and were instrumental in the recapture of several cities, including Bordeaux, which surrendered in June. Jean Bureau was appointed Mayor of Bordeaux in August 1451, but the local Gascon population revolted against the new leaders and invited the English to return. In October 1452, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Sir John Talbot, reoccupied Bordeaux with an English force of 3,000. Within a few months, he had regained control of much of the Gascony region. The French launched their campaign to retake Gascony in the Spring of 1453. Bureau, now leading an army of about 7,000, laid siege to the town of Castillon, east of Bordeaux. He deployed 300 cannon in fortified field defenses on the town's perimeter. Remembering the loss of his cannons at Formigny, he attached a force of archers in the woods adjacent to his position to protect the cannons from capture. Talbot arrived with a relief force on 17 July, and routed a small advanced force of French archers. Mistakenly believing the French were retreating, he attacked the French camp, and his army was decimated by Bureau's cannon fire. Talbot's horse was hit by a cannonball, and he was killed by a French archer shortly after. Bureau proceeded to Bordeaux, which he surrounded with 250 artillery pieces. After a 10-week siege, Bordeaux sent a delegation to Charles VII asking for terms of surrender. Bureau, confident in the positions of his batteries, told the king, \\"I promise you on my life that in a few days I shall have demolished the town.\\" Hearing this statement, the delegation agreed to accept Charles' harsh terms, and control of the town was turned over to the French on 19 October 1453.Henry Smith Williams, The Historians' History of the World, Vol. 11 (Hooper and Jackson, Ltd., 1909), p. 241. Later life After the war, Bureau was ennobled as the Lord of Montglas. He was knighted in 1461. He and his brother continued to serve as advisors to Charles' son and successor, Louis XI, even though Louis dismissed most of Charles' staff. Bureau died in 1463.
