Fester's Quest The Addams Family The Addams Family is a platform game released by Ocean in 1992. The game was released for TurboGrafx-16, Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, Super NES, Amiga and Atari ST. It is based on the 1991 movie of the same name. Other titles based on the film were released for other platforms. The characters bear resemblances to their movie counterparts. The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a video game released by Ocean in 1992 in Europe and 1993 in North America. It was based on the second animated series. It was released in North America on all three of Nintendo's systems at the time: * Super NES in February, 1993 * Game Boy in July, 1993 * NES in August, 1993 The Game Boy version was ported for the system by Enigma Variations Ltd. Story The plot of Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt centered on Pugsley's attempts to win a scavenger hunt challenge proposed by his sister, Wednesday. His hunt takes him to the bedrooms of each member of the Addams family in order to find one item from each. Gameplay The game is a side scrolling platformer adventure game that plays in a very similar way to the previous Addams Family title. The game plays in a non-linear way in so much that the player can choose which level to attempt by entering whichever door they choose in the Addams house. Versions The NES version was not a direct port of the SNES version. The NES version was actually based on the previous Addams Family game released for Super NES, Mega Drive and Amiga, showing the same levels, enemies, items and gameplay but with Pugsley as main character instead of Gomez. However, the NES version lacked the freezer and crypt levels (they were reduced to the boss fights only) and the rest of the levels were shortened. It also lacked any music, aside from the Addams Family theme on the title screen and ending. The NES version also lacked the two weapons from the SNES (swords and golf balls). However, it did allow the player to obtain a password whenever they paused the game, whereas the SNES Addams Family would only display passwords after each boss was defeated. The Game Boy version was a port of the NES version. However, it had cut even more of the game. The stove level was completely removed (defeating the snowman boss would award Pugsley a heart like the other versions, but would also free Granny) as well as the big bird boss (Pugsley would start the game with the extra heart already in his possession). The final level was also removed, as entering the final door would send Pugsley directly to the final boss fight. Thing's hint boxes were also removed from this version. Reception A major source of criticism for the SNES version was the lack of a password feature, despite the game being very difficult. A password feature is present on both the NES and Game Boy versions. Super Play Magazine UK praised the graphics as they were more colourful than in the previous title, saying that \\"This is one of those games that it's fun just to sit and watch, not only to play.\\" Review scores for the SNES version are generally higher than for either the NES or Game Boy versions. Addams Family Values Addams Family Values is an Action RPG based on the film of the same name produced by Ocean Software and released in 1995 for the Sega Mega Drive and Super NES. Story Loosely based on the plot of the film, the player takes the role of Uncle Fester as he searches for the recently kidnapped baby Pubert. On the way he receives help from The Addams Family and a host of original characters from the game. Gameplay An action adventure game with slight RPG elements (you gain more hit points while proceeding in the game, can upgrade your equipment and special attacks). You control Fester, by moving him around, fighting regular enemies and bosses, talking to members of Addams household, and occasionally solving puzzles. The combat is pure action, Zelda-style. The New Addams Family The New Addams Family (The New Addams Family Series in Europe) is an adventure video game released for Nintendo's Game Boy Color in 2001. It was developed by 7th Sense and published by MC2-Micro√Øds. It is based on The New Addams Family television series that ran from 1998 to 1999. Story The family mansion is going to be demolished and replaced by an amusement park, and therefore the family will be evicted. While the adults are trying to find a solution, the children roam the house helping out in their own peculiar way. Only if they find the estate ownership documents will the contractors can be stopped. Gameplay The player controls both Pugsley and Wednesday Addams, and must navigate the house, collecting items, solving puzzles and conversing with other members of the family. The Addams Family Mystery Mansion There is also a 2019 mobile game called The Addams Family Mystery Mansion for Android and iOS.https://www.addamsfamily.game It was produced by pixowl/Animoca Brands.  Story  Morticia and Gomez return home to their mansion to find the rest of their family missing.

As males only contain one X chromosome, male flies dosage compensate for the X chromosome by hyper-transcribing the X chromosome. This is achieved by the MSL complex binding to the X chromosome and inducing histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation and allows for the formation of euchromatin. These ncRNAs were first discovered in RNA extracted from neuronal cells. Two roX RNAs have been identified in the MSL complex from Drosophila melanogaster and have been shown to be conserved across different drosophila species. The two roX RNAs, known as roX1 and roX2 have been shown to differ in primary sequence and sequence length but despite these differences they both contain a MSL binding site and are functionally redundant. Cloning roX genes and subsequent sequence alignment from a number of different drosophila species identified several conserved regions and it was also noticed that roX RNA is only present in male flies. Secondary structure predictions predicted a stem loop to be present at the 3' end of the roX RNA transcripts. Mutagenesis within this region that either altered the sequence or prevented stem loop formation was shown to be lethal in male flies as they were unable to dosage compensate as these mutations prevented MSL binding to the X chromosome. It was also shown that in the presence of mutant roX RNA the MSL complex was unable to localize on the X chromosome and mislocalize to the heterochromatic chromocenter. This suggests that roX RNA plays a role in directing MSL complex to the X chromosome. Sequence alignment of roX2 identified several regions of sequence conservation known as Gub regions and are absent in roX1. Many of these Gub regions are thought to be redundant as mutating has no effect however, Gub1 which is present within the 3' stem loop region is thought to be a key motif required for roX2 as Gub1 mutations were shown to be lethal. These studies show that roX RNA are essential for dosage compensation where that the 3' stem loop region in the roX RNA are crucial for MSL localization and it is thought to be the motif that allows the two roX RNAs to be functionally redundant.

The Enercon E-126 is an onshore wind turbine model manufactured by the German company Enercon. With a hub height of , rotor diameter of and a total height of , the turbine can generate up to of power, making it the largest wind turbine in the world (by nameplate capacity) for several years, until it was overtaken in 2014 by the Danish company Vestas with their V164-8.0 turbine. Their model number is a reference to their rotor diameter. History The project had come about after Enercon decided to pursue a larger turbine than the 2MW E-66. For some time, Enercon worked on the E-112 project - a turbine with a generator output of 2.25x the 2MW E-66, with it eventually being available for sale sometime in 2002. Enercon then tweaked the E-112's rotor diameter from 112m to 114m, for a slight benefit in efficiency. The turbine didn't sell well - only two 4.5MW units exist as of today, which prompted Enercon to increase the generator output from 4.5MW to 6MW - which, to put into visual terms, was the same as building three 1.5MW turbines, and adding a 4th turbine at a later date. However, while the generator power output increase did increase sales, by 2008 sales were literally non existent, due to two key factors: * The fact that the wind turbines were extremely expensive to manufacture, transport and assemble, * That Enercon was having to contend with ever-stiffening competition from fellow wind turbine builders, such as Senvion SE and Vestas Wind Systems A/S from Denmark. Unfortunately for Enercon, the belief that the turbine's massive nameplate capacity would market itself to operators backfired, and it became a massive failure, with only 9 being ever installed, and this failure prompted Enercon to start tweaking the design. Enercon's new E-126 project, from the outset, didn't seem to be a massive change from the E-112, but rather an evolution of the model with a slightly higher hub height (135m vs. 124m) and a slightly larger rotor (127m vs 112/114m) with a new blade profile. For this new model, the sales were also slow, but sometime in 2011, Enercon increased the generator output from 6MW to 7.58MW. Sales then began to increase, with the first large-scale purchase of this wind turbine model was at Estinnes Wind Park in Belgium, with 11 wind turbines ordered for installation. E-112, the predecessor to E-126. Note the different rotor blade profile. Specifications There are three variants of the E-126, of which are: EP3 low-wind, EP4 mid-wind and EP8 high-wind models. For the sake of simplicity, this article focuses on the EP8 E-126. The power output of the generator was , but has been uprated to after technical revisions were performed in 2009. Since 2011 the E-126 is available as a 7.6 MW nameplate capacity. The E-126 incorporates power electronics and offers grid stabilising capabilities. The weight of the foundation of the turbine tower is about 2,500 t, the tower itself 2,800 t, the machine housing 128 t, the generator 220 t, the rotor (including the blade) 364 t. The total weight is 6,012 tonnes exactly. The first turbine of this model was installed in Emden, Germany in 2007, at Rysumer Nacken Wind Park.Enercon E126 from official Enercon website The list price of one unit is $14 million plus install costs. Market In June 2012, at least 147 Enercon E-126 windturbines were operating, in construction, or nearing final approval, 35 of them completed and operating.Summary of existing and planned E-126 wind turbines (based on public available www-info till June 2012) Furthermore, during 2010-2011, onshore wind farm projects still in their early design processes were considering wind turbines of the 2-3.5 MW class, or wind turbines of the 5-8 MW class. This approach is at least applied in the Netherlands. Examples for this trend are found for instance in the preliminary research for the \\"Wind farm de Drentse Monden\\" aiming at 300-450 MW with possibly 50-60 E-126/7.5 MW turbines, \\"Wind farm N33\\" aiming at >120 MW with possibly 15-40 E-126/7.5 MW turbines, \\"Wind farm Krammer\\" aiming at >100 MW with possibly 11-21 E-126/7.5 MW turbines, \\"Wind farm Wieringermeer\\" aiming 200-400 MW with possibly 60 or more 6+ MW turbines (in that case possibly Repower 6M/6.15MW).

In 1910, the most prominent social theorists in the world gather in London for a conference on the new science of sociology. Things rapidly fall apart, though, as a fight breaks out, a jewel is stolen, and famous sociologist Emile Durkheim disappears. As Sherlock Holmes and Watson investigate, it appears that social theory may not only explain actions --in this case, it may be the cause of them. So Holmes and Watson investigate social theory itself, learning directly from those creating it: W. E. B. Du Bois, Sigmund Freud, Vladimir Lenin, Beatrice Webb, Georg Simmel, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber. The theories, lives, and passions of each sociologist are revealed as Holmes and Watson learn first-hand just how influential social theory can be.

Vainshtein (1926‚Äì2008) was a Russian ethnographer, archaeologist, historian and explorer of Siberian and Central Asian peoples. He was a professor at the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Family His father, Israel Vainshtein, had been a professor of philosophy at the Avia Institute in Moscow. During the terror-years of Stalin, in 1936 he was accused of spying for the Germans, and, after an excruciating two-year prison stay, he was shot to death ‚Äì but was completely rehabilitated posthumously. Sevyan‚Äôs mother was from Riga; after her marriage in Russia she became a teacher of the German language. First expedition Sevyan Vainshtein had concluded his study of ethnology at the University of Moscow in 1950, while in 1947 he had been honoured with a high university award for his religious-philosophical work about the Ishmaelites. During his studies, Vainshtein was able to participate in an expedition into Siberia in 1948 to the river Podkamennaya Tunguska (Substone Tunguska), a 1,150 mile long tributary of the great Yenisei River, in order to visit the small Nordic Kets people with the aim to research their cultural roots as well as the circumstances of their life at the time. To him it became obvious that the Kets and their culture were threatened with extinction. Consequently he wrote a respective report to the Institute, stressing the Kets‚Äô poor living conditions and suggesting federal aid. This report was considered to discredit Russia's ethnic politics, and he was expelled from the Young Communist League (Comsomol) and from the Institute. But Vainshtein, with his firmness to defending peoples‚Äô rights, then wrote a letter to Molotov, and some time later it was decided to check the facts in Vainshtein‚Äôs report by sending a new expedition to the Kets, which proved that his initial report was correct and that this people badly needed help, which then was in fact provided. Vainshtein was restored in the Institute and became one of the prominent students. Second expedition He was also encouraged to undertake a second expedition in 1949, during which Vainshtein could also establish that the Kets consisted of two tribes, whose northern branch were likely those whose ancestors had migrated across the land bridge of the then-dry Bering Strait into America some 12,000 years ago. The Kets‚Äô southern tribe was said to have settled in southern Siberia near the headwaters of the Yenisei. When having obtained his university degree in 1950, he proposed researching the origins of the southern Kets, and after this was agreed upon in the same year, he had reached the territory of what today is Tuva ‚Äì another region of Siberia which ethnologically and archaeologically represented an almost complete white area (terra incognita) on the Soviet Union‚Äôs map. 1950s In Tuva‚Äôs capital city Kyzyl, Vainshtein worked as scientific director at the State Museum from 1950 to 1954, and following that period he was asked to work in the same capacity at the Tuvan Institute for History, Language and Literature. During this time he also met the Russian music pedagogue Alevtina (Alla) Petrova, who was teaching in Tuva the Russian classical music heritage, and the two got married in Kyzyl. Within this almost 10-year period, Vainshtein undertook wide-ranging ethnographic and archaeologic research in many parts of Tuva. Among these scientific endeavours, he visited and interviewed thousands of Tuvans and explored hundreds of important archaeological monuments, including kurgans of the ancient Scythian culture, all of which he thoroughly researched and described in Russian and international scientific publications. In order to materialize his field research, he undertook uncounted trips on inhospitable expedition trails over thousands of kilometers on horse back, on the backs of reindeers and camels, but as well on foot, because Tuva had only very few consolidated roads at the time, especially in the eastern Sayan Mountains. Late in 1959, Vainshtein and his family returned to Moscow. At the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the RAS, he began to undertake further intensive research into the large Asian migrations of ancient times, and about the Tuvans and their evolution in particular, bolstering this up with regular field research in Tuva and elsewhere in Central Asia. 1960s In 1961 Vainshtein took a degree in history as Dr. Sc.with his thesis about the origins and culture of the Tuvan people, and was later appointed professor at his Institute. At an Anthropology Congress in Moscow in 1964, Sevyan Vainshtein was approached by another participant, the world-renowned explorer Thor Heyerdahl of Norway, who had asked him for a separate discussion, requesting Vainshtein to tell him more about his expeditions and to let him read his diaries. The two had a long conversation, during which Heyerdahl also reflected about his own expeditions and research. After a few days he visited Vainshtein again, returning his diaries, and strongly suggested to him to one day write a book about his personal experiences along with interesting details about his life on expeditions into Central Asia, aimed not only at the science community but also at the general public interested in foreign peoples and cultures. In saying good-bye, Heyerdahl remarked to him with emphasis: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt postpone the work on such a book for too long. There will be many interested readers the world over. Believe my own experience!‚Äù 1980s & 1990s He undertook his last major journey to Tuva in 1983. In these almost 25 years of hard work, Vainshtein with his distinctly developed inquiring mind was also able to expand his scientific studies towards the Tofalars, the Altai people, the Buryats and the Mongolians. Further research and study trips followed into the 1990s. Documentary In the late 1990s, the well-known Russian filmmaker Leonid Kruglov visited Vainshtein with the proposal to produce a film about his expeditions into Tuva, using as a ‚Äòred line‚Äô Vainshtein‚Äôs correspondence with American Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, who had written him a letter in 1981 requesting his help in securing a visa to visit Tuva, which, was not granted during Feynman‚Äôs lifetime. [In June 2009, Feynman‚Äôs daughter Michelle did visit Tuva accompanied by a BBC reporter.] To make the documentary, Kruglov and his film crew had to travel on the backs of horses and reindeer to reach those places in Tuva which Vainshtein had visited and researched so thoroughly. During many strenuous months of filming, Kruglov also managed to reach a mysterious location high up in the taiga of the eastern Sayan Mountains, which Vainshtein had in vain tried to visit: the mineral springs Arshan-Tschoigan, the immense healing qualities of which only very few people are able to utilize because it is extremely difficult to get to during the few weeks a year when the springs unfold their unique powers. Sevyan Vainshtein, in the year 2000, was awarded the title ‚ÄúHonourable Scientist of Russia‚Äù by the Russian president. Already in 1977 he was honoured by the parliament of Tuva with the award ‚ÄúScientist of Honour of the Republic of Tuva‚Äù. The Russian State Museum for Oriental Art has recently named Vainshtein‚Äôs monographs a ‚Äògolden discovery‚Äô for the Russian ethnology, especially his aforementioned book ‚ÄúThe History of Folk Art in Tuva‚Äù, a work that is not only important for Tuvan science but also for the history of art of many other peoples of Central Asia and South Siberia. Publications He has to his name more than 300 scientific publications, including numerous monographs, of which his main works are: *The Todsha-Tuvans ‚Äì Historic-Ethnographical Studies, Moscow 1961 *The Historic Ethnography of Tuvans ‚Äì Problems of a Nomadic Economy, Moscow 1972 *The History of Folk Art in Tuva, Moscow 1974 *Nomads of South Siberia, Moscow 1980, and Cambridge 1980 and 2009 *The World of Nomads in the Center of Asia, Moscow 1991 and Berlin 1996 In his 1971 publication entitled The Problem of the Origins of Reindeer Herding in Eurasia, Part II: The Role of the Sayan Center in the Diffusion of Reindeer Herding in Eurasia, Vainshtein argued that that Sayan reindeer herding \\"is the oldest form of reindeer herding and is associated with the earliest domestication of the reindeer by the Samoyedic taiga population of the Sayan Mountains at the turn of the first millenium A.D...The Sayan region was apparently the origin of the economic and cultural complex of reindeer hunters-herdsmen that we now see among the various Evenki groups and the peoples of the Sayan area.\\" The Sayan ethnic groups still live almost exclusively in the area of the Eastern Sayan mountains. A total of 30 works, including two monographs, have been translated into English and German as well as into numerous other European languages. The author was invited to hold scientific lectures about Siberian peoples, especially about Tuvans and their tradition of shamanism, at the universities of Moscow, Novosibirsk and Cambridge, but also in Germany, Finland, France, Sweden, Japan and in the USA. Vainshtein‚Äôs last book is the one that Thor Heyderdahl had urged him to write ‚Äì a popular-scientific book with his personal experiences and details of the almost 50 years of exploratory travels and research in Central Asia, especially in Tuva, which one can also classify as an autobiographical account of his incredibly difficult expeditions on unknown paths into hitherto uncharted lands. Under the close guidance of Sevyan Vainshtein, this book was first published in German, with the title \\"Geheimnisvolles Tuwa ‚Äì Expeditionen in das Herz Asiens\\", Oststeinbek 2005/2006, along with a DVD featuring Leonid Kruglov's aforementioned documentary as well as many of his photos, and examples of the famous Tuvan throatsinging. The book‚Äôs Russian version, again under the close guidance of the author, was finally produced with the personal help and support of the Tuvan representative of the State Duma, deputy Larisa Shoigu and some of her friends: it was published in Moscow in January 2009, shortly before the author's unexpected death in October 2008. When this book was presented by Larisa Shoigu in the conference hall of the Aldan Maadyr Tuvan National Museum in June 2009, where Vainshtein had once been the scientific director, officials pleaded to undertake the necessary steps to publish all of Sevyan Vainshtein‚Äôs books as a multi-volume edition of collected works.

It ran through Wittenberge, D√∂mitz, Dannenberg, L√ºneburg and Buchholz and was originally to have been extended to Bremerhaven. The single-tracked main line ran through the present-day states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Lower Saxony. With the destruction of the bridge over the Elbe at D√∂mitz at the end of the Second World War and the subsequent division of Germany it suddenly lost its importance and, as a result, was partially closed. Today two sections of the line are still open: the longer one of the two between Dannenberg and L√ºneburg in the Wendland is known today as the Wendland Railway (Wendlandbahn); whilst western end of the shorter section from Buchholz to Jesteburg merges into the line to the Maschen Marshalling Yard. The freight carried on the line includes the transport of nuclear waste containers with radioactive waste to a terminal at the end of the track one kilometre east of the Dannenberg Ost station, where it is off loaded for further transport by road to a nuclear waste storage facility.

The name has various interpretations, including \\"Malagasy Western Slave Youth\\" and \\"Zatovo Warriors' Association of Malagasy\\". The term \\"Western\\" in the title comes from the fact that members of the group were fans of Spaghetti Westerns and dressed in cowboy hats. According to Lesley Sharp the \\"cowboys\\" of ZWAM \\"assumed a style of dress reminiscent of Clint Eastwood, a loner recognized as the 'champion of real justice' over 'the venal guardians of formal law'\\". The group later changed its name to ZOAM, an acronym for Zatovo Orin'Asa Malagasy (\\"Young Unemployed of Madagascar\\"). The movement drew its membership from the poor, \\"black\\" quarters of the capital, traditionally inhabited by the descendants of slaves. ZWAM were the first slave descendants to form an organisation in Madagascar and they campaigned against discrimination against slave descendants in education and employment.

The municipality covers an area of , and has a population of 2,022 (as at 28 August 2006). Troubsko lies approximately south-west of Brno and south-east of Prague. History The first written reference about this village comes from year 1237, when in the charter of a king V√°clav I. is Robert from Troubsko cited as a witness. This lower nobleman apparently wasn‚Äôt the owner of the whole village; later references testify that Troubsko was in accordance with the then practice of fragmented holdings divided among several owners. In the years 1317-1389 there existed a feudal estate of the Olomouc bishopric. In 1349 Luder, prior of the Dominicans in Brno, bought with his niece Catherine four acres in Troubsko from the citizen named Anselm and donated them to Herbursk monastery. This part of the village administratively separated from the remaining larger part for a long time and after the transfer of assets of Herbursk monastery to a Jesuit college in the years 1578-1581 it became a part of the estate of ≈òeƒçkovice. Stated greater part of the village, divided into unequal shares, changed owners frequently, and during the 14th and 15th century was held by members of various noble families - from K≈ôi≈æ√≠nkov, from Rohozov, from Svojanov and especially numerous members of the old gentry family from Her≈°pice. Troubsko in 2012 Maty√°≈° Munk from Ivanƒçice bought the whole village and from the year 1573 he is cited as the only owner, until 1609. In these years he also began the construction of the castle in place of former fortress. To the other owners of the estate belonged personalities like Karel Elder of ≈Ωerot√≠n, Albrecht from Vald≈°tejn or Ji≈ô√≠ Rupert Hauspersk√Ω. Troubsko reached the largest economic and cultural development in 1735 to 1806, when Tom√°≈° Jan Sekora from Sekenberg owned the village. He devoted himself to the economy, expanded the number of artisans and supported fishing and forestry. After his untimely death his wife Anna Marie and his daughter Marie Cecilie continued in his work. The most sights are preserved until now from this period. In 1826 the manor was given to Leopold Hodak. At this time was built the school and the railroad; the village was also promoted as township in 1876. The public activity of the population began to develop in unprecedented extent; in this time the alliance of Podƒõbrady, fire brigade, TJ Sokol and Eagle were established. Ethnographical Exhibition was held from which is passed the preservation of the old customs and traditions. The last owners of Troubsko‚Äôs manor in interwar period were Hugo Pt√°ƒçn√≠k, Josefa Gabriela Pt√°ƒçn√≠kov√° and Bed≈ôich Hochberg.

History  From 1031 until 1305, Moravia was ruled by the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. To improve the use of agricultural area and to gain higher yields, the P≈ôemyslides were looking for colonists by offering them 10 years of tax free living. Up until the year 1150 German colonists from Lower Austria settled around the area of Mikulov (Nikolsburg) und Znojmo (Znaim). Vlasatice is an Angerdorf, a Germanic type of village characterized by the houses and farmsteads being laid out around a central grassed area, the anger (from the Old High German angar = pasture or grassy place), a village green which was common land, owned jointly by the village community. German was spoken in Vlasatice until 1946, derived from a Central Bavarian dialect with the ui-slang indicates, that the settlers originally came from areas in Bavaria, from around the bishopry of Regensburg und Passau. The settlers brought a new way of doing agriculture, the so-called three-field system with crop rotation and new agricultural tools. Since 1276 the town of Vlasatice was in possession of the monastery of Rosa Coeli. From 1342 until 1633 the village had a system of High justice, in German as Blutgerichtsbarkeit (lit. \\"blood justice\\", \\"blood-court\\"; sometimes also known as Halsgericht), which is the highest penal authority, including capital punishment. The name of the town changed from \\"Wassatycz\\" (1333) via \\"Wasaticz\\" (1370) to \\"Bassatitz\\" in the 17th century, and from the late 17th century was known as \\"Wostitz\\". During the Hussite Wars, the castle in the village was conquered and occupied by Taborites. Around 1428, Catholic troops regained the castle. In 1538, the town was granted a market by Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. A parish existed since 1276. Around the year 1560, Protestantism got a hold in Vlasatice. In the year 1567 a farmstead was founded by of Bretheren Hutterites. The Hutterites were eventually driven away in 1617 by Count von Thurn. Most of the Hutterites moved to Siebenb√ºrgen, also known as Transsylvania. During 1618, all possessions were taken away from Count Thurn Thirty Year War and given to Cardinal Dietrichstein. Since 1622 the region was re-catholicized. During the Thirty Year War, the village was devastated by troops of the Holy Roman Emperor. Parish registers are known since 1631.

In the years 1831 and 1866 an outbreak of cholera killed 180 (73) people. As a result of the First World War the historical Austrian countries of Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia were ceded to the newly formed state of Czechoslovakia. The Second World War ended on May 8, 1945. All territories, commonly known as the Sudetenland given to Germany in 1939 as a result of the Munich agreement were returned to the State of Czechoslovakia. During the war 154 inhabitants lost their lives. In 1946 the majority of the villagers were driven away to Germany during the Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia as a result of the Bene≈° decrees. 160 ethnical Germans from Vlasatice/Wostitz, who fled to Austria at the end of the war, were granted citizenship there. Nine individuals emigrated to Canada, five to the USA, three to Australia und Switzerland, two to Sweden and one each to Argentina, France, Italy und England. Only a few of the original villagers remained in Vlasatice, mostly due to their bi-ethnic Czech and German background. Starting in 1946 Vlasatice was repopulated with ethnic Czechs by the new government.

Carpenter (1815 ‚Äì November 15, 1866) was an American law enforcement officer and police inspector of the New York Police Department. He was one of earliest leading detectives on the police force during the mid-19th century and also had a prominent role in the Police Riot of 1857 and New York Draft Riots in 1863. His successful defeat of the rioters was the largest, and perhaps most crucial, battle during the riot. Fought in front of the Metropolitan Police headquarters, Carpenter's victory saved the New York financial district from falling into the hands of the rioters. Biography Early life and police career Born in Albany, New York in 1815, Daniel Carpenter moved to New York City as a young man and where he was engaged in jewelry manufacturing until joining the Municipal police force around 1847. Then under command of George Washington Matsell, Carpenter was appointed captain of the Fifth Ward. One of the most important posts in the city, the area was populated by many members of New York's prominent citizens. Carpenter was described as \\"patient, cool and inflexible\\" and his administration over the Fifth Ward was largely successful in keeping order and quiet. Throughout his career, he was described as \\"a noble, manly, unselfish gentleman - a man in all the corruption of a Great city, so far beyond suspicion that the most vindictive tongue could not breathe against him\\".\\"Obituary.; Sudden Death of Inspector Daniel Carpenter of the Metropolitan Police\\". The New York Times. 16 Nov 1866 Police & Draft Riots Upon the formation of the Metropolitan Police Department in 1857, Carpenter was one of the majority of officers who joined the new police force. During the Police Riot of 1857, Carpenter was reportedly able to enter City Hall and officially serve the arrest warrant to Mayor Fernando Wood and escort him to Metropolitan Police Headquarters. Becoming very knowledgeable of the New York underworld, he was eventually appointed a police inspector shortly after the police riot. During the New York Draft Riots, Carpenter was one of the most active officers who fought against the rioters. After Superintendent John Kennedy was attacked by a mob and hospitalized, overall command of the police force fell to Commissioner Thomas Coxon Acton and John G. Bergen while Carpenter took command of police squads on the streets. His most memorable action during the riot was the defense of the New York financial district and the U.S. sub-treasury. With drillmaster Sergeant Theron S. Copeland, he assembled what remained of the police force, which was then about 125 men, and in a brief speech to the officers said \\"We are going to put down a mob, and we will take no prisoners\\". Carpenter and Copeland then led the small squad through Mulberry and Bleecker Streets until meeting the thousands of rioters marching down Broadway. Although both sides were armed with clubs, the male and female rioters also possessed crowbars, swords and pistols. The mob, which numbered as much as 10,000 rioters, reportedly filled up the street from corner to corner and with the head of the mob carrying an American flag and a large sign with \\"No Draft\\" written on it.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 126-127, 129) He deployed his men in four lines of skirmishers across Broadway, and marching northward, made contact with rioters at Amity Street just south of La Farge House where rioters were attacking negro servants. Carpenter led the first assault, supported by Patrolman Doyle and Thompson, and supposedly killed the first thug which challenged him with a bludgeon. Patrolman Thompson seized the American flag while Doyle killed the rioter holding the \\"No Draft\\" sign. The front rank of the mob had been halted for a moment but soon responded by throwing brickbats and paving stones. Several officers were seriously wounded in the assault, but the rest of the squad closed ranks and continued their march clubbing rioters with each step. The mob gradually began to give way and, after 15 minutes of heavy fighting, the rioters broke and scattered in all direction with officers following them into sidestreets while the dead and wounded lay on the streets and sidewalks. This was the farthest the rioters would advance, the remaining mobs being confined to central Manhattan. He and Inspector John S. Folk also faced the rioters who had fled from the New York Tribune after being driven away by Captain Warlow and Captain Thorne. Sweeping City Hall Park of the remaining rioters, Folk returned to Brooklyn while Carpenter left behind 50 men to guard the New York Tribune offices while he and the rest of the squad went on to other threatened parts of the city. He was later joined by Captain John J. Jourdan who made a tour of the notorious Fourth Ward and the waterfront district.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 131-132) On the second day of the riot, at about 6:00 am, Carpenter left Metropolitan headquarters with a squad of 200 officers and marched uptown where rioters had appeared on Second Avenue and were threatening the Union Steam Works. Moving the detachment into Second Avenue a block below the Union Steam Works, Carpenter once again deployed his men into lines of skirmishers with two lines of men marching slowly northward. The rioters, who had grown even more confrontational towards the police, were now armed with muskets, pistols and swords while others invaded nearby homes and buildings to throw bricks and stones from the rooftops. The police met little resistance at first ut were then met at Thirty-Second Street by a shower of brink and stone into the squad injuring many police officers. The mob had been slowly closing in from behind, surprised the police by attacking from the front and rear, but Carpenter and his men fought so fiercely that they managed to clear the street after 15 minutes of fighting. With the frightened mob huddled in small groups a hundred feet from the police, Carpenter ordered 50 of his men into the surrounding buildings to chase out the rooftop rioters. Many of the rioters fell from the roofs and were killed while others who managed to escape into the street were caught by Carpenter and his men. It was during this engagement that a nearby saloon was taken over by rioters armed with muskets and pistols, but Carpenter's men were able to force them out without any casualties.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 137-139, 147) When Carpenter saw Colonel H.J. O'Brien and 150 infantrymen, sent by Major General C.W. Sandford, he launched a second assault against the rioters. In spite of heavy fire from rioters, both from muskets and debris thrown from the rooftops, Carpenter and O'Brien were able to defeat the rioters with the help of artillery fire under Lieutenant Eagleson. After the rioters had been dispersed, Carpenter continued on to the tour the eastern part of the city and where he attacked several smaller mobs still remaining in the streets. Later that night, he and his squad arrived to clear out the Brooks Brothers clothing store after several officers had been shot and killed by rioters looting the store. Death On the afternoon of November 15, 1866, Carpenter was at Metropolitan police headquarters on Mulberry Street where he oversaw police preparations for the grand banquet held at the Metropolitan Hotel in honor of Cyrus W. Field. At around 2:00 pm, Carpenter left the station for his home on West Thirty-Fourth Street. He returned to headquarters after having dinner with his family however, met by Captain Lord of the Sanitary Police at the corner of Crosby and Bleecker Streets, the captain \\"observed a strange manner in him\\" and took Carpenter to his home on Twentieth Street. Carpenter rested on a sofa in the parlor while Lord had dinner. When Lord returned after eating his meal, Carpenter had become gravely ill. Both a physician and his wife were called for but Carpenter died before either arrived. He was succeeded by George Washington Walling, who eventually became police chief of the NYPD.Walling, George W.

Speight (May 16, 1816 ‚Äì March 20, 1877) was an American law enforcement officer and police inspector for the New York City Police Department. A noted crimefighter, credited for running out the criminal elements from Manhattan's Eighteenth and Nineteenth Wards in the 1850s, he also took part in the Police Riot of 1857 and New York Draft Riots of 1863. Prior to the outbreak of violence at the Third Avenue draft office, Speight was the only officer to maintain control of his station, the Broadway draft office, during the early hours of the riots.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 117) Biography Early life and career Francis C. Speight was born in Ithaca, New York on May 16, 1816. He first arrived in New York City in 1830 where he was apprenticed as a ship-smith until he was 21 years old. A strong supporter of the Whig Party, he became involved in local politics as a young man and held considerable influence in the Eleventh Ward as a political organizer for the party. This was most evident during the 1840 U.S. presidential election which resulted in the successful election of William Henry Harrison.\\"Death Of Inspector Speight. The End Of A Busy Life ‚Äì Over Thirty Years In The Public Service ‚Äì An Active And Efficient Officer Action Of The Police Board\\". _New York Times._ 21 Mar 1877 In 1845, Speight was appointed to the police force by Alderman Jance D. Oliver and assigned to the Fifteenth Ward. His success against the criminal elements in the area soon earned him promotion to second lieutenant, a position being the modern equivalent to police sergeant. Speight's term of office expired in 1849. With the Whigs not then in power, he was not reappointed and briefly retired to private life. Shortly thereafter, Speight was appointed Inspector of Customs by then Collector of the Port Hugh Maxwell. He held that position until 1853 and returned to the Municipal police the following year by appointment from the Board of Police Commissioners, then including Mayor Westervelt, City Judge Buebe and Recorder Tillon. On June 3, 1854, Speight received his commission as police captain and was made commander of the recently created Twenty-First Ward, formerly comprising the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Wards. Police captain of the 21st Precinct In the area where the Twenty-First Precinct was located, a particularly violent group of \\"rowdies\\" were active and where they based their criminal activities for nearly a decade. Reinforced by Fire Department roughs, these criminals had been a constant source of trouble to the local police. Speight decided to take on the criminal gang and headed police squads sent out at every disturbance caused by them. On one of these occasions, Speight was seriously injured after being struck on the forehead with a blunt object and confined to his bed for several weeks. The scars he received from the injury would remain for the rest of his life. Using aggressive and heavy-handed tactics, Speight directly confronted the street gang and was able to successfully drive them out of the district. Police Riot of 1857 and the New York Draft Riot of 1863 Speight remained in command of the Twenty-First Ward until the formation of the Municipal Police Department in 1857 and turned his office to the new organization. He was among the first senior police officials to join the Metropolitans, Inspector Daniel C. Carpenter and George W. Dilks among others, and he was returned to his former post. Many of these had been former Whigs who now aligned themselves with the New York Republican Party. He also took part in the Police Riot of 1857 assisting in the arrest of Mayor Fernando Wood. During the early hours of the New York Draft Riot of 1863, upon news of crowds gathering at the Third Avenue draft office and in Central Park, Police Superintendent John Alexander Kennedy dispatched sixty-nine patrolmen under the command of Speight and Sergeants Wade, Wolfe, John Mangin and Robert McCredie to guard the Broadway draft office. No trouble occurred there under Speight's watch and drafting went ahead as scheduled and uninterrupted until noon when it was adjourned for twenty-four hours. The same force under Captain Galen T. Porter had been overwhelmed by the mob and forced to flee from the building after a brief siege when it was set on fire with assistance from members of the Volunteer Engine Company, No. 33 (\\"The Black Joke\\"). Speight would be on constant duty throughout the riots. Later years and death On March 20, 1877, Speight died from pneumonia at his home on Eighty-Third Street. Although it was known that Speight had been ill, his sudden death was unexpected and came as a great shock to the police force. His funeral was held days later at the Church of the Transfiguration, popularly known at the time as \\"The Little Church Round the Corner\\", and was attended by members of the Board of Police Commissioners Williams F. Smith, Joel B. Erhardt, Dewitt C. Wheeler and Sidney P. Nichols, ex-Police Commissioners Barr and Voorhis, former Police Superintendent George Washington Matsell, Chief Police Clerk Seth C.

He is credited for breaking up the Daybreak Boys, a gang of river pirates active along the New York waterfront during the 1850s, by closing their dive bar headquarters in Slaughter House Point. He is also one of the commanding officers during the Draft Riots of 1863, in charge of the City Hall Police, and helped defend the New York Tribune. Biography Early and police career Born near Newburgh in Orange County, New York in June 1823, his father was a well-to-do farmer and his mother was a member of the prominent Woolsey family. He moved to New York City as a young man and worked as a house and ship carpenter. For a time, he was the assistant stage carpenter at the old Bowery Theater, now the Thalia Theater, and was involved in the construction of early steamboats on the Hudson River.\\"Inspector Thorne Dead; Stricken With Apoplexy In The Streets\\". _New York Times._ Mar 21, 1885 He first lived in the Thirteenth Ward and became active in Whig politics. In 1851, he was appointed a watchman for the revenue service and subsequently became a Custom House Inspector. On July 25, 1853, Thorne became an officer in the Municipal police force and was assigned to the Thirteenth Ward under the command of Captain Thomas S. Steers, father of Captain Henry V. Steers of the City Hall Police. That same year, he was elected by the rank-and-file officers to represent them when speaking to the Board of Commissioners over concerns over \\"an expensive and fantasical uniform\\". Although he himself was an early critic, he agreed to wear the new design and later became a strong supporter of the new uniforms.Lardner, James and Thomas Reppetto. NYPD: A City and Its Police. New York: Henry Holt & Co., 2000. (pg. 31-32, 35, 45, 57) When the Metropolitan Police Department was formed in 1817, Thorne was among the majority of the old Municipals under then Mayor Fernando Wood who left to join the new police force. He officially joined the Metropolitan police on April 23, 1857 as a patrolman and, within a month, he had won promotion to sergeant. He eventually left the Thirteenth Ward and was stationed in Seventh, Eleventh and Thirteenth Precincts. He became a police captain on September 16, 1861, and was posted to the Fourth Precinct. The precinct was notorious for its corruption and was referred to as \\"a resort of thieves and desperados of the worst kind\\". It was around this time that Thorne closed the headquarters of the Daybreak Boys, a dive bar located in Slaughter House Point, which contributed to the eventual break up of the river pirates and went a long way in cleaning up the New York waterfront.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 63, 130-131) Walling, George W. Recollections of a New York Chief of Police: An Official Record of Thirty-eight Years as Patrolman, Detective, Captain, Inspector and Chief of the New York Police. New York: Caxton Book Concern, 1887. New York Draft Riots Within a year, Thorne had cleaned the precinct and was reassigned to the Twenty-Sixth Precinct, located in the basement of New York City Hall. He was still in command of the precinct at the time of the New York Draft Riots in 1863, and had five officers dress in civilian clothes to move freely among the rioters and inform of their plans. On the first night of the riot, he set out from City Hall to relieve the besieged defenders of the New York Tribune. He was met at Printing House Square by Captain Jacob B. Warlow and his squad, returning from a tour of the New York waterfront, and decided to combine forces. With around 100 patrolmen, he and Captain Warlow led their squad against the mob attacking the offices of the New York Tribune. They attacked from the rear, quickly clearing the building of rioters and putting out small fires which had been set, and the mob fled in disorder up Park Row and into City Hall Park where they were met by another police squad under Police Inspectors Daniel C. Carpenter and John S. Folk. Later career In late 1866, Thorne returned to the Fourth Precinct to take over command from Captain Bryan, who had resigned his post, before returning to City Hall on July 2, 1869. Following the removal of Police Inspector William Jameson from office, on April 20, 1872, Thorne was appointed as his replacement. He held this position until May 31 when he resigned to head the Street Cleaning Bureau. Then under the jurisdiction of the NYPD, the laws were changed a year later to allow a police officer to oversee the bureau and, on February 14, 1873, Thorne was reinstated on the NYPD being promoted from patrolman to sergeant and then captain all in one day. This was considered at the time to be the most rapid rise in rank in the history on the police force. Thorne remained in charge of the Street Cleaning Bureau and, following his promotion to police inspector, he was assigned to the Third District after the reorganization of the inspection districts in 1875. The area then comprised the eastern half of the city above Forty-Second Street. It was while in command of the district that headed the investigation into the murder of Abraham Weisberger, a Jewish peddler, whose body had been found in Lydig's Woods. Three African-Americans, William Thomas, William Watson and Charles Ellis, were convicted of the murder and hanged at The Tombs on December 17, 1875. The Board of Commissioners credited Thorne for his conduct of the high-profile case. In riots during the summer of 1877, he commanded a 400-man reserve police force, both patrolman and mounted police, in support of Police Inspector William Murray and Captain Thomas F. Byrnes. He was subsequently transferred to the First Inspection District and remained there until his replacement by Inspector William Murray. Returning to the Third District, on the appointment of Inspector Byrnes, the Third and Fourth Districts were consolidated and placed under the command of Inspector George W. Dilks. Thorne was then put in charge of the Third District, which comprised the west side of the city below Forty-Second Street, and remained there for the rest of his career. It was while commander of the precinct that he became concerned over accusations of illegal gambling in the Twenty-Second Precinct and, although these charges were primarily directed towards then Captain Alexander S. Williams, it was Williams acquittal of these charges that indirectly vindicated him. Thorne had married twice, having a son and daughter from the first marriage, before marrying a wealthy young widow in 1873. His brother-in-law from the latter marriage was old time yachtman Commodore Charles Cheesebrough. Although there was no issue by this second marriage, the two lived together for the next 12 years. In 1884, he and Captain Alexander \\"Clubber\\" Williams attended a boxing match between John L. Sullivan and Greenfield at Madison Square Garden. Under orders from Mayor Edson, Walling closed the fight and had Thorne and Williams arrest both men. On January 19, 1885, Thorne was again involved in controversy when he was assigned as the police supervisor in a boxing match between John L. Sullivan and Paddy Ryan at Madison Square Garden. He had been ordered by New York Mayor William R. Grace to stop the match \\"at the slightest hint of violence\\", 30 seconds into the first round, he \\"stamped into the ring, seized Ryan by the feet and ended the match\\".Isenberg, Michael T. John L. Sullivan and His America. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1994. (pg. 7, 177, 181, 183) Caldwell, Mark. New York Night: The Mystique and Its History. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2005. (pg. 191) Death On the afternoon of March 19, 1885, Thorne left his precinct to attend a meeting with the Superintendent George W. Walling and other Inspectors. He remained on duty at police headquarters until 7:15 am when he left the building to return to his office on East Twenty-Ninth Street. On his way uptown, he stopped by the Mercer police station to visit Captain John J. Brogan. After having breakfast, Thorne finally arrived at his office and received the reports of the Captains of the Second Inspection District. He then started out for the Twenty-Ninth Street station house but fell seriously ill at the corner of Broadway and Twenty-Ninth Street. He walked into the nearby Lindo Brothers jewelry store where he told one of the owners, David Lindo, that he felt sick. He asked for some brandy and, when it failed to revive him, a Dr. Hunt was called from West Twenty-Ninth Street. Thorne, at his suggestion, was brought to a back room while a messenger brought back a sergeant and detective from the West Thirteenth police station. He asked that his wife be sent for, however he died before her arrival 20 minutes after he had entered the store. His body was removed to his home on West Fourteenth Street. His funeral was organized by Captain Williams on his family's behalf and held in the front parlor of his home three days later. When the funeral procession began, around 1,100 policemen had formed in line stretching from Eight to Sixth Avenue. Three police battalions under Captains Theron S. Copeland, Anthony J. Allaire and George Washburn escorted his body to the Calvary Baptist Church for the funeral. Superintendent Walling, Inspectors Thomas F. Byrnes, George W. Dilks and William Murray, and Captains William H. Clinchy, Joseph B. Eakins, Thomas Killilea and John J. Mount walked alongside the hearse as pallbearers. The funeral procession included 16 carriages carrying Thorne's family and friends as well as a delegation from the Mecca Temple of the Mystic Shrine led by Potentate Walter M. Flemming. The Temple, together with the Palestine Commandery of the Knights Templar and the Eureka Lodge, later received his body for burial at Woodlawn Cemetery.\\"Inspector Thorne Buried; The Last Honors Paid By His Comrades\\". _New York Times._ Mar 24, 1885 References Further reading *Barnes, David M.

He was a board member of the Scottish Legal Aid Board, and a former vice chairman of the Faculty of Advocates Criminal Bar Association. He died suddenly on a trip to Pakistan. Education McBride, an only child from a working-class family, attended the private Catholic school St Aloysius' College, Glasgow and thereafter studied law at the University of Strathclyde from the age of 16. He graduated with an LLB aged 19, and joined a solicitors firm in Ayrshire. After completing his two-year traineeship with the firm he devilled with a practising advocate for nine months, and was admitted advocate in 1988. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 2000 aged 36, one of the youngest ever in the UK. Legal career McBride was very well known for his intelligence, his skilful advancement of the merits of Scottish Law as well as his courage. He often represented high- profile clients in controversial criminal cases. He led the legal teams which won the acquittal of human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar of contempt of court in July 2008, and Gail Sheridan of perjury in HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan. When he was appointed to the latter case the Daily Record called it a \\"legal dream team\\". In 2009, McBride defended Rangers and Scotland goalkeeper Allan McGregor on sex attack claims which never reached court. Later, McBride represented Celtic F.C. on a number of legal and disciplinary matters. He issued statements to the press about incidents that involved Celtic and defended Celtic's staff in court including touchline bans for their manager, drink driving charges, charges of child neglect and speaking out about football officials. In April 2011, McBride branded the SFA \\"the laughing stock of world football\\", and \\"not merely dysfunctional and dishonest, but biased\\". This statement came after an SFA disciplinary hearing involving three members of Rangers staff. McBride later apologised for the remarks after the SFA threatened legal action and made a formal complaint to the Faculty of Advocates. Personal life McBride was a fan of football club Celtic and was considered to be one of the club's \\"highest profile supporters\\". McBride was gay and had been in a civil partnership with his partner Gary Murphy since 2007. Politics In April 2009 McBride made a high-profile defection from the Scottish Labour Party to the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. On 6 November 2011, McBride resigned from the Scottish Conservative Party hours after the election of leader Ruth Davidson, describing the party as \\"divided and dysfunctional\\" and \\"a bunch of unreconstructed morons\\". Bomb threat In April 2011, McBride, Neil Lennon and Trish Godman, public figures all connected with Celtic, were sent parcel bombs. The device sent to McBride was intercepted by Royal Mail at a depot in Kilwinning. This resulted in the trial of two men, HM Advocate v Muirhead and McKenzie, in which McBride was due to appear as a witness, but died before he was called. Trevor Muirhead, 44, and Neil McKenzie, 42 were later jailed for five years, having been found guilty of sending devices in the post to McBride, Celtic manager Neil Lennon, and Trish Godman. Death On 4 March 2012 McBride died in his sleep while in Pakistan. He was visiting Pakistan on business with fellow lawyer Aamer Anwar. His body was discovered in a hotel room in the city Lahore by Anwar, who said later that McBride had been unwell during the trip. A post-mortem examination carried out on McBride has found that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. The post-mortem was carried out at the Mayo Hospital in Lahore, Pakistan. His Requiem Mass was held in St Aloysius's Church, Garnethill, Glasgow, and many prominent figures in Scottish public life attended, including First Minister Alex Salmond, and Neil Lennon, then manager of Celtic FC, who was a pall bearer. He was buried in St Conval's, Barrhead.

Biography Although his birth was officially recorded as having happened on October 24, he was actually born on the 23. His father had him registered one day later because, for a child born on Sunday, he would not get a day off work. Already at a young age, his talent for drawing became apparent. He attended the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, Netherlands for 3 years and was active, among other things, as an advertisement painter and designer of posters. Later he also designed decors for theatre and cabaret, regularly for Lou Bandy, Wim Kan and theatre Carr√© in Amsterdam. During World War II, Manders had to work in Germany but after half a year, he fled from his job as a painter. Because of Wim Kan, Manders got the idea to start doing cabaret himself, like his older brother Kees. Starting in 1953, Manders was involved with the design of Carel Kamlag's cafe Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s at the Rembrandtplein in Amsterdam. Manders performed there himself as a vagabond, a role that would later become famous as Dorus. When VARA offered him an opportunity to perform on television, he had the cafe copied in the studio and started a successful show that would be broadcast for several years. Clowning as a waterskier on the Amstel, in 1955 Between 1956 and 1962, Manders worked together with organist Cor Steyn for the program De Showboat. Together they created tracks like Twee motten (two moths), Als ik wist dat je zou komen (had I known you would come by) en Bij de marine (in the navy). Manders got into financial trouble when he tried to produce Dorus movies. In 1967, he won the Zilveren Roos prize and started a new program, Bij Dorus op schoot (on Dorus' lap). In a particularly famous scene from November 18, a young girl tries to sing the famous Dutch children song Poessie Mauw, of which she endlessly repeated only the title. Also in 1967, the former chemical products business on the Mauritsstraat 65 in Rotterdam was converted to Cabaret Dorus. This only lasted until 1970 and with the closing of Cabaret Dorus, the show Bij Dorus op schoot also ended. Since 1985, there is a block of houses in the same location named the Tom Mandershof. In 1971, Dorus made one more television appearance, in which he scared visitors of Madame Tussauds by pretending to be a wax statue. In the same year, he had another musical hit with In de hemel is geen bier (there is no beer in heaven). In February 1972, Manders had a car accident. In the hospital, he was diagnosed with cancer. Three weeks later he died because of a heart attack.  Musical  In 2009/2010 Albert Verlinde produced a musical about the life of Tom Manders with the title Dorus, the musical. and , better known as , played the main roles. The show was written by Lars Boom and Dick van den Heuvel and directed by Peter de Baan.

Twinning is one of the principal tools of Institution Building accession assistance. Twinning aims to help beneficiary countries in the development of modern and efficient administrations, with the structures, human resources and management skills needed to implement the acquis communautaire to the same standards as Member States. Twinning provides the framework for administrations and semi-public organisations in the beneficiary countries to work with their counterparts in Member States. Together they develop and implement a project that targets the transposition, enforcement and implementation of a specific part of the acquis communautaire. The main distinct feature of the Twinning project is direct exchange of specific national experience in EU legislation implementation. Not similar to other technical assistance, a Twinning project is that it sets out to deliver specific and guaranteed results and not to foster general cooperation. The parties agree in advance on a detailed work programme to meet an objective concerning priority areas of the acquis. The key input from administrations of EU Member States to effect longer-term change is in the core team of long-term seconded EU experts, practitioners in the implementation of the acquis, to administrations of new Member States, acceding, candidate or potential candidate country. The proposed experts should be seconded from public institutions in the Member State and not be private consultants. Once a Call for Proposals is launched, Member States create and submit their project proposals, sometimes forming consortiums with other Member States (Lead and Junior Partners). The target country then selects some of these Member States and invites them to present their proposal in person. The potential Resident Twinning Adviser (RTA) and Project Leader (PL) are expected to attend this presentation. Based on the presentation and the proposal, the country with the best bid is selected. Each country has an appointed \\"National Contact Point\\" to coordinate its activities in Twinning. Each Twinning project has at least one Resident Twinning Adviser (RTA) and a Project Leader. The RTA is seconded from a Member State public administration or from another mandated body in a Member State to work full time for a minimum of 12 months in the corresponding ministry in partner country to implement the project. The Project Leader is responsible for the overall thrust and coordination of the project. They are supplemented by carefully planned and timed missions of other specialists, training events, awareness raising visits, etc. to accompany the reform process towards the targeted results. The Twinning project cycle is more demanding in terms of preparation and a specific competitive selection procedure is used for selection and evaluation of the potential MS partners. Policy Advice (incl. law drafting, advice on organisational issues, awareness raising, etc.), training, study tours and internships are among the activities eligible for Twinning projects. These activities, together with eligible costs for the Twinning project implementation and all relevant procedures are described in the Twinning Reference Manual. Twinning may be implemented as classic Twinning (up to 24 months) and light Twinning (up to 6 months), with budget up to 2 mln euros. Mutual benefits of Twinning for counterparts: 1\\\\. Exchange of experiences and knowledge based on equal-level communication between twinning partners (civil servant to civil servant); 2\\\\. Implementation of best practices of EU member State public administration; 3\\\\. Complementarity in the case of a consortium; 4\\\\. Alignment with current European legislation; 5\\\\. Knowledge of political administrative systems; 6\\\\. Long-term and structural working-relationships, professional networking, and, therefore, influencing attitude towards a beneficiary country in the EU; 7\\\\. Training and improving professional capacity; 8\\\\. Development and implementation of adapted legislation which is necessary for fulfilment of the obligations on joint Agreements and Action Plans, and for integrating into the European markets; 9\\\\. Changes in organisational practices and culture, improvements in managerial styles, better communication and co-ordination between and within Beneficiary Administrations are valuable bi-products of the process of MS civil servants working closely alongside BA counterparts.

The painting depicts three boys set among the buildings in an empty town; two playing cricket and the other watching them. The National Gallery of Australia describes the painting as \\"one of the most original and haunting images in all Australian art.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald said the work is \\"possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century.\\" History The painting was commissioned by Walter Hutchinson, an English publisher, for his own collection, known as the \\"National Collection of British Sports and Pastimes\\". Looking for a picture of an Australian cricket match, Hutchinson asked his Melbourne office to commission a well-known Australian artist for this purpose. Leonard Voss Smith, an art dealer who often worked for Hutchinson, spoke to Drysdale who was then painting in the town of Hill End in the Central West region of New South Wales. Drysdale accepted the commission, worth ¬£150. When complete, Voss Smith sent Drysdale's work through to Hutchinson in England. Hutchinson was shocked, the painting was nothing like what he had expected. Immediately Hutchinson sent a telegram back to Melbourne, firing Smith. The next day Hutchinson reconsidered and rehired Voss Smith, after satisfying himself that Drysdale was a respected artist in Australia. The painting, valued in 2004 at A$6,000,000, is now owned by JGL Investments, a Melbourne-based investment company. It was last on public exhibition in 1998. Composition and legacy The painting was a departure from earlier artistic visions of Australia with a Sydney Morning Herald review noting \\"Drysdale‚Äôs large composition of 'cricketers' under leaden skies in the wide open spaces of burning sands dramatises the 'outback' as it has never been dramatised before.\\" The National Gallery of Australia claim that the work \\"succeeds as art by abandoning any pretence to illustrative realism.\\" The model for the batsman was Teddy Woolard and Roy Holloway was the model for the bowler. In 1996, after the models were identified, Woolard was asked for his opinion of Drysdale's portrayal; \\"I just don't rate it ... It makes us all look out of proportion.\\" The town of Hill End itself is not as desolate as shown in the painting, with a later visitor to Hill End remarking \\"Even the scattered buildings--so blank and menacing in The Cricketers--appear as if ripped from the cover of a chocolate box.\\" References Category:Paintings by Russell Drysdale Category:1948 paintings Category:Sports paintings Category:Cricket paintings Category:Hill End, New South Wales ","title":"The cricketers"},{"id":"24117374","text":"S.

Oinas, Heroic epic and saga: an introduction to the world's great folk epics, Indiana University Press, 1978, , 123f.  Periodisation  The period corresponds to the Germanic Wars in terms of historiography, and to the Germanic Iron Age in terms of archaeology, spanning the early centuries of the 1st millennium, in particular the 4th and 5th centuries, the period of the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the establishment of stable \\"barbarian kingdoms\\" larger than at the tribal level (the kingdoms of the Visigoths and Ostrogoths, the Franks and the Burgundians, and the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain). The Germanic peoples at the time lived mostly in tribal societies. William Paton Ker in Epic and Romance (1897) takes the \\"heroic age\\" as predating the \\"age of chivalry\\" with its new literary genre of Romance. Ker would thus extend the Germanic heroic age to the point of Christianization, to the inclusion of the Scandinavian Viking Age and culminating in the Icelandic family sagas of the 13th century.Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde vol. 16, p. 453 Indeed, Christianization resulted in the loss of the tradition of heroic poetry, although there are examples of heroic poems that postdate Christianization by several centuries, such as The Battle of Maldon, composed three centuries after the Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons, or the Hildebrandslied, written at Fulda 300 years after the Christianization of the Franks. The Prose Edda itself originated as a handbook for skaldic poets, compiled by Snorri Sturluson more than 200 years after the Christianisation of Iceland, because poetic tradition at that time was threatened by extinction. Historicity Germanic mythology combines purely mythological material with historical events of this period. Identifiable historical characters appearing in Germanic heroic poetry, notably in the V√∂lsung and Tyrfing cycles, include: * Gundaharius, king of the Burgundians, as Gunnar/Gunther * Theodoric the Great (454‚Äì526) in the √ûi√∞rekssaga as well as in Middle High German legends about Dietrich von Bern * Attila the Hun (406‚Äì453) in the Atlakvi√∞a * the Roman Emperors as Kj√°rr A number of tribal kings of the 5th to 6th centuries reflected in heroic poetry are likely historical, but only rarely can this be established from independent historiographic tradition, as in the case of Hygelac, king of the Geats who appears both in the heroic poem Beowulf and in historiographic sources such as the Liber Historiae Francorum.

Racing career Early career His racing career began in an Irish Point-to-Point at Kilossera on 24 January 1993 where he finished 6th out of 14. After a further four races he was sold to Dido Harding to run in point-to-points in England. Cool Dawn started his English career with a win in a maiden at Badbury Rings. He subsequently had a second, first, and a ran out. Two further point-to-point wins (including a Ladies Open) preceded his debut on a professional racecourse during the 1994/95 season in a novice Hunter Chases when he came second at Folkestone. After a further point-to-point win he won his first Hunter Chase at Ascot (6/5f), but followed that win with an unseated with the race at his mercy at Warwick (2/11f). His performances during this season clearly established him as a top class point-to-pointer and hunter chaser. His target during the 1995/96 season was the Foxhunter at Cheltenham. He was moved to Robert Alner's professional yard for his Hunter Chase campaign. After a good win at Kempton (7/2), beating the useful Teaplanter, he ran well in the Foxhunter (7/2) coming second to the Enda Bolger ridden favourite, Elegant Lord. He then returned to Ireland and, ridden by Conor O‚ÄôDwyer, came third in the Irish Grand National behind Feathered Gale. In the 1996/97 season it was decided to go for a professional campaign. However, he only had one outing, finishing fourth of five in a handicap at Sandown, before his season was curtailed by injury. 1997/98 season This season was Cool Dawn's annus mirabilis. After an undistinguished reappearance at Wincanton in the Badger Beer Handicap Chase, his owner-rider handed over the reins to a professional jockey, Andrew Thornton, who rode him for the rest of the season. His next three outings, all at Ascot, all resulted in wins, the Gardner Merchant Handicap Chase by 6l (from 4 lb out of the handicap)(4/1), the Betterware Cup by 9l (carrying 10-5)(5/2f), and the Ok Soil Remediation Ltd Handicap Chase by 2l (carrying 12-0)(10-11f). His final outing before the Gold Cup, at Sandown in the Agfa Diamond Chase, was rather an anti-climax as he was pulled up before 3 out. However, ignoring that run, in which it turned out that he had pulled some muscles in his back, he went to Cheltenham with a good outsider‚Äôs chance of a place at least. Cool Dawn returned to Cheltenham to the same course and distance as his second in the Foxhunter two years earlier and put up the best performance of his career. There was early drama at the seventh fence when Cyborgo was pulled up lame and carried out See More Business, the 1997 King George winner, and Indian Tracker. However, Cool Dawn (a 25/1 outsider) was never troubled by this as he led from start to finish being briefly challenged by Strong Promise at the final fence before storming up the hill to win by 1¬æl from Strong Promise with the favourite Dorans Pride a further head behind. As the weights for the Whitbread Gold Cup at Sandown had already been published by the time of his Gold Cup win, he was well in at the weights and it seemed too good a chance to miss. However, after being sent off the 5/1f and leading for the first couple of miles, it was case of going to the well once too often and he was pulled up 2 out when well behind. 1998/99 season In his first outing of the season at Wincanton he was pulled up. However, before the race he had reared over in the paddock falling over onto his jockey, this time his owner-rider, and was probably feeling the effects of this. It is probable that he actually injured himself slightly more seriously than thought as Cool Dawn never fully recovered his form. His final two races were at the two tracks where he had shown his best form. At Ascot he finished third of four and in his final start at Cheltenham he was pulled up. Post race career Following his retirement from racing, Cool Dawn continued to hunt regularly with the Weston and Banwell Harriers, and also paraded at a large number of events as a former Gold Cup winner. After spending retirement hunting and grazing in Winscombe at Dido Harding‚Äôs family home Cool Dawn was euthanised on 25 March 2018.

It was established in 1886 and has been in business for more than 120 years. The company has produced and distributed more than 15 million watches worldwide since 1886.  History  The West End Watch Company was created in 1886. The West End, a district of the centre of London, inspired its name to M. Arnold Charpi√© who was the Bombay representative of the Alcide Droz & Sons firm, a watch company established at Saint-Imier (Canton of Bern) in Switzerland. In 1886, MM. Amstutz and Droz, the owner of Alcide Droz & Sons firm, began the exploitation of the trademark West End Watch Company in the Indian market and developed the first waterproof pocket watch ever produced:article published in the magazine \\"The World of Horology\\" (editions : societe de presse neuchateloise SA, no 4, Dec. 2003) \\"L'Impermeable\\" (nowadays displayed at the International Watchmaking Museum of La Chaux-de-Fonds). During the First World War, a large force of British and Indian soldiers was sent from Bombay to the Persian Gulf to reach Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). They received some West End Watch Company watches. In 1917, the West End Watch Company changed its name to Soci√©t√© des Montres West End SA and was registered in Geneva. At the same time the sub-brand Sowar was also registered. In 1934, the Soci√©t√© des Montres West End SA was the first brand to introduce the Incabloc anti-shock system invented by Mr. Braunschweig.http://www.incabloc.ch In 1973, after several years of development, the company was finally sold, for lack of heirs, to its main supplier, Aubry Brothers Ltd, established in Noirmont (Jura) to keep open the Bombay West End Watch Company's office. Since 2000 the workshops and the head office of the company have been moved to Leytron, in Wallis. At the same time, the company was taken over by new shareholders and the management changed. In 2005, the West End Watch Company celebrated its 120th anniversary of uninterrupted presence in Asia with the introduction of its \\"Silk Road concept\\". This concept came from the fact that the Silk Road crossed most of the regions where the brand possessed, and still possesses, counters. Nowadays, West End Watch Company is active in Saudi Arabia, in the United Arab Emirates, in the Himalaya Range (in particular in Tibet, Nepal and in Bhutan), as well as in the western half of China. In 2011, West End Watch Company celebrated 125 years of uninterrupted activity, so a commemorative book redrawing the history of the brand was published in 2010 in association with the Centre Jurassien d‚ÄôArchives et de Recherches Economiques.CEJARE At the beginning of the 20th century West End Watch Company launched a model called the Sowar -the cavalryman- named after one of the elite troops of the Indian army. This name was selected in honour of Sir Thomas Edward Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) because it is said that he and his soldiers wore West End Watch Company watches during the war. The Sowar model is still manufactured today.

It was released on the 32 Jazz label in 1997. Reception The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek states \\"None of this material is substandard... The blues range is deep on many of these tracks, as is the entertainment value. Kirk was a performer as much as he was a musician, before and after the stroke. His lyric and harmonic sensibilities were deeply embedded in one another, and his way of crossing harmonic strategies was truly singular because it was so unorthodox... Natural Black Inventions: Root Strata is its own classic, and it deserved its own release apart from the package, but listeners will have to take what they can get. For this album alone, this package is worth the price\\".Jurek, T. [ Allmusic Review] accessed 26 August 2009. Writing for JazzTimes Bill Shoemaker noted \\"With few exceptions, the new material is engaging; heard in tandem with Kirk's daring real-time solo pieces, they flesh out a high-contrast portrait of this singular artist\\".Shoemaker, B., JazzTimes Review, April 1998. In Jazz Review Lee Prosser observed \\"The live cuts from the 60's seem the most anachronistic on this set, being that they align more closely with bebop/hardbop tradition than the majority of the later performances. Still, Rahsaan's own brand of freedom was already exhibited. Indeed, the evolution over this set is from the relative conservatism of the 60's live material to the unique live-in-the- studio recordings of 1971\\".Prosser, Lee., Jazz Review review, November 29, 2001 All About Jazz suggested \\"Overall, this box is a must for the Rahsaan fan. For the Rahsaan virgin, I'd suggest picking up We Free Kings, or the two- disc set Does Your House Have Lions first. But once you've gained an appreciation of Rahsaan, definitely, definitely pick this up. The gospel awaits all the true believers\\".AAJ Staff, All About Jazz Review, February 1, 1998 Entertainment Weekly said \\"Kirk juggled musical genres as easily as he did a huge swath of saxophones and flutes, thumbing his nose good-naturedly as he dashed all notions of refinement and constriction\\".Entertainment Weekly Review, December 19, 1997.

It is the first of the Virtual Pool franchise of computer simulations of pool games developed by Celeris.  Overview  Virtual Pool is an accurate simulation of straight pool, eight-ball, nine- ball, and rotation pool. The game is viewed in first-person 3D perspective, in contrast to most earlier pool games which featured a fixed overhead view. The game's publishers, Interplay, offered a full refund for buyers of the game who did not see an improvement in their pool abilities within 45 days of purchase and returned the CD-ROM to the company. Virtual Pool has revolutionary features that allow players to actually 'walk' around the table to check out their next shot, take a closer look, back away, look left or right and then line-up the shot like they would in a real game with a real table. This title also allows players to take an overhead view from above, something unavailable in a real pool game. Taking game tips from World Champion pool player \\"Machine Gun\\" Lou Butera is guaranteed to improve the player's game. Butera will teach players over 30 famous trick shots the player can practice on their computer screen and then implement on a real table. Gameplay A game of 9-Ball pool from Virtual Pool As with later games in the Virtual Pool series, the game is played with keyboard, and mouse, with shots being played by moving the mouse forwards, to simulate moving the . The control scheme devised for the game would be the same one that would be continued through the Virtual Pool series. The game features four different pool modes, with Eight-Ball, 9-ball, rotation and straight pool. There are also a choice of 9 different AI opponents to face off against, as well as local competitive multiplayer, or online via a modem. The player has the ability to alter the amount of pace, and angle of playing shots, as well as accurately mimic the effect of raising the of the cue to play a shot. Also featured is a licensed soundtrack, music ranging from rock to country, with regular sounds effects for striking the balls, and hitting rails. Release Pre-release versions of the 1995 PC version of Virtual Pool were leaked. The authorized production version of the game a different code named than that of the leaked copies. According to IPC the stolen version was \\"being offered for sale at some swap meets, computer fairs and small retail shops\\" and \\"contain a defective software program which will not operate properly.\\" The game was released successfully for DOS and Windows in 1995, with plans to port the game to the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Mac. The game was successfully released worldwide for PlayStation and Mac in 1997, after the release of Virtual Snooker. However, the planned Saturn release was eventually cancelled, for unknown reasons. Before cancellation, the release was scheduled for May 1997, around the time of release of the PlayStation release in Europe. Some time after the release of the sequel Virtual Pool 2, both games were re- packaged as a two-in-one CD-ROM jewel case edition (i.e., a bargain bin version without a box), called the \\"Virtual Pool 1 / Virtual Pool 2 Bundle\\" Before the release of Virtual Pool 2, the game sold over 2 million copies. Reception PC version PC Gamer US named Virtual Pool the \\"Best Sports Game\\" of 1995. The editors wrote, \\"For weeks after its release, the sounds of pool balls clacking together and dropping into the pockets was about all we heard in the PC Gamer office, and Virtual Pool is still a big hit around here.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the game a perfect score, stating \\"with its first-person perspective and true-to-life physics, Virtual Pool is one of the rare simulations that may actually improve your real game.\\" GameSpot said the interface was \\"elegant and responsive\\", and that the player can \\"almost feel the contact with the ball.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, and stated that \\"Interplay has dressed Virtual Pool up with some multimedia chrome - videos on the history and theory of the game - but it could just as easily have left it out The core of Virtual Pool, the game itself, is as close to perfect as a PC game can get.\\" Virtual Pool was named the 57th best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. Virtual Pool was also voted the Game of the year by Games magazine in 1995 The game was also awarded best simulation of 1995 from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, best Sports Game of 1995 from PC Gamer magazine and Best VR Game of 1995 from Computer Player magazine. PlayStation version The PlayStation version was not as enthusiastically received. Most critics found that the graphics, being largely identical to those of the PC version, were outdated by the time the game was released on PlayStation. The heavy slowdown was also criticized, and some critics recommended players buy the PlayStation Mouse for the game, saying that the control is unacceptably imprecise with the standard gamepad. However, critics still applauded the game's accurate physics and found the instructional videos still helpful in improving one's skills. Josh Smith of GameSpot concluded that these elements, and the wide range of possible viewpoints, are enough to make the game enjoyable. GamePros review also found the game solid overall, and appealing to players of all skill levels. A reviewer for Next Generation described it as \\"slow and ugly\\", and recommended only due to the lack of better competition. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly made similar remarks, with Kraig Kujawa summarizing, \\"Virtual Pool delivers, but it could be better.\\" IGN liked the gameplay, and concluded that \\"Aside from the bland, flat shaded graphics, Virtual Pool is an awesome pool sim.\\" Sales According to Interplay, global sales of Virtual Pool surpassed 250,000 copies by June 1998.

Short was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1920 New Year War Honours. From 1920 to 1922, Short was Political and Literary Secretary to the Earl of Dunraven. Short also invented a game called disco. This was a racquet sport similar to tennis, played on a 40 ft x 16 ft court with a 4 ft high net. Near each corner, set 6 ft in from the baseline and 3 ft from the sideline, was a 7-8 ft high post with a yellow wooden disc hanging from it. Play was similar to tennis, with one point being scored if the opposing player failed to return the ball, hit it into the net or hit it out of court. Five points were scored if a player hit one of the discs on his opponent's side with the ball. Games were played to fifteen points and five games made a set. The game was designed to be played indoors or in a small garden and sets were made by F. H.

Geographical Situation  Bohutice lies approx. 30 km North of the Austrian border. The municipality covers an area of , and has a population of 615 (as at 3 July 2006). Bohutice lies approximately north-east of Znojmo, south-west of Brno, and south-east of Prague. The village lies on the former royal and imperial railway line at the kilometre 114,1, this railway line went from Brno to Vienna East Station (Wien Ostbahnhof). Photo from the 70s with the Hill Leskoun behind  History  The first documentary mention of Bohutice (Bochtitz or Pochtitz) stems from 1253 mentioning a parish church. At the beginning of the 14th century, the village belonged to the Vy≈°ehradsk√° kapitola near Prague. In 1321, Jind≈ôich z Lip√© (Heinrich von Leipa on Kromau) procured Bohutice for 2,000 mark. From 1346 to 1356, Bohutice belonged to its feudal lord who was called Voytel of Bohutice (von Bochtitz) and to Miksik von Geiwic. In 1346, Miksik von Geiwic (Mik≈°√≠k z Kyjovic) sold Bochtitz to the land commander Stibor Pflug and to the pastor of Hosterlitz, Berchtold, for 62 marks and 12 groschen. In 1448, Racek ze Zborovic (von Zborowitz) claimed his ownership of Bochtitz. In 1491 and 1500, Georg Kussy von Mukodiel owned the estate. In 1535, the Bohemian Marshal Johann von Leipa sold his share of the fort Bochtitz to Jan Kus√Ω z Mukodƒõl (Johann Kussy von Mukodiel). Jan was followed by his son Mathias around 1542. In 1545, the Anabaptists settled in the village with his permission. In 1560, the village became possession of Stephan Kussy von Mukodiel, who in 1576 passed his estate to his son Wilhelm. Wilhelm was followed by Jan (gen. Hanuss) Kussy von Mukodiel, who on April 14, 1597 drove the Anabaptists out of their farm and estate and disowned them from the propert. However, the Anabaptists returned to their farm and estate after just one year. The evangelical church was built in 1615 and dedicated to all Angels. On August 1, 1619, the village was burned down entirely by General Dampierre's mercenaries. Hanuss' sons Stephan and Wilhelm lost Bochtitz due to participation in the uprising of 1620 after the Battle on White Hill near Prague. At the end of 1620, the Landlord of Bohutice was an imperial lieutenant named Michael von Althan. On 26 August 1621, the Preacher Of The Word (elected in 1610), Konrad Bl√∂si, died in Bochtitz. On January 5, 1622, the village was looted and the house of the Anabaptists set on fire, the Anabaptists were finally expelled. On September 25th 1627, the King Ferdinand II gave the little castle and village of Bochtitz to the Znojmo Jesuit College, which on March 10, 1673 also bought the village of Babitz with a farm, sheepfold, tavern, orchards and hop gardens for 4075 Rhein florins. The church behind the village had been neglected since 1657. The oldest register of inhabitants dates from 1641, in which 39 families are listed. In 1663, the Jesuit college had repaired the small church on the hill behind the cemetery, so that in 1664 holy masses were celebrated there. After the Order was disbanded by the imperator on July 21, 1773, the church was desecrated and the cemetery chapel was built instead. On the site of the church windmills were built, but sod and demolished in 1850 due to frequent storm damages. In 1785, the village school was founded, in 1807 it was attended by 70 children. The property was transferred to the Study Fund, and on October 15th 1789 it was let over to Johann Topolansky for annual interest of 7508 Florenos on a long- term lease. In 1803, there was a brewery and a fabric factory in Bohutice. After Topolansky's death, his widow Theresia married V√°clav Pet≈ô√≠ƒçek (Wenceslaus Petritschek), who owned the estate after her death on December 31 1804. He could make compromise with the other heirs on July 15 1805 and became the only owner of Bohutice. After his death on June 22 1825, his daughter Aloisia Petritschek inherited the village. She then married the administrator of her property Josef Seydl. From 1840-1850, coal was mined in Bochtitz. On December 3 1866, Aloisia Seydl was confirmed by the Financial Procurator as the legal possessor of Bochtitz. The marriage contract of December 14, 1869 gave Josef Seydl half of the Bochtitz estate. In 1867 the parish office was established in Bochtitz and the building of the new church began. The Assumption Church of Holy Mary was completed and consecrated in 1870. It had 4 bells, the Virgin Mary, St. Wenceslas, St. Michael and St. Joseph. The estate's owner Josef Seydl and his wife Aloisia financed the construction of the church. The railway came to Bochtitz in 1868. The school library was founded in 1876 by Josef Seydl, who dedicated 76 books. Josef Seydl died in 1878 and after his death the estate was worth 82 792 Rhein Guilder. Heinrich Seydl got 1/6 of ownership of the Bochtitz estate, 2/6 went to Karl Seydl, 1/6 became property of Rosalia Seydl, 1/6 went to Obsieger Maria and 1/6 to Henriette Mauer. The year 1889 was the year of foundation of the Volunteer Fire Brigade. A new school building was built in 1907. In 1909, Anna Seydl became the owner of 5 shares of the estate, while Rosalia Seydl kept on her own share. Thus, the two sisters were co-owners of the estate and the village. In 1910, the gymnastics club Sokol was founded. On July 8 1923, the Sokol club house was opened. On August 23 1925, another club house was opened by the gymnastics club Orli (The Eagles). On December 31 1928, the electric lighting came to the village. On June 25 1935, a new Protestant church opened. The last estate owner was Hans Seydl-Neuschl. He was adopted by the Anna Seydl who had no children of her own. He was natively from Nov√Ω P≈ôerov (Neu Prerau) near Mikulov. Hans Neuschl adopted the last name of his foster mother. During the protectorate he was the village administrator. After 1945 he was expelled from his estate as a Sudeten German. As former collaborateur of Nazi Germans, he was allowed to bring along max. 50kg of his possessions. The rest was supposed to be left behind. After 2 years of Czechoslovak Republic, the socialist dictatorship was established February 1948. With the socialism came the disappropriation of the farmers, during the 1950s. The local Agricultural Production Cooperative was founded on March 1st 1957. In 1966, the public water supply was established. The waste water system had to wait until 2018.  Sightseeings & Points Of Interest  The most important historical buildings in the village are the Bochutice Castle and the Assumption Church of Saint Mary. In the castle, there is an exhibition of wooden statues depicting the Stations of the Cross connected to last Jesus Christ's way to the Golgota hill. This exhibition, as well as the three castle cellars that are located in the courtyard, were created through the tireless efforts for the village of the former mayor Pavel ≈†tefka. Behind the village, there is a pilgrimage site that represents the grotto of Lourdes. It was created from the plans of Pastor Anton√≠n Pr√°≈°ek and was inaugurated on July 22, 1928. There are 3 Stations of the Cross on the was from the grotto to the cemetery, this Way of the Cross was also created by Pastor Pr√°≈°ek. His plan was to set up 13 Stations of the Cross, but this plan was interrupted forever by World War II and then by the socialist regime. A statue of St. Michael stands on the Mich√°lek (formerly called Steinh√ºbl) in the middle of the vineyards southwest of the center of the village. The Mich√°lek is a nature reserve. In the vicinity of the village there are baroque statues of St. John, St. Michael, St. Florian and St. Wenceslaw. One of the statues stands behind the cemetery at the former path leading to the church on the hill behind the villlage. In the middle of the cemetery, there is a chapel which served as a replacement church until 1870. It was meant to be the family crypt of the Seydl family.

Sarfus is an optical quantitative imaging technique based on the association of: *an upright or inverted optical microscope in crossed polarization configuration and *specific supporting plates ‚Äì called surfs ‚Äì on which the sample to observe is deposited. Sarfus visualization is based on the perfect control of the reflection properties of polarized light on a surface, which leads to an increase in the axial sensitivity of optical microscope by a factor of around 100 without reducing its lateral resolution. Thus this new technique increases the sensitivity of standard optical microscope to a point that it becomes possible to directly visualize thin films (down to 0.3 micrometer) and isolated nano-objects in real-time, be it in air or in water. Principles Langmuir-Blodgett layers (bilayer thickness: 5.4 nm) on silicon wafer and on surf Light polarisation after reflexion on a surf (0) and on nanoscale sample on a surf (1). A recent study on polarized light coherence leads to the development of new supports ‚Äì the surfs ‚Äì having contrast amplification properties for standard optical microscopy in cross polarizers mode. Made of optical layers on an opaque or transparent substrate, these supports do not modify the light polarization after reflection even if the numerical aperture of the incident source is important. This property is modified when a sample is present on a surf, a non-null light component is then detected after the analyzer rendering the sample visible. The performances of these supports are estimated from the measurement of the contrast (C) of the sample defines by: C = (I1-I0)/(I0+I1) where I0 and I1 represent the intensities reflected by the bare surf and by the analyzed sample on the surf, respectively. For a one nanometer-film thickness, the surfs display a contrast 200 times higher than on silicon wafer. This high contrast increase allows the visualization with standard optical microscope of films with thicknesses down to 0.3 nm, as well as nano- objects (down to 2 nm diameter) and this, without any kind of sample labelling (neither fluorescence, nor radioactive marker). An illustration of the contrast enhance is given hereafter with the observation in optical microscopy between cross polarizers of a Langmuir-Blodgett structure on a silicon wafer and on a surf. In addition to visualization, recent developments have allowed accessing to the thickness measurement of the analyzed sample. A colorimetric correspondence is carried out between a calibration standard made of nano- steps and the analyzed sample. Indeed, due to optical interference, a correlation exists between RGB (red, green, blue) parameters of the sample and its optical thickness. This leads to 3D-representation of the analyzed samples, the measurement of profile sections, roughness and other topological measurements. Experimental setup The experimental set-up is simple: the sample to be characterized is deposited by usual deposit techniques such as dip-coating, spin-coating, deposit pipette, evaporation‚Ä¶ on a surf instead of the traditional microscope slide. The support is then placed on the microscope stage. Synergy with existing equipment The sarfus technique can be integrated in existing analysis equipment (atomic force microscope (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, etc.) to add new functionalities, such as optical image, thickness measurement, kinetic study, and also for sample pre-localization to save time and consumables (AFM tips, etc.). Applications Sarfus images of nanostructures: 1. Copolymer film microstructuration (73 nm), 2. Carbon nanotube bundles, 3. Lipid vesicles in aqueous solutions, 4. Nanopatterning of gold dots (50 nm3).

It is easy-to-use and directly visualizes the sample. The analysis in real-time allows kinetic studies (real-time crystallization, dewetting, etc.). The broad choice of magnification (2.5 to 100x) allows fields of view from several mm2 to a few tens ¬µm2. Observations can be performed in controlled atmosphere and temperature.

He is the founder and president of Innovation Strategies International, a global education- innovation consulting firm. Education and early career Ravech√© was born in Brooklyn, New York. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry at Hofstra University in 1963. He then earned a PhD in physical chemistry and statistical mechanics from the University of California at San Diego, where his research was in statistical mechanics. Following his PhD work at UCSD, Ravech√© was awarded a research fellowship working with Melville S. Green at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and then accepted a research chemist position. At the NIST, he founded the thermodynamics division and conducted a federal study on supercomputing. In 1985 Ravech√© was named Dean of Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he helped restructure their Science Initiatives Program to advance science education and helped increase the program‚Äôs federal research grants to $9 million. He also attracted 27 new faculty members from institutions such as the National Academy of Sciences and Duke and Columbia Universities. Stevens Institute of Technology In 1988, Ravech√© was named president of Stevens Institute of Technology to replace Kenneth Rogers, who joined the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. His goals upon accepting the position included: increasing the number of guest lecturers to enhance students‚Äô interest in the sciences, improving the university‚Äôs national reputation, and encouraging students to participate in research projects. Ravech√© also hoped to improve the students‚Äô communication skills with humanities courses and to develop courses in polymer processing and the analysis of coastal lands and the coastal ecology. At Stevens, Ravech√© connected the university‚Äôs research programs with business and government to encourage technology development. He promoted Stevens‚Äô trademarked Technogenesis education process, in which students learn how to commercialize the university‚Äôs research and ideas. Ravech√© also emphasized the importance of a well-rounded student experience at Stevens. He expanded the Scholar-Athlete program and oversaw the renovation of student dormitories and the construction of new buildings, including the Lawrence T. Babbio, Jr. Center for Technology Management and the Rocco Technology Center.  Political prospects  A self-described pro-business moderate Republican, Ravech√© was mentioned as a possible contender in the Republican primary elections for the New Jersey governor‚Äôs race as early as 2005, and again in 2009. Also in 2009, he was asked to run for the seat of retiring New Jersey Senior Congressman, and Republican stalwart, H. James Saxton. A resident of Saxton‚Äôs 3rd Congressional District, Ravech√© respectfully declined to enter the race in order to continue in his role as president of Stevens.  Allegations by New Jersey Attorney General  On September 17, 2009, New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram announced charges against Ravech√© and the Stevens board of trustees chairman Lawrence T. Babbio, Jr. According to the state's 16-count lawsuit, Stevens' leaders allegedly kept several trustees in the dark about the school's financial condition. The lawsuit alleged that Ravech√© and Babbio misrepresented the finances of the school and caused the endowment to fall by $42 million from $157 million in 2000 to $115 million in 2009. The lawsuit also contended that Ravech√© received below-market loans from the school, at least some of which were forgiven by Stevens, and questioned Ravech√©'s salary compared to the president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a larger, better known school. The school denied the allegations, brought a preemptive lawsuit against the State of New Jersey, and contended that the state attorney general had overstepped her legal authority. The Stevens trustees also sought unsuccessfully to keep the Attorney General's lawsuit confidential. In December 2009, the New York Times ran an editorial calling for the Stevens case to be pursued vigorously after the end of Anne Milgram term of office. On January 15, 2010, a settlement was reached between the school and the Attorney General's office. The Final Consent Judgment stated in part that \\"the Parties have reached an amicable agreement resolving the issues in controversy and concluding this action without trial, adjudication, or any admission of liability or unlawful conduct by any Party.\\" As a part of the settlement, Ravech√© agreed to step down as president at the end of the 2010 school year and agreed to repay the remainder of the mortgage which the school had extended to him. Other terms of the agreement were focused on limiting the influence of the school's president over committees of the board, designed to promote transparency of operation, and to forestall future allegations of perceived misconduct. Ravech√© was succeeded by Nariman Farvardin. Innovation Strategies International After leaving Stevens, Ravech√© founded Innovation Strategies International, a consulting firm which assists universities, corporations and government agencies with entrepreneurship and innovation. Ravech√© was the longtime science and technology adviser to President Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Republic. Ravech√© also served as entrepreneur-in-residence at the National University of Malaysia, and lectures on innovation in Singapore, Sri Lanka, India, Vietnam, Taiwan and Korea. Ravech√© also occasionally writes on topics of geopolitics, technology, military preparedness and national security. In 2014 Ravech√© was appointed by Beneficial Holdings, Inc., as an independent member of its board of directors. He has been on the board of directors of several electronics, power-generation and financial organizations.

It improves upon the naive selection sort by using a priority queue to find the next element in the sort. In the naive selection sort, it takes O(n) operations to select the next element of n elements; in a tournament sort, it takes O(log n) operations (after building the initial tournament in O(n)). Tournament sort is a variation of heapsort.  Common application  Tournament replacement selection sorts are used to gather the initial runs for external sorting algorithms. Conceptually, an external file is read and its elements are pushed into the priority queue until the queue is full. Then the minimum element is pulled from the queue and written as part of the first run. The next input element is read and pushed into the queue, and the min is selected again and added to the run. There's a small trick that if the new element being pushed into the queue is less than the last element added to the run, then the element's sort value is increased so it will be part of the next run. On average, a run will be 100% longer than the capacity of the priority queue.Donald Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Sorting and Searching, Volume 3, 1973. The \\"snowplow\\" argument. p. 254 Tournament sorts may also be used in N-way merges.  Etymology  The name comes from its similarity to a single-elimination tournament where there are many players (or teams) that play in two-sided matches. Each match compares the players, and the winning player is promoted to play at match at the next level up. The hierarchy continues until the final match determines the ultimate winner. The tournament determines the best player, but the player who was beaten in the final match may not be the second best - he may be inferior to other players the winner bested.

Early life Kelly was born in Bristol, UK, in 1965. His family emigrated to Australia later the same year and settled in the Melbourne suburb of Sunshine. In 1985 John obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Visual Arts Painting) from RMIT where he also completed his Masters of Arts in 1995. As a winner of the 1995 Anne & Gordon Samstag International Visual Arts Scholarship, he travelled to London to study as an Affiliate Student at the Slade School of Art from 1996 to 1997.  Works  Paintings ‚Äì early works (Dobell's cows) Kelly's interest in Australian history clashed with his idiosyncratic sense of humour and this collision created his early Dobell's Cows series (1992‚Äì1996) based on the work of the artist Sir William Dobell. Dobell and his fellow artists were commissioned to camouflage airfields during WWII, and as part of this ruse Dobell made papier-m√¢ch√© cows and scattered them around airfields to deceive the Japanese pilots ‚Äì \\"Said Bill, I think the authorities underestimate the eyesight of the Japanese airmen\\".See Lindsay, Robert, Deconstructing Australia, 2006 McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park, http://www.johnkellyartist.com/documents/lindsay.pdf There is very little historical record that these cows actually existed although Dobell's camouflage activities at Menangle and Bankstown aerodrome are well documented in the Australian War Memorial and by the photography of Max Dupain.Australian photographer Dobell's cows were first exhibited at Niagara Galleries,http://www.niagara- galleries.com.au/niagara/art_gallery_melbourne.html Melbourne, in 1993. Whilst studying at the Slade, a work from this series, ‚ÄòTwo men lifting a cow‚Äô was reproduced in France on the front page of Lib√©ration.Premiere edition numero 4754 These early indications that Kelly's work had broader resonance beyond Australia influenced Kelly greatly, and his thoughts for future international projects. Cow up a Tree and other sculptures In 1999 Kelly was asked by the City of Paris to exhibit in a sculpture exhibition, 'Champs del la Sculpture II', held on the Champs-√âlys√©es to mark the millennium. This exhibition included internationally recognised artists such as Red Grooms, Nam June Paik, Tony Cragg, and Barry Flanagan. At the famous Coubertin Foundation, just outside Paris, Kelly created his iconic 'Cow up a Tree' sculpture, an 8-metre high, four ton bronze sculpture that reproduces Dobell's camouflage cows upside down, high in the branches of an Australian gum tree. This surreal sculpture, based on flood imagery from Australia,It is not uncommon for cattle to be left stranded in trees after flash floods recede as described in Patrick White's book 'The tree of man' published in 19*date missing* caused a Parisian sensation and was commented upon in worldwide media including in The Times, 'Cows and debris put Paris back on modern art map' (Charles Bremmer, 14, Sept. 1999), Time magazine the BBChttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/447751.stm and almost all the French media. This sculpture, one of three in the edition travelled back to Melbourne where it has been on permanent public exhibition as part of Melbourne's Docklands precinct. The second sculpture has been exhibited at The Hague Sculpture Festival, Glastonbury Festival (2007), where it features in a Kaiser Chief's music video 'When the Heat Dies Down', and in 2007/08 Musee de Arte Moderne et Contemporain (MAMAC)http://www.mamac- nice.org/francais/exposition_tempo/parvis/john-kelly_2007/index.html in France where it was juxtaposed against the work of Alexander Calder and Niki de Saint Phalle. After the Champs Elys√®es exhibition he went on to exhibit another monumental bronze work, 'Three Cows in a Pile' at the Monte Carlo Sculpture FestivalLa Parade des Animaux in 2002. Other artists in this exhibition included Alexander Calder, Red Grooms and Keith Haring. In 2003 'Holy Cow ‚Äì the art of John Kelly', a half-hour television documentary was aired on the ABC.Australian Broadcasting Commission In 2005 'Three Cows in a Pile' was exhibited at Glastonbury Festival and also at the Goodenough College in London's Mecklenburgh Square. This exhibition also raised money for a perennial student bursary and was so successful the college has named room 345This was Kelly's old room at the Goodenough Trust as it was in 1996/97 when he studied at the Slade after the artist and the drinking club, The Black and White society who helped raise the money.See the Goodenough College newsletter July 2008, page 7. http://www.goodenough.ac.uk/fileadmin/docs/newsletters/Newsletter_July_2008_01.pdf The Logo series The Monte Carlo sculpture Festival was to be a turning point in Kelly's imagery for it was here he clashed first with the legal world and then the Arts bureaucracy. In accepting the invitation to exhibit in Monte Carlo, Kelly was sued by Arts d‚ÄôAustralie- Stephane Jacob a Parisian art dealer who claimed he was the artist's agent in France. In facing the Parisian court Kelly looked for support from the Australia Council for the Arts and the Australian Embassy. The Embassy refused Kelly's request for mediation,Katrina Strickland, 'No sacred cows', Australian Financial Review, 6 December 2007 After an appeal, the Australian Council offered a small grant to Kelly. In accepting he was contractually obligated to use the logo of the Arts funding body, which consists of a sun and kangaroo emblem. At the same time Kelly discovered that the Australia Council had contracted Saatchi and Saatchi, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars, to undertake a report titled Australians and the Arts. This report found that the Arts were very much a ‚Äòbrand‚Äô and led to an Australia Council strategy of ‚ÄòBranding the Arts‚Äô. As branding can only lead to conformity, Kelly viewed it as anti-art and objected to the concept. Using poetry, letters and articlesSee the Artist Book http://www.johnkellyartist.com/index.php?pageID=1 Kelly began to agitate to have this policy abandoned but to no avail. Finally, using his contractual obligations he tried to subvert the Arts Council by using the Arts council logo in his work, which possibly more effectively critiqued the Australian Council's strategy, for all reference to branding was later removed from their website. In its place were instructions titled ‚ÄòIncorrect usage‚Äô which explained how not to use the logo. These instructions could also have been an accurate description of Kelly's work and the title ‚ÄòIncorrect Usage‚Äô was used as the title of Kelly's 2005 exhibition at the Piccadilly Gallery in London. Arts'd‚ÄôAustralie's case relied on the concept that an unwritten agency agreement existed between the parties. However, in 2004 the Tribunal de Grande instance dismissed the entire case. Arts d'Australie appealed and the case was re-heard. The Appeals court again found that Stephane Jacob was not Kelly's French Agent but awarded the dealer 20,000 euros for parasitism. In all the French court case had dragged on for five years. After the case was over Kelly was quoted as saying; \\"many artists would consider being a parasite upon an art dealer an unlikely and extraordinary achievement\\". Moo Brew Beer Labels In 2005 Kelly was asked to design beer labels for a boutique Australian beer made by the Moorilla Estate in Tasmania. In an ironic twist he accepted and produced a series of paintings to be reproduced as labels for the beer, Moo Brew. The paintings did not use Dobell's cows but incorporated a deconstructed logo, which was in keeping with the Saatchi and Saatchi report that said 'Australian Art should be down to earth and accessible'. The artist who opposed ‚Äòbranding the Arts‚Äô had effectively used the advice to brand the beer with his deconstructed logo work. Deconstructing Australia In 2006 Kelly was invited by Agnew's Gallery in London to exhibit his work. The gallery who formerly represented Sir Sidney Nolan exhibited three paintings from the Logo series in 'Looking Forward ‚Äì 30 British Artists'. In late 2006 the McClelland Sculpture Park and Art Gallery surveyed a collection of his sculptures in a show titled 'Deconstructing Australia', which introduced a new element. This element was a shape borrowed from a Sidney Nolan painting 'Moonboy' or 'The Boy and the Moon' a seminal 1939 work by Australia's most important 20th century painter. At first Kelly simply turned it upside down so it became a light (Nolan's light), but eventually it evolved into other things including an alien. With this exhibition his three key themes to date (Dobell's cows, the Australia Council logo and Nolan's Moonboy) merged to form an idiosyncratic set of symbols that reference Australian modernist history, critique bureaucratic meddling in the Arts and formed a set of symbols that peculiarly become Kelly's although the references are direct and specific (an example is Nolan's Moonboy metamorphosis into an Alien). Also in 2007 he exhibited in Ireland at the Fenton Gallery with a show titled 'There was an Englishman, an Australian and an Irishman...' In the book 'Representing art in Ireland', the writer Fergal Gaynor described Kelly as an \\"obsessive\\" and \\"awkward\\" artist.Representing Art in Ireland, Edited by Nuala Fenton, 2007 A documentary 'Deconstructing John Kelly' was made by Fine Eye Productions and released in 2013. Recent Exhibitions Kelly's recent paintings and sculptures have been complemented by his building of scale models of real museums and galleries including the Tate gallery in London, the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art and the Lewis Glucksman Gallery in Cork. In quietly acquiring and subverting these institutions, much as he did with the Australia Council he has held miniature exhibitions in their sanctified spaces. In the recent work 'The Probe' he introduced the surveillance camera where the viewer becomes the viewed and in 2008 he was invited as a 'Free Radical' to exhibit in the Guangzhou Triennial in China where his work 'The Probe II' was acquired by the Guangdong Museum of Art. His work is also represented in the National Gallery of Australia and the Art Gallery of New South Wales as well as Mus√©e Poulain in Vernon, France and the Ballarat and Benalla galleries. In August 2018 Kelly suffered a severe and complex health crisis but recovered sufficiently to make art again. Writing Kelly's articles and reviews have been published in Circa magazine in Ireland and Art Monthly in Australia. His take on the art world in Cork, where he lives has created debate in the Irish Times, especially when he exposed the selection process at the 'Open' held at the Crawford gallery in 2007. Aidan Dunne wrote ‚Äú...the balance of power in the art world has shifted to the extent that curators play a prescriptive and constitutive role in what artists do and how their work is framed and presented, to the extent that artists are crucially dependent on curatorial approval. So Kelly is making a good point in his open letter in shifting attention onto the role of the curatorial selectors in deciding on what we see when we go into a gallery‚Äù. Kelly was critical of the two curators, France Morris (Tate Modern) and Enrique Juncosa (Irish Museum of Modern Art). Kelly is also a regular contributor to the Daily Review ‚Äì an independent Arts Journal. Several articles regarding what Kelly refers to as the \\"disproportionate representation\\" of private galleries and the appointment of the chair for Australian Venice Biennale 2019 selection panel again sparked considerable controversy and discussion in the media. Aside from his critical writing he is also co-writing a play based on Sir William Dobell's life with the award-winning Scottish playwright Alan Gilmour. Kelly has recently exhibited at the Salamanca Arts Centre in Hobart, Tasmania and also at the Liverpool Street gallery in Sydney.

Early life Li Tao was a direct descendant of Li Si (ÊùéÂÅ≤), Emperor Taizong of Tang's grandson who narrowly escaped from the persecution of Empress Wu Zetian to settle in Danleng, Mei Prefecture, in 8th-century Tang dynasty. Li Tao's father Li Zhong (Êùé‰∏≠), a 15th-generation descendant of Li Si, passed the imperial examination in 1109 during the Song dynasty. He was well known for his knowledge in history and the classics. Li Tao read widely from a young age, not only Confucian classics but also history, medicine, agriculture, cosmology and divination. A believer of I Ching, he made an effort to modify his daily conduct and learning to its teachings. But his greatest passion was in the field of history: he devoted himself to the learning of The Spring and Autumn Annals, looked up to Sima Guang and strongly believed that history should be written as a guide for Confucian ethics. In 1132 he scored first in the local examination in Mei Prefecture, and six years later he passed the imperial examination. In between, he wrote two historical essays \\"The Mirror of Both Han Dynasties\\" (ÂÖ©Êº¢Èëë) and \\"The Discussion about the Restoration of Righteousness\\" (ÂèçÊ≠£Ë≠∞), focusing on the morality lessons of his historical subjects. Official career Under Emperor Gaozong Having passed the imperial examination in 1138, he was appointed Assistant Magistrate (‰∏ªÁ∞ø) of Huayang (ËèØÈôΩ; in modern Chengdu) in Chengdu Prefecture, but he with permission postponed the appointment to pursue further studies at home, assuming office only in 1142. When chief councilor Qin Hui heard of Li's literary fame, he offered Li a position in the central government, but Li rejected the offer on the grounds that their views differ. This directly prevented him from entering the central bureaucracy for the next 20 years. At the local post, Li Tao spent his time collecting and arranging historical sources. He went home to mourn his late father in 1147 and became the Prefectural Judge (Êé®ÂÆò) of Ya Prefecture three years later. This was when he started working on Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, an annalistic work intended to follow Sima Guang's monumental Zizhi Tongjian. Like Sima Guang before him, he began gathering the veritable records (ÂØ¶ÈåÑ), the reign histories (ÂúãÂè≤) and biographies for his project. In 1159, when he worked under the Sichuan Military Commissioner (ÂõõÂ∑ùÂà∂ÁΩÆ‰Ωø) Wang Gangzhong (ÁéãÂâõ‰∏≠), he published an article titled \\"Ten Comments on Li Yue and Others\\" (ÊùéÊÇÖÁ≠âÂçÅ‰∫ã) which denounced Qin Hui and Cai Jing. A year after he was appointed Prefect (Áü•Â∑û) of Rong Prefecture. Under Emperor Xiaozong In 1163, Li Tao finished the first 17 chapters of Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, which covers the reign of Emperor Taizu of Song. In 1167 he was recommended by the new Sichuan Military Commissioner Wang Yingchen (Ê±™ÊáâËæ∞) and went to the capital Lin'an Prefecture to serve as Assistant Official (Âì°Â§ñÈÉé) in the Ministry of War (ÂÖµÈÉ®). He was concurrently appointed Official of the Bureau of Compilator of the Reign History (ÂúãÂè≤Èô¢Á∑®‰øÆÂÆò), and his unfinished Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian was included in the Palace Library. In 1168, he presented his unfinished book, now covering Song history from 960 to 1067 in roughly 108 chapters, to Emperor Xiaozong of Song. In 1169 he became Vice Director of the Palace Library (ÁßòÊõ∏Â∞ëÁõ£) and concurrently an Imperial Diarist (Ëµ∑Â±ÖËàç‰∫∫). He proposed to recompile the veritable records for Emperor Huizong of Song because of their \\"partiality and carelessness\\". In 1170, he was made the Examining Editor (Ê™¢Ë®éÂÆò) of the newly established Bureau of Compilation of Veritable Records (ÂØ¶ÈåÑÈô¢). When Wang Yingchen suffered a political setback, Li Tao as his prot√©g√© was ousted from the central government. He served as Vice Fiscal Commissioner (ËΩâÈÅãÂâØ‰Ωø) of Jinghu North Circuit and concurrently Fiscal Governor-General of Jinghu and Guangnan Circuits. Before long he was summoned back to Lin'an and restored to his ranks and titles. Later, chief councilor Yu Yunwen feared Li's opposition to his plans to attack the Jin dynasty, so he made Li the Military Intendant of Tongchuan (ÊΩºÂ∑ù; in modern Sichuan) and the Administrator of Lu Prefecture (in modern Sichuan). Thereafter Li Tao served as Vice Fiscal Commissioner of Jiangnan West Circuit. By 1174 he had finished 280 chapters of Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian. Li Tao came back to the central government for the third time in 1176, when he assumed the posts of Director of the Palace Library, Provisional Associate Compiler of the Bureau of Compilation of Reign History (ÂúãÂè≤Èô¢) and Associate Compiler of Bureau of Compilation of Veritable Records. In 1177 he finished the last part of Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian and was honored as a Vice Minister (‰æçÈÉé) of the Ministry of Rites. He was also joined in the Palace Library and the historical bureaus by his son Li Hou (ÊùéÂûï), who worked with him in the compilation of historical materials. But when Li Hou was impeached for an allegedly blasphemous exam question which he used on university students, Li Tao was also demoted to Administrator of Changde Prefecture. In 1181 he was transferred to Administrator of Suining Prefecture. In 1180, the Bureau of Compilation of Reign History finished the treatise chapters of its Sichao Guozhi (ÂõõÊúùÂúãÂøó; \\"The Reign History of Four Thrones\\"), with Li Tao authoring the chapters on geography. Much information of the other chapters was taken from Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, and Li Tao continued to write the biography chapters. He also edited Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian into a 980-chapter book, and wrote the summary (68 chapters), the general catalogue (5 chapters) and the compilation accounts (10 chapters). The finished book was finally presented to Emperor Xiaozong in 1183. He was summoned back to the central government the 4th time and rewarded the posts of Auxiliar-Academician (Áõ¥Â≠∏Â£´) of Fuwen Pavilion (Êï∑ÊñáÈñ£), Lecturer-in-Waiting (‰æçË¨õ) of Hanlin Academy and Intendant of Youshen Temple (‰ΩëÁ•ûËßÄ). He continued to contribute to Sichao Guozhi until his death in 1184 in Lin'an. (The book was finished by Hong Mai in 1186.) His sons Li Hou and Li Zhi (Êùé°å¥) were also notable historians, and another son Li Bi (ÊùéÂ£Å) became Assistant Executive of the Secretariat- Chancellery during Emperor Ningzong's reign.

Spray drying is a gentle method for producing powders with a defined particle size out of solutions, dispersions, and emulsions which is widely used for pharmaceuticals, food, biotechnology, and other industrial materials synthesis. In the past, the limitations of spray drying were the particle size (minimum 2 micrometres), the yield (maximum around 70%), and the sample volume (minimum 50 ml for devices in lab scale). Recently, minimum particle sizes have been reduced to 300 nm, yields up to 90% are possible, and the sample amount can be as small as 1 ml. These expanded limits are possible due to new technological developments to the spray head, the heating system, and the electrostatic particle collector. To emphasize the small particle sizes possible with this new technology, it has been described as \\"nano\\" spray drying. However, the smallest particles produced are in the sub-micrometre range common to fine particles rather than the nanometer scale of ultrafine particles. Functional principle of a nano spray dryer  Functional principle  The functional principle is basically the same as with normal spray dryers. There are just different technologies that are used to do similar things. The drying gas enters the system via the heater. A new kind of heater system allows for laminar air flow. The spray head sprays the fine droplets with a narrow size distribution into the drying chamber. The droplets dry and become solid particles. The solid particles are separated in the electrostatic particle collector. The [exhaust gas] is filtered and sent to a fume hood or the environment. The inlet temperature is controlled by a temperature sensor. and can be very dangerous also due to particulate matter ¬±√ó“¶·º´Œü  Applications  Scanning electron micrograph of gelatine particles spray dried with a nano spray dryer Scanning electron micrograph of grisofulvin particles spray dried with a nano spray dryer Pharmaceuticals: This technique is widely used in the pharma market. Because of the small sample amounts and the high yields it is ideal for spray drying expensive substances in basic research. The following list shows examples of what is possible: *Inhalable drugs for dry powder inhalers (DPI‚Äòs) *Nano- and microencapsulation of liposomes *Stabilization of heat-sensitive vaccines, insulin, growth hormones *Encapsulation of nanoparticle drugs for high bioavailability *Nanocapsules of biodegradable polymers (lactides, glycolides) *Porous drug carriers for nanoparticle suspensions *Excipients for controlled drug release studies: trehalose, mannitol, lactose, HPMC, PVA, chitosan, dextrine, PLGA, starch, gelatin Materials science: This new technique offers new prospects in materials science, specially in the nanomaterial field. Now it is possible to spray dry fine particles. The following list shows examples of what is possible: *Fine metal particles for novel catalysts *Fine magnetic powders *Carbon nanotubes as additives *High performance ceramics with novel structures and high specific surface area *Titanium oxide particles *Nanoparticle suspensions for agglomeration *Silicon oxide nanoparticle agglomerates *Finest pigments for paints and coatings Food: Also in the field of food science this technology offers new possibilities. Especially in the currently vibrant field of functional food, the following list shows examples of what is possible: *Nano food ‚Äì Functional additives *Encapsulation of fruit aromas, flavours, or perfumes *Spray drying of fine powder aromas for pet food *Encapsulation of fish oil for smell protection *Vitamins, other food additives, etc.  Spray head  One of the three new technologies that makes \\"nano\\" spray drying possible is the spray head. A piezoelectric system precisely vibrates a fine mesh. Vibration produces fine droplets with a narrow size distribution. Vibrating mesh of a nano spray dryer spray head Size distribution of the droplets produced by the spray head  Heating system  In the field of \\"nano\\" spray drying a new heating system is used to provide the drying gas to produce the particles. The gas flow in the system is laminar and not turbulent as in common spray drying. The advantage of a laminar flow is that the particles fall straight down from the spray head and do not stick to the glass wall. The laminar flow is produced by pressing the air through a porous metal foam.  Electrostatic particle collector  To collect the very fine particles a new technology is used in the field of \\"nano\\" spray drying. The reason is that common cyclone technology depends on the particle mass; particles smaller than 2 Œºm can‚Äôt be separated and instead exit the system along with the exhaust gas. The electrostatic particle collector charges the dry particles' surface and deflects them with an electrical field. To produce the electrical field, a high voltage (16 kV) is applied to a round collector tube. The electrical field builds up between the inner wall of the collector tube and the tips of a grounded star electrode. To have a low level of energy in the system the current is very low. After getting deflected the particles stay at the inner wall of the particle collector tube and are completely uncharged. This separation method works fine for all kinds of materials. The efficiency of the electrostatic particle collector is very high: 99% of all particles that enter the system are collected.

Sex pheromones and aggregating pheromones are the most common types used. A pheromone-impregnated lure, as the red rubber septa in the picture, is encased in a conventional trap such as a bottle trap, Delta trap, water-pan trap, or funnel trap. Pheromone traps are used both to count insect populations by sampling, and to trap pests such as clothes moths to destroy them. Sensitivity Pheromone traps are very sensitive, meaning they attract insects present at very low densities. They are often used to detect presence of exotic pests, or for sampling, monitoring, or to determine the first appearance of a pest in an area. They can be used for legal control, and are used to monitor the success of the Boll Weevil Eradication Program and the spread of the gypsy moth. The high species-specificity of pheromone traps can also be an advantage, and they tend to be inexpensive and easy to implement. However, it is impractical in most cases to completely remove or \\"trap out\\" pests using a pheromone trap. Some pheromone-based pest control methods have been successful, usually those designed to protect enclosed areas such as households or storage facilities. There has also been some success in mating disruption. In one form of mating disruption, males are attracted to a powder containing female attractant pheromones. The pheromones stick to the males' bodies, and when they fly off, the pheromones make them attractive to other males. It is hoped that if enough males chase other males instead of females, egg-laying will be severely impeded. Some difficulties surrounding pheromone traps include sensitivity to bad weather, their ability to attract pests from neighboring areas, and that they generally only attract adults, although it is the juveniles in many species that are pests. They are also generally limited to one sex. Targets Though certainly not all insect pheromones have been discovered, many are known and many more are discovered every year. Some sites curate large lists of insect pheromones. Pheromones are frequently used to monitor and control lepidopteran and coleopteran species, with many available commercially. Pheromones are available for insects including: *African bollworm *African cotton leafworm *Apple brown tortrix *Apple clearwing moth *Apple fruit moth *Apple maggot *Artichoke moth *Asian beetle *Asian corn borer moth *Baluchistan fruit fly *Banana weevil *Banded elm bark beetle *Barred fruit-tree tortrix *Beech tortrix moth *Beet armyworm *Bertha armyworm *Black cutworm *Blueberry maggot *Bollworm *Bright-line brown-eye or tomato moth *Brown oak tortrix *Cabbage leaf roller *Cabbage looper moth *Cabbage moth *Carnation tortrix *Carob moth *Cherry-bark moth *Cherry fruit fly *Citrus cutworm *Citrus flower moth *Citrus leafmining moth *Citrus mealybug *Codling moth *Corn earworm *Corn stalk borer *Cucumber fruit fly *Cucumber moth *Currant clearwing moth *Cutworm *Date palm fruit stalk borer *Diamond back moth *Douglas-fir tussock moth *Dubas bug *Durra stem borer *Eastern cherry fruit fly *Eggplant shoot and fruit borer *Egyptian cotton leaf worm *Engraver beetle *European corn borer *European goat moth *European pine shoot moth *European spruce bark beetle *Eye-spotted bud moth *Fall armyworm *False codling moth *Fruit fly *Fruit tree leaf roller *Garden pebble *Golden leaf roller *Golden twin moth or groundnut semi-looper moth *Grape moth or vine moth *Green oak moth *Grey tortrix *Gypsy moth *Hants moth *Jasmine moth *Large fruit tree tortrix *Leche's twist moth *Leek moth or onion moth *Legume pod borer *Leopard moth *Lesser peach tree borer *Longhorn date stem borer *Marbled orchard tortrix *Mediterranean fruit fly *Mediterranean pine engraver beetle *Melon fly *Northern bark beetle *Nun moth *Olive fruit fly *Olive moth *Orange tortrix *Oriental fruit fly *Oriental fruit moth *Pea moth *Peach fruit fly *Pear leaf blister moth *Pear twig borer *Pine processionary moth *Pine sawfly *Pink bollworm *Plum fruit moth *Potato moth *Potato tuber moth *Queensland fruit fly *Quince moth *Red palm weevil *Rhinoceros beetle *Rice stem borer *Rose tortrix *San Jose scale *Sesiidae (some) *Silver Y moth *Six- spined spruce bark beetle *Six-toothed bark beetle *Spiny boll worm *Spotted bollworm *Spotted tentiform miner *Straw coloured tortrix moth *Sugar beet weevil *Summer fruit tortrix moth *Tobacco budworm *Tomato leaf miner *Tomato looper *Turnip moth *Variegated golden tortrix *Winter moth *Xyloterus bark beetle References Category:Biological pest control Category:Pest control techniques Category:Insect ecology Category:Entomology equipment Category:Pest trapping ","title":"Pheromone trap"},{"id":"24118187","text":"Oleksovice () is a market town in Znojmo District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic.

It was built for the benefit of children from all over South Wales shortly before World War II as a residential education, sport, arts and outdoor activities centre for young people 8‚Äì24 years of age. The camp was closed in 2007 and demolished to make way for housing in 2014. History Ogmore Centre came under the ownership of Bridgend City Council at the time of local authority reorganisation. It had previously been operated under the old Mid Glamorgan Education Authority. Although still under the ownership of Bridgend County Borough Council it was located in The Vale of Glamorgan with regard to planning etc. After it was closed by Bridgend County Borough Council in the mid 1990s public pressure led to it being reopened in 1998 as a Trust under the leadership of Roger Lewis, now Chief Executive of the Welsh Rugby Union. In the subsequent years up to 2006 some 10000 children a year attended residential courses in subjects including literacy, languages, mathematics, music, performing arts, sports and environmental studies. It provided a sense of adventure by being the first time away from home for many, in a safe secure facility. The camp had a sprung floor gymnasium with indoor facilities for basketball, football, badminton, indoor cricket nets etc. It had outdoor playing fields for both rugby and soccer, and an outdoor climbing frame. In addition it had a computer lab and a hall for performing arts, together with classrooms and rehearsal facilities. All of this, together with the beaches and heritage coast. In 2004 planning approval was given to build a new ECO Centre on site, which would have been a living, learning environment for sustainability studies and would have made the site a Centre of Environmental Excellence. The Trust kept the cost of attendance low to enable children from poorer areas to afford to attend. As running costs escalated this began to tip the economic balance of running the centre against it being able to continue. In order to move forward, the Trust sought the help of Kingswood Education and Adventure Centres, an organisation who operate a number of similar facilities in the UK. They had the resources to improve the marketing and provide funding for upgrading the facilities. Today In 2007 Kingswood offered to pay an economic rent and provide the funding to upgrade the facility or purchase the centre outright so it could continue as a residential education facility with preferential rates for local children, but BCBC declined to explore either of these possibilities further and declared the Trust to be in breach of their lease agreement. Bridgend refused any variation of the lease agreement thereby forcing Kingswood to vacate the centre and further declines of local or central funding put a huge strain on the trust that had originally saved the centre. The doors were closed its doors in December 2007 with the loss of local jobs. The Glamorgan Gazette reported that Bridgend had secretly identified the site as potentially generating ¬£7m revenues during a difficult budgetary period. A planning application by BCBC to demolish the centre and build some 84 houses was submitted in 2009. Wig Fach Property Company are competing for planning permission to also develop the site together with the adjacent caravan park to build some 130 houses. Wig Fach have said they would keep the education facility and are prepared to look again at the Kingswood proposal. However their plan provides for the demolition and change of use of more than 50% of the residential capacity so vital to the ongoing viability of the site for residential education. In August 2009 Kingswood Centres restated their commitment to re-open the centre with a ¬£2-¬£3 million investment at a local resident community meeting. Attempts were still under way from local groups, the trustees of Ogmore Centre and Kingswood, to allow the centre to reopen in 2010. Sadly, this never occurred and the Centre was subsequently sold for the construction of new housing. The development was begun toward the end of 2014 and completed in 2018 with the construction of over 70 new homes. The builders were David Wilson Ltd who are part of the Barrett Group. Many people who attended the Ogmore Centre have gone in to be famous in their own right including sports men and women and musicians.

In American high society, the Social Register was traditionally a key resource for identifying qualified members. From a global perspective, see upper class. The quality of housing, clothing, servants and dining were visible marks of membership.Yuri Lotman, High Society Dinners: Dining in Tsarist Russia. (2014) 19th century The term became common in the late 19th century, especially when the newly arrived rich in key cities such as New York City, Boston, and Newport, Rhode Island, built great mansions and sponsored highly publicized parties.Wayne Craven, Gilded Mansions: Grand Architecture and High Society (2009). The media lavished attention on them, especially when newspapers devoted whole sections to weddings, funerals, parties and other events sponsored by the local high society. In major cities, a Social Register was published that listed the names and addresses of people who properly belonged. Informal identifiers appeared, such as the \\"upper tens\\" in mid-19th century New York City, or \\"the 400,\\" Ward McAllister's late 19th-century term for the number of people Mrs. William Backhouse Astor, Jr's ballroom could supposedly accommodate,Mooney, James E. \\"Astor [n√©e Schermerhorn] Caroline (Webster)\\" in , p.72, pp.962-963 although the actual number was 273.Mooney, James E. \\"Society\\" in , pp.1199-1201 Debutantes are young female members of high society being officially presented for the first time, at debutante balls or cotillions. An example of a high society debutante ball is the prestigious International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. Gold and silver mining, in the mid 19th century brought enormous wealth overnight to certain small towns such as Central City, Colorado and Leadville, Colorado. The new rich typically build a lavish opera house in the mining town, but then moved to a major city, especially Denver or San Francisco, where their wealth could be more suitably displayed and enjoyed.Thomas J. Noel, \\"Colorado's Rush to Culture A Gold Rush Legacy.\\" Journal of the West 49#2 (2010): 41-49. When the men attended to business affairs, women generally took charge of comings and goings and doings in high society.Newport Historical Society Staff, \\"The Business Of Leisure: The Gilded Age In Newport,\\" Newport History (1989) 62#3 pp 97-126. Starting with the Stuyvesant luxury apartment house that opened in 1869, and The Dakota in 1884, affluent New Yorkers discovered the advantages of apartment living, where a full-time staff handled the upkeep and maintenance, as well as security.Stephen Birmingham, Life at the Dakota (1979)Andrew Alpern, New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments: With Original Floor Plans from the Dakota, River House, Olympic Tower and Other Great Buildings (1987) covers 75 famous buildings starting in 1869. In most French cities the very rich, often holding an old aristocratic title, maintained an elaborate high society well into the 20th century. Ten to twenty servants demonstrated the taste for conspicuous consumption. The richest households in Paris typically employed 30 servants. After 1945 the supply of servants dried up and there was a move to smaller inner city apartments in elite neighborhoods.Elizabeth C. Macknight, \\"A ‚Äòtheatre of rule‚Äô? Domestic service in aristocratic households under the Third Republic.\\" French history 22.3 (2008): 316-336. onlineChristophe Charle, \\"Noblesse et √©lites en France au d√©but du XXe si√®cle.\\" Publications de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome 107#1 (1988): 407-433. online  Art  Mrs. William Astor painted by Carolus-Duran in 1890, presented at the 1894 Great Portrait Exhibition Art in this time was almost exclusively linked to the possession of money. The art of high society focused greatly on absorbing cultures from around the world, and referencing great architecture from the past, and commissioning artists that were from Europe. The culture was to possess knowledge and artifacts from other cultures or at least replicated it very well. Acquiring rare and valuable items was another way of high society representing its prestige. Art was also a way of representing taste level and someones ability to commission the right artist or chose the best piece to have installed in their homes.  Portraiture  Portrait painters were in high demand in London. Meanwhile, the smaller corps of American artists shifted their focus from painting the great landscapes of America to making portraits of great Americans.Meaghan Clarke, \\"(Re) Viewing Whistler and Sargent: portraiture at the fin-de-si√®cle.\\" RACAR: revue d'art canadienne/Canadian Art Review (2005): 74-86. However art historians generally ignored the society artists such as John Singer Sargent (1856 ‚Äì 1925) until the late 20th century.Franz Schulze, \\"J. S. Sargent, Partly Great.\\" Art in America (1980) 68#2 pp 90-96 Portraiture became the most common art in order for people in high society to record and have evidence of their accomplishment and valuable possessions. \\"Portrait of Lady Helen Vincent\\" by J.S. Sargent, 1904 New York City started its Great Portrait Exhibition, focused on high society. The exhibition became a place for people to see Who's Who in New York City high society and focused more on the names of the people in the portraits rather than the quality of the portraits. The art community changed its focus to portraiture and became a tight-knit circle of patrons (who were, more often than not, also subjects), artists, and critics.  Architecture  Stanford White (1853-1906) was the most influential architect for High Society. High Society was also immortalized through the building of mansions glittered in decadence and detail that were reminiscent of the renaissance, and the Victorian gothic. These massive homes were visible in dense cities like New York, they sprinkled main avenues that belonged to the wealth or middle class and stayed clear of the poor areas that were dense and littered with filth and the poor working class. Richard Morris Hunt played a large role in giving many members of High Society what they were looking for: homes that represented their cosmopolitan outlook and outshine all that was around it. For more on the homes of this time era see List of Gilded Age mansions. Sociology Members of high society depend greatly on the people and social circles they are surrounded by. In many cases an elite member can confirm status by having servants, people who remove a task from everyday life, or artists and performers, whose talent and skills are at their disposal. Social groups play the most important role in establishing members of high society. Members of high society usually must attend social gatherings throughout the year while also putting together social gatherings in their own homes. The sociological distinction is the use of social capital in order to attend or be invited to certain events. Members of high society tend to be aware of the connections that should be made in order to move up the social ladder. Recent decades High society is less visible in the 21st century‚Äîprivacy is much more valued, and the very expensive housing is not as conspicuous to ordinary pedestrians as the famous old mansions. There are far fewer servants, but much more attention to security. Remote ski resorts in places like Vail and Aspen are especially popular with high society.Edward Duke Richey, Living it Up in Aspen: Post-war America, Ski Town Culture, and the New Western Dream, 1945--1975 (2006). However, the rise of social media services such as Instagram and Facebook has given a new outlet to practices of conspicuous consumption that characterize the upper class. Philanthropy is a high-prestige activity in high society. Sociologist Francie Ostrower states: > The wealthy take philanthropy and adapt it into an entire way of life that > serves as a vehicle for the social and cultural life of their class. This is > reflected in the widespread popularity of educational and cultural causes > among donors.

Part of a series of works by Darwin related to his theory of natural selection, the book is a study of carnivorous plants with specific attention paid to the adaptations that allow them to live in difficult conditions. It includes illustrations by Darwin himself, along with drawings by his sons George and Francis Darwin. The book chronicles Darwin's experiments with various carnivorous plants, in which he carefully studied their feeding mechanisms. Darwin tried several methods to stimulate the plants into activating their trap mechanisms, including feeding them meat and glass, blowing on them and prodding them with hair. He found that only the movement of an animal would cause the plants to react, and concluded that this was an evolutionary adaptation to conserve energy for prey and to ignore stimuli that were not likely to be nutritious. He also discovered that while some plants have distinct trap-like structures, others produce sticky fluids to ensnare their prey and concluded that this was an example of natural selection pressure resulting in various methods for food capture. The first edition had a reported printing of 3,000 copies. It was translated into several languages during Darwin's lifetime, including German. A second English-language edition was published in 1889 after Darwin's death. It was edited with additions and footnotes by Francis Darwin. Summary Drawing of a Venus flytrap, one of the plants Darwin studied, from the German translation All page numbers refer to where the quotes can be found in the 1875, John Murray edition. From his initial observations in 1860 of Drosera rotundifolia, the common sundew, Darwin developed a series of experiments ultimately establishing how \\"excellently adapted\\" these plants are to catching insects (p. 3). Darwin knew that these plants flourish in nitrogen-limited environments, growing in bogs, poor peaty soil and moss (p. 18). Most plants receive nutrients from the soil by their roots, but these plants have poor root systems and have adapted to receive nutrients (primarily nitrogenous substances) from captured insects. Darwin noted that Drosera and other carnivorous plants also feed on seeds, thus also making them vegetable feeders (p. 134). His notable observations are (p. 3‚Äì4): 1\\\\. The sensitivity of the glands to slight pressure and to minute doses of nitrogenous substances. He noted that although there is extreme sensitivity it is wholly appropriate to the purpose of gaining sustenance, e.g. they do not respond to heavy rain falling on them nor to the wind blowing other leaves against them. They have adapted well to insects alighting upon them and this saves them from wasting energy through excess movement. 2\\\\. The power to digest nitrogenous substances by secreting digestive matter and then absorbing them. He noted that digestion follows a similar pattern to animal processes (p. 135) in that acid is added to ferment the nutrient source(equivalent to pepsin). How they adapted this process from already existing substances in their system is explored later on in the book (p. 361). 3\\\\. The changes which took place within the cells when the glands are excited in various ways. A major part of the book enumerates his experiments on Drosera rotundifolia. Darwin then turns his attention to other varieties of insectivorous plants and makes comparisons, noting that in some cases different parts of the leaf are used for digestion and others for absorption of decayed matter (p. 330‚Äì331). He conjectured that plants may become adapted exclusively to one of these functions by gradually losing the other over a period of time. This would explain how Pinguicula and Utricularia came to use different functions even though they belong to the same family; p. 331). Darwin wrote in his autobiography that \\"the fact that a plant should secrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment, closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a remarkable discovery.\\" See also * Insectivorous Plant Society  Notes   External links  *Full Text from The Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online Category:1875 non-fiction books Category:Books by Charles Darwin Category:Botany books Category:Evolutionary biology literature Category:British books Category:Carnivorous plant literature Category:Stefan Zweig Collection Category:English-language books Category:John Murray (publisher) books ","title":"Insectivorous Plants (book)"},{"id":"24118346","text":"Kora Karvouni () (born 22 April 1980 in Athens, Greece) is a Greek stage and television actress.

View of the Rundling Satemin, 3 km west of L√ºchow in the Wendland The Rundling was a relatively common village form used by the Slavs. It usually comprises a central, circular village green owned in common with individually owned farmsteads radiating out around it like the spokes of a wheel. The best examples are now only in a small area of Lower Saxony in Germany near to the town of L√ºchow. 15 of these villages have been put forward as an ensemble for consideration as possible World Heritage Sites, and a decision is expected in the next few years. At the City Hall Oslo on 11 June 2015 the Rundlingsverein were awarded the Grand Prix for the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Award 2015. This was in recognition of 46 years of voluntary work in preserving these ancient settlements. Such villages were originally found across a strip of central Germany from Kiel to Bohemia (where they are variously referred to as a Rundling, Runddorf, Rundlingsdorf, Rundplatzdorf or Platzdorf), often indicated by village names ending in -itz, -ow and -thin. Virtually all such Rundlinge are now only to be found in the small area of Wendland. History and origins  There are no contemporary historical records of the founding of these circular villages, but a consensus has arisen in recent decades that they were founded in the 12th century, on land that had not been previously cultivated, probably because of its essentially low lying boggy nature, its tendency to be flooded and the relative poverty of its sandy soil. The current leading theory is that of Professor Dr Wolfgang Meibeyer, who believes that all the Rundlinge were developed at more or less the same time in the 12th century, to a model developed by the then Germanic nobility as suitable for small groups of mainly Slavic farm-settlers. Whether these settlers were there by choice, by conquest or by forced settlement is no longer known. It does seem to have happened without much bloodshed, and the following centuries showed a living together of Germans and Slavs. This eventually led to an assimilation and eventual disappearance of the Slavs as a separate ethnic group with their own language, Wendish (Wendisch) or Polabian (drav√§nopolabisch), which is the language used for the majority of the Rundling names, and still to this day for certain unusual features of local rural architecture and land-use. This separate Slavic language did however remain more generally in use in the region of L√ºchow until the 18th century, and there is a written chronicle and dictionary still in existence drawn up by Johann Parum Schultze of the village of S√ºthen, in around 1725, which marks the increasing loss of the old language. The area of its historical use is now often called Wendland after those Slavic peoples who were called the Wends, and it corresponds more or less with the current administrative boundaries of the district of L√ºchow-Dannenberg. Two related Slavic ethnic groups were the Wenden of the Spreewald and the Lusatian Sorbs of Upper Lusatia (Oberlausitz), together making a group of about 60,000 who still are said to be able to speak Sorbian in the Spreewald, an area of Eastern Germany near the Polish border around the towns of Bautzen and Cottbus.  Slavic or German?  Rundlinge are therefore closely related to the existence of the Slavic ethnic group of the Wends, but seem to have been a German invention. There is absolutely no evidence that the round form of those early settlements was essentially Slavic in origin, as many once assumed. They arose as part of Henry the Lion's eastern colonization (Ostsiedlung) in the mid 12th century. It seems that the German nobility hit upon the idea of creating new villages in the form of a half circle or a horseshoe shape, with the wide entrance to the central village green opening out to the fields. It has been speculated though that this model could have been based on a form of settlement dating from at least the 7th century. In our later form each farmer would have an equally sized wedge-shaped piece of land on which to build their houses, so that the basic outline of the village is that of a half a circular cake cut into slices. Behind each farmer's plot would be their own personal wood as a source of firewood, foraging for farm animals and at times of crisis for building materials. This would usually be on somewhat lower ground, and often had a stream running through it, or by it. Slavic ceramics have been found but not directly in the Rundlinge, more usually a few hundred metres outside of them. A continuation of Slavic settlement perhaps in a new Germanic form remains therefore a possibility. Proof one way or another will only come from more comprehensive archaeological examinations perhaps of those Rundlinge known to have been deserted in earlier centuries.  Appearance  Schematic diagram of a Rundling with its access track These villages were usually small, with only a few farmsteads, averaging perhaps around 5‚Äì7, and built away from tracks or roads, around an open central village green, which was a part of the commons, not allocated to any one particular farmer. The leading farmer, called a Schulze, had a slightly better plot, set in the centre opposite the entrance to the village, and usually extra land outside the circle called by its Wendish name G√ºsteneitz. They are almost always to be found on the border between low-lying wetter land near to water and higher drier land more suitable for cultivation, called here geest. The villages were fairly densely scattered across the area to be colonized, with each one barely a kilometre from its neighbour. This means that there were very many, fairly small, settlements. In very very few cases have they been amalgamated into larger villages or subsumed as suburbs of towns. Even today this pattern has continued. Of the 324 named settlements in today's L√ºchow-Dannenberg, over 200 are or were once Rundlinge, and virtually none have been swallowed up by the encroachment of towns, or have been amalgamated into larger villages, although since the reforms of 1972, most have lost their political separateness. Prior to 1972 each village had its own separate political status, which led to there being 230 entities, Gemeinden, in what was then and still is one of the most sparsely settled areas of modern Germany, East or West. The smallest of the 230 was Liepeh√∂fen, which had the princely number of 3 adult voters! Instead of 230 there are today a more reasonable 27 Gemeinden.  Subsequent circular shape  The original shape of the Rundlinge was semi-circular or horse-shoe shaped. Most became circular through a period of time in the later Middle Ages, probably between 1500 and 1550, when population densities increased. This led to the original farmsteads being split into two, three or four, and additional wedge-shaped land being made available at the open entrance to the village, in effect closing the village in and allowing only one track in from outside. This development appears to have been ordained from above, rather than being the result of more than one son taking over a farmstead. This gives us the tightly packed Rundling of today with up to 20 farmsteads. The greater prosperity, and therefore greater population density of the Rundlinge of those times may have been related to the increasing addition of flax-weaving to the incomes of the farmers. In any event most of the originally semi-circular villages became more nearly circular, although there were in fact many slightly differently shaped solutions. Some of the Rundlinge today are more oval in shape, others more irregularly shaped. The original \\"one entrance to the village green\\" model was in some cases altered to take account, say, of a path to the local church or one to the local mill, and in later years these paths may have been widened to take vehicles, and may today form a route through the village. Although very many Rundlinge of today have retained their separateness, many have expanded during the last century and have modern houses added, typically in one direction away from the original round. This occasionally leads to an elongated village with the old Rundling at the end.  External location of churches  One anomaly, which marks out these villages from others in other parts of Europe, is that the Rundling villages virtually never have a church in them. There are churches, even quite ancient ones, but they and their burial grounds are almost always well outside the Rundling itself. This could have come about because the Rundlinge were usually built only just above the water-table, whereas the churches needed higher ground to give enough depth for their burials. It could also be as a result of each village being too small to maintain a church, so the church had to serve several villages. However most researchers believe that it shows that Christianisation came late to the villages, after their basic structure had been created. There are reports by the church authorities of practices well into modern times. It also suggests that, even where it had been possible to add a church to the village circle (even in the middle ‚Äì why not?), they did not do so. There must have been a sense that it was not appropriate to do so, or there would be examples among the 200+ villages in Wendland, and there are not, even in the villages set on higher ground. Not only are there no churches, there are no schools or communal buildings, no shops and virtually no trade outlets. The villages are made up entirely of farm dwellings.  Rundling and Lower German Hall House  The Rundling village of Schreyahn with its Low German hall houses Although the Rundling shape and the Rundling farmhouse architecture are two separate developments, with several hundred years between them, and which therefore need to be kept separate in our minds, it is the interplay between the two which makes the Wendland Rundlinge of today so attractive to the visitor. We have seen that the Rundling form seems to have been a planned form of division of property in newly colonized areas east of Germanic lands, and there are historically examples in a wide strip of land running from the Baltic Sea near Kiel and L√ºbeck down both sides of the Elbe river right down to the Czech Lands in the south. This corresponds to the Eastern Colonisation of Henry the Lion after 1147 and others in the so-called Wendenkreuzzug, or Wendish crusade, where the Pope had given his agreement to a northern crusade to conquer and convert the pagan Slavs, at the same time as others were taking part in southern crusades to retake Jerusalem from the Muslim Turks. However the architecture of the much later mediaeval farmhouses to the south of Wittenberg was different from those in the north, and so different parts of the north‚Äìsouth Rundling strip through Germany looked different as a result. The farmhouses of Wendland were a part of an enormous east‚Äìwest area running from parts of Eastern Netherlands across the North German plain to Poland, where one form of farmhouse predominated. This was the area of the Low German Hall House (Niederdeutsches Hallenhaus), an all-in-one building of considerable size which housed not only the farmer and his family, but also most of his farmyard animals, his hay loft and his implements. Typically the hall house had the animals and the barn buildings at the front facing the village green, whereas the farmer lived at the back facing his garden or smallholding. The design of the house put the main open fire in the middle at the back of the barn area, the smoke disappearing through small apertures in the front facade. The hall house was an invention of the North German plains, and did not exist to the south of a line from Dortmund to Brunswick to Wittenberg to Stettin. This meant that only about one tenth of its entire width crossed the strip of land running north to south that was part of the 12th century Wendenkreuzzug, which created the Rundling form. Within this strip were the cities of Kiel, L√ºbeck and Hamburg and the four rural areas of Uelzen, Wendland, Prignitz and the Altmark around Salzwedel.  Types of Lower German hall house  The three types of hall house are called after the number of rows of pillars which carry the roof construction. The oldest form, which would also have the lowest roof, was called a Zweist√§nderhaus because the whole construction rested on two rows of pillars (front to back) carrying beams across the centre. They were pillars and not posts because they rested on stones and were not set in holes in the ground as their predecessors had been. A typical house might have 14 rows of pillars, with a corresponding 14 beams, each of them being originally a single oak tree. Nothing else is load-bearing, although the half-timbered construction with infill does give some extra stability. The infill these days is likely to be brickwork, but was originally wattle and daub, covered with a lime mixture. The oldest house in Wendland of this construction is around 1611, but only about 10 are 17th century in origin, most of the others being 18th century. They are comparatively rare, as less than 80 remain in Wendland. The more recent form which became common throughout the 19th century is called in German Vierst√§nderhaus which means that the roof construction is carried by four rows of pillars carrying beams. This means that the central barn area is narrower than for Zweist√§nderh√§user but the two single storey sides are larger. The overall building will also be larger, and are sometimes three stories high, or have two stories with much larger hay lofts and storage above the barn. There is a third form which is called a Dreist√§nderhaus, with three rows of pillars. This looks like a two pillar-row house on one side, with lower eaves, and a four pillar-row house with higher eaves on the other. It also looks lopsided because the barn door is no longer central under the roof apex. This hybrid form can be found across all the eras but was commoner during the 18th century. It is commoner in Wendland than almost anywhere else across Northern Germany (although even here there are only 40 surviving examples), and there are two Wendland villages, Prie√üeck and P√ºggen, where it is the commonest form. It does not appear to be a transition between the two and the four pillar-row models but a genuine attempt to get the best of two different models, an experiment which ultimately did not make it through to the very end of the 19th century when almost the last hall houses were being built.  Present extent  Why only Wendland should retain the Rundling form, plus the Lower German Hall House, is not immediately clear, but will have more to do with the relative wealth of the cities to the north, which would have swallowed up the \\"primitive\\" Rundlinge and its \\"primitive\\" rural architecture over the centuries. It is less easy to see why Uelzen, Prignitz and Salzwedel should have so few existing Rundlinge, as they did have them as recently as the 1820‚Äì1850 series of enclosure maps, Verkoppelungskarten. Prignitz, Salzwedel and the Altmark were politically parts of Prussia, and Wendland and Uelzen parts of the Kingdom of Hannover at this time. We know that the Government of Prussia had become alarmed at the numbers of fires caused by putting an open fire in the same building as the hay loft and a thatched roof, as well as the animals. They had therefore issued a decree in the early 18th century forbidding the building of traditional hall houses, and requiring farmers to separate out the functions of cooking and storage. This seems to have led to different solutions in Prussia from those traditional to the wider area, favouring Querdielenh√§user or transverse farmhouses, with the barn entrance to the side. In the Altmark they also had the tradition of putting gatehouses across the fronts of their farmsteads, thus blocking the view of the large barn doors from the centre of the village green. It is however probably as much poverty as decrees that led farmers to \\"make do and mend\\" rather than demolish their old houses and build new ones in their stead. And Wendland has always been at the poor end of the scale. This has continued right up to the present day, with its unfortunate position as part of the old West Germany sticking out into the old East Germany, so that it was bound on three sides by an electric fence which was the barrier to the Communist East for most of the second half of the 20th century. Wendland has always somehow been passed by, right from the times of the early Christianisation, and even today it has no motorways, virtually no railways, very little industry, very little employment and a shrinking population. If it is known for anything today, it is known for its decades-long fight against the deposit of radioactive waste in Gorleben, a site chosen by the politicians of a generation ago precisely because so few people live there.  20th century  From the 1880s onwards began a time of greater prosperity in Germany, and this was reflected in Wendland too with the arrival of some industry. A few large brick buildings typical of the time called the Gr√ºnderzeit were built in the modern style, and were often faced sideways to the village green, but these were the exceptions. Most farmers had only enough spare to renovate their houses, occasionally replacing the half-timbering with brick, or tiling the outside to give better warmth inside. Most Rundlinge survived intact. Up to the Second World War, the small scale farming of areas such as the Wendland was still just sustainable, although the domestic flax industry had by then disappeared. Briefly in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Wendland became home to very many refugees from the east, but the increasing pull of the industrialised parts of the new Federal Germany led to many moving on. The subsequent division of Germany into East and West affected Wendland a great deal, as it became isolated to the north, east and south by the Inner German Border for almost 40 years until 1989. This development, whilst largely negative for the region, had two major positives. Firstly the rural isolation of the Rundling villages was not affected negatively by industry or motorways, and secondly Wendland became a second home for a large number of West Berliners, who were anxious about their position, surrounded as they were on all sides by an unfriendly state. It was largely Berliners who invested in the old property of the Wendland, which was cheap and spacious. They rescued whole villages from certain ruin. At the same time the local population, reflecting post-war prosperity, was embracing modernization, and pulling down old hall houses to replace them with far less sympathetic modern housing, which was cheaper to maintain and warmer in winter! This trend was noticed with alarm by many lovers of the old hall houses in their picturesque circular villages, and the Rundlingsverein was brought into existence in 1969 to educate the population to the potential loss of a heritage that had become unique not only in Germany but in the whole of Europe. It was those early pioneers that eventually stopped the old houses being demolished, thought through alternative uses for the buildings and supported the initiatives of the Denkmalpflege (the government agency for the protection of monuments in Germany) to preserve the cultural heritage of the Rundlinge and their hall houses.  Rundlinge today  The Rundling museum of Wendlandhof in L√ºbeln How many Rundlinge there are is a more difficult question to answer than one might think. Originally there were perhaps a thousand such villages created in the 12th and 13th centuries, perhaps 400 of which survived into the 19th century. In Hanoverian Wendland alone there is over 200 which were clearly still Rundlinge at the time of the Verkopplungskarten (a type of enclosure map, marking the ownership of land and property) in the early parts of the 19th century. Many had already succumbed to catastrophic fires, and been fully or partially rebuilt, not always as Rundlinge. Modernization has led to the destruction of many of the older hall houses, and their replacement by modern housing, sometimes but not always affecting the circular structure of the villages. At present the best guess is that about 80‚Äì100 of these 200 villages in Wendland are still recognizable as Rundlinge to an untrained eye, and of these about 30 are of sufficient interest to tourists to warrant developing a tourist plan. This is currently a major interest because of the so far successful attempt by the Samtgemeinde L√ºchow to have the Rundlinge recognized by the UNESCO as a part of their World Heritage portfolio. The Rundlingsverein, which has long supported the preservation of these unique villages for posterity, has recently put its weight behind the bid from the Samtgemeinde, and in a parallel action will take a structured analysis of all 200+ existing Rundlinge and former Rundlinge, to record how much has been retained, and what corrective action needs to be taken to preserve them.

ZooBank is an open access website intended to be the official International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) registry of zoological nomenclature. Any nomenclatural acts (e.g. publications that create or change a taxonomic name) need to be registered with ZooBank to be \\"officially\\" recognized by the ICZN Code of Nomenclature. Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) are used as the globally unique identifier for ZooBank registration entries. The ZooBank prototype was seeded with data from Index to Organism Names (http://www.organismnames.com), which was compiled from the scientific literature in Zoological Record now owned by Thomson Reuters.  History  ZooBank was officially proposed in 2005 by the executive secretary of ICZN. The registry was live on 10 August 2006 with 1.5 million species entered.Biodiverse MySpace? Online Encyclopedia To Name All Species The first ZooBank LSIDs were issued on 1 January 2008, precisely 250 years after 1 January 1758, which is the date defined by the ICZN Code as the official start of scientific zoological nomenclature. Chromis abyssus was the first species entered into the ZooBank system with a timestamp of 2008-01-01T00:00:02.  Contents  Four main types of data objects are stored in ZooBank. Nomenclatural acts are governed by the ICZN Code of Nomenclature, and are typically \\"original descriptions\\" of new scientific names, however other acts, such as emendations and lectotypifications, are also governed by the ICZN code and technically require registration by ZooBank. Publications include journal articles and other publications containing Nomenclatural Acts. Authors records the academic authorship of Nomenclatural Acts. Type Specimens record the biological type specimens of animals which are provisionally registered, until the bodies responsible for such types implement their own registries. In addition to those, periodicals which have published articles are also entities within the system, providing access to a list of \\"Nomenclatural Acts\\" published in the periodical over time.  Electronic publications  Traditionally, taxonomic data was published in journals or books. However, with the increase in electronic publications, the ICZN established new rules that include e-publications, especially electronic only publications. Such publications are now regulated by amendments of ICZN Articles 8, 9, 10, 21 and 78. Technically, nomenclatural acts that are published in electronic only papers are not recognized if they have not been registered with ZooBank and are considered as \\"non-existent\\".

AHRC was also tasked with fostering an environment in which ethical principles are applied in all matters related to assisted human reproduction, while supporting scientific advances that benefit Canadians. The agency was led by a President and governed by a Board of Directors. History In 1989, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney founded the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies.Nielson, Laura, \\"Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies, The Canadian Encyclopedia]. Commissioners spent four years examining assisted human reproduction (AHR) activities in Canada. They heard from 40,000 Canadians, including doctors, medical organizations, patients and other interested parties, before issuing their final report, \\"Proceed with Care,\\" in 1993.Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies, \\"Proceed With Care: Final Report\\", Ottawa: Minister of Government Services Canada, Ottawa, 1993. (Summary) The report called on the Government of Canada to ban activities such as payment for sperm or eggs, commercial surrogacy and human cloning. It also recommended the establishment of an independent regulatory body to govern permissible AHR activities. On March 29, 2004, Bill C-6, the Assisted Human Reproduction Act received Royal Assent and became law. Provisions of the Act come into force on the day fixed by order of the Governor in Council.

Life Robert Harris was born in Melbourne. He was educated in Doveton High School. He enlisted in the Australian Navy in 1968 during the Vietnam War. During the 1970s he spent time in a commune. He was married but separated from his wife in the 1980s with no children. He lived in Sydney in the later part of his life. Harris died in Summer Hill, New South Wales on 24 March 1993 of a heart attack. His obituary in The Sydney Morning Herald stated that \\"he followed his own poetic path with little regard for the niceties of a literary career.\\" A friend wrote \\"Robert Harris had only known two things in his short life: poverty and poetry. He knew poetry would get him, and it did.\\" Harris was involved in literary magazines as an author and as an editor. He worked as an editor for New Poetry magazine and for Overland magazine. Five books of his poetry were published. His manuscript papers are held at the Australian National Library. Themes and subject matter David Malouf wrote that Harris understands that \\"poetry is one of the last remaining activities in which reverence is paid, in which the holiness of things is recognised in a way that may be essential to the fullest expression of what we are.\\"Back Cover, Jane Interlinear and Other Poems Through his friendship with Sydney poet and singer Michael Driscoll, Harris became converted to charismatic Christianity, which informed the poems in A Cloud Passes Over, and later became a confirmed Anglican, which informed the poems in Jane, Interlinear. The device of material presented as a kind of translation bookmarked his efforts with Translations from the Albatross and Jane, Interlinear. It provided a mechanism for expanding the vocabulary and musicality of the pieces. Poems such as Do I think we could have won, Signs & Wonders and O'Hara show a longing for softness and a relief from despair in himself and others, an eye for the underdog. Events and localities often frame or stimulated his poetry, for example New York, Sydney and country New South Wales. Isaiah by Kerosene Lantern Light from The Cloud Passes Over has many of Harris' themes: the memory of a friend, the locality (a tent), the contrast of the mild and the nasty (heresy hunter), the book as a thing that demands response. In around 1990, he traveled to England to study Lady Jane Grey and visit the original locations. He became progressively more interested in using poetry cycles, seeing a tendency in Australian contemporary poetry towards safety or lack of ambition. He responded to criticism that he was over- ambitious with the acerbic poem High & Low from The Cloud Passes Over which begins with a reference from a New Testament verse Ephesians 1.3 \\"Do I reach to high,/ will the judgment which I come under/ be therefore greater?\\" but he is revealed to be reaching for an empty glass in a pub as a menial glass- collector. Cycles also gave Harris an opportunity to deal with less autobiographical material and less parochial or obscure subjects than in his vignette-like shorter poems as found in The cloud passes over. In his final book, these cycles were: * Seven Songs for Sydney (10 poems), concerning the Royal Australian Navy cruiser HMAS Sydney and its sinking in World War II. Harris had served, possibly in the troopship of the same name during the Vietnam War, and felt a strong sympathetic connection to the sailors. It has the dedication \\"This poem is dedicated to those who perished in Sydney, their families and shipmates.\\" It was performed at a poetry reading performance in 1987 at La Mama Theatre, produced by Barry Dickins. It was performed by Dickins in August 2008 for the ABC Radio Poetica program when the wreck of the cruiser was discovered. * Jane, Interlinear (30 poems), concerning Lady Jane Grey. Harris was attracted to her for her youth, innocence, religious convictions, and persecution. The Interlinear refers to a form of synchronized text layout used in some biblical publications, from which the layout form of many of the poems is taken in a way that emphasizes phrases, as well as the more obvious meaning. * After the Process (24 mostly unconnected poems), including ** Notations of N.Y.C. (5 poems) * Silver Buckle (12 poems) about sex and impending middle age. * Recorder Music (4 poems) is material from the Jane cycle which did not fit, or which came as a response. Appreciation In the article on Australia in The Oxford Guide to Contemporary World Literature Peter Craven says of Harris that he: Poet Jill Jones wrote(2005) concerning neglected masterpieces: Writer David Malouf is quoted in Harris' obituary:Poet's shining career cut short (Obituary), Sydney Morning Herald, 27 March 1993, p9 He is the subject of a poem by Tim Thorne, The Living Are Left with Imagined Lives, and also Et in Arcadia Ego. He is a subject of a poem in Weeping for Lost Babylon by Eric Beach. He is a subject in a poem The Ghost of John Forbes by Dorothy Hewett. Noting a poem by Robert Adamson ( Cornflowers - in memorium Robert Harris), a critic wrote in 1994 \\"Can the anthology of elegies for Robert Harris be far off?\\" His poems have been included in the New Oxford Book of Australian Verse (The Enthusiast, Riding over Belmore Park, Tambaroora Remembers), the Oxford Book of Australian Religious Verse (The Eagle), and Chapters into verse : poetry in English inspired by the Bible (Isaiah by Kerosene Lantern Light). His essay The Carriers Off of the Dead has been included in the Oxford Book of Australian Essays. Robert Adamson judges the Robert Harris Ulitarra Poetry Prize.

It is located just north of Mea Shearim. The name Beit Yisrael is taken from the verse in Ezekiel , in which Ezekiel prophesies to the hills and mountains of Israel, \\"I shall make numerous on you the people, the entire House of Israel; the cities will be reinhabited and the ruins will be rebuilt.\\" According to tradition, the neighborhood is built on the location on which the sacrificial remnants of the Second Temple were disposed. History Beit Yisrael was built in the 1880s as an extension of Mea Shearim; it was originally called \\"Mea Shearim HaHadasha\\" (, lit. the new Mea Shearim). A number of prominent community activists of the Old Yishuv, looking for a solution to the skyrocketing costs of living quarters in Mea Shearim, came up with the idea to purchase the adjacent plot of land, a dirty and infested area nicknamed \\"the pool\\" because of its severe drainage problems. Rabbi Aryeh Leib Dayan purchased the plot for a cheap price, after which they drained the water and began to build. The neighborhood book of regulations describes some of the difficulties of the time: Beit Yisrael originally consisted of one central street by the same name, which contained the main synagogue, with small alleyways branching off on which houses were built. Another main street, which connected the neighborhood to Mea Shearim, was built later and named for Rabbi Dayan. Two-story houses lined the roads, with spacious courtyards behind them and a shared well for every two houses. The inhabitants were originally poor people who could not afford housing in other neighborhoods, though many olim from across the globe settled there as well. By 1900, there were sixty houses and two synagogues. Throughout the years of Mandate Palestine, the neighborhood continued to grow, eventually expanding to the north. During the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war, from 1947-1949, Beit Yisrael was on the front lines, and from 1949 until 1967, it was situated right near the Armistice Line and the border with Jordan. On March 2, 2002, eleven people were killed and over 50 were injured in the Yeshivat Beit Yisrael massacre in the neighborhood, where people had gathered for a bar mitzvah celebration. Religious institutions The neighborhood's main synagogue, Beit Yaakov (), was established in 1887 using funds donated by a donor who wished to remain anonymous. The marble plaque, which can still be seen on the wall, relates some of the background of the donation: There has been much speculation as to the identity of this anonymous donor. A local legend relates that a wealthy resident often lent money to local businessmen. Once, after forgetting that one of his debtors, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Porush, the administrator of the cities charity fund, had already repaid his loan, he asked for payment. Rabbi Porush insisted that he had already paid, so they went to Rav Shmuel Salant. According to Jewish monetary law, in such a scenario the debtor must swear that he repaid the loan to the creditor. The debtor, even after swearing, and now absolved from paying, paid a second time. When the creditor discovered his error, he immediately went back to the debtor in order to return the money. Rabbi Porush refused the money, saying he doesn't want to take money which he made an oath over. Instead he donated the money to build Beit Yaakov. The Beit Yaakov synagogue also has a number of smaller rooms, known as shteiblach, in which minyanim can be found at almost any hour. According to the synagogue administration, more people pray there daily than in any other synagogue in Jerusalem, including the famed Zikhron Moshe shteiblach. The entire complex was refurbished and modernized in the last few years. To the west of the synagogue building is the Machane Yisrael Yeshiva for baalei teshuva (returnees to religious observance). Many other synagogues can be found in Beit Yisrael, owing to the many Jews of various ethnic backgrounds who preferred to pray according to their local custom, including Jews from Dagestan, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, and others. There are also many synagogues of various Hasidic sects, including Pinsk-Karlin, Lelov, Lubavitch, and Zvhil. Also located in Beit Yisrael is the Mir Yeshiva, the largest yeshiva in the world, boasting over 7,500 students.

Formerly just a collection of farms in a Scottish Highland Strath, the village of Strathpeffer developed and became a popular health resort (then the most northerly spa in Europe) in the Victorian era, when local spring waters were discovered to have health-giving properties. Opened by the Countess of Cromartie in 1881, the Pavilion provided entertainment in the form of dances, concerts, lectures etc. Famous speakers included suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and explorer Ernest Shackleton. During the First World War (1914-18), many of the large houses and hotels in Strathpeffer were requisitioned by the armed forces and the Pavilion was taken over by the US Navy and used as a hospital. After the War, the popularity of the spa declined and the Pavilion was used only as an occasional venue for events, until it was acquired by Harry McGhee's Highland Lass Estates and was completely restored and refurbished, re-opening in 1960 as a licensed dance hall and concert venue, becoming hugely popular, with people coming to the dances from all over the Highlands. The venue was even visited by the Beatles in January 1963 but, contrary to popular lore, they never actually performed at the Pavilion. Thereafter, the building was acquired by a large hotel group and was allowed to fall into disrepair, being used only occasionally for concerts and other events. Eventually, it was acquired by The Highland Council, who passed it on to the Scottish Historic Buildings Trust (SHBT). SHBT then masterminded a huge fund-raising and restoration project, with a view to restoring the much-altered building to its original Victorian splendour, with the addition of requisite modern facilities. The restoration was carried out in 2003-2004 by architects LDN and the Pavilion re-opened in autumn 2004. It was then a multi-purpose venue for the performing arts, dances, conferences, weddings and a variety of exhibitions, festivals and other events. The Pavilion returned to community ownership in 2019.

Italy is known for its generally very good health system and the very high life expectancy, low infant mortality, relatively healthy cuisine and diet, and healthcare system that is ranked 2nd according to World Health Organization and which has the third best medical performance worldwide. As with any developed country, Italy has adequate and sufficient water and food distribution, and levels of nutrition and sanitation are high. Water and Food Italy has a good and sufficient water supply, yet, especially due to droughts, common in the summer (notably in Southern Italy), water shortages can frequently occur. Italians consume a very high amount of mineral water, the highest compared to equivalent neighbours: in 1992, the average person in Italy drank 116 litres, compared to 105 in Belgium, 93 in Germany and 80 in France. According to studies, 18 million people in Italy annually are confronted with at least one slight water shortage, and 18% of Italian families have been recorded as having irregular distribution patterns. Some water distribution is also uneven, and can be explained by economic factors; for example, people in Lombardy, Italy's richest region, drink nine times more bottled water than Campania, one of the country's poorest. A problem which often presents itself regarding drinking water is water pollution and the presence of harmful purifying chemicals and/or herbicides, which can cause several health problems. According to a decree issued by the state, the maximum presence of herbicides or similar materials in Italy drinking water is 0.5 Œºg per litre. Italy's nutritious and generally healthy cuisine ensures that Italians are well-nourished and eat good food. The relatively recent addition of several drugs to meats has meant that controls have increased from 4,000 in 1988 to 56,831 in 1991. Radiation Being a relatively warm and sunny country, Italians are often exposed to direct radiation from the sun (ultraviolet radiation), which, if not protected from sun cream or block, can create carcinogenic skin diseases, such as skin cancer. Despite this, the greatest risk from exposure to radiation is found indoors. Life expectancy and mortality Italy has one of the highest life expectancies in the world. Italy's high average varies greatly by regions. In the more affluent north, the life expectancy at birth in 1990 for a man was lower than in Italy's south (73.3 compared to 74.2). For a woman, the average is higher in the north than in the south (80.6 compared to 79.8). Central Italy has the highest average, with 74.7 for men and 81.0 for women. In 2003, the average national life expectancy at birth for a woman was 78~84, and for a man 71~77. By 2009, this average had increased to 77.26 for men, and 83.33 for women. Italy also has a very low rate of infant mortality, that of 5.51 out of 1000 people, the 185th lowest in the world. From 1970 to 1989, the death rate went down dramatically, from 11 and 10.3 for men and women, to 8.3 and 6.7. In 2015 Liguria had the highest cancer mortality of any region in Europe, at 377 per 100,000 population. Vaccination The Italian vaccination system is complex because services and decisions are delivered by 21 separate regional authorities creates many variations. There is a National committee on immunizations that updates the national recommended immunization schedule, with input from the ministry of health representatives, regional health authorities, national institute of health, and other scientific societies. Regions may add more scheduled vaccinations, but cannot exempt citizens from nationally mandated or recommended ones. A nationwide plan for eliminating measles and rubella began in 2001. Childhood vaccinations included in national schedules are free for all Italian children and foreign children who live in the country. Estimated coverage for the required three doses of HBV-Hib-IPV vaccines is at least 95% of 2 year olds. Influenza is the only nationally necessary vaccine for adults, and is administered by general practitioners. Italy has a national vaccine injury compensation program. One evaluation of vaccine coverage in 2010, which covered the 2008 birth cohort, showed a slight decline in immunization insurance coverage rates of diphtheria, hepatitis B, polio, and tetanus after those specific vaccinations had been made mandatory. However, vaccination levels continued to pass the Italian government's goal of 95% outreach. Aiming to integrate immunization strategies across the country and equitize access to disease prevention, the Italian Ministry of Health issued the National Immunization Prevention Plan (Piano Nazionale Prevenzione Vaccinale) in 2012 which proposed an institutional \\"lifecourse\\" approach to vaccination. HPV vaccine coverage increased, and pneumococcal vaccine and meningococcal C vaccines had a positive public reception. However, both infant vaccine coverage rates and influenza immunization in the elderly have been decreasing. A 2015 government plan in Italy aimed to boost vaccination rates and introduce a series of new vaccines, and triggered protests among public health professionals. Partially in response to the statistic that less than 86% of Italian children receive the measles shot, the National Vaccination Plan for 2016‚Äì18 (PNPV) increased vaccination requirements. Chickenpox shots would be required for newborns. Under this plan, government spending on vaccines would double to ‚Ç¨620 million annually, and children could be barred from attending school without proving vaccination. Although these implementations would make Italy a European frontrunner in vaccination, some experts questioned the need for several of the vaccines, and some physicians worried about the potential punishment they may face if they do not comply with the proposed regulations. There were 5,000 cases of measles in 2017, up from 870 in 2016, 29% of all those in the European Union. The law compelling children to have 10 vaccinations in order to enroll at state schools came into effect in March 2018 but in August 2018 the Five Star Movement pushed legislation through the Italian Senate abolishing it. It has not yet passed the Chamber of Deputies but parents do not now have to provide schools with a doctor's note to show their children have been vaccinated. Smoking Smoking in Italy has decreased greatly in the past decades for men, yet women have had a less definitive pattern. From a country where in 1966 a 68.5% average of the male population smoked, this had gone down to a ~37% average in 1991. For women, it increased from ~15% for women in 1966, to ~16.5%, notably in the centre, where it has gone up from 15% to 20.1%.

Primarily a right fielder, he played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball, from 1958 until 1962, for the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs. He was in the White Sox starting lineup for three of the six games in the 1959 World Series. The 1959 pennant-winning season was by far his best in the majors. It included 210 of his 241 career at-bats, as McAnany, a contact hitter with little power, batted .276 for the White Sox with no home runs but just 26 strikeouts. A native of Los Angeles, he attended Loyola High School and the University of Southern California there. He made his professional debut in 1955 with the Waterloo White Hawks. Called up to the majors in late 1958, McAnany made his MLB debut on September 19, 1958 in Kansas City, pinch-hitting for White Sox pitcher Early Wynn in the fifth inning. He struck out against Ralph Terry and ended up a hitless 0-for-13 for the '58 season. He then had his breakout season in 1959, becoming an integral part of a Sox team that captured the American League pennant for the first time since 1919. After the Sox won Game 1 of the World Series with the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-0, McAnany started in right field for Game 2 against Dodger left-handed pitcher Johnny Podres. He went 0-for-3 as the Sox, after taking a 2-0 lead, lost the game 4-3. In baseball's 1960 expansion draft, the new Los Angeles Angels franchise claimed McAnany with the 49th pick. He was then traded on April 1, 1961 to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for Lou Johnson. Hampered by injury, he had 16 at-bats as a Cub and 12 in the minors before retiring in 1963. McAnany was mentioned in Jane Leavy's 2010 book The Last Boy: Mickey Mantle. In it is a story in which McAnany was hit by a Mickey Mantle line drive during the 1959 season and stated, \\"I think I have a hole in my chest.\\" According to a Chicago Tribune column of Oct. 21, 2005 by Mike Downey, McAnany, employed by an insurance agency in Southern California, returned to Chicago to participate in a \\"Turn Back the Clock\\" weekend sponsored by the White Sox in June 2005 when the Los Angeles Dodgers played at Comiskey Park for the first time since the '59 World Series. Four months later, the White Sox would return to the World Series for the first time in 46 years. McAnany died December 16, 2015.

Paulet St Andrew St John, 8th Baron St John of Bletso and 5th Baronet (1711‚Äì1714) was an 18th-century English aristocrat who succeeded as a peer, and as a baronet, but died in infancy. Sir St Andrew St John, 4th Baronet, his father, was heir presumptive to his second cousin, Paulet St John, 3rd Earl of Bolingbroke, both of whom died in 1711; Paulet St John was born posthumously and so succeeded at birth to the family's ancient barony (but not the more recently created earldom, to which he was not in remainder) as well as to his father's baronetcy. He died an infant at the age of three, being succeeded as 9th Baron by his uncle, William St John. St John family Insignia of a Baronet Such quick succession in the family titles created confusion and so sources differ in the numbering of the subsequent Barons St John: The fourth Baron St John was created Earl of Bolingbroke; when the Long Parliament was called, both the aged Earl and his eldest son were summoned, the latter by a writ of acceleration of the now-subsidiary title of Baron St John of Bletso. Normally, writs of acceleration end in the reunion of titles when the father dies; but in this case the son (Oliver St John, 5th Baron St John of Bletso) died two years later, fighting for the Parliamentarians at the Battle of Edgehill, and his father died in 1646, and was succeeded by his second son's son. Whilst there is no question that Oliver St John succeeded as Baron St John of Bletso ‚Äì he spoke and voted as a Peer in the House of Lords ‚Äì the numbering of the successive Barons St John has been obfuscated by differing sources. Although publications such as Debrett's Peerage and the Complete Peerage record Oliver St John as one of these Barons St John, the family prefers not to, down to the present Baron St John, by ignoring the writ of acceleration granted to Oliver St John (died 23 October 1642); however, the register of the House of Lords now records Paulet St John, 7th Baron St John as the 3rd Earl of Bolingbroke.

Plot  The year is 2238 and the most popular sport in the world is the Military Olympics, in which gladiators in various combat aircraft fight robot drones and each other for victory.  Gameplay  The player controls a low-flying combat aircraft in a series of combat arenas filled with enemy robot drones. He starts with the titular \\"Thunderstrike\\" fighter by default, but may choose between five different models, all differing in flight characteristics. The player must defend his base installations (red pyramids) from attack by various robot drones; if they are all destroyed the game is lost. Meanwhile, he must search and destroy the robot spawn bases (blue/red bunkers); when these are all destroyed the round is won and the player progresses to the next arena.

It ran from Kidlington railway station parallel with the Cherwell Valley Line north to Shipton-on-Cherwell, where it turned west through towards . History Built for the 8th Duke of Marlborough, the line opened on 19 May 1890 and was privately owned until 1897 when it became part of the Great Western Railway, although the line was operated by Great Western Railway from its inception. In 1929 was opened, primarily to serve the Oxford and Shipton Cement Company limestone quarry and cement works. The last train ran on 27 February 1954 and track lifting was completed in January 1958. Train services The original service was four trains each way between Oxford and Blenheim and Woodstock. By around 1910, this had become ten trains a day and it remained at this level for many years. By 1938, the passenger service had been pruned back to nine trains a day, not all trains running through to Oxford. The number of trains serving the station was cut in the late 1930s, and again in 1952 down to only six trains a day.Searle, 1983, p. 129. These cuts in the frequency of trains along the Woodstock branch line produced two-hour waits at Kidlington for a connection. Closure British Railways closed the branch line in March 1954 with the last train adorned with a wreath. The track was lifted in 1958.

It has featured aircraft from the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, as well as civil aviation displays. Since its formation in 2008, the festival claims to have entertained over nine million people. History The first Bournemouth Air Festival was held from 28‚Äì31 August 2008, attracting over 750,001 visitors.  2009  Its second year, 2009, was held from 20‚Äì23 August and attendance almost doubled to an estimated 1,344,000 people.

On Saturday 20 August, at approximately 13:50 BST, one of the Red Arrows, Red Four, crashed in a field, approximately 1 km near to Bournemouth Airport. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, was killed in the accident, when returning to the airport after a display at the Air Festival. An inquest heard Flt Lt Egging may have succumbed to G-force impairment before attempting to correct his course in the moments before the impact. The coroner in Bournemouth recorded a verdict of accidental death. The court heard a service inquiry, led by Wing Cdr Mark Rodden, concluded \\"A-loc\\" - almost loss of consciousness due to G-force - was the likely cause of the crash. Memorial Sculpture and Relocation after Clifftop Landslide: Prior to the 2012 Bournemouth Air Festival, a memorial sculpture was unveiled in a private ceremony at the top of the East Cliff at Bournemouth Beach. The sculpture is of three glass Red Arrows planes and stainless steel contrails. In August 2017, the memorial sculpture was relocated further along the East Cliff, at the top of the Zig-Zag, after a landslide on 24 April 2016. Rubble fell down the 30m-high (100 ft) rock face in East Cliff, partially engulfing the carriages of an Edwardian funicular railway - known as East Cliff Lift and a crushing a block of toilets. There were no reported injuries as a result of the landslide. Although undamaged in the landslide, the Jon Egging memorial was close to the edge and was sealed off from public view.  2013  The 2013 show took place between Thursday 29 August and Sunday 1 September.
