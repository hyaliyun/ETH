Marie Rucki at Studio Ber√ßot in 1990  History  Suzanne Ber√ßot, painter and fashion illustrator, created the Cours Ber√ßot in 1954 on the advice of her colleagues at the magazine Jardin des Modes. Drawing was a rigorous and necessary discipline in the heyday of Haute couture, both for designing and for representing the garment. After several years of close collaboration, in 1971, Madame Ber√ßot entrusted the management of the Establishment to Marie Rucki, a former student who was active in the fashion world. She renamed it Studio Ber√ßot. The decline of Haute Couture and the rise of ready-to-wear during the 1970s developed a large number of new professional activities in the field of fashion. Marie Rucki was highly aware of the constant changes in trends, and organized the curriculum to match the expansion of fashion design. Studio Ber√ßot has become a key pool of talent dedicated to the designers/creators of the 1980s, to the artistic directors in large luxury houses of the 1990s, and to the fashion accessory market in the 2000s when mass retailing internationalized the industry.  Curriculum  Reflecting the environment for which it prepares its students, Studio Ber√ßot deliberately focuses its training on a three-year period to strengthen students' involvement in the work they have to produce. = Year 1 = By experimenting with the basics of artistic creation and a selection of techniques that are representative of the Fashion Industry, the first year tests students' capacity to position themselves. At the end of the year a jury of professors assesses students' aptitude to continue with the program. = Year 2 = Students are individually mentored in their own fashion project. Over time, with collections developed in close collaboration with teachers and external instructors, a personal dossier is developed which will constitute a future professional canvassing tool.  Fashion show  The fashion show is considered to be the emblematic event in fashion, and therefore the definitive way of learning to carry a project through to the end. Consequently, a year- end fashion show can be organized, widely followed by the professional community.  Twinning  Two students are selected each year to further their studies at the Academy of Arts University in San Francisco. = Year 3 = Depending on students' skills evaluations at the end of the first 2 years, internships are programmed within the Studio Ber√ßot network. During this last year, students receive personalized mentoring and support by their teachers while entering the professional arena.  Subjects taught  * Cultural: history of art and costumes, visits to museums and exhibitions, film screenings * Research: nude drawing, fashion sketches, colors, trends * Techniques: the study of volumes in clothes (cutting, sewing), prototyping (pattern design), embellishment of materials, pattern and textile design. Studio Ber√ßot does not uses a grading system, preferring a weekly assessment of each individual in a group, in the form of rigorous evaluations. The Studio Ber√ßot certificate is recognized by the French government and is approved by the Rectorate of Paris.  Registration  Applicants are seen individually with their personal dossier. The interview enables professors to examine future students' positioning and personality, to validate their registration. Considering the maturity required for the program, it is recommended that applicants hold a Baccalaureate degree (or foreign equivalent). All classes are taught in French, very good knowledge of oral French is essential.

His position of choice was fullback. Hay-MacKenzie did not play in any test matches as New Zealand did not play their first until 1903. While Hay- MacKenzie made his two All Black appearances at fullback, he was equally custom to play in the wing and centre positions.  Career  Hay-MacKenzie was educated at Oamaru High School and then Milton High School (now known as Tokomairiro High School). He played for the Dunedin club and gained 18 caps for the Otago province between 1894 and 1900. He then moved north to Auckland and joined the Grafton club. Between 1901 and 1910 Hay-MacKenzie played 23 times for the Auckland provincial side. He was selected for the national side, the All Blacks in 1901. He played in two games, the first, a warm-up match against Wellington. The second, against New South Wales. Both matches were played at Athletic Park, Wellington. The games were won 24-5 and 20-3 respectively. Four years later, Hay-MacKenzie played in the North against South Island match, where the North Island team won 26-0. Subsequently, the entire backline apart from Hay-MacKenzie was selected for the team that would go on to be known as the Original All Blacks. Although initially Hay-MacKenzie was included in the squad, he lost out due to the selectors re-choosing the party.  Personal and death  Hay-MacKenzie was on the Dunedin club committee in 1899. He was a life member of the Grafton club. He lived in Wellington in his later life and played bowls for the Kelburn club where he appeared in the national championships on more than one occasion.

The neighborhood is located southwest of central Schoten, and lies near the border with the Antwerp district of Merksem. To the south of the Deuzeld neighborhood lies the Albert Canal, which connects Antwerp with Liege. The neighborhood is geographically separated from the rest of Schoten by several nature domains located along the path of the A102 highway reservation stroke. The Heilig Hart (Sacred Heart) church at the Deuzeldlaan  History  For a long time, the Deuzeld formed a small hamlet containing only a few homes, situated between Merksem and Schoten, as can be seen on, for example, the Ferraris map, made by the Austrian general Joseph de Ferraris on the orders of emperor Joseph II. With the advent of the industrial revolution however in the 19th century, and the construction of the Kempische Vaart (1847) and later the Albert Canal (1946), the latter replacing the former, the neighborhood quickly grew in numbers. In the late 19th century, a first church was built at the Kruiningenstraat. In 1961, work commenced on the new Heilig Hart church, which was opened the following year. Originally, a castle called the Cogelshof could be found at the Deuzeldlaan, which was eventually demolished because of its bad material condition. The castle was replaced in the 1970s by the Cogelspark and the Cogelshof service centre, built in glass and concrete, which was renovated in 2011 and is used by the OCMW. In 2008, the Deuzeldlaan, the main street of the neighborhood, was completely reconstructed, adding green elements and creating more room for cyclists. Plans exist to built a new bridge over the Albert Canal in the neighborhood, called the Kruiningenbrug, which would only be used by pedestrians and cyclists.

Olga Segler (July 31, 1881 ‚Äì September 26, 1961) was a German woman who died of injuries as a result of crossing the Berlin Wall. According to the Centre for Contemporary History (ZZF), Segler was both one of the earliest victims of the Berlin Wall and the oldest victim, aged 80-years-old at the time of her death. Additionally, Segler was one of only eight women who was either killed at the Berlin wall, or died as a result of crossing it, among the total of at least 140 victims. Background Olga Segler was born on July 31, 1881, in Prischt, now in Ukraine, into an ethnic German family. No other official documents providing information about her life exist, but by 1961 at the age of 80-years-old lived in Berlin, on the second floor (by European standards, third floor by North American standards) of Bernauer Stra√üe 34. The building itself was located in the district of Mitte in East Berlin, part of East Germany, however it lied directly along the border with the district of Wedding in West Berlin, part of West Germany. The sidewalk and street adjacent to the building were situated in Wedding, where Segler's daughter was living. On August 13, 1961, East Germany began construction of the Berlin Wall without warning, sealing the border between Mitte and Wedding, effectively separating Segler and her daughter. Residents of Bernauer Stra√üe were placed under constant observation by East German authorities, who deemed it a \\"focal point of border breaches\\" with buildings along the street being barricaded and their hallways patrolled by watch guards. Death On September 24, 1961, just over a month later, East German authorities began a forced evacuation of Bernauer Stra√üe residents. People on the West Berlin side expected the residents to make attempts to flee and lined the street outside Segler's window, including Segler's daughter. The following day Segler jumped from her window into a life net which was prepared by the West Berlin firefighters. However, as a result of her jump, she suffered a back injury and was taken by ambulance to the nearby Lazarus Hospital. Segler later died of a heart attack caused by over- excitement from the jump. Her funeral took place at the municipal cemetery in Berlin-Reinickendorf. berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de: Biography of Olga Segler Aftermath In 1962, a memorial was erected at outside Bernauer Stra√üe 34 to commemorate Segler's death.chronik-der-mauer.de: Memorial of Olga Segler in front of her residence on Bernauer_Stra√üe In September 1982, the district office of Wedding established a memorial stone adjacent to Swinem√ºnder Stra√üe, to commemorate Olga Segler, along with other victims of the Berlin Wall, most of whom died on Bernauer Stra√üe; these also included Ida Siekmann, Hans-Dieter Wesa, Rudolf Urban, Bernd L√ºnser, Ernst Mundt, Otfried Reck, Dietmar Schulz and, still unknown in 1982, the victims Dieter Brandes and Michael-Horst Schmidt.chronik-der-mauer.de: Memorial stone to Olga Segler and other victims of the Berlin Wall on Bernauer_Stra√üeberlin.de: Gesamtkonzept Berliner Mauer: Texte und Materialien.

She is voiced by Michaela Dietz. She is a \\"Gem,\\" a fictional alien being that exists as a magical gemstone projecting a holographic body, and one of the four \\"Crystal Gems\\", a group of Gems who defend Earth. Her story arcs throughout the series mostly focus on overcoming her low self-esteem, mostly caused by her feeling inferior to other Gems.  Development and casting  Amethyst is voiced by Michaela Dietz. Amethyst's look was redesigned between the pilot episode of Steven Universe and the first regular episode.  Character  She is one of the three Crystal Gems (with Pearl and Garnet), who, along with the titular Steven Universe, form the main characters of the series. She is more hedonistic and carefree than the other Gems, and behaves as more of an older sister figure to Steven. She often encourages Steven to enjoy himself and is the only Gem to engage in eating for fun. From the gemstone in her chest, she can summon a purple whip. Unlike Pearl and Garnet, who were allies of Steven's mother Rose Quartz in the ancient Gem war, Amethyst joined the Crystal Gems after the war ended. She was created on Earth to be one of many Amethyst soldiers in the Gem empire's army. However, she was created smaller and weaker than other Amethysts, and long after the others had departed, leaving her isolated for many years before being taken in by Rose Quartz. Michaela Dietz has spoken about how her experience as an adoptee informs her performance of Amethyst in this respect. Her character arc centers on coming to accept the burden of responsibility and overcoming her poor self-image arising from her smaller stature and \\"defective\\" creation. During the fourth season, she meets the other Amethyst soldiers who were created alongside her, and their support and affection for her become a source of emotional validation.

It was built in 1862 by George Goldring. It is also known as Old Rainworth Fort and Rainworth Head Station Store. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Rainworth store is a single-storeyed, rectangular stone structure built in 1862 for Jesse Gregson as a storehouse on the Rainworth Station in the Diamantina district of Queensland. It was built adjacent to Rainworth Creek, close to the boundary of Rainworth and Cairdbeign and is now part of the Old Rainworth Fort Tourist Complex on Wealwandangie Road, about from Springsure. In 1844 Ludwig Leichhardt explored an area to the east of what is now the township of Springsure, naming the Expedition Range, Albinia Downs and Comet Creek. In 1846 Major Thomas Mitchell travelled through the area and in 1847 Leichhardt attempted to explore the area again, but was forced back by floodwaters. While the Leichhardt Pastoral District was officially opened to settlement on 10 January 1854, it was only after William Landsborough explored the Springsure area in 1858 that pastoralists began to take up runs in the vicinity. Following a reconnaissance into the Leichhardt Pastoral District in late 1860 by Queensland's Surveyor-General Augustus Charles Gregory and William Kellman, the flat-topped hill south of present day Springsure was named Rainworth Hill. Gregory subsequently took up a number of leases in the district, paying the rent on Wallaroo, Norwood, Emu Plains, Osmondthorpe and Yarra No.2 in March 1861. Gregory did not hold these leases for long, and in September 1862 the rents were paid by lessees Jesse Gregson and Alexander and William Busby, who called the combined runs Rainworth Station. While travelling out to Sydney from England in the mid-1850s, one of Jesse Gregson's fellow passengers was Alexander Busby, who invited Gregson to visit him at Llangollen Station near Cassilis. Failing to find work in Sydney, Gregson took up Busby's offer and soon gained employment at Collaroy, a nearby property, where he learnt stock management and was appointed head overseer by 1858. In May 1860, as Busby's partner, he overlanded 5,000 sheep to a new station in Queensland, which he named Rainworth, near the future town of Springsure. By June 1861 Jesse Gregson was living on the property as manager and was in partnership with Alex and William Busby as lessees. Gregson described the run in his diaries: > I made my head station and called it Rainworth after the hill on the > opposite side of the creek. It was a lovely tract of open country. A little > creek fed by a stream flowed southerly to join Cona Creek. There was sparse > timber, a stunted Downs box in patches all around, which without diminishing > the open character of the country added to its beauty. Down the valley were > clumps of tea tree scrub here and there. Opposite was the strikingly > picturesque hill which Gregory had named Rainworth and which some seven or > eight hundred feet above the level of the adjacent country. Behind our camp > was another isolate hill called Mt Cassilis, the distance between the two > hills being perhaps one and a half miles. Rainworth Head Station was established on the Norwood East run, just north of the boundary with Cairdbeign Station and west/northwest of Rainworth Hill. At that time the Cairdbeign-Wealandangie Road to Springsure passed through the property, and the head station was established near where this road crossed Rainworth Creek. The first head station buildings were constructed of timber. On 17 October 1861, a few months after Gregson had taken up occupancy at Rainworth, the local Kari people attacked the nearby pastoral property of Cullin-la-ringo. In the Cullin-la-ringo attack 19 people, including women and children, were killed. Of the 22 people on Cullin-la-Ringo that day three survived: a station hand and two shepherds. Edward Kenny, one of the surviving shepherds, rode to Jesse Gregson at Rainworth to raise the alarm and to seek help. Within days the former owner of Cullin-la-ringo, PE MacDonald, accompanied by a troop of Native Mounted Police, led reprisal attacks against the Kari people. Construction began on a stone store at Rainworth in 1862, following the Cullin-la-ringo massacre. The store was built out of stone in order to reduce threats of fire and to act as a safe haven during an Aboriginal raid. The builder was an Englishman, George Goldring, who with his son had arrived at Rainworth in 1862, and was employed initially as a bookkeeper. He left Rainworth in 1868. To construct the store, Goldring burned lime, made bricks and collected basalt boulders. He bound the walls with a mortar mix of sand, lime and a holding element obtained from crushing calcified basalt. It is believed that the roof was clad with galvanised iron, which was amongst the earliest use of this material in the district. The Rainworth Store is the only known stone building erected by Golding in Queensland. By 1867 Gregson had established the necessary plant and buildings at Rainworth. In that year he entered into a new seven year partnership with the Busbys and commenced fencing of Rainworth land using wire, which he claimed was the first use of wire fencing in the district. Jesse Gregson contributed significantly to the development of the Springsure district. He served as postmaster for the district until January 1864, when a post office was opened at the town of Springsure, surveyed in 1863. He was a member of the Springsure Road Trust, praised in 1864 by the Engineer of Roads in the Northern District, Frederick Byerley, for completing the work on their section of the Rockhampton to Springsure road within cost. At Cairdbeign on 4 January 1865, a meeting of prominent landholders Archibald Buchanan, Robert Patton, William Thomson, Peter McIntosh and Jesse Gregson decided to form a local agricultural society to improve the quality of livestock.. Gregson was the inaugural Secretary of the Society. In 1874 Alexander Busby, who was on the board of the Australian Agricultural Company, one of the largest pastoral and mining companies in Australia, recommended Gregson for the position of Company Superintendent. Gregson left Rainworth to take up this position, which he held from 1875 to 1905. After the Gregson family left Rainworth in 1874, the property was offered for sale but there were no buyers and James Nesbit was appointed the manager. From 1862 the partners had held a mortgage with The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney and the lease was transferred to the Bank on 1 June 1877. Government land policy at this period encouraged the resumption of large pastoral leaseholds for closer subdivision, but existing lessees could apply for pre-emptive selection as freehold, to protect improvements such as head station homesteads and shearing sheds. In November 1877 the Rainworth Head Station blocks, on Portions 1 and 1A, parish of Rainworth, county of Denison, were surveyed as pre-emptive selections. At this time improvements on portion 1A, which contained the head station buildings, totalled and comprised a ten-roomed house of wood/weatherboard and shingles ('W & S'), valued at ; a kitchen building with bath and saddle rooms, valued at ; a stone store with cellars, granaries, meat rooms and dairy, valued at ; a number of slab and iron huts valued at ; yards and of 2 and 3 rail fencing, valued at ; a water race and garden valued at ; and of 6 wire fencing valued at . The property was still operating as a sheep station, with lamb folds established close to the head station buildings. Deeds of grant for portion 1A (containing the head station buildings) and portion 1 were issued to the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney in September 1878 and April 1880 respectively. In May 1888 title was transferred to Francis Hamilton Beadon Turner, who also acquired the lease of the consolidated Rainworth holding. It appears that until 1919 the lessees of Rainworth Station also owned the freehold of the Rainworth Head Station. Title to the head station freehold passed to Dalgety & Company in 1904, then to Francis Bayntun Starky (grazier of Sydney) and Prosper Charles Trebeck (Stock & Station Agent of Sydney) in 1912. Alexander McLaughlin (grazier of Burnside near Springsure) acquired the Rainworth Head Station freehold in 1919, and the property has been owned by his descendants ever since. It appears that from this time the freehold was known as Old Rainworth. In 1940 Alexander McLaughlin divided his holdings amongst his children. Two of his granddaughters inherited Burnside and in 1973 purchased Old Rainworth. The McLaughlin sisters, concerned about the deterioration of the old stone store and wanting to restore and conserve its heritage, established a Committee for the Preservation of Old Rainworth Fort. Stonemason Gino Sandrin was employed in 1981 to restore the building. He used original stones that he shaped, using cement to help hold them in place. In April 1980 the National Trust Journal described the Old Rainworth Stone Store. Constructed of local material, the bluestone walls were held together with a mortar of clay and the external walls with a mix of clay and limestone. It was single-storeyed with a loft and a cellar. The building appeared to have been constructed in two stages, the inner rectangular section first with the surrounding outer walls added later. It was rectangular in plan with a perimeter verandah. Originally the shorter sides of the rectangle were stone, however, weathering had caused these external walls to collapse. Windows and doors were timber framed and suspended floors were of cypress with massive log bearers. A timber framed calico partition created a main room. The stone store measured approximately with the stone walls about in thickness. The roof was corrugated iron. In 1987 the Old Cairdbeign homestead, constructed in the 1870s, was demolished and re-erected at Old Rainworth, which was being developed as an historical tourist complex. Springsure timber worker Robert Young re-built the homestead between 18 July and 31 October 1987. Archibald Buchanan was the first owner of Cairdbeign and his was the first homestead built on Rainworth Creek. By 1881 the head station had been moved about southeast of Rainworth and a new large slab house of seven rooms erected, using some timber from a barn at the former head station on the creek. Some of these slabs with joggles cut for holding benches can still be seen in the old Cairdbeign homestead at the Rainworth historical tourist complex. The former Cairdbeign School also has been relocated to Old Rainworth. Old Rainworth now functions as a tourist facility and has a special association for tourists and visiting school children.  Museum  The museum complex contains the storehouse in its original condition, the relocated Cairdbeign homestead and the original school building from the 1800s. The museum contains many period pieces and artefacts of local importance. According to the current caretakers of the fort, Colleen McLaughlin and her sister Lorna Smith, the future of the historic site is unsure:  Description  The Old Rainworth Stone Store is located on Burnside approximately by road from Springsure. It is accessed by travelling south along the Dawson Highway towards Rolleston for approximately then taking the Wealwandangie Road for a further . The Old Rainworth Stone Store has undergone partial reconstruction. It is a single-storey structure with a corrugated iron broken hipped roof with a U-shaped verandah encircling the entire western elevation and part of the southern and northern elevations. Constructed of locally quarried basalt, the stones are mortared with a pise of calcified basalt that comes from beneath the black soils of the district The building contains six rooms, a cellar and a loft. The unlined walls vary in thickness from . The main room on the western side of the building is accessed through double timber doors made of diagonal boards, and which have original fittings. The main room has a timber floor and windows. The timber frame of an interior partition wall with a connecting doorway remains. From the main room a set of timber stairs lead to the loft. The treads are narrow () and there are no risers. A recent handrail of debarked bush timber has been installed for safety purposes. The loft has a timber floor. The encircling verandah has stone flooring and a set of timber stairs lead from the western side down to a cellar. The cellar walls and floor are of stone and several vents are set into the walls. The eastern section of the building comprises three rooms. The walls and flooring of each of the end rooms are of stone while the centre room has an earthen floor with an exterior wall of horizontal slab timbers. To the south west of the building are the remains of what appears to have been an arbor; this is constructed of debarked bush timbers. Immediately to the west of this is the site of the former Rainworth Homestead. No surface remains are apparent.  Heritage listing  Old Rainworth Stone Store was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. Neither Cairdbeign Homestead nor the Cairdbeign School are considered to be of state-level cultural heritage significance. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Old Rainworth Stone Store illustrates the pattern of early non-indigenous settlement in Queensland, where the development of pastoral properties preceded agriculture and the establishment of towns. Because of the distance of Rainworth Station from a major settlement, lessee Jesse Gregson had the stone building erected in 1862 to store and protect supplies brought twice a year from Rockhampton. Its construction illustrates the need on pastoral properties for the provision of adequate storage facilities in harsh climatic conditions remote from the source of supply. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Rainworth Stone Store is a rare surviving mid-19th century stone building constructed for the purpose of storing provisions for lengthy periods. In addition, comparatively few stores on pastoral properties were constructed in stone in Queensland at this period. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Rainworth Stone Store is a rare surviving mid-19th century stone structure in Queensland, which has the potential, through physical investigation and documentary research, to reveal important information about the design, form and function of stone buildings of this period, way of life on a pastoral property in a remote area, and about the people who erected such buildings. Archaeological deposits associated with the former homestead have the potential to contribute information on the lifeways of an operative pastoral property of the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Rainworth Stone Store remains substantially intact and is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a fortified store on a remote and early pastoral property. These characteristics include the use of traditional European building techniques combined with local materials with inherent insulation qualities. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Rainworth Stone Store is an asset valued by the community as one of the earliest surviving buildings in the area and for its connections with the past. Forming part of a tourist attraction, Rainworth Stone Store is recognised as a significant part of the history of the district.

Rinaldo served as a close confidante to Pope Boniface VIII before the latter was elected as pontiff and is known for attempting to secure the rehabilitation of the Knights Templar. His beatification received formal confirmation on 18 August 1852 from Pope Pius IX after the latter approved his local 'cultus' - or popular and enduring devotion. Life Rinaldo da Concorezzo was born to nobles in Milan in 1245. In his adolescence he completed his studies in Bologna and began to teach canon law in Lodi from October 1286. The Bishop of Lodi - in May 1287 - summoned him for legal expertise and Rinaldo later gained the academic title of \\"Magister\\" in 1295. In 1289 he entered the staff of the Vice Chancellor of the Roman Curia Cardinal Pietro Peregrosso and he became an heir of the cardinal in the latter's will after he died in 1295. Rinaldo became a private aide and later the chaplain to Cardinal Benedetto Caetani who became Pope Boniface VIII in 1294. Boniface VIII appointed him as the Bishop of Vicenza on 13 October 1296 to the disappointment of the locals who - in defiance - chose their own appointee but the pontiff's decision soon prevailed and Rinaldo received his episcopal consecration and was installed as bishop. The French monarch Charles of Valois - as well as the pope - called on Bishop Rinaldo and asked him to travel to Florence to support the 'blacks' faction. He later went as the Vicar of Romagna in 1302 and was later made the province's rector. He finished that term in 1305 and was almost killed on one occasion. The death of Boniface VIII came as a slight blow to the bishop though Pope Benedict XI appointed him on 19 November 1303 as the Archbishop of Ravenna-Cervia and Rinaldo was installed in his new archdiocese in October 1305. He convoked a provincial council in 1307 and then resumed the old practice of visiting all parishes contained within the archdiocese. He held a second in 1309 and another in 1311 all in Ravenna. He visited northern Italian cities in tumult to reconcile them with the empire's monarch Henry VII. In 1314 he called the fourth in Argenta in order to restore discipline to priests and liturgical matters. He called for the fifth and last in Bologna in 1317. He attempted to defend and secure the rehabilitation of the Knights Templar at the Council of Ravenna and opposed the decision of Pope Clement V to dissolve and condemn them. Archbishop Rinaldo was also a friend of Dante Alighieri. Rinaldo's health began to deteriorate in 1314 to the point where he settled in an Argenta castle and ran his archdiocese through his vicars. He died in that castle on 18 August 1321 and was interred in the Ravenna Cathedral; he was exhumed in 1566 and found incorrupt with his long beard still intact. Beatification The ratification of his local 'cultus' - or popular and enduring devotion - allowed for Pope Pius IX to approve his beatification on 18 August 1852.

Overview = Brazil and the Tropicalia movement = Os Mutantes performing in 1969. Latin America proved a particularly fertile ground for psychedelic rock. The Brazilian psychedelic rock group Os Mutantes formed in 1966, although little known outside Brazil at the time (due to the fact that they recorded in Portuguese), they have since accrued a substantial international cult following.John Bush, \\"Os Mutantes\\", Allmusic. Retrieved 2 February 2010. Os Mutantes also played a central role in the short-lived but revolutionary Brazilian aesthetic movement Tropic√°lia, also known as 'Tropicalismo' (Tropicalism), an anti-authoritarian artistic reaction to the repressive military junta that seized power in Brazil in 1964. Encompassing visual art, theatre, poetry and music, Tropic√°lia combined the popular and the avant-garde, and fused traditional Brazilian culture with foreign influences, including contemporary developments in British and American psychedelic music, and above all the music of The Beatles.Gilberto Gil, quoted in Brazil, Tropicalist Revolution, Yves Billon & Dominique Dreyfus (Cannes TV/Histoire/Les Films du Village/Mezzo/TV Cultura, 2001) As well as recording their own material, Os Mutantes collaborated with other key figures in the burgeoning Tropicalist movement, including singer-songwriter Gilberto Gil, whom they backed on Gil's second LP.Tropicalia - Revolution in Sound, BBC World Service, 15 February 2015 The musical manifesto of the Tropicalist movement was the landmark 1968 collaborative LP Tropic√°lia: ou Panis et Circencis (\\"Tropicalia: or Bread and Circuses\\") which brought together the talents of Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Tom Z√© and Gal Costa, with arrangements by avant-garde composer-arranger Rogerio Duprat (who had studied with Pierre Boulez) and lyrical contributions from poet Torquato Neto. The album's group cover photograph depicted the collective holding a variety of objects and images, in a deliberate reference to the cover of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The collective also performed a number of concert \\"happenings\\" which were intended to both involve and provoke audiences, and these reportedly had a similar effect on Brazilian audiences to that experienced by folk purists who witnessed Bob Dylan's early \\"electric\\" concerts - the performers sported long hair, wore outlandish psychedelic costumes, used electric guitars and amplification, and played at full volume. Brazil's military junta was becoming increasingly suspicious of the anarchic anti-establishment attitudes of the Tropicalistas, who also found themselves at odds with the nationalistic student left-wing, who favoured traditional Brazilian musical forms, and rejected what they saw as the corrupting influence of Western pop music. In September 1968 Caetano Veloso gave two tumultuous performances at the third annual International Popular Song Festival in Rio, where the audience included a large contingent of left-wing students who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalistas. When Veloso (backed by Os Mutantes) performed in the first round of the Festival's song competition on 12 September, he was initially greeted with enthusiastic applause, but the situation soon turned ugly. Dressed in a shiny green plastic suit, festooned with wires and necklaces strung with teeth, Veloso provoked the students with his sensual movements and startling new psychedelic music. He was bombarded by insults, jeers and boos from the students, who became even more incensed when American pop singer John Dandurand made a surprise appearance during the song. The ideological conflict climaxed three days later when Veloso returned for the second round of the competition on 15 September, at which he performed a new song entitled \\"Prohibido a Prohibir\\" (\\"It is Forbidden to Forbid\\"), which was recorded live and later released as single. The students began hissing and booing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, and when he began his performance, his overtly sexual stage moves and the experimental music of Os Mutantes provoked an outpouring of anger - the audience began booing so loudly stood that Veloso could barely be heard, and a large number then stood and turned their backs on the performers, prompting Os Mutantes to turn their backs on the audience. As the song continued, the students pelted the stage with fruit, vegetables, eggs, paper balls and anything else that came hand. Veloso stopped playing and launched into a furious monologue, in which he excoriated the students for their conservatism. After being joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support, Veloso finished his diatribe by telling the students \\"... if you are the same in politics as you are in aesthetics, we‚Äôre done for!\\" and declaring he was withdrawing from the competition. He then deliberately finished the song out of tune, angrily shouted \\"Enough!\\" and walked off arm-in-arm with Gil and Os Mutantes.Victoria Langland (2006), \\"Il est Interdit d‚ÄôInterdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil\\", Estudios Interdisciplinarios de Am√©rica Latina y el Caribe, Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006) Tropic√°lia had a major effect on the Brazilian music scene during its brief heyday (1967‚Äì68), and the main performers made regular appearances on Brazilian stage, television and radio, but the movement was abruptly shut down in early 1969, following a provocative December 1968 TV performance which parodied the Brazilian national anthem. Gil and Veloso were both arrested in February 1969 on the orders of the military junta - they were held in prison for three months without charge or trial, and after a further four months under house arrest, they were released on condition that they leave the country, and they spent the next few years in exile in the UK. Others in the Tropicalist movement were treated even more harshly - several were arrested and tortured, or forced to undergo psychiatric 'treatment'. = Mexico, Chile and Argentina = Pescado Rabioso performing in a TV show in Buenos Aires, 1972. In the late 1960s, a wave of Mexican rock, heavily influenced by psychedelia and funk emerged, especially in northern border Mexican states, in particular, Tijuana, Baja California. Among the most recognized bands from this \\"Chicano Wave\\" (Onda Chicana in Spanish) were Three Souls in my Mind, Love Army, El RitualG. M. Joseph and T. J.

The Festival Rock y Ruedas de Av√°ndaro was a historic Mexican rock festival held on September 11‚Äì12, 1971, on the shores of Lake Av√°ndaro near the Av√°ndaro Golf Club, in the central State of Mexico. The festival, took place at the height of La Onda and celebrated life, youth, ecology, music, peace and free love, has been compared to the American Woodstock festival for its psychedelic music, counterculture imagery and artwork, and open drug use. In Chile from 1967 to 1973, between the ending of the government of President Frei Montalva and the government of President Allende, a cultural movement was born from a few Chilean bands that emerged playing a unique fusion of folkloric music with heavy psychedelic influences. The 1967 release of Los Mac's album Kaleidoscope Men (1967) inspired bands such as Los Jaivas and Los Blops, the latter going on to collaborate with the iconic Chilean singer-songwriter Victor Jara on his 1971 album El derecho de vivir en paz.B. Keen and K. Haynes, A History of Latin America (Andover: Cengage Learning, 8th ed., 2008), , p. 592. Also Aguaturbia produced psychedelic rock within the Chilean late 60s early 70s context with a female vocalist Denise Corales. Piedra Roja was a music festival in Chile noted as an expression of the hippie counterculture in South America.2011 website on Piedra Roja I was held between 10 and 12 October 1970 in the eastern area of Santiago. Among others Aguaturbia, Los Blops, L√°grima Seca and Los Jaivas played in the festival.

Overview The Bee Gees, one of the most commercially successful survivors of the psychedelic era, performing on Dutch television in 1968 Although only a few singles gained recognition outside the region, the thriving Australian and New Zealand rock scenes that formed in wake of Beatlemania produced a wealth of inventive and original psychedelic pop and rock music. Much of this was strongly influenced by British psychedelia, since many bands included first-generation British (and European) immigrants, and bands such as The Twilights, whose members were British immigrants, were able to keep up to date on current musical developments, thanks to regular \\"care packages\\" of the latest singles and albums, tapes and cassettes of radio broadcasts, and even the latest Mod fashions, sent to them by family and friends back in the UK.Ian McFarlane, The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock & Pop (Allen & Unwin, 1999), pp. 652‚Äì654. After gaining local success, a number of these groups returned to the UK further their musical careers.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1341‚Äì3. The most internationally successful Australian pop-rock band of this period were The Easybeats, formed in Sydney in 1964 by a group of English, Scottish and Dutch immigrants, who scored a string of local hits in Australia and became hugely popular there before travelling to the UK. They recorded their international hit \\"Friday on My Mind\\" (1966) in London and remained there for their forays into psychedelic-tinged pop until they disbanded in 1970.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 349‚Äì50. A similar path was pursued by the Bee Gees, formed in Brisbane, but whose first album Bee Gees' 1st (1967), was recorded in London, and gave them three major hit singles and contained folk, rock and psychedelic elements, heavily influenced by the Beatles.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 85‚Äì6. Two bands that formed in Adelaide in the mid-1960s also figured prominently in Australian psychedelic pop/rock. The Masters Apprentices started out as a gritty R&B; band in the style of the early Rolling Stones and the Pretty Things, but they rapidly absorbed the changes in music spearheaded by The Beatles, and during 1967 they released several accomplished psychedelic singles ‚Äì \\"Wars or Hands of Time\\" (the B-side of their 1966 debut single \\"Undecided\\") is generally regarded as the first Australian pop single to address the Vietnam War; their second single \\"Buried and Dead\\" (1967), showed the unmistakable influence of the nascent \\"Raga rock\\" genre, and their third single, the psych-pop classic \\"Living In A Child's Dream\\", became a major national hit and was voted \\"Single of the Year\\" by the readers of the Australian pop magazine Go-Set. The group also performed at one of the first psychedelic \\"happenings\\" in Australia, the \\"Living In A Child's Dream Ball\\", staged on 14 October 1967 at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, which featured a full psychedelic light-show, with liquid slide projections, smoke machines and mirror balls, with the band wheeled to the stage inside a specially-constructed giant die.Jim Keays, His Master's Voice (Allen & Unwin, 1999), p. 86. All the groups' early singles tracks were penned by rhythm guitarist Mick Bower, who was sadly forced to quit the music scene for health reasons soon after \\"Living In A Child's Dream\\" was released, but after a period of upheaval, the band was able to continue with new members, scoring another Australian psych-pop hit in late 1967 with the classic Brian Cadd song \\"Elevator Driver\\".Ian McFarlane, The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock & Pop (Allen & Unwin, 1999), pp. 395‚Äì397. The Twilights, also formed in Adelaide and likewise became nationwide pop stars in the mid-1960s before making the trip to London. Here they recorded a series of minor hits, and absorbing the psychedelic scene, before returning home in mid-1967, where they performed the entire Sgt Pepper's album live on stage some weeks before its official release in Australia. This was followed by the release of their psychedelic 1968 concept album Once upon a Twilight.T. Rawlings, Then, Now and Rare British Beat 1960‚Äì1969 (London: Omnibus Press, 2002), , p. 191. Although The Easybeats were the only Australian band working in the psychedelic style to score a major international hit, many other Australian bands scored local or national hits with singles that were strongly influenced by psychedelic trends. This included the cult Brisbane-based group The Wild Cherries, led by guitarist Lobby Loyde, whose 1967 single \\"Krome Plated Yabby\\"/That's Life\\" combined influences from R&B;, soul and psychedelia, and the single's driving B-side, \\"That's Life\\" is believed to be the first Australian pop single to employ phasing in its production.Ian McFarlane, The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock & Pop (Allen & Unwin, 1999), pp. 679‚Äì680. The most successful New Zealand band of the period, The La De Das, produced the psychedelic pop concept album The Happy Prince (1968), based on the Oscar Wilde children's classic, but failed to break through in Britain and the wider world.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 635‚Äì6. Although British influences were predominant, a number of progressive Sydney- based groups such as Tamam Shud and Tully produced music that combined influences from Eastern mystical philosophy, avant-garde jazz and American psychedelic groups like The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. Both bands also regularly collaborated with the experimental Sydney film and light-show collective Ubu, and Tully were also notable for being the first Australian group to buy and use a Moog synthesiser, as well as performing as the house band in the original Australian stage production of Hair, which premiered in Sydney in 1969.Ian McFarlane, The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock & Pop (Allen & Unwin, 1999), pp. 624‚Äì626 and 649‚Äì650. Australian psychedelic music in the late 1960s peaked with the two singles by Melbourne singer Russell Morris. His 1969 solo debut \\"The Real Thing\\" (penned by mid-Sixties pop star Johnny Young) broke new ground in Australian popular music, both for its lavish production by Ian Meldrum and John L. Sayers ‚Äì it was reputedly the most expensive Australian single ever produced up to that time ‚Äì and for its running time of almost seven minutes, unprecedented for an Australian pop single. It became a national number one hit in Australia, where it charted for 23 weeks, and also went to number one on local charts in New York, Houston and Chicago. It was followed by \\"Part Three Into Paper Walls\\" (co-written by Young and Morris), which was deliberately crafted as a virtual \\"sequel\\" to \\"The Real Thing\\", featured similarly dazzling production, was just over seven minutes long, and gave Morris his second consecutive number one hit in Australia.Ian McFarlane, The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock & Pop (Allen & Unwin, 1999), p. 432. Other Australian classic rock bands later had moderate success within the realm. The Little River Band, whose 1979 hit \\"Cool Change\\" combined psychedelia with elements of pop, jazz, soft rock, and progressive rock. Midnight Oil began their career in the forays of new wave and post-punk, utilizing a style akin to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Diamond Dogs to create a droning final note on their 1981 record 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Hoodoo Gurus incorporated science-fiction into their bizarre college rock concept albums, and to an extent, the droning distorted guitars utilized by AC/DC incorporate and develop upon psychedelic themes. Through to the 1990s, Australian acts such as The Vines presented a new era of music, a fusion between the psychedelic pop of the 1960s and the more modern rock stylings of 1990s-era bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam. The neo-psychedelic rock scene has been heavily pioneered by Australian psychedelic and garage rock acts. One-man act Tame Impala, the brainchild of Kevin Parker, led the charge with their 2012 breakthrough hit Elephant, which reached #8 on Billboard's Alternative and received widespread radio play. This has led to their overwhelming demand as a music festival headliner, Parker being backed live onstage by members of Perth native psych-rock outfit Pond. Hiatus Kaiyote, led by singer Nai Palm, emerged around the same time, offering a psychedelic sound influenced by R&B; and hip- hop, creating music laced with reverb and complicated by bizarre rhythmic syncopation. King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard has also been a titan in the Melbourne psychedelic scene, releasing upwards of 15 studio albums and creating Flightless Records. Their sound is sonically unfettered, drawing from genres as eclectic and diverse as garage rock, hard rock and heavy metal, thrash metal (on Infest the Rats' Nest), Indian classical music, acoustic music (their 2015 record, Paper M√¢ch√© Dream Balloon, was recorded in a barn), microtonal music (Flying Microtonal Banana), boogie rock (demonstrated on Fishing for Fishies), indie rock, raga rock, blues rock, surf rock, jazz fusion, progressive rock, art rock and punk rock. The slow burn success of King Gizzard, and the appeal of their high-energy live concerts, has helped to launch the careers of Flightless acts such as The Murlocs, Stonefield, and Tropical Fuck Storm. Other important and emerging acts in the scene include Courtney Barnett, who has herself developed a record label and a significant following; Psychedelic Porn Crumpets, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever, Bananagun, GUM, and Wolfmother are amongst the other rock bands to emerge in this scene.

She was politically engaged during the build up to German reunification, but in November 1991 resigned, sidelined and disillusioned, from what had by then become the Party of Democratic Socialism, Since then she been formally unaffiliated politically, but very far from uninterested. She has been a committed feminist through most of her career, and was the director of the Paula Panke Women's Centre (\\"Frauenzentrum Paula Panke e.V.\\") in Berlin-Pankow between 1998 and 2009. Life Helga Obuchoff was born in Praschnitz a mid- sized town in the Zichenau region of what had become East Prussia following the frontier changes agreed and implemented by the governments of Germany and the Soviet Union four years earlier, in 1939. Her father had volunteered for army service in 1939, and was promoted by the end of the war to the rank of a junior officer. After the ethnic cleansing of 1944/45 the Obuchoffs and their three children ended up living with relatives in the Harz region, before moving on and settling in Genthin, a small industrial town near Magdeburg, where Helga Obuchoff grew up. The entire central portion of what had been Germany was administered as the Soviet occupation zone after 1945, and her father engaged in the politics of the time and place, becoming by 1956 the first secretary in the Genthin district of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), created in 1946 and, after October 1949, the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. As a young mother in a war-ravaged country with a desperate shortage of working age males, Obuchoff's mother was able to benefit from education and other practical career support that would not have been available to German women of earlier generations, and later became the Operations Manager at Genthin's large sugar refinery. By the time she was old enough to attend secondary school, the education system had been reconfigured. Between 1950 and 1958 Obuchoff attended the Polytechnic Secondary School (Polytechnische Oberschule / POS) in Wernigerode and then, when the family relocated, moved on to the POS in Genthin. Between 1958 and 1962 she attended Genthin's well respected Extended Secondary School (\\"Erweiterte allgemeinbildende polytechnische Oberschule\\" / EOS) which was where, in 1962, she passed her School Final Exams (Abitur), opening the way to university level education. However, her immediate next step, in 1962/63, was a training in Magdeburg as a draftswoman for the construction sector. It was only to be expected that, as the daughter of a dedicated party official, Helga Obuchoff had been a member of the party's youth wing, the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\" / FDJ) since 1958: in 1963 she became one of the by now one and a half million members of the country's ruling SED (party). In 1963 she enrolled at Berlin's Humboldt University where she studied History and Art history, concluding her undergraduate studies in 1968 with a history degree. After this she worked between 1968 and 1974 as a researcher at the Party Central Committee's Academy for Social Sciences in Berlin, holding a teaching chair in history. From 1974 to 1975, and again between 1978 and 1990, she held a post as a researcher at the International Politics and Economics Institute (\\"Institut f√ºr Internationale Politik und Wirtschaft\\" / IPW) in East Berlin. Between 1975 and 1978 she combined her roles in Berlin with her work as a researcher at the International Peace Institute (\\"Internationales Institut f√ºr Frieden\\") in Vienna, where the focus of her work was on the peace movement. However, in 1979 it was from the IPW in Berlin that she received her doctorate for work on socialist and democratic movements and the peace movement in Western Europe and the USA (\\"...soziale und demokratische Bewegungen sowie √ºber die Friedensbewegung in Westeuropa und den USA \\"), subjects on which as an established researcher at the Institute she was also able to act as an advisor to the political establishment. She was also able to apply herself to contemporary social movements in her study of the German Federal Republic (West Germany), such as the \\"new political platforms in the struggle against nuclear power\\" among which she identified students, women, gays and lesbians. 1989 was a year of increasing street protests in East Germany, mirrored by a loss of self-confidence within the party leadership which reflected uncertainty over the extent to which any traditional hard-line government response to the protestors would be supported by Mikhail Gorbachev, whose advocacy of greater openness had actually encouraged political discussion in East Germany. Underlying the political tensions was the financial bankruptcy of the state which was forcing the government to solicit additional funding from West Germany. In June 1989 Adler was a member of an East German delegation headed up by Egon Krenz for an exploratory meeting with Oskar Lafontaine. The meeting was important because Krenz and LaFontaine were seen as potential future leaders of their countries at a time when Erich Honnecker was well past retirement age and Helmut Kohl had already been in power for eight years. LaFontaine occupied a position on the political left within (for most of the time) the West German political establishment, while there were hopes that Krenz might be more open to new ideas than the existing East German geruntocracy. At a time when few dared (or, from the position of the East Germany political establishment, wished) to contemplate reunification, good personal relations between LaFontaine and Krenz nevertheless offered the prospect of closer future relations between East and West Germany. Adler later recalled their meeting, at which LaFontaine had politely but firmly criticised the recent so-called Tiananmen Square Massacre and condemned the falsification of election results in East Germany. Krenz initially responded expansively and positively, but then appeared to withdraw his earlier comments after receiving fresh instructions from the leadership in Berlin. The breach of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the subsequent realisation that Soviet troops in East Germany had no orders to intervene in order to suppress popular dissent, appeared to rule out a rerun in Berlin of the 1968 Prague Spring or of East Germany's own sad experiences back in 1953. This triggered a series of events which presaged political change and which, as matters turned out, culminated in German reunification, formally in October 1990. There were those who thought the survival of East Germany's ruling SED (party) in doubt. At the end of 1989 Helga Adler was one of those who took a lead in insisting that the old party could and must be reformed in order to preserve socialist values through an uncertain future, as part of which she took a lead in establishing what one source defines as the \\"Initiative Movement\\" (\\"Initiativbewegung\\") which was part of the process leading to the emergence of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which as the discredited authoritarianism of the German Democratic Republic crumbled, could evolve into something better able to operate under democratic structures. Between March 1990 and November 1991 Helga Adler served as a member of the PDS party executive (\\"Parteivorstand\\"). Within the leadership team, reflecting her years of academic research, she headed up the Commission on Foreign Policy, Pressure Groups and Labour Associations. In February and March 1991 Helga Adler also served as spokesperson for the party executive. Nevertheless, in November 1991 she resigned from all her party offices, also resigning her party membership. She complained of a monolithic approach by the new party leadership under Gregor Gysi, that left insufficient room for discussion, even though he was keen, for external consumption, to present the party as something colourful, diverse, feminine, punky and youthful (\\"... als etwas Buntes, Vielf√§ltiges, Weibliches, Punkiges, Junges\\"). Several of the party's \\"more progressive\\" comrades resigned at the same time, apparently for broadly the same reasons. From December 1991 till the start of 1993 Adler worked as a researcher in \\"Netzwerk Wissenschaft\\" in Berlin. Between 1992 and 1999 she was a member of the executive board with the Marburg based Association of Democratic Scientists and Scholars (\\"Bund demokratischer Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler\\"), a left-leaning think tank / pressure group. In 1997 she accepted the directorship of the Paula Panke Women's Centre (\\"Frauenzentrum Paula Panke e.V.\\") in Berlin-Pankow, running the centre with energy and commitment till 2008 or 2009. She also, in 1999, became spokeswoman for the \\"Berlin Women's Network\\" (\\"Berliner FrauenNetzwerk\\"). Since 2011 Adler has represented The Left (party) in the Berlin-Pankow local council, although formally she remains unaffiliated politically.

The Navasard month has had 30 days which started on 11 August and ended on 9 September. For ancient Armenians, the first day of Navasard (11 August) has been a social gatherings, festivals and celebrations day throughout history. The Navasardian god in Armenian mythology was considered the protector of the crops and the feeder of the hungry. His statue is currently standing in Bagavan, which is today considered a sanctuary to Pagans.  History  = General history of the first month = The first month of the year was considered the modern August and was called Navasard by Armenians. Likewise start-of-year positions affected economic and cultural capitals adding difficulties to certain trading deals, especially ones done in wintertime. Therefore, after the end of the century XVI (approximately around 1582), it was internationally decided to consider January as the first month of a year, considered as the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian calendar was introduced to the people by the pope of the time Gregory XIII. Even though this decision was made internationally, traditional and old calendars are still being used in countries in the Middle and Near Easts (Iran, Afghanistan, other Arab countries). = Navasard history = The word Navasard is composed of \\"nav\\" meaning new and \\"sard\\" meaning year in Armenian, directly translating it to \\"New Year\\". It was later adopted to Parthian-Persian known as ‚ÄúNawruz‚Äù. Navasard month was also considered the last month of summer and was referred to as the \\"introduction of the golden autumn\\". Throughout the Navasardian days; the Armenian lands would reach to a prosperity peak, especially the grapefruits, pears, peaches and watermelons. Armenian scholar Mardiros Ananikian emphasizes the identical nature of Newroz and the Armenian traditional New Year, Navasard, noting that it was only in the 11th century that Navasard came to be celebrated in late summer rather than in early spring. He states that the Newroz - Navasard ‚Äúwas an agricultural celebration connected with commemoration of the dead [‚Ä¶] and aiming at the increase of the rain and the harvests.‚Äù The great center of Armenian Navasard, Ananikian points out, was Bagavan, the center of fire worship.  Celebrations  The Navasardian festivals were considered the biggest celebrations of the year. The celebrations used to start from the start of the Navasard month and lasted a week. Armenian families used to serve their best feasts during lunch and suppertime, having very big numbers of dining guests ranging from family to friends. They also hung stockings on their doors and impatiently expected drops of gifts put in them, as a tradition nowadays done too. The representative Armenian Gods of the Navasardian celebrations are the Astghik, Vahagn and Anahit gods.  Celebration locations  In Ancient Armenia, the Navasardian celebrations carried a cultural significance and to which participated all the representatives of the nation. The celebrations were initially done at Bagavan, but then they were relocated to the Ashtishat region. The celebrations also included the worship of water and rivers, therefore they chose these two regions to be also located at the shores of the Aradzani (now known as the Murat River). = Ceremony = On the day of the ceremonies, the region of Bagavan would be decorated in many colorful decorations, the king would be present as well as a big part of the army, up to 120,000 in number. According to ancient book descriptions, colorful tents set up on the shore of Murat are seen, the golden tent would always be the king's, the most beautiful of the tents usually belonged to the elite of the nation. Most of the people spent their times under big trees' shadows to hide away from the sun while they watched the celebrations and performances. Throughout the day, doves and deer would be sacrificed in the name of the gods. Usually the horns of the deer were painted colorfully. There also was set up a big bonfire at nighttime where kids and young adults would try to jump over and around it to scare and drive away bad spirits. The celebrating people would bring their first set of harvest of the year to share with others. Horseback riding races were done, as well as deer racing. The let go hundreds of doves into the air for good luck. Dancing, singing, intellectual and athletic competitive games were a big part of the celebrations, where competitors would try to impress the ones they admire in the audience. = Organized games = In Ashtishat, games similar to the current well-known Olympic games were organized to choose the best athlete in a bundle of performed games. While the athletes competed, poets and instrumentalists merged and performed their own music and lyrics, as well as painters drew the event in various methods, accordingly to their point of view. A water festival, referred to as Vardavar, also takes place, where everyone drenched each other with water using different types of containers a bucket. The Vardavar festival is still done every year all over Armenia.

It was built in 1998. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 April 2004.  History  The Lilyvale Stand Monument was constructed in 1998 by a group of dismissed mine workers from the Gordonstone Coal Mine (later renamed by Rio Tinto to Kestral Coal Mine). Following their dismissal, the mine workers commenced a protest line in early October 1997, which was to continue for 22 months, until August 1999, becoming Australia's longest running black coal dispute. The Gordonstone Coal Mine, an underground coal mine located approximately north- east of Emerald, commenced operations in 1992. The life of the mine was thought to be about 25 years, with the project being undertaken as a joint venture by ARCO (an American oil company), Mitsui (a Japanese coal trader) and Australian company MLC. ARCO was the senior partner with 80% ownership. At the time, over $500 million was invested in the project. By 1996-97, total raw coal produced at Gordonstone Coal Mine was 4.4 million tonnes, breaking world production records for an underground coal mine. Shortly after the federal Workplace Relations Act 1996 became law in mid-1997, 312 miner workers at the Gordonstone Coal Mine were dismissed, as the miners were not interested in accepting the company's direction that mine workers surrender conditions in their certified Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA). The 312 mine workers, members of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), resisted the company's attempts for them to agree to new terms, considering them unacceptable. The new agreements were products of the Workplace Relations Act, which established Australian Workplace Agreements as individual contracts between employer and employee instead of collective bargaining through Enterprise Bargaining Agreements. Considerable industrial trouble has resulted from enforcement of this provision. By September 1997, two employees had accepted individual contracts, with the other 310 opting to remain with the EBA. With negotiations faltering, ARCO made the decision, on 1 October 1997, to retrench the entire production and engineering workforce of 312 employees. The mine workers subsequently set up a protest line on 6 October 1997. The protestors continued a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week protest that was to last for 22 months, becoming Australia's longest black coal industry dispute. ARCO had kept on a management team of over 100 and commenced recruiting a new workforce. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) ordered that the company give preference to former workers. The company refused to reopen the mine on those terms. The Gordonstone Coal Mine sat idle and in February 1998 the AIRC found that the dismissals had been unfair and ordered ARCO to pay compensation. The workers were awarded Australia's largest unfair dismissal ruling, leading to a payout of $4.6 million to 282 of the retrenched employees who brought applications to the AIRC. In October 1998, companies wholly owned by Rio Tinto Limited negotiated to purchase the mine. The intention of Rio Tinto was to recommence mining operations utilising a new workforce not connected to the CFMEU. The CFMEU argued that Rio Tinto should re-engage the entire workforce that had previously been dismissed by ARCO, with proceedings commencing in the AIRC to obtain such a result. Rio Tinto claimed that the dispute was one between the CFMEU and Gordonstone Coal Management Pty Ltd, and that it was not involved. The ruling was made that Rio Tinto should be made a party to proceedings. In the meantime, the protest line continued. When Rio Tinto Limited acquired the mine, the numbers on the protest line increased. It was during protracted legal actions that the members of the protest line decided that a reminder of its struggle was in order and set about designing and building a monument. The construction of the monument also served to assist the protestors in overcoming what was increasingly a frustrating and tedious daily existence as the legal battle associated with the retrenchments was being carried out in the AIRC and the Federal and High Courts. Members of the protest line gathered the materials for the monument, including stones and petrified wood, from the surrounding area. Concrete required for mortar was donated to the protest group. Construction of the wall took approximately four months and was completed by November 1998. A ceremony to bless it was organised, to be followed by a day rally in Emerald. Initially, the local Roman Catholic priest was approached to undertake the blessing; however, he declined as the congregation was divided in its opinion over the Gordonstone mine issue. Eventually, the Captain of the Salvation Army, Steven Metcher, agreed to perform the blessing. The Salvation Army, particularly Captain Metcher, had over the previous year, assisted with the counselling of many families who had been affected by events at the mine. The wall was officially blessed on 22 November 1998 with speeches being made by representatives of workers throughout Australia. With the contract of purchase completed on 10 February 1999, Rio Tinto took over the control of the mine and immediately reopened it using a \\"scab\\" workforce (a derogatory term given to a person or employee willing to cross a picket line). This action aggravated the protest line and through the assistance of families, friends and associated groups and Unions, the numbers on the Lilyvale Stand (as it became known) increased once again. The protest line attempted to stop the non-union workforce entering or leaving the mine site - resulting in over 280 people being arrested over the next four months, including Labor MLA Jim Pearce, a former coal miner. On 10 August 1999, the members of the Lilyvale Stand decided to remove the picket line, following a Supreme Court of Queensland injunction preventing the protesters from stopping workers entering or leaving the mine, which had been renamed by Rio Tinto from Gordonstone Coal Mine to Kestral Coal Pty Ltd. It is estimated that over 5000 people, including mine workers from Tasmania, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, visited the picket line throughout the 22 month protest.  Description  The Lilyvale Stand Monument is a wall addressing both the Lilyvale Road (Gregory Mine Road) to the north and Kestral Coal Access Mine Road to the east. The wall is approximately six metres along both the northern and eastern sides. It is approximately high and wide. The wall is constructed predominantly of large stone blocks concreted together, with a large face stone, placed at the intersection of the wall lengths, addressing the Gregory Mine Road. The face stone contains spaces for four plaques. Some pieces of petrified timber have also been used in the construction of the wall. The Lilyvale Stand Monument is situated approximately three kilometres away from the Kestral coal mine.  Heritage listing  Lilyvale Stand Monument was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 April 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Lilyvale Stand Monument, constructed in 1998, is significant as a physical reminder of Australia's longest running dispute in the black coal industry with a protest line that continued uninterrupted for a total of 22 months, from October 1997 until August 1999. It demonstrates the pattern of Queensland's industrial history whereby Unions and workers resist the implementation of industrial legislation which they consider unfavourable to them. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Lilyvale Stand Monument is also significant as it was constructed during the days of the protest line by members of the Lilyvale Stand, from materials obtained from the general area, rather than as a retrospective tribute to the protest line members. Strike memorials are uncommon in Queensland and those built on site during the dispute are particularly rare. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Lilyvale Stand Monument is significant for its strong social significance, particularly for its association with the workers from the Gordonstone Coal Mine, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, and the families, friends and supporters of the mine workers who constructed it, as a representation of their determination to fight a retrenchment decision that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission later ruled to be a case of unfair dismissal.

He was the only son of Sir Thomas Dunlop Wallace, of Craigie, Ayrshire, and his first wife, Eglantine Maxwell. Sir Thomas had been born John Dunlop and adopted the name and style of Baronet Wallace on inheriting the Craigie estate of his grandfather Sir Thomas Wallace, 4th Baronet. John Alexander Wallace joined the British Army in 1787 as an ensign in the newly raised 75th (Highland) Regiment of Foot. He served with the regiment in India in 1789, became lieutenant in 1790, and took part in Cornwallis's operations against Sultan Tippoo in 1791‚Äì2, including the siege of Seringapatam in 1792. He acted as aide-de-camp to Colonel Maxwell, who commanded the left wing of the army. In 1796 he obtained a company in the 58th Regiment of Foot and returned to England to join it. He went with the 58th to the Mediterranean in 1798, was present at the capture of Minorca, and in the campaign of 1801 in Egypt. The 58th formed part of the reserve forces under Lt-General Moore, and was very hotly engaged in the Battle of Alexandria. It came home in 1802. Wallace was promoted major on 9 July 1803, and obtained a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 11th Foot on 28 August 1804. At the end of 1805 he was transferred to the 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) to command a newly raised second battalion, which was posted to the Peninsular in 1809. There he joined the first battalion of the 88th, which had suffered in the Talavera campaign, and restored it to be one of the finest corps in the army. It greatly distinguished itself at the Battle of Busaco, where it was on the left of the third division. When the French had gained the ridge and seemed to have cut the army in two, a charge made by the 88th, with one wing of the 45th Foot, drove them down headlong. Wellington, riding up, said, ‚ÄòWallace, I never saw a more gallant charge than that just made by your regiment,‚Äô and made special reference to it in his despatch. Picton, who was with another part of his division at the time, gave Wallace the credit of ‚Äòthat brilliant exploit.‚Äô He commanded the 88th at the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro, and was again particularly mentioned in Wellington's despatch. He was also mentioned in the despatch after the Salamanca, where he was in command of the right brigade of the third division. During the retreat of the army from Burgos, he had a very severe attack of fever at Madrid and was dangerously ill for nearly eight months. He saw no further service in the Peninsula, but commanded a brigade in the army of occupation in France in the latter part of 1815. He received the gold medal with two clasps, and was made C.B. in 1815. He was made colonel in the army in 1813, major-general in 1819 and elevated to K.C.B. on 16 September 1833. On 20 October 1831 he was given the colonelcy of the 88th, a position he held until his death. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1837 and full general on 11 November 1851. He died at Lochryan House, Stranraer, Wigtownshire in 1857 at the age of 82. On 23 June 1829 he had married Janette, daughter of William Rodger, by whom he had five sons and one daughter.

By the far turn he had the lead, but he was still challenged for that lead throughout the stretch by Indian Jones until they hit the wire together. It was Eldaafer by a nose. After the race he suffered a suspensory injury. Because of this he was retired after the race. Eldaafer now lives at Old Friends in Georgetown, Kentucky, with his two best friends, Yahoo and Google the goats.

At Rawl Pindi, the 58th Bengal Native Infantry were disarmed peacefully, however the 2 Companies of the 14th Bengal Native Infantry resisted the attempt by force of arms. These two companies were quickly defeated by the British, loyal native troops and the local population. In Jhelum, also garrisoned by the 14th, the concurrently timed disarmament was much more violent. Thirty five British soldiers of 24th Regiment of Foot (of later Rorkes Drift fame) were killed (or died of their wounds) along with a number of Loyal Indian troops, by mutinous Sepoys of the 14th Bengal Native Infantry, stationed at Jhelum. When the mutineers realised that they, with the exception of the Sikhs, were to be disarmed, they mutinied and made a vigorous defence against the force that had arrived from Rawl Pindi to disarm them. The following night a significant number of mutineers managed slip away but most were subsequently arrested by the Kashmir authorities, into whose territory they had escaped. Background The background to the Indian Mutiny, or the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as it is also referred to, is complex and has its origins largely with the Hindu members of the British East India Company Army of the Presidency of Bengal (although the British view after the mutiny was that it was largely driven by Muslim members). Each of the three \\"Presidencies\\" into which the East India Company divided India for administrative purposes maintained their own armies. Of these, the Army of the Bengal Presidency was the largest. Unlike the other two, it recruited heavily from among high-caste Hindus and comparatively wealthy Muslims. The Muslims formed a larger percentage of the 18 irregular cavalry units within the Bengal Army, whilst Hindus were mainly to be found in the 84 regular infantry and cavalry regiments. The sepoys were therefore affected to a large degree by the concerns of the landholding and traditional members of Indian society. In the early years of Company rule, it tolerated and even encouraged the caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army, which recruited its regular soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning Brahmins and Rajputs of the Bihar and Awadh. These soldiers were known as Purbiyas. By the time these customs and privileges came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted.Seema Alavi The Sepoys and the Company (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1998 p. 5 The sepoys also gradually became dissatisfied with various other aspects of army life. Their pay was relatively low and after Awadh and the Punjab were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (batta or bhatta) for service there, because they were no longer considered \\"foreign missions\\". The junior European officers became increasingly estranged from their soldiers, in many cases treating them as their racial inferiors. In 1856, a new Enlistment Act was introduced by the Company, which in theory made every unit in the Bengal Army liable to service overseas. Although it was intended to apply to only new recruits, the serving sepoys feared that the Act might be applied retroactively to them as well. A high-caste Hindu who travelled in the cramped conditions of a wooden troop ship could not cook his own food on his own fire, and accordingly risked losing caste through ritual pollution. The incident which appears to have been the actual flash point for the mutiny of units within the East India Company Army related to the issue of new cartridges for the in service rifle. These cartridges were covered in grease which it was rumoured was made from animal fat, and specifically beef or pig fat. As soldiers had to place the cartridges in their mouth to rip them open and cows were regarded as sacred by Hindus and pigs unclean by Muslims this rumour created outrage. This spilled over into open defiance in some units and eventually a very bloody mutiny in Meerut and Dehli. Disarming of Native Units As some units openly rebelled and disquiet spread the decision was made to disarm some Bengal units that it was believed may be at risk of mutiny. This does not appear to have been a blanket policy across the East India Company Army and the decision as to whether or not to disarm units or not appears to have been taken on a case by case basis at a local level. In some cases attempts to disarm units went badly wrong or were bungled such as at Benares and Allahabad, also leading to local revolts.Michael Edwardes, Battles of the Indian Mutiny, pp 52‚Äì53 As a result, orders to disarm other Bengal Native units were carried with much more secrecy. Deployment of forces To prevent forewarning the Bengal Native Infantry units in either Jhelum or Rawl Pindi of plans to disarm them the decision was taken to arrange for both garrisons to be disarmed simultaneously. On 1 July 1857 a small force was dispatched under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Ellice, consisting of 3 Companies of the 24th Regiment of Foot (a Regular British Army unit rather than an East India Company unit), a total of 260 men, 3 Horse Artillery guns from Captain Cooke's Company of the Bengal Horse Artillery and 150 men of Miller's Police Battalion (an Indian unit). This forced was ordered to proceed under sealed orders to Rawl Pindi and were joined en route by Moolantee levies under Lieutenant Lind. None of the officers or men knew the mission they were being sent on and many had assumed that they would be sent to Dehli. On the morning of 7 July the garrison at Rawl Pindi was called out on parade, ostensibly to hear the reading of routine orders. Troops in the garrison at the time consisted of the other half of the 24th of Foot and the remainder of Cooke's Company of the Bengal Horse Artillery along with elements of Captain Millar's Mounted Police, the 58th Bengal Native Infantry and two companies of the 14th Bengal Native Infantry. During the issue of routine orders Brigadier Campbell of the Royal Artillery and commander of the garrison issued orders for the two Bengal Native Infantry units to be disarmed. This was done without the knowledge of these two units British Officers and whilst the 58th obeyed the orders the two companies of the 14th took to arms and carried out a fighting withdrawal pursued by the Mounted Police. Those of the two companies that escaped into the town were later captured by the locals and their heads were delivered to the garrison the following day by the townspeople. The Battle On the morning of 6 July Lieutenant Colonel Ellice's force arrived at Deenah, one days march from Jhelum, where he was to open his sealed orders. With the intent of the expedition now clear Ellice sent half of his mounted Moolantee troops ahead of the column, ordering them to cross the river and proceed through the low ground and waddies so as to avoid detection and cover that flank. He then rode ahead himself to Jhelum and met with Lieutenant Colonel Gerard, commander of the 14th Bengal Native Infantry, to direct him as to how he was to co-operate with his force the following morning. Early on the following day (7 July), as events were unfolding in Rawl Pindi, the three guns from Captain Cooke's Company, Bengal Horse Artillery along with the remainder of the Moolantee Cavalry took up positions to the right of the Jhelum Cantonment and cut off the lines of communication. Later that morning the infantry of the 24th of Foot arrived moving into the open outside the cantonment and began deploying into line. The 14th Bengal Native Infantry were at this stage formed up in column on their parade square, with the Sikh members of the unit formed up to one side. Upon seeing the British troops come into sight the men of the 14th realised that they were about to be disarmed and began loading their weapons and making ready for a fight. Their European officers attempted to remonstrate with them and get them to lay down their weapons but without any success. As the Sikh troops and European Officers realised the danger they were in they began moving rapidly towards the 24th Regiment of Foot, and just in time as the remaining troops of the 14th began opening fire on them. The mutineers began deploying into defensive positions and blocking the main route into the garrison but were met by a charge by the Moolantee Cavalry led by Lieutenant Lind. The cavalry charge caused a significant number of casualties amongst the mutineers but with Lieutenant Lind going down (with his mount shot out from under him) and the 14th in a strong defensive position the cavalry couldn't press home their attack. In ten minutes the Moolantees had suffered 9 dead, 28 wounded and 60 horses killed. The Moolantee Infantry and Police the men of Millar's Police Battalion followed up the attack supported by the guns of the Bengal Horse Artillery but a stalemate ensued. Finally Lieutenant Colonel Ellice took 50 of his men from the 24th of Foot and led them in a charge, hoping to storm the enemy position, and managed to break through the Quarter Guard of the mutineers. Lieutenant Colonel Ellice fell during the charge (wounded in the neck and leg), but the mutineers of the 14th Bengal Native Infantry fell back into the adjoining camp of the 39th Bengal Native Infantry. The mutineers were then forced to retreat from their new position when an artillery shell hit the magazine causing a large explosion, around 300 escaping to the nearby village of Saemlee and prepared new positions. During this lull in the battle the men of the 24th of Foot discovered the 39ths Mess and stores including the alcohol. After a long march the men were difficult to restrain and order was lost for a brief period with only the men of the Bengal Horse artillery and the Moolantees remaining disciplined and watching the enemy. When Lieutenant Colonel Ellice recovered enough to take command order was restored and he ordered another attack. The Mounted Police and Moolantees Cavalry were placed on the left flank of the village to prevent the mutineers from slipping away and the artillery was ordered closer to the village to begin a bombardment with Grapeshot. The range was however so close, and the mutineers sufficiently covered by the villages buildings, that the artillerymen began to suffer severe casualties; being picked off by the enemy Sepoys. Captain McPherson of the 24th attempted to lead a charge to take the village by bayonet but was forced to withdraw. With ammunition running low and the artillery suffering badly in casualties to men and horses Lieutenant Colonel Ellice ordered a withdrawal. Due to the losses in horses and damage one of the guns could not be pulled away and was captured and tipped into the river by the mutineers. As it was getting late the decision was made to wait until morning to renew the attack on the village and pickets were set. Concurrently the events of the day had been telegraphed to the garrison at Rawl Pindi as events had unfolded and a Colonel was despatched to replace the wounded Lieutenant Colonel Ellice and a small column of reinforcements of the 24th was dispatched under the command of Lieutenant Holland. In the morning when the attack was to be resumed the attackers found that the remainder of the 14 Bengal Native Infantry's mutineers has slipped away in the night. Aftermath Although a large number of mutineers escaped they found they couldn't cross the river easily, the Punjabi Police having secured the major crossing points and boats. Those that did manage to find some small boats were mostly captured by the Moolantees patrolling the far side of the river or by other troops further downstream. In all of the 600 men of the 14th Bengali Native Light Infantry based at Jhelum 100 Sikhs had remained loyal, 150 were killed outright in the fighting, 180 were captured by British or East India Company forces and 150 were arrested by the Kashmiri authorities and handed over to the British. Only 50 remained unaccounted for. The result of the fighting at Jhelum and Rawl Pindi was the destruction of the 14th Bengali Native Infantry as a unit. Lieutenant Colonel Ellice was Mentioned in dispatches, received the Indian Mutiny Medal, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1858. The early success of the 14th Bengali Native Infantry was however to have a wider effect sending shock waves through the region and sparking unrest in nearby garrisons. Victoria Cross Gunner William Connolly, a Bengal Horse Artillery soldier with the force sent from Rawl Pindi to disarm the mutineers, won a Victoria Cross during fighting at Jhelum on 7 July 1857. Memorials Mirza Dildar Baig, also known as Khaki Shah, took part in the mutiny at Jhelum and was later celebrated by Indian Nationalists. He was captured and arrested with the remaining mutineers by authorities in Kashmir and later hanged near the river Jhelum. His grave is in a shrine in Jhelum Dildarnagar, and a small town in Uttar Pradesh is also named after him. Marble Lectern in memory of 35 British soldiers killed at Jhelum. A lectern inside St. John's Church Jhelum the church commemorates the 35 soldiers of the 24th regiment of Foot killed during the mutiny.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 October 2008.  History  Tomahawk Creek Fossicking Area, about west of Rubyvale, north-west of Emerald, is the most remote part of the Central Queensland Gemfields. It is about in area, excised from a Grazing Homestead Perpetual Lease. The first huts were built in the 1960s on mining claims or under Miner's Right but in 1986 under the Mining (Fossicking) Act 1985 the area was designated a fossicking area and the huts made illegal and their residents squatters. Fossicking areas are areas where the government has negotiated access for fossickers in advance and no commercial mining is allowed. On designated fossicking lands the government has negotiated the land owners' permission in advance but some commercial mining under the appropriate legislation may occur. There are 11 designated fossicking areas in Queensland, five of them in Central Queensland, where camping with a permit for a maximum period of three months is allowed. No camping is permitted on the fossicking areas in south-east and north Queensland and there are no known huts in these areas. On the fossicking lands in western and south-west Queensland, out from Winton and Quilpie, camping with a permit is allowed for periods up to three months. There are also \\"general permission areas\\" where special conditions may apply, including Swipers Gully fossicking area near Stanthorpe, where camping is not permitted. . Houses and huts in the several townships on The Gemfields, but not at Tomahawk Creek, are now on regular titles and provided with town facilities. Tomahawk Creek is the largest fossicking area in the Gemfields. The first sapphires were found on The Central Queensland Gemfields in 1870 and attracted hand miners. Archibald John Richardson, Government Surveyor and his partner Frank Fisher, erected a treatment plant but profit eluded them. In the 1890s interest from the nobility of the Russian Empire and from German buyers stimulated the market for sapphires and a period of prosperity ensued, but these markets were lost with the onset of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Government assistance to the market kept miners on the field, with limited recovery in the 1940s. Through the years gemstone miners have lived in tents, and built huts of tin and poles, recycled materials and caravans. Small townships grew at Anakie, Sapphire, Rubyvale and The Willows. In the 1960s the price of gems increased and more tourists and gem collectors worked the fields. In 1965 machine mining began, with the first use of a bulldozer on the Gemfields. Thai buyers began visiting the fields in 1971 and output increased as heavy machinery mining became dominant, in competition and conflict with hand miners for whom some richer areas were reserved. In the late 1970s activity slowed but a core of machinery miners and hand miners remained. The Gemfields become a popular holiday destination for campers and caravanners during the cooler months. Fossicking at Tomahawk Creek was active in the late 1960s, when the earliest extant huts were built, on occupation under Mining Claims, Leases and Permits to Occupy. Most occupants stayed during winter and holiday periods; there were 13 non-permanent huts and six permanent huts in January 2007. Most of the huts began as caravans to which annexes and lean-tos were added, with walls and roofs of galvanised iron and \\"billy boulders\\" (large irregular-shaped stones of hard siliceous material) and other light materials, on frames of poles. Toilets and showers usually were built some metres distant from the hut. Designated as a fossicking area, and remote from the townships, Tomahawk Creek has not been machine mined but has been explored and mined by hand miners and tourists. The last Mining Claim expired about 1991, when two occupants applied for Permits to Occupy. There is no legal tenure of the other huts. The hut known as \\"Tomahawk Heights\\" is on lot 9. It is a structure basically of galvanised iron, built after 1969 on a former camp site. There are four occasional occupants. The most substantial hut in the area was built before 1984 on lot 17 by Hans and Eva Hendrickson who used a section as a shop. Known as \\"The Lodge\\", it is now occupied as a holiday place. \\"Camp David\\" hut, 2011 An A-frame hut known as \\"Camp David\\" was built at Mackay, transported to Tomahawk Creek and re-erected in Easter 1981, on Crystal Hill on lot 8. The front wall is made of coloured glass. A hut of \\"billy boulders\\" and bottles, with three caravans, occupies lot 4. Its former permanent occupant (in April 2008) was relocating to a township. The regular occupants of these huts function as a community, meeting regularly and sharing services such as shopping trips and medical visits to the towns. They have a strong sense of ownership of the place and its huts, and residents care for huts when their \\"owners\\" are absent.  Description  Tomahawk Creek is an area of about 2340 hectares of undulating bushland, reached at on an unsealed road, the Reklaw Park track, which leaves the Clermont Road from Rubyvale. Tomahawk Creek forms the north-western boundary. Mount Hoy is a prominent basalt peak in the south-western area. When the sign-posted entrance is reached a number of tracks run through the area, but the main one runs roughly parallel to Hut Creek where most huts are located. There were 21 huts in the area in 2006, five of which are now abandoned, ranging from five to 50 years old. Most were built around caravans with canvas annexes and roofs and walls of galvanised iron, supported by poles of bush timber, tied with wire, and recycled materials. Some are partly built of \\"billy boulders\\", especially the lower walls and outdoor barbecues. Open areas provide ventilation and cooling, with some innovative solutions to the summer heat. Three of the huts within the nominated boundary area are within about of each other. \\"The Lodge\\" hut, 2011 A stone hut known as \\"The Lodge\\", on lot 17, is the most substantial building in the area. It is 12-sided, a dodecahedron. The walls are made of \\"billy boulders\\", above which are horizontal logs between windows of various types using recycled materials. Around the base are air vents made from barrels with caps which can be opened to the exterior. Further ventilation is provided through the roof with slats of galvanised iron which can be opened from the inside, around the water tank that sits on the top of the roof, supported by a central pole. The roof is of galvanised iron. The hut has an electricity generator and a solar panel which charges 24 and 12 volt batteries. Inside is a wooden stove, its fireplace made from a fly wheel, and a conventional wood burning fuel stove. Similar to other huts in the area, any internal divisions are made of insubstantial materials, of hessian, scrap timber and iron. An A-frame building, known as \\"Camp David \\" on Crystal Hill, on lot 8, was built off-site and re-erected in Easter 1984. It measures approximately in length, in width and is high at its apex. A Trimdeck roof is supported by steel struts. It has a mezzanine sleeping area and a staircase. The floor is laid with brick pavers. Power is provided by a generator. The front wall, facing east, is made of pieces of coloured glass held in place by aluminium strips. A hut built largely of \\"billy boulders\\" and bottles occupies lot 4. Three caravans are on the site and incorporated as annexes to the hut. A hut known as \\"Tomahawk Heights\\" occupies lot 9. Building began after 1969 where the occupant had previously camped. The walls are largely of \\"billy boulders\\" but it contains the remnants of a previous building. Power is provided by a solar panel and batteries. It has a stone fireplace and barbecue.  Heritage listing  Tomahawk Creek Huts was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 October 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The huts at Tomahawk Creek are important as part of the evolution of Queensland's history and particularly of the Central Region Gemfields. They illustrate a way of life associated with fossicking with minimal technology and building with recycled materials. The huts date from the 1960s with additions made in the 1980s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Tomahawk Creek illustrates a way of life that has become endangered as land use that once was common has been regulated, and the solutions evident in the huts for living in difficult hot, dry climates have become rare. Camping is confined under the Fossicking Act and Regulations to fossicking areas in Central Queensland and to three fossicking areas in remote western and south-west Queensland, for periods up to three months. State government abolition of the Miner's Right on fossicking areas has resulted in a decrease in the occurrence of huts similar to those at Tomahawk Creek, and they are now rare and possibly the only survivors of an endangered tradition.

His doctorate was supervised by the former President of the American Sociological Association, Franklin Henry Giddings, and published as Australian Social Development in 1918.C.H.

Here, he worked alongside such Rowntree figures as Lyndall Urwick and Oliver Sheldon, the latter of whom was initially employed under Northcott.Katherine A.

He was a key organiser in Rowntree's Oxford Management conferences and was Chairman of the Labour section of Rowntree's Management Research Groups.

In 1932, Northcott wrote in Unity that he was unimpressed by the Bedaux Unit, it being very similar to the Haynes Manit Man-Minute.Michael Ferguson, The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002) He also explained that he did not approve of using management consultants to introduce work measurement systems and that the Bedaux Unit was not new: Rowntree's Cocoa Works had been using an almost identical unit, the Mark, to measure many of its 7,000 workers since 1923. The Incentives and Contentment studies From 1929, Northcott led the Incentives and Contentment studies at the Rowntree Cocoa Works. These workplace experiments lasted for four years, being published as a book in 1938, featuring a foreword by Seebohm Rowntree.Patricia Hall and Henry William Locke. Incentives and contentment: a study made in a British factory (Sir I. Pitman, 1938). Northcott and his researchers found that pay incentives were the most effective way of stimulating better work. Incentives and Contentment was reviewed by labour managers, sociologists and economists, all of whom compared the Rowntree experiments to the American Hawthorne studies. In the postwar period, the Incentives and Contentment studies became overshadowed by the Hawthorne studies which found, in contrast, that social incentives were more effective than pay.Michael Weatherburn, 'Human Relations' invented traditions: sociotechnical research and worker motivation at the interwar Rowntree Cocoa Works', Human Relations (May, 2019).

The episode was written and storyboarded by Colin Howard, Jeff Liu, and by Takafumi Hori. The episode was watched by 1.334 million viewers. The episode focuses on Steven and Connie training as their fusion, Stevonnie. However, when their respective personal problems interfere with the stability of the fusion, Garnet, a permanent fusion herself, steps in to help them. Plot The episode opens with Connie (Grace Rolek) arriving at Steven (Zach Callison)'s house for training, distracted and in a bad mood. Steven and Connie go to the Sky Arena to practice fighting while fused as Stevonnie (AJ Michalka), under the supervision of Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall) and Garnet (Estelle). Stevonnie's first practice fight is interrupted when a vision of a boy causes them to panic and defuse. Connie confesses that the boy is a classmate she accidentally beat up after bumping into him at school. Steven tells her that when you hurt someone by accident you just have to \\"try not to think about it\\"; but Garnet decides to educate them on healthier ways of dealing with difficult emotions. On the beachside, Garnet tells the two that an emotional imbalance causes a fusion to lose touch with reality; if one of them is falling apart, their fusion will as well. She leads Stevonnie in a guided meditation, singing the song \\"Here Comes a Thought\\". The song encourages Stevonnie to mindfully pay attention to and contextualize their emotions: \\"Take a moment to think of just flexibility, love, and trust.\\" The process of dealing with emotions is visualized by scenes of Ruby and Sapphire, and then Connie and Steven, being overwhelmed by swarms of butterflies, but helping each other to drive them off or accept them. The next day, Connie returns for training, having made amends with the boy she beat up. Stevonnie performs well in practice battles until they again begin to have visions driven by guilt and anxiety. This time, the guilt is Steven's; they see images of Bismuth, Jasper, and Eyeball, three recent adversaries with whom Steven, despite his best efforts, was unable to make peace. The cloud of butterflies then takes the shape of a stern and disapproving-looking Rose Quartz. Overwhelmed, Stevonnie falls from the Sky Arena. As they fall, Steven and Connie split again. Connie calls for Steven to fuse so they can float to the ground, but Steven is too wrapped up in guilt to pay attention. Connie tells Steven that he has to be honest with himself about how bad he feels in order for him to move on. Accepting this, Steven fuses with Connie once again and Stevonnie regains stability, managing to safely float down. Stevonnie falls to the ground laughing in relief, and contently proclaims, \\"I'm here\\". Production Promotional art for the episode by storyboarder Jeff Liu Episodes of Steven Universe are written and storyboarded by a single team. \\"Mindful Education\\" was written by Colin Howard, Jeff Liu, and guest animator Takafumi Hori of Studio Trigger. Ki-Yong Bae and Jin-Hee Park provided animation direction, and Ricky Cometa served as art director. =Music= The episode features the song \\"Here Comes a Thought\\". The song was written by series creator Rebecca Sugar, and arranged by Aivi & Surasshu, the music team for the series, with strings performed by Jeff Ball. It features vocals by Estelle as Garnet and AJ Michalka as Stevonnie. A shortened version of the song was first performed by Sugar at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, where she described it as a song she wrote to talk herself off of a proverbial ledge. At San Diego Comic Con 2017, AJ Michalka and Estelle, alongside Rebecca Sugar, sang a live acoustic version of the song. Broadcast and reception \\"Mindful Education\\" premiered on Cartoon Network on August 25, 2016. Its initial American broadcast was viewed by approximately 1.334 million viewers. It received a Nielsen household rating of 0.3, meaning that it was seen by 0.3% of all households. The episode received a great deal of praise from critics. The animation, Hori's storyboarding and voice acting of the \\"Here Comes a Thought\\" sequence was particularly lauded, with James Whitbrook of io9 calling it \\"one of Steven Universe's best songs since 'Stronger Than You'\\", and Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club, who gave the episode an A grade, singling out AJ Michalka as \\"the real MVP of the song\\". The message of the episode was also praised, with Vrai Kaiser of The Mary Sue comparing it to Pixar's Inside Out, and ND Medina of iDigitalTimes calling it a \\"bite-sized dose\\" of cognitive behavioral therapy.

History The territory was historically known as and was ruled by clan M√°g Tighearn√°n. Another name for it was Clonballykernan. For centuries it was part of the Kingdom of Breifne, a loose union of chiefdoms that the O'Rourkes ruled as overlords. Following the dissolution of the kingdom, the area was still in the orbit of the O'Rourke kingdom of West Breifne until the early 1500s, when the M√°g Tighearn√°ns switched allegiance to the O'Reilly of East Breifne. In 1579 the area was subsumed into the newly formed county of Cavan. In 1584 the barony of Tullyhunco was officially demarcated and granted to clan M√°g Tighearn√°n by the Kingdom of Ireland.

Bicchieri ‚Äì born to a patrician ‚Äì is best known for the construction of a Dominican convent in her hometown of Vercelli where she served as prioress. Her beatification came in 1769 after Pope Clement XIV issued formal ratification to the late religious' longstanding local 'cultus' ‚Äì or popular devotion and worship. Life Emilia Bicchieri was born in 1238 in Vercelli as the fourth of seven girls to Pietro Bicchieri, a patrician of noble stock. She was baptized sometime in the month of her birth. In her childhood she often sung psalms in the house and retreated to her room for spiritual reflection. In her adolescence she staved off her father's attempts for her to enter an advantageous marriage. Before her birth her mother had a vivid dream in which she saw the future work of her daughter. She told this to a Dominican friar who told her that she would bear a daughter and that the dream was a clear sign that the unborn child would become a saint. In her childhood Bicchieri was taught to read and to embroider, and was considered her father's favorite despite emptying her purse as quickly as he could fill it ‚Äì she provided alms to the poor with tender affection. Her three older sisters concerned themselves with advantageous marriages for greater wealth while she shunned such things as vain. Bicchieri's ambitions in 1254 were to become a nun but she did not know which order she would enter. In 1256 she decided her call was to serve God as a professed nun in the Order of Preachers. Her father bowed to pressure and in 1255 decided to oversee construction of an establishment that his daughter could found in her name and use for religious purposes. Her father died after the convent was constructed in 1255, which came as a tremendous blow to her for she was devoted to her father; she had dreaded informing him of her decision to become a nun. The hopeful Bicchieri founded the convent of Santa Margherita in her hometown for regular Dominican tertiaries and in 1257 enrolled in the Dominicans before making her solemn profession and receiving the habit of the order; her convent would observe the rule of the Third Order of Saint Dominic. Pope Alexander IV issued a papal brief that authorized the new convent in 1256. The convent was incorporated into the full order sometime in 1266. On 28 September 1257 she and 30 others took the habit and her mother came to attend the celebration and was amazed that her dream seemed to be fulfilled. She was elected as prioress in 1258 ‚Äì against her will ‚Äì but despite her position she liked to do the most menial of domestic duties in service to her fellow sisters. Bicchieri was reconfirmed as prioress in 1273. The prioress became noted for her frequent reception of the Eucharist and for often giving into ecstasies. During her tenure as prioress the rule in force at the time prohibited members from drinking in between meals without the express permission of the prioress, which was something that was conceded on ultra-rare occasions. Cecilia Avogadro requested but did not obtain Bicchieri's consent, and was advised to take her cup to the angel in meditation for sustenance. This religious died sometime later all of a sudden and ended up in Purgatory. She appeared to the prioress and thanked her for her firmness. She was known to wear a hair shirt and often fasted as signs of penance. Bicchieri died in 1314 and her remains were placed in a modest grave before being relocated to her convent in 1537. Her remains were moved one final time to the Vercelli Cathedral in 1811. Beatification The formal ratification of the local 'cultus' ‚Äì or popular and enduring devotion to her ‚Äì enabled Pope Clement XIV to grant formal approval to the beatification of the late religious on 19 July 1769.

MUD Jeans satisfies the principles of the circular economy. The MUD Jeans are made from 40% recycled content, with the material being derived from discarded jeans. The main business concept of the company it to lease its apparel to consumers. After the lease period of one year, consumers can switch them for another pair and continue leasing, return them for recycling or upcycling purposes, or keep them. The lease contract includes free unlimited repair services. This concept is called Lease A Jeans and was launched in 2013. MUD Jeans sells the products online and is available in a limited number of sustainable concept stores around the globe.  History  The company was re-launched by Bert van Son after acquiring the brand in 2012. Bert van Son had a new vision for the company and decided to invest in MUD Jeans. From May 2016 to August 2018, MUD Jeans was headquartered in Almere, The Netherlands. In September 2018, the \\"MUDquarters\\" relocated to Laren, Netherlands at the Groene Afslag.https://mudjeans.eu/blog-welcome-to-the-mudquarters/  Lease A Jeans  The 'Lease A Jeans' concept was launched in 2013. With this concept, MUD Jeans follows a circular economy where the mindset of the consumer changes from owing to using. The concept also promotes the return of the jeans, which will stimulate the recycling process. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Bert van Son came to notice that in order to promote the return of jeans he has to avoid selling it in the first place. The consumer can lease a jeans for a period of one year. Throughout this year, the monthly fee is ‚Ç¨7,50 (with a one-time membership fee of ‚Ç¨20 with which you can lease 3 jeans at a time). Around the eleventh month of the consumer's lease contract, MUD Jeans gives the consumer three choices concerning the jeans: # Switch the current jeans for another pair and continue leasing the new pair of jeans for ‚Ç¨7.50/month. The old pair will be recycled or sold as vintage depending on the condition of the jeans. # Return the jeans without receiving a new pair. The old pair will be recycled or sold as vintage depending on the condition of the jeans. # Keep the jeans. After the 12 months of monthly payments, the consumer has paid off the amount of the jeans and are now the owner. As MUD Jeans promotes the philosophy of a circular economy, they discourage this last option in order to recycle jeans. When old jeans are returned back to the company, a quality check is carried out to determine whether they can be re- used through MUD' s vintage program or if they should be recycled. Once jeans are returned to be recycled, the jeans are send back to the factory in Valencia, Spain, where the recycling process takes place. The denim fibres are reused in new jeans and sweaters. MUD Jeans currently sells sweaters which contain 85% recycled denim. Anyone can return (non-)MUD Jeans so that they can be recycled. To stimulate and encourage this, MUD Jeans offers the consumer who do this a discount on their next purchase.  The Recycle Tour  In May 2016, MUD Jeans travelled from Amsterdam to Valencia, where one of the factories is located. This road trip was planned to bring jeans back to the factory in order to close the circle. At the starting destination, Amsterdam, and along the way, jeans were collected from individuals who wished their jeans a next life. In Valencia, the MUD Team was able to see the whole recycling process and capture this to share with their followers. This initiative allowed them to bring back 3,000 pairs of jeans. The jeans that are recycled here, will be shredded and woven together with virgin denim into new fabric. The first batch of recycled denim jeans will be available as of fall 2016 and will be made of 20% recycled denim, which is the highest level of recycling that is possible with current technology. Throughout the road trip to Valencia, the MUD Team organised get togethers with other sustainable organisations and individuals, such as a beach clean up in collaboration with the Surfrider Foundation Europe.

She was also the regent of Renkum in circa 983-?, likely as regent for her son Dirk of Renkum. Her claim on the county of Hamaland caused a war of succession with her sister Liutgard of Elten, which lasted from 973 until 996. She married count Immed of Renkum (d. 983) and 995 with count Balderik of Hamaland, whom she made her co- regent by marriage. Life Adela was the daughter of count Wichman II of Hamaland (d. 973) and Liutgard of Flanders (d. 962), daughter of Arnulf of Flanders and Adele of Vermandois. Adela was the younger sister of Liutgard (d. 995), who became the abbess of Elten Abbey, which was founded by their father. Adela's first husband was Count Immedd of Renkum, a member of the Immedinger dynasty, with whom she had five children. =Succession war= At the death of their father in 973, the Emperor made Elten Abbey a Princely Imperial Abbey and Liutgard was thereby given sovereign status as princess abbess of Elten. A succession war erupted between the sisters, as Adela claimed the county as sovereign countess of Hamaland and Liutgard claimed all the county as Elten territory. Liutgard had her vassal Balderich attacked and burned Adela's fortress down. In 983, Adela became a widow and regent of the county of Renkum as guardian of her minor son. She used her power position to occupy the territory of Liutgard, but was forced by the emperor to end the occupation. =Later life= Upon the death of Liutgard in 995, Adela married her sister's former vassal Balderik, and named him co-regent as count of Hamaland by marriage. One year later, the succession dispute between Adela and Elten was finally resolved by mediation of the Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor: the territory formally named county of Hamaland was parted between Elten Abbey and Adela of Hamaland, and Adela's spouse Balderik was formally named the successor of her father. In 999, Adela and Balderik conquered the land given to Elten as well. By their contemporaries, Balderik was regarded merely as the tool of Adela, and when his rival Wichman van Vreden was murdered in 1016, she rather than Balderik was blamed. The followers of Wichman made siege to Adela's fortress Uplade, where she was left by Balderik, who had escaped, to defend the fortress herself. Adela did not have enough soldiers, and therefore dressed women as soldiers and used them in her defense as well. The fortress was eventually conquered by the enemy, but Adela was allowed to leave unharmed. Children With Immed, Adela had the following children: *Meinwerk, bishop of Paderborn *Dirk/Theoderic (d.1014) *Glismod (d.before 1041) *Adela (d. after 1027), a canoness at Elten abbey *Emma (d. 1038), married Liutger, son of the Saxon duke, Hermann Billung Legacy Adela has traditionally been given an infamous reputation in history.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built from 1913 to 1920 by G P Williams. It is also known as the 1914 Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 June 1994.  History  This timber building was erected in 1914, and replaced a building erected in 1880. The Mitchell Downs run was taken up during the 1850s. A Post Office opened at Mitchell Downs in 1865, mail services commencing for the surrounding district at this time. The Reserve for the town of Mitchell was gazetted in 1869, on the site of the Mitchell Downs head station, the owners having erected another homestead further west. The Booringa Division was gazetted in 1879 and Mitchell became the administrative centre for the Division and later the Shire of Booringa. The Western Railway line was extended to Mitchell in 1885, and Mitchell consolidated its position as the business centre of the surrounding pastoral district. A provisional school for 20 pupils was established at Mitchell in 1876. A new school building and residence were completed by contractors Joseph and John Warren for in 1880, by which time there were 66 pupils. The building consisted of 2 rooms with verandahs at the front and rear. The building was raised and reroofed in 1911. By 1913 the school enrolment numbered just over 200, and complaints were received regarding the inadequacy of the existing building. Plans were prepared, and a new building was mostly completed in 1914 by contractor GP Williams for . During construction of the new building, lessons were taught in the old residence and the playsheds, and held in the supper room of the Shire Hall during winter. The new building was described as: > \\"A modern compact wooden building placed on high stumps with area under > concreted, and batten enclosed. A glazed partition divides the infants' and > main school rooms, both of which are cove-ceiled with stamped metal. Large > gable windows, dormer and high verandah lights, give ample lighting and > ventilation.\\" The former school building was sold in 1914. The school residence was removed in 1915, and replaced by the present residence, completed in 1919. Records indicate that the balance of the building was completed by 1920, in particular, inclusion of the dormer lights and metal ceiling. By the late 1940s the building appears to have been divided into three rooms, and a teachers room added to the south eastern side of the building. Crowded and unsatisfactory teaching conditions by 1950 prompted proposals for major alterations, including the removal of the existing verandah and teachers room and their re-erection on the northwestern side of the building, and an extension to the classroom area at the western end of the building. It does not appear however, that these proposals were ever followed through. A portion of the northwestern verandah was enclosed in 1959 to form a library room, and by the early 1980s the library occupied a large former classroom area. From the early 1900s, the garden appears to have been a focus of school activity, with mention made of experiments in wheat culture and experimental plot and flower gardens. References to project clubs date from the mid 1940s, and included clubs associated with fruit, vegetables, flowers, bee keeping and poultry. Accommodation for vocational education classes was provided in 1922, by enclosing a shed in the school yard. In 1949, the school on the Aboriginal reserve was closed, and the building moved to the Mitchell State School where it was converted for domestic science and manual training classes. This building has been removed from the site. Other additions to the school undertaken from the 1950s, have included the erection of additional primary school facilities, the addition of a wing for secondary school classes, the erection of a new building for home economics and manual arts, and a new administration block. The building was removed from the Queensland Heritage Register in June 2015 having been destroyed.  Description  The 1914 school building, now known as Block A, was located on the school reserve bounded by Oxford, Ann, Margaret and Cambridge Streets. Positioned at the centre of the school complex, the north western verandah of the building formed part of the circulation between newer adjoining buildings. A single storeyed building elevated on concrete stumps, the school was a timber-framed structure with weatherboard walls and a corrugated iron roof. The former classroom area was rectangular in plan, with verandahs running along the full extent of the longer north western and south-eastern facades. Outside the basic rectangle was the former teacher's room, which was positioned in the centre of the south-eastern facade abutting the adjacent verandah. A large gable roof covered the classrooms and verandahs while a smaller gable, protruding from the centre of the main roof, covers the former teacher's room. An ornate ventilator was mounted centrally on the ridge of the main roof. Below the ventilator on both sides of the roof were banks of dormer windows. A number of roof lights were added to the roof. The former teacher's room wa accessed from the south-eastern verandah. On both sides of this room were external timber staircases which connect the elevated verandah with the ground. The south- eastern verandah was later enclosed with small rooms built into both ends. A single timber staircase led to the centre of the north western verandah which was partly enclosed. Casement windows, positioned symmetrically in the gable ends, were protected by timber framed awnings. The former classroom area featured a coved pressed metal ceiling. The concrete play area under the building was partly enclosed by corrugated iron screen walls and timber battens.

Though criticized by some for its lukewarm opposition and warm reception to government policies, Justice Nzeako, a former NCWS president emphasized that the organization is apolitical but acts as a pressure group to make the government amend its ways. History The formation of the National Council of Women's Societies was prompted due to the large number of women's organizations in the Western region during the nation‚Äôs First Republic. The regional minister in charge of social welfare, Oba Akran, called on these organizations to unite and present a common platform in their rapport with governmental and international institutions. In March 1958, members of these women organizations attended a meeting in Ibadan to discuss the establishment of an umbrella organization to unite women in the country. NCWS was formally inaugurated in 1959 as an organization for women's group in the country. Key organizations that came together to form NCWS include Women's Cultural and Philanthropic Organization in Eastern Nigeria, Women's Improvement Society, Women's Movement, Nigerian Women's Union and Federation of Women's Societies. Between 1961 and 1962, the organization established regional branches in Kaduna, Enugu and Lagos. In the formative years, NCWS was a group of elite women interested in promoting their interest and the interests of less privileged women. In the early 1960s, NCWS took an active role in promoting initiatives to increase the participation of women in the Economy of Nigeria through training classes and credit programmes. Economic lectures on self- sustenance were delivered by individuals such as Aduke Alakija and other elite women. In the early 1980s, after the crash of oil prices, NCWS organized economic literacy programmes for the market women community. NCWS goal of affecting national life through active participation of women has led the organization to support women's suffrage in Northern Nigeria during the First Republic. In the late 1950s, it started a voting rights campaign to allow women to vote and be voted for and visited regional leaders such as Ahmadu Bello to press on those interests. The NCWS was also involved in mobilizing women to participate in the political process during the short-lived Third Republic. =Affiliates= Some organizations which had been affiliated with NCWS are: *Association of Professional Women Bankers. *International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA). *Young Women's Christian Association (YCWA). *Zonta International. *The Nigerian Guides Association. *Medical Women's Association. *Amata Progressive Women's League. *Ward Women's Vanguard. *Ibibio Women's Cooperative Societies. *Muslim Mothers Association. *National Market Women's Association Goals The goals of NCWS include among others, to improve the welfare, progress and standard of living of women in Nigeria, and to increase the role of women in affecting political life through access to decision making. Other aims include to ensure through legal and political means that women have the opportunity to participate as responsible members of their communities development and growth. In addition, it encourages the affiliation of all women NGO's in the country to come under its platform. =Special programs= In 1985, NCWS started a Vesico Vaginal Fistula project with assistance from Ford Foundation. The organization is also involved in other educational campaigns including maternal and child health in local governments of the federation and was involved in the establishment of Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria. During the 2011 presidential campaign, the government pledged to implement a 35% affirmative action in political appointments for women as part of a promise made to women in the country and NCWS. Presidents The following women have led the National Council of Women Societies. *Kofo Ademola (1958-1964) *Elizabeth Abimbola Awoliyi (1964-1971) *Kofoworola Abeni Pratt (1971-1976) *Ronke Doherty (1976-1980) *Ifeyinwa Nzeako (1980-1984) *Hilda Adefarasin (1984-1988) *Emily Aig-Imoukhuede (1988-1993) *Laila Dogonyaro (1993-1995) *Amina Sambo (1995-1997) *Bolere Ketebu *Ramatu Usman *Nkechi Mba *Laraba Gloria Shoda Criticism During its formative years, NCWS was plagued with conflicts bordering on religious and geographical divisions, state subvention and support of specific government policies such as the austerity programme of President Shehu Shagari's administration and the harassment of street vendors.Tripp, Aili Mari, Casimiro, Isabel, and Kwesiga, Joy. African Women's Movements : Transforming Political Landscapes. New York, US: Cambridge University Press, 2008. P. 49 The issue of financing has earned NCWS criticism from some groups. For a long time, federal and state government gave subventions to NCWS which allowed the organization to build a national headquarters in Abuja and also own a commercial building in Victoria Island, Lagos. This financing relationship have sometimes made NCWS less critical of some actions of the government such as the annulment of the democratic process in 1993 a few years after mobilizing women to come out and participate in the electoral process.

Her work in photography, sculpture, and site-specific installation art is known for her interpretations of modernist architecture and contemporary urban life. Her work has appeared in solo exhibitions throughout the world, including Double Transparency at Art Unlimited Basel in Switzerland (2014) and Projects 78 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (2003), and in numerous group exhibitions at institutions like the J.Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and ICA London. Hornig's work is included in the collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the Cleveland Clinic, Hirshorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, and Malm√∂ Konstmuseet in Sweden.  Education  Hornig studied sculpture and photography at the Hochschule der K√ºnste (since 2001 the Universit√§t der K√ºnste Berlin, UdK (Berlin University of the Arts)), in Berlin from 1986 to 1992 receiving a BFA and an MFA.  Work  Hornig's work plays with and challenges the way in which human beings perceive the world around them, blurring scale and perspective. Many of her works combine photographs and three-dimensional structures, often creating a tromp l‚Äô≈ìil effect. These stretch the boundaries of what would commonly be considered ‚Äúphotography‚Äù or ‚Äúsculpture‚Äù and do not fit easily into any single categorization. Hornig's work is frequently described as incorporating a philosophy of Minimalism, frequently incorporating windows or doors that frame barren city landscapes as well as the viewer's own image reflected in the object's surface. The artist, however, has stated that she does not find that Minimalist description wholly accurate or appropriate. Hornig's art considers the built environment and incorporates everyday architectural elements like doors, walls, and windows, as well as industrial materials such as concrete. These appear in both sculpture and site-specific installations. One 2002 sculptural work, Balcony, installed a full stucco balcony ‚Äì complete with a drying towel ‚Äì floating above the floor in a gallery. In a 2005 Lisbon exhibition, Hornig created a ‚Äústone‚Äù wall out of newspaper and glue, extending along and reflecting in a glass gallery wall of windows. One major site-specific work is the Glass Fa√ßade Project, or Das Glasfassaden-Projekt, which in 2005 provided a large installation for an elementary school building at Pfeuferstra√üe 1, in Munich's Sendling district. The project features silkscreen printed with transparent colors on safety glass. Brightly colored balloons, bookshelves, and seemingly billowing white sheets appear on the fa√ßade of the urban school. The silkscreened images are visible from inside the glass fa√ßade and outside of it. In certain works that incorporate architectural elements, she simplifies and omits details like door handles and adjusts an item's scale in order to transform a recognizable object into a sculpture. Windows are another common motif in Hornig's art, appearing in major installations like her 2003 work at MoMA Queens, Projects 78, with photographs of urban or outdoor spaces frequently appearing embedded within solid window or doorframes. She has created an ongoing Windows series since 2001, utilizing photographs of and through windows. In some of these works the empty windows, and the empty storefronts viewed through the window frame, reflect potential for change and provide an opportunity for reflection. Her 2013 exhibition at the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in New York, called Transparent Things, took its title from a 1972 novel by Vladimir Nabokov and explored themes of temporality and urban spaces. The exhibition combined sculptural pieces, mimicking industrial urban objects and made out of materials like concrete, polyester, and aluminum, with photographs depicting run-down spaces in modern Berlin. Both the structures and the photographs subvert viewers‚Äô visual understanding of the objects and the physical space. Nearly all of the photographs are captured through windows, in a manner that compresses and distorts depth perception and sense of place, throwing viewers off-balance and creating spatial confusion that is characteristic of Hornig's work. The artist herself has said that she communicates a sense of abstraction, ‚Äúplacelessness,‚Äù and ‚Äúindistictness‚Äù in her work, to encourage critical thought in her viewers. Commissioned by LaGuardia Airport, Hornig realized her largest architectural intervention to date, La Guardia Vistas (2020), running 268 feet long and 42 feet tall on the glass facade of the Terminal B passageway to the parking garage. Taking the view of Manhattan‚Äôs skyline from the airport as a conceptual departure point, she shot more than 1,100 high-resolution photographs of Manhattan from its rooftops as well as from the waterfront in Queens. She merged the images into a stacked composition punctuated with 20 quotations by and about Fiorello La Guardia.Hilarie M.

The organisation had an unofficial armed wing called National Liberation Front, which carried out sabotage activities in Jammu and Kashmir as well as the hijacking of Ganga. Amanullah Khan later moved to England, where he revived the National Liberation Front under the new name Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). History The Plebiscite Front was the initiative of Gilgit-born Amanullah Khan, who after graduating with a Law degree in Karachi, set up a Kashmir Independence Committee advocating the ideology of independence for the entire princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. In April 1965, the Kashmir Independence Committee merged into the newly launched Plebiscite Front in Muzaffarabad. Abdul Khaliq Ansari was its president, Amanullah Khan the general secretary and Maqbool Bhat the publicity secretary. Journalist Arif Jamal states that, the participants drove to an unguarded location of the Kashmir Line of Control near Suchetgarh, brought back soil from the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, took an oath that they would work exclusively for the liberation of the former princely state. National Liberation Front Amanullah Khan and Maqbool Bhat also wanted to set up an armed wing for the Plebiscite Front, but the proposal did not get the majority support in the Plebiscite Front. Undeterred, they established an underground group called National Liberation Front (NLF), obtaining some support for it in August 1965. The group was fashioned after the Algerian Front de Lib√©ration Nationale. Major Amanullah, a former soldier in the Azad Kashmir forces, was in charge of the armed wing while Amanullah Khan and Mir Abdul Qayoom took charge of the political and financial wings. Maqbool Bhat was made responsible for the overall coordination. All the members swore in blood that they would be ready to sacrifice their lives for the objective of the NLF, viz., to create conditions in Jammu and Kashmir that enable its people to demand self- determination. The organisation was successful in recruiting members from Azad Kashmir, and obtained backing from the bureaucracy of the state. The NLF recruited and trained a cadre of militants in the use of explosives and small arms. Crossing into Indian-controlled Kashmir on 10 June 1966, they trained local workers in sabotage activities in the forests of Kupwara and set up secret cells. However, in September 1966, Bhat's group was compromised, possibly via Ghulam Muhammad Dar, who acted as a double agent. The group kidnapped a police inspector and, when he tried to escape, shot and killed him. The Indian army zeroed in on them, leading to an exchange of fire in the Kunial village near Handwara. A member of Bhat's group, Kala Khan, was killed in the action. Bhat and a colleague named Mir Ahmad were captured and tried for sabotage and murder, receiving death sentences from a Srinagar court in September 1968. Major Amanullah's wing waiting to receive the volunteers at the Line of Control retreated, but it was arrested by the Pakistan Army. Maqbool Bhat's arrest brought the group's activities into the open, and sharply divided the Plebiscite Front. Nevertheless, they declared it an unconstitutional body and \\"banned\\" it. Meanwhile, Maqbool Bhat and Mir Ahmad escaped from the Indian prison in December 1968, along with another inmate Ghulam Yasin, tunneling their way out of the prison complex. They returned to Azad Kashmir in January 1969, creating a sensation in the militant circles. Their standing increased within the community, forcing the Plebiscite Front to abandon its opposition. However, the NLF's failed operations in Jammu and Kashmir put at risk all its sympathisers in the state, many of whom were arrested. The militants' escape from an Indian prison was viewed with suspicion by Pakistan. Bhat and his colleagues were detained and brutally interrogated for several months. Statement of Advocate Abdul Khaliq Ansari before ‚ÄòAzad Kashmir‚Äù High Court in 1971, Jammu Kashmir Democratic Liberation Party, 8 June 2015. Long after their release, Bhat was still suspected of being a double agent. Pakistan extended little support to the other Indian youth that crossed over into Azad Kashmir for arms and training. Praveen Swami suggests that, as Pakistan was waging a covert war through its own network in Jammu and Kashmir, it did not want those official operations jeopardised by the amateur operators of the NLF. The NLF continued its activities, sponsoring bomb explosions in the Jammu province. It targeted public places, such as railway stations and bus stations, and military installations in and around the cities of Jammu and Poonch. However, the international attention it was hoping to galvanise through the bombing campaign did not materialise. Ganga hijacking Hashim Qureshi, a Srinagar resident who went to Peshawar on family business in 1969, met Maqbool Bhat and got inducted into the NLF. He was given an ideological education and lessons in guerrilla tactics in Rawalpindi. In order to draw the world's attention to the Kashmiri independence movement, the group planned an airline hijacking fashioned after the Dawson's Field hijackings by the Palestinian militants. Hashim Qureshi, along with his cousin Ashraf Qureshi, was ordered to execute one. A former Pakistani air force pilot Jamshed Manto trained him for the task. However, Qureshi was arrested by the Indian Border Security Force when he tried to reenter Indian-held Kashmir with arms and equipment. He negotiated his way out by claiming to help find other conspirators that were allegedly in the Indian territory, sought an appointment in the Border Security Force to provide such help. Maqbool Bhat sent Qureshi replacement equipment for the hijacking, but it fell into the hands of a double agent, who then turned it over to the Indian authorities. Undeterred, the Qureshis made look-alike explosives out of wood and hijacked an Indian Airlines plane called Ganga on 30 January 1971. The hijackers landed the plane at Lahore and demanded the release of 36 NLF prisoners lodged in Indian jails. However, they succumbed to pressure from the airport authorities and ended up releasing all the passengers and the crew. Years later, Ashraf Qureshi admitted that they were naive and didn't realise that \\"the passengers were more important than the actual plane.\\" Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto showed up at the airport and paid a handsome tribute to the hijackers. Indian Government then refused to carry out the demands. The plane lay on the tarmac for eighty hours, during which the Pakistani security personnel thoroughly searched the air plane and removed papers and postal bags they found in it. Eventually, upon the advice of the authorities, Hashim Qureshi burnt the plane down. For some time, the Qureshis were lauded as heroes. After India reacted by banning overflight of Pakistani planes over India, the Pakistani authorities claimed that the hijack was staged by India, and arrested the hijackers and all their collaborators. A one-man investigation committee headed by Justice Noorul Arifeen declared the hijacking to be an Indian conspiracy, citing Qureshi's appointment in the Border Security Force. In addition to the hijackers, Maqbool Bhat and 150 other NLF fighters were arrested. Seven people were eventually brought to trial (the rest being held without charges). The High Court acquitted them of treason charges. Hashim Qureshi alone was sentenced to seven years in prison. Ironically, Ashraf Qureshi was released even though he was an equal participant in the hijacking. This is said to have been a deal made by Zulikar Bhutto, by now the President of Pakistan, who declared that he would convict one hijacker but release the other. Amanullah Khan was also imprisoned for 15 months in a Gilgit prison during 1970‚Äì72, accused of being an Indian agent. He was released after protests broke out in Gilgit. Thirteen of his colleagues were sentenced to 14 years in prison, but released after a year. In Amanullah Khan's death Kashmiri separatism lost its champion, Catch News, 27 April 2016. According to Hashim Qureshi, 400 activists of the Plebiscite Front and NLF were arrested in Pakistan after the Ganga hijacking. Abdul Khaliq Ansari, who was arrested and tortured, testified in the High Court that the Ganga hijacking had emboldened the people to question the corrupt practices of the Azad Kashmir leaders and, in reaction, the government arrested them and forced them to confess to being Indian agents.  Post-hijack operations  Further attempts by the NLF to infiltrate into Indian-controlled Kashmir also met with failure. Praveen Swami states that the organisation did not have enough funds and infrastructure, or support from other sources, to make an impact inside India. Paul Staniland adds that \\"State repression\\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir also played a key role. In May 1976, Maqbool Bhat reentered the Indian-controlled Kashmir again. He was encouraged by the student protests against the 1974 Indira- Sheikh accord, by which Sheikh Abdullah agreed to return to constitutional politics. Bhat attempted to rob a bank in Kupwara. A bank employee was killed in the course of the robbery. Bhat was rearrested and received a second death sentence. Bhat's arrest effectively broke the back of the NLF in Azad Kashmir. Amanullah Khan moved to England, where he received the enthusiastic support of the British Mirpuri community. The UK chapter of the Plebiscite Front was converted into the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) in May 1977 and formed an armed wing called the \`National Liberation Army'. Amanullah Khan took charge as the General Secretary of JKLF the following February.

The original log homestead house was built soon after Frank King filed his homestead claim in 1888. According to the Albany County Tax Assessor records, the original part of the house was built in 1896; however, a photograph dated 1891 shows the three King Brothers, Frank, Bert and Joe, in front of what appears to be the west elevation of the original log house. The house originally served as living quarters and a base of operations for the sheep ranch. Like most early homestead cabins in Wyoming, the house is built of logs, with a north-south oriented gable roof, and several later additions. The original structure is constructed of massive unhewn logs, one foot in diameter, which are hewn at the ends to fit into similar sized, unhewn corner posts. These logs are much larger than the 8-inch logs that make up the east addition. The gables and the west addition are of frame construction, sheathed in drop siding. The interior of the house has been maintained in nearly its original configuration, giving a good picture of how the house was used during the period of significance. The other building in the historic district is known as the bunkhouse. The King Ranch functioned as a successful sheep ranch through 1950. The bunkhouse, which sits a few hundred yards west of the ranch house, provided housing for some of the ranch hands. Although the exact date of construction is unknown, it appears in a photograph from a 1928 brochure, and the construction technique and materials would suggest it was built during the 1920s. The Historic District was listed on September 21, 2006 in the US Park Service's National Register of Historic Places. The Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office supported the listing on the national registry because of the importance of the ranch in the economic and cultural life of early settler Wyoming. The King Brothers ranch is also important in the historic development of the American sheep industry in the 19th and 20th centuries. References External links * F.S.

Background Nan Goldin in 2009 Goldin started taking black-and-white photographs as a teenager in Boston, before she moved to New York City in 1978. Goldin had no prior formal education in photography, and she was heavily influenced by fashion photography, Andy Warhol‚Äôs early films, Federico Fellini, French and Italian Vogue, Larry Clark, Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton. Her celebratory black-and- white photographs of drag queens prefigure her later signature cibachrome work such as The Ballad of Sexual Dependency. Details When she was 19, Goldin lived in downtown Boston where she began documenting her life in the subcultural community she made home. It was during her time there that her interest in photography solidified. She frequented The Other Side, a drag bar, where she became acquainted with the drag queens and transsexuals who later became the principal subjects for her photographs. In this photograph, Ivy is in drag with a long-haired wig cascading behind her, epitomizing the sexual freedom and gender fluidity that Goldin admired. Goldin has said that she wanted to show respect and honor drag queens by portraying them as a ‚Äúthird gender, as another sexual option, a gender option.‚Äù Notes See also * 1973 in art * Nan Goldin 1973 works 1973 in art Black-and-white photographs LGBT art in the United States 1973 in LGBT history 1970s photographs ","title":"Ivy wearing a fall, Boston"},{"id":"51284270","text":"The slender-billed cuckoo-dove (formerly Macropygia amboinensis) was until recently the name of a species of bird in the family Columbidae.

A long-term member of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), Fairchild was a member of its radical Central Hackney branch, alongside Zelda Kahan and Theodore Rothstein. As early as 1909, he was a signatory to a resolution denouncing party leader H. M. Hyndman's anti-German rhetoric.Martin Crick, The History of the Social- Democratic Federation, p.232 He supported closer links with the Independent Labour Party and other socialists, and worked with Alf Purcell and Victor Grayson on the Provisional Committee for the Promotion of Common Ground Among the Socialists. This was opposed by the right-wing of the SDF, but proved successful, as it constituted the British Socialist Party (BSP), and the SDF merged itself into the new party.Martin Crick, The History of the Social- Democratic Federation, pp.238-240 Fairchild was elected to the BSP's first standing orders committee, alongside Duncan Carmichael, Peter Petroff and C. T. Douthwaite. The four worked together to ensure voices in the party opposing British rearmament were heard.David Howell, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XII, pp.72-76 He was also elected to the party's executive, representing the party's left-wing.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, pp.248-249 At the 1913 London County Council election, Fairchild stood for the BSP in Bow and Bromley. He took 1,609 votes, but was not elected.London Municipal Notes, 1913 In 1915, the party selected him as its delegate to the Zimmerwald Conference, but he was refused a passport and could not attend.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, p.269 During this period, Fairchild was close to John Maclean. When Maclean's newspaper, Vanguard, was suppressed, Fairchild launched The Call as a replacement.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, pp.273-274 The BSP was divided over British entry to World War I; although the majority of the party opposed it, much of the leadership was in favour. Fairchild was an opponent of the war, although he was considered a centrist within the party, as he also argued against action which would endanger \\"national defence\\". The party's right-wing were defeated at its conference in 1916 and walked out; following this, Fairchild was elected as the party's chairman, and The Call became the party's official newspaper. The BSP affiliated to the Labour Party, and Fairchild was selected by the Rochdale Trades and Labour Council as the party's candidate for Rochdale the 1918 UK general election. However, a dispute over his support for conscientious objection during World War I led to his replacement by R. H. Tawney.Jay M. Winter, Socialism and the Challenge of War, p.176 Like the majority of his party, Fairchild welcomed the February Revolution in Russia, and he spoke at the launch of the Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Delegates in Leeds.

Core first gained recognition with her Thiebauds series (2003-4) in which she created photographic interpretations of American painter Wayne Thiebaud's renderings of food. Two of her works in the Thiebauds series, Candy Counter 1969 (2004) and Confections (2005) were acquired by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2005. Early life and education Core was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1965. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1987 from the University of Georgia, and a Master of Fine Arts from the Yale University School of Art in 1998, which is where she received the George Sakier Memorial Prize for Excellence in Photography. Career After studying painting at the University of Georgia, Core moved to Stockholm, Sweden. She then settled in Prague in 1993, where she first practiced photography seriously and created a baking business based in her own apartment. In 1996, she returned to the United States to attend the Yale University School of Art. For her thesis project, which was centered around the ritual of eating, she photographed people consuming their favorite foods. This project led to her early series, Drunk (1998-2000), in which she captured portraits of intoxicated guests at a party she organized as well as those she found at local gatherings. In her series Thiebauds (2003-2005), Core recreated 18 of Wayne Thiebaud's food paintings of the 1960s. She was inspired upon viewing Thiebaud's retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2001. The photographs are known for Core's detailed process of preparation and baking in order to replicate the baked goods and other foods of Thiebaud's paintings. Her next series, Early American (2007-2010), remodeled the still lifes of 18th century American painter Raphaelle Peale. Similar to the photographs of Thiebauds, Core again focused on the idea of process, growing the early 19th century produce in Peale's paintings in her greenhouse and collecting period dish ware. She also painted the walls in the backdrop of the photographs to echo Peale's painting techniques. These works were on view at the Yancey Richardson Gallery in New York City from October 23 to December 6, 2008. Core's project 1606-1907 (2011-2015) explored three centuries of flower paintings. For her subsequent project \\"Understory\\" (begun 2015), Core takes inspiration from the seventeenth-century Sottobosco tradition of Dutch paintings of forest floors. According to a description in The New Yorker, \\"Core's new pictures revel in decay and wildness. Snails slither across bright, wet leaves; pink flowers collapse in a pile of petals; a toad peers from the shadows, camouflaged in the dirt.\\" Core lives and works in Esopus, N.Y. = Legal controversy = According to Robert Panzer, the executive director of the Visual Artists and Galleries Association (the copyright collective that represents Thiebaud), \\"Wayne Thiebaud is concerned with the use that Sharon Core has made of his work...The reproductions she has made are largely straightforward versions of his paintings.\\"  Exhibitions  Core has presented solo exhibitions at spaces across the U.S.: * White Room Exhibition, White Columns, New York (2000) * Sharon Core: Photographs, Clementine Gallery, New York (2001) * Thiebauds, Bellwether Gallery, New York (2004) * Early American, Yancey Richardson Gallery, New York (2008), * James Kelly Contemporary, Santa Fe, New Mexico (2009), * Hermes Foundation, New York (2009), * Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, Georgia (2009) * Project Gallery, Yancey Richardson Gallery, New York (2010) * 1606-1907, Yancey Richardson Gallery, New York (2011) * Still Lives: Early Works by Sharon Core, Mint Museum, Charlotte, North Carolina (2013) * Understory, Yancey Richardson Gallery, New York (2016) = Selected collections = Core's works have also been purchased by various institutions: * Alturas Foundation, San Antonio, Texas * Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas * Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio * Columbus Museum, Columbus, Georgia * Cornell Museum, Cleveland, Ohio * Hermes Foundation, Paris, France * J.

The commission was created by state legislation in 1975. History Urban renewal in the United States started with the Housing Act of 1949, part of President Harry Truman's Fair Deal. In Boston, almost a third of the old city was demolished, including the historic West End, to make way for a new highway, low- and moderate-income high-rises, and new government and commercial buildings. The Boston Landmarks Commission was created by legislation in 1975 as a response to the mass demolitions, particularly the demolition of the Jordan Marsh Building on Washington Street. Built in the 1860s, the ornate building featured a well-known corner clock tower designed by Nathaniel J. Bradlee. Along with an entire row of annex buildings, the building was torn down in 1975 and replaced by a new building. Public outrage and grass roots protests influenced preservation legislation and sparked preservation action. There are now over 8000 landmarked properties in Boston. Responsibilities The chief responsibilities of the Landmark Commission include identifying historic resources through preservation surveys, protecting and recognizing historic properties through designation, and preserving designated Landmarks through the design review process. The BLC also administers Article 85 Demolition Delay for the entire city of Boston. Whenever a building proposed to be demolished is determined by BLC staff to be significant, the public is invited to testify at a public hearing. If the BLC invokes a 90-day Demolition Delay as a result, there is an opportunity for the community to participate in discussions with the developer and explore alternatives to demolition. The Commission meets twice a month on second and fourth Tuesdays - Design Review starts a few hours prior to the business portion at every fourth Tuesday hearing. Applicants propose changes to a Landmark by presenting at the hearing, and the public is invited to comment. Commissioners Commissioners are nominated by professional and neighborhood organizations, and appointed by the Mayor. Most are also confirmed by City Council. All commissioner positions are voluntary. There are 85 commissioner slots among the Boston Landmarks Commission and the 9 local historic commissions, although BLC commissioners also hold slots on local commissions. Historic Districts There are currently 7 historic designated districts and 2 architectural districts. Each district has its own commission staffed by a preservation planner within the Boston Landmarks Commission. The commissioners assure that the architectural and historical integrity of the district is not compromised.

History Edwards published The Practice of Diaspora with Harvard University Press in 2003. Subject matter The Practice of Diaspora focuses on black writers in the interwar period. \\"Retracing the encounters between black intellectuals from both the Anglophone and the Francophone world in Paris, during the early to middle decades of the twentieth century, Edwards is able to make broader theoretical and historical claims for the role of translation in shaping black diasporic cultures.\\" Edwards examines works by Alain Locke, Ren√© Maran, Claude McKay, and Paulette Nardal among others. W.E.B. DuBois serves as a point of departure for this transnational examination of black print culture. Edwards observes that DuBois first presented his famed argument, \\"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line,\\" not in his landmark 1903 text, The Souls of Black Folk (the usual attribution for that quotation), but in fact three years prior, at the 1900 Pan-African Congress in London, explicitly framing the \\"color line\\" as an issue and a dialogue that crossed national boundaries. In addition to the DuBois reference, Edwards also draws on Stuart Hall and the concept of articulation to develop a theoretical use of the French word d√©calage, \\"referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it, and applies the term to describe the way in which members of the black diaspora share similar conditions of oppression yet often find ourselves on opposite ends of the political spectrum‚Äîfor example, black writers seeking solace from Jim Crow in Paris, while simultaneously Africans were struggling against French colonialism. These countering political locations create tensions within our diaspora, but Edwards does not see these sites of difference as global movement killer...[instead] that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion.\\" Reception =Reviews= The Practice of Diaspora received widely favorable reviews. In Modern Fiction Studies, Michelle Stephens wrote, \\"With The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism, Brent Edwards has changed the very landscape of transnational black studies, showing what we have lost by not developing a more multilingual approach to black cultural studies and texts.\\" Writing in Crisis Magazine, Angela Ards said Edwards > \\"has been hailed as one of the most promising emerging scholars of African > American letters.

One day while watching a TV show, they realize that humans have created a negative image in their minds about snakes and decide to come up with a way to change these perceptions about them. While Chirmiri plans to threaten humans, Ichha believes that perhaps, there might be a more peaceful way to go about with this and comes to earth to change their perceptions. She appears in a temple, before a pandit who worships snake deities and he tells her about the Pratap Family; a simple and loving Pehalwaan family. She befriends Appu who knows about her secret but problems arise when she falls in love with Babbal and must hide her true identity from him. Meanwhile, Chirmiri who's jealous of Ichha attempts to sabotage her mission on various occasions but fails each time. On the other hand, Vishaili, an evil snake of \\"Vishailgarh\\" who lost one of her family members because of Daadi's son, Shankar, vows to kill each and every member of his family and has since kidnapped him and held him hostage to find about the whereabouts of his family. During the Diwali celebration, rivals from the neighbourhood place a bomb in the cracker box at the \\"Pratap House\\". Appu unknowingly lights the bomb thinking it's a firecracker and it explodes. Babbal saves Appu but gets severely injured and eventually breathes his last. To bring Babbal back to life, Ichha performs a puja called \\"Sanjhapratyarpan\\" where she gives half her life to Babbal.

After many failed attempts, Babbal decides to make Ichha jealous by flirting with Amrita. Amrita falls for Babbal and it creates a rift between Iccha and Babbal. Prabal who can now read women's minds, mistakes Amrita to be in love with Babbal and informs Daadi who plans to get them married. However, Vishnaini, Vishaili 's sister and Queen of Vishailgarh allows this on the condition that Babbal be turned into a snake through a process called Naag- Atmikaran. Ichha interrupts the process causing Babbal to be hypnotised by Vishaili. Vishnaini arrives at Pratap House as Vishaili's mother to make sure everything goes according to their plan. Meanwhile, Ichha enters Vishailgarh and fetches a diamond which causes the Vishailgarh Sisters to take their snake form during Babbal and Vishaili's wedding and they escape soon afterward. Ichha finds out that she was born as a human and the former queen of Vishailgarh turned her into a naagin so Sipili and Sheshu had to save her. Ichha gets permission to marry Babbal and then she confesses her love to him. Ichha and Babbal finally get married after they defeat Vishali and Vishnaini. Ichha had to defeat Sursuri a naagin who was jealous because Ichha married a human and who was creating trouble between Ichha and Babbal. Babbal eventually finds out that Ichha is a naagin but then eventually accepts her because she has saved his life during the Diwali incident. After the whole family finds out that Ichha is a naagin, Daadi get very furious and decides to kick her out of the house. Chanchal was very mad at Ichha but then Sipili tells her that Ichha saved her son from dying. Just before Ichha was leaving the house, Lord Shiva comes to the house and tells them that Ichha is a good naagin and she just came on Earth to change people's negative perception on snakes. The whole family then accepts Ichha and the series ends. It is observed that there will be a second season with Ichha's daughter Dhari.

He married Beverley Victoria Sularz (1916‚Äì2012), and they had two daughters and a son (Floyd Almer Bagley II, nicknamed \\"Spud\\" who died in 1970). Military and legal career Bagley enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps as World War II began, and served twenty years, retiring in 1959 after the Korean War from a posting at headquarters. He attended American University's Washington College of Law. After 11 years as a civilian, Bagley re-enlisted around the time of his son Spud's death. Bagley served from 1970 until 1972 as a judge advocate general (military judge) at Quantico Marine Base. After his final retirement (with the rank of Captain), Bagley remained active in the American Legion, Forty and Eight (an elite group within the American Legion), Veterans of Foreign Wars and Marine Corps League, as well as a judge advocate with the Virginia American Legion, 3rd Marine Division Association and National Sojourners. For six of the eleven years between Bagley's service as a Marine Corps attorney and as a military judge, he was town attorney for Dumfries, Virginia. He helped organize the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia association (and served as its director), and was active in the Virginia Bar Association, Prince William Bar Association and Delta Theta Phi law fraternity. He also owned the \\"Potomac News\\" for a time and led the Eastern Prince William Chamber of Commerce for a term. Other memberships included Masons (Alexandria Scottish Rite) and Acca Temple Shrine. Political career Bagley was active in his local county Democratic party, as well as that for the 8th Congressional district. Upon retiring as a military judge, he was elected county attorney for Prince William County, Virginia, and served from 1972 to 1976. After major redistricting following the 1970 census, all three of the delegates representing Prince William County changed in the 1975 election, as the district now designated the 41st linked Loudoun County with the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park in Prince William County. Bagley, Earl E. Bell and David G. Brinkley were elected to replace Stanley A. Owens, William R. Murphy and Kenneth B. Rollins.Cynthia Miller Leonard (ed.) General Assembly of Virginia July 30, 1619-January 11, 1978: A Bicentennial Register of Members (Richmond, 1978) Bagley established a private legal practice and served part-time position as a legislature until defeated by Republican Jack Rollinson in 1985. Following the 1980 census, the three-man delegation from Prince William County was split into individual districts. Thus Bagley, Brinkley and Harry J. Parrish were jointly elected from District 23 in the 1981 election, but in 1983 Bagley won re-election from District 52. During his legislative tenure, Bagley chaired the State Commission on Veterans Affairs, which funded creation of a veterans home in Roanoke, as well as served on the Dulles International Airport Development Commission (like his predecessor Stanley Owens). He was involved in two controversies. In 1980, he was accused of creating an additional judgeship in Prince William County in hopes that his fellow legislators would select him to fill it, as did not happen. Also, in 1982, Bagley authored a bill which the legislature passed but governor Charles Robb refused to sign as contrary to the First Amendment until its new criminal libel provision was removed. That would have criminalized intentional circulation of false written statements in an election campaign. Bagley lost his re-election race in 1985.

The song, produced with music producer Rick Rubin in 1997 during the sessions for Adore album, was removed from the album at the last second by band frontman Billy Corgan, who did so as a last-ditch effort to keep the record company from releasing it as a single against his wishes. A heavily reworked version was recorded for their 2000 album Machina II without Rubin's help, but the song would go unreleased for sixteen years until being put on the extended re-issue of Adore in 2014. Background and recording After the band's breakthrough success with the very guitar-heavy Siamese Dream album in 1993 among the grunge movement of the early 1990s, the band moved into a more eclectic collection of music in their next album, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. The band retained their guitar-driven sound, but also experimented in other musical sounds, most notably their single \\"1979\\", which had a stripped down, simple guitar and electronic sounds. The song ended up being the band's biggest hit, reaching number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. The song's success inspired frontman Billy Corgan to pursue a more minimalist and electronic sound for their next album, which would be 1998's Adore.Graff, Gary. \\"Smashing Pumpkins‚ÄîRave of the Future,\\" Guitar World. December 1996. However, the sessions were very long and difficult for the band; after the sprawling and massively successful album, Corgan found himself facing many difficult issues, including musical burnout, the absence of his \\"best friend and musical soul mate in the band\\" Jimmy Chamberlin, who was kicked out of his band due to continued issues with drug addiction, the end of his marriage, and the death of his mother to cancer.Corgan, Billy. \\"Starcrossed, and subsequently, a door is opened (1997).\\" The Confessions of Billy Corgan. April 12, 2005. The band's record label and management, growing concerned with the album's new direction and lack of progress, decided to send influential music producer Rick Rubin to assist Corgan in the studio. Corgan agreed to work with him on a song, the result being \\"Let Me Give the World to You\\". Corgan enjoyed working with Rubin on the track, but felt creative control slipping away, and limited his input to the one song. The track was considered to be on the album until just before the release of the album - it was completely mixed and mastered with the rest of the album, with it being planned as the album closer. Corgan felt that while it didn't really fit well Adore's artistic direction, putting it at the end of the album helped it stand out less, and would serve as his backup plan as a future single if the album's new direction wasn't well received. Plans changed when Corgan learned at the last second that his record label was insisting that it instead be the album's lead single. Corgan felt that the poppy, upbeat sound misrepresented the album's more somber and introspective direction. Corgan explained: > And the true story is, I handed in the record to the record company. And I > get the call, they want to make ‚ÄòLet Me Give the World to You‚Äô the first > single. And I was like, ‚ÄòHell, no.‚Äô And the only way I could stop them was > to take it off the record. Someone asked me about this, ‚ÄòIt sounds like it > could have been a hit song at that time, so why take it off the record?‚Äô And > I said, ‚ÄòBecause I spent a whole f‚Äîing year trying to make this avant-garde > thing.‚Äô ‚ÄòPerfect‚Äô or ‚ÄòAva Adore‚Äô were more representative [of the album], > and now we‚Äôre gonna release the song with the dry, milquetoast production. > And it isn‚Äôt even as avant-garde as the stuff on Mellon Collie, much less > Adore! I didn‚Äôt want to step back to simple pop [on the single], and then > try to sell this avant-garde record! It wasn‚Äôt that I hated it, or even that > I hated what Rick had done. He did a great job. It was more that I didn‚Äôt > want to blow up everything I‚Äôd done for this one song. So the song had to > go. And in the basement it went, for sixteen or eighteen years. With the song being cut from the album, \\"Ava Adore\\" and \\"Perfect\\" would subsequently be the singles released from the album in its place. Release and promotion While the song was withheld from the final version of Adore original release in 1998, a different, alternate version of the song was recorded and released on Machina II/The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music in 2000. The original Adore version was finally released in 2014, on the extended re-issue of Adore, sixteen years after its initial planned release on Adore. The song was debuted by the band putting it up for streaming on YouTube in August, followed by its official release on the Adore reissue in September. Reception Reception for the Adore version of the song was generally positive, with many journalists noting that it would have fit well into the rest of the band's catalogue of songs in the 1990s. Rolling Stone praised the song for being more \\"upbeat\\" and \\"straightforward\\" than their 1998 singles for Adore, concluding that \\"It's got all the marks of the Pumpkins' big hits, making the decision to hold it in favor of \\"Ava Adore\\" all the more frustrating.\\" Both Colin Joyce of Spin and Michael Nelson of Stereogum asserted that it sounded like it belonged on Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, the former calling it \\"essential listening\\" and the latter calling it \\"a really good song\\". Exclaim! praised the song as well, calling it \\"immaculately produced\\" and disagreeing with Corgan's notion that it wouldn't have fit on Adore's original release. The Machina II version of the song generally received less attention, due to the album being released for free on the internet just before the band's 2000 breakup, but still received positive marks from critics. Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club referred to the track as the most \\"shocking\\" of the album, referring to it as \\"prettier and more accessible than virtually anything the band has done\\".

There was an uprising against police violence in Liberty City, Florida; multiracial coalitions propelled Harold Washington to the mayor‚Äôs office in Chicago; and the presidential campaign of Jesse Jackson was gathering steam. As a young activist and campus organizer, Kelley was part of the movement that pushed the University of California system to divest from its holdings in South Africa, but he was also discovering a tradition of black radical organizing closer to home,\\" namely the Communist Party in Alabama, which became the topic of his dissertation and then the book. Kelley published Hammer and Hoe with the University of North Carolina Press in 1990. A 25th anniversary edition, with a new preface, was published in 2015. Subject matter Hammer and Hoe describes the Communist Party's role \\"in the fight for racial equality in the south, specifically Alabama, where segregation was most oppressive...[The] communist party tried to secure racial, economic, and political reforms.\\" Writing at The Nation, Sarah Jaffe says, \\"Kelley details in wonderfully vivid prose how black workers in Alabama made communism their own, blending the teachings of Marx and Lenin with those of the black church and the lessons of decades of resistance to slavery, segregation, and racist terrorism.\\" Reviewing Hammer and Hoe for American Quarterly, historian David Roediger described Kelley's methodological approach: \\"Kelley asks not whether the Communist party was good (or correct or independent) but how the party came to attract a substantial number of African-American workers in Alabama and to energize their struggles [emphasis in the original]. Or, more exactly he asks how these black workers could embrace and use the Communist party as a vehicle for organizing themselves. He insists on measuring radicalism not by its ideological purity but by its ability to interact with a received culture to generate bold class organizations.\\" Reception Roediger praised Hammer and Hoe as \\"superbly crafted...a story that is fresh in every way.\\" For Hammer and Hoe, Kelley won the Elliott Rudwick Prize from the Organization of American Historians, the Outstanding Book Award from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights in North America, and the Francis Butler Simkins Award from the Southern Historical Association. In 2015, Jaffe wrote that the book on \\"what might have seemed to be a fairly esoteric topic yet offered lessons that activists have been drawing on for twenty-five years. Throughout that time, the book has remained in print, winning awards and, more important to Kelley, a place in the hearts and strategic thinking of decades of young organizers struggling with the questions of race, gender, class, and solidarity.\\" References External links * 25th Anniversary Edition of Hammer and Hoe at the University of North Carolina Press 1990 non- fiction books University of North Carolina Press books Labor history of the United States Books about labor history American history books Books about communism History of Alabama 20th century in Alabama African- American history of Alabama Labor relations in Alabama ","title":"Hammer and Hoe"},{"id":"51284881","text":"Greenfield Public Square Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district located in Greenfield, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 52 resources, including 42 contributing buildings, one contributing site, six noncontributing buildings, and three noncontributing objects. The historic district covers part of the city's central business district in the center of the original town plat. There is a significant number of one- and two-story, brick, commercial buildings, as well as a few three-story structures. The Commercial Italianate style is dominant. While the vast majority of the buildings are commercial buildings, there are four government buildings in the district: the Adair County Courthouse (1892), public library (1916), city hall (1930), and the municipal light plant (1940). Besides the courthouse, the other buildings that are individually listed on the National Register include Warren Opera House Block and Hetherington Block (1896), Adair County Democrat-Adair County Free Press Building (1903), and the Hotel Greenfield (1920). The most unique feature of the district is the square itself, which is the contributing site. It is a Lancaster Square, of which there was only one other in an Iowa county seat, Fort Dodge. Unlike Greenfield, the courthouse in Fort Dodge was never in the square. In a Lancaster Square the streets enter the square in the middle of the surrounding blocks rather than at the corners (a Shelbyville Square), which is the most common form of public square in Iowa. The streets that surround the square are not named, so building addresses are rendered with the building number and then \\"Public Square.\\" Building numbers begin on the west side of South First Street with 102 and follow clock-wise around the square ending at the east side of South First Street with 362.

It lies to the east of Bedminster railway station and south of the Bristol to Exeter line. The park features tennis courts, a bowling green, a marked route for joggers, various exercise stations and a children's play area. History The park was established in the 1880s following the expansion of Bedminster as a residential and industrial area within Bristol. The council bought of land from Sir John Henry Greville Smyth for ¬£20,678 (now ¬£), though the land had been used as an unofficial open space and meeting area for some time before this. By 1887, a children's play area had been installed which became immediately popular. The streets around the park were laid out in 1891. By 1898, four rangers were permanently employed in the park, and a bandstand had been installed. Several drinking fountains and a circular pond had also been established. In 1984, a Water Maze was built in the park, modelled on the bosses on the roof of the church of St Mary Redcliffe. It was built over a 12th-century pipeline supplying water from a spring at Knowle Hill to Redcliffe, which is the subject of the annual St Mary Redcliffe Pipe Walk. The maze was opened in conjunction with work elsewhere to stop sewage water discharging into the River Avon. Events A number of annual events take place in the park. It is a performance venue for the Art on the Hill Arts Trail, which has been held on the first weekend in October since 2007. The park has also hosted a number of open-air films, profits from which are used towards its upkeep.

The vehicles were made by Sidney Holes Electric Vehicles, of Brighton, Sussex. They were designed out of Holes' experience of doorstep milk delivery, through Holes and Davigdor Dairies. Both pedestrian controlled vehicles (PCVs) and ride-on models were produced, and entered the market around 1947. The company was bought by Stanley Engineering in the 1960s, and sold to Crompton Electricars in 1972. Some Manulectric models were subsequently manufactured by Harbilt Electric Trucks. History Manulectrics were made by Sidney Holes Electric Vehicles, who were based in Brighton, Sussex. The vehicles were designed out of Holes' own experience of milk delivery in the South Downs area, through the retailing business of Holes and Davigdor Dairies. In 1947, Sidney Holes were selling 3-wheeled PCVs, fitted with a motor and a 24-volt battery. The bodywork was fabricated from steel, and the vehicle could carry 24 milk crates, 16 in the body and 8 on the roof. Those in the body were mounted on runners, so that they could slide out to access the bottles. It had a range of . The 1-ton version of their PCV was given a 2-day road test by L J Cotton for Commercial Motor in August 1951. By this time, steel had been replaced by extrusions and sheets of light alloy, to reduce the weight of the vehicle. The battery was mounted in the centre of the vehicle, to maintain stability, and the electric motor was mounted above the rear axle, powering both rear wheels through helical gears, to provide good traction in icy conditions. The single front wheel was steered by a tiller, and because it was mounted in front of the load compartment, could be turned through 90 degrees to left or right, making the vehicle highly manoeuvrable. No reverse gear was provided, but this was achieved by lifting a safety catch and turning the tiller through 180 degrees in relation to the wheel. All controls were mounted on the tiller, and the model tested was called the Marathon. They offered a lightweight alloy refuse-collecting body on their standard 3-wheeled PCV chassis in 1952. The chassis had the battery, electric motor and gearbox located near the centre of the rear axle. Smooth starting was obtained by fitting a centrifugal clutch and two stage control, using a switch and resistance. Transition between the stages was controlled by an automatic hydraulic dashpot, and helical gearing and a differential in the rear axle ensured that the vehicle was very manoeuvrable. The 24-volt battery, manufactured by Kathanode, gave it a range of with a full load. The load space was , and the refuse collector could be tipped to either side or to the rear. At the 1953 Dairy Show, Sidney Holes showcased the new Standon model, developed from their 4-wheeled PCV. It included a platform at the front, on which the controls were mounted, and which provided standing space for the roundsman. A vertical steering column and wheel were mounted in the centre of the platform, and the automatic controller was activated by a foot-operated switch. Construction was of light alloy, to reduce the weight, and top speed was . The vehicle had a range of , and was aimed at rounds in densely populated areas, where the task would be too strenuous for a roundsman with a PCV, but the extra cost of a heavier vehicle could not be justified. Job's Dairies of Hanworth, Middlesex, bought several Standon 25 cwt vehicles in 1955. The cab was not fitted with doors, providing quick access to the driving position by the roundsman. The vehicle could carry 110 gallons of milk, with crates stacked three high, and had a range of about , based on 200 stops and hilly terrain. Maximum speed was and this was achieved by fitting a 48-volt, 160 Amp-hour battery and a motor. The specification also included a double- reduction hypoid gearbox and hydraulically operated brakes on all four wheels. The Metropolitan borough of Wandsworth bought a Manulectric Standon model in 1957, to assist in the maintenance of electric street lamps, as they replaced gas lamps. The 160 Amp-hour battery gave a range of per day, enabling the operator to service between 35 and 45 lamp standards. Manulectric displayed a pedestrian controlled vehicle and a conventional driven vehicle at the 1958 Dairy Show. The fleet of Windsor and Eton Dairies included 4 Manulectric 13 cwt standing driver vehicles with solid tyres in 1963. The Model 730, current in 1965, could cover with a road speed of . It included a dry grocery compartment, as well as a 21-crate load space. As a result of using a system of flow-line building for the vehicles, the price had not been increased for 5 years, despite rising labour costs. In 1967, the Model 730 Mark III was shown at a public cleansing exhibition. It came with a tipping body, and could cover per day at a top speed of . By this time, Manulectrics were built with Pulsomatic thyristor controls, bought in from Cableform Ltd of Romily, Cheshire. Tests had revealed that this increased the range by some 25 per cent. =Acquisition= By 1965, Manulectrics were being manufactured by Stanley Engineering Co Ltd, who were based at Exeter Airport. At some point ownership passed to L & P Engineering Co, who were also based in Exeter, as this was the company that sold the manufacturing rights for Manulectric PCVs to Crompton Electricars (formerly Morrison-Electricar) in 1972. Electricars had been built at Tredegar since 1968, and literature at the time stated that Manulectrics were suitable for use in hospitals and by municipal, commercial and industrial customers, as well as for the delivery of milk. At some point soon afterwards, and certainly prior to 1974, Harbilt Electric Trucks and Morrison-Electricar reached an agreement for a product exchange and rationalisation. Under the agreement, production of Harbilt milk floats would transfer from Market Harborough to Tredegar, and Morrison trucks would be handed over to Harbilt. This included some Manulectric trolley trucks, but details of the deal and the precise dates are a little sketchy, as a copy of the agreement has not been found. Preservation At least one Manulectric vehicle has been preserved. This is a 1961 Standon model, formerly owned by Jobs Dairies, and now owned by Paul Laurence. It carries the registration number 219 TPC, and according to the caption on the Classic Commercial Motor Vehicles website, was built by the Stanley Engineering Co Ltd, who were based at Egham, Surrey at the time.

History  The history of Kidmore House starts in Norman times, when Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville, was given the land on which the country house stands after the 1066 conquest. In 1158, his son Walter Giffard, Earl of Buckingham and Ermigardis his wife gave the land to a house of Augustinian friars when they founded the Abbey of Notley in Buckinghamshire. The Giffard's original charter, in Latin, which survives in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, was confirmed by King John I. The Abbey of Notley, together with other land in Caversham, continued with the friars until the dissolution of the Abbey in 1536 by King Henry VIII, who sold the estate and surrounding land to his Chief Disbursing Officer for the Royal Household. Kidmore House was completed in 1680 and was most likely constructed by his descendants. During mid eighteenth century the house was occupied by Thomas Willats Esq., (1732-1786), High Sheriff of Oxfordshire 1772‚Äì1773. His son Rev. Thomas Willats (1762-1831) married Elizabeth Laura Littlehales, a descendant of James II. The Rector inherited the house and was also made High Sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1792.

The murderer, a Sunni Muslim, Tanveer Ahmed, had driven from the English city of Bradford with the intent of confronting Shah about his claim to be a prophet. Shah had allegedly issued YouTube videos in which he claimed the status of a prophet. Because orthodox Sunni Muslims believe that Muhammad was the last prophet, Ahmed regarded Shah's claims as blasphemous and disrepectful to Islam, and worthy of death. Some Muslims and mosques in the UK, though opposed to IS and Al-Qaeda, praised his action. Murder Ahmed reached Glasgow on 24 March 2016 and confronted Shah as he served behind the counter in his shop in Shawlands. He demanded that Shah must retract his views. Shah declined to do so and offered to shake Ahmed's hand as a gesture of goodwill. Ahmed responded by drawing a knife and stabbing Shah repeatedly. Shah attempted to escape by running outside his shop, but Ahmed continued the attack despite the intervention of Shah's brother Athar. After Shah collapsed from his wounds, Ahmed stamped repeatedly on his head and face. He then walked a short distance to a bus shelter and waited for the police. When they arrived and approached him, he reportedly told them: \\"I respect what you do and I have nothing against you and so I am not going to hurt you. I have broken the law and appreciate how you are treating me.\\" =Motives for the murder= Following his arrest and remand to prison, Ahmed issued a statement through his lawyer explaining his motives for the murder: \\"This all happened for one reason and no other issues and no other intentions. Asad Shah disrespected the messenger of Islam the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Mr Shah claimed to be a Prophet.\\" Ahmed was an admirer of Mumtaz Qadri, a Pakistani Sunni who assassinated the Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer after Taseer suggested a relaxation in Pakistan's strict blasphemy laws. Like Qadri, who was hanged for the assassination, Ahmed belongs to a religious group called Dawat-e-Islami, which is dedicated to defending the honour of Muhammad. Dawat-e-Islami have stated that they do not condone Ahmed's crime. =Reaction to murder= The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, attended a vigil for Asad Shah, together with 500 other people. The Ahmadiyya community issued a statement about the murder that read: ‚ÄúIn any society, all members of the public have a right to safety and it is up to the Government and police to protect members of the public as best they can. In this context it is up to the Government to root out all forms of extremism and the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has been speaking about the importance of this for many years.\\" Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Statement - \\"Love For All, Hatred For None\\" The Ahmadiyya community are now conducting an anti-extremism campaign in Scotland. Representatives from the Sikh, Jewish and Christian communities attended the launch of the campaign and invitations were extended to the Glasgow Central Mosque and the Muslim Council of Scotland. The Guardian reported that both Mosque and Council declined the invitations \\"at the last minute\\" with apologies. =Victim= Asad Shah was 40 and was born in Rabwah, Pakistan.

On 9 August 2016, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 27 years in the High Court in Glasgow by Judge Lady Rae. The judge said Asad Shah was regarded by those who knew him as a \\"peaceful and peace-loving man and family man who went out of his way to show respect for those of any faith.\\" She said his murder was an \\"appalling display of merciless violence\\" and told Ahmed that he was responsible for the \\"barbaric, premeditated and wholly unjustified killing of a much loved man who was a pillar of the local community.\\" On hearing his sentence, the killer shouted: ‚ÄúMuhammad is the prophet, he is the only one.‚Äù His supporters in the public gallery chanted back to show their solidarity.

The direct connection between Green Violinist and its earlier counterpart was made explicitly during the artist's lifetime at his retrospective at Museum of Modern Art. In 1917, during his Second Russian Period, Chagall began accepting commissions to work on theater sets and costume design. In 1919, Chagall was commissioned to create a setting for the premier production of Alexis Granowsky‚Äôs Moscow State Jewish Theatre. Susan Compton provides an excellent description of the physical layout of Chagall‚Äôs work in the theater: ‚ÄúWhen he was done, his paintings ‚Äì in tempera and gouache on canvas ‚Äì decorated tall the walls and even the ceiling of the theater: four vertical panels between the windows on one side, on the themes of Music, Dance, Drama, and Literature [‚Ä¶] and a narrow frieze depicting a wedding feast [‚Ä¶] above them; one long composition, Introduction to the Jewish Theater [‚Ä¶], on the windowless wall opposite; a single panel, Love on the Stage [‚Ä¶], between the two entrance doors at the back of the theater; the stage curtain; and the ceiling painting, which depicted flying lovers[.]‚Äù Through the subject matter of the painting Introduction to the Jewish Theater, Chagall inserts himself as an important and defining voice for the new direction of Jewish Theater. There is extensive evidence of the profound affect Chagall's artistic style had on manner of acting that was adopted for the first production of the company, a collection of short plays written by Sholem Aleichem.  Details  The style of this work reflects the avant-garde styles that were common in Paris after Chagall relocated there in 1910, but the subject matter is highly indicative of his Hasidic roots in Russia. This is made particularly evident by the central figure of the fiddler, who was a ‚Äúvital presence in ceremonies and festivals‚Äù due to the Hasidic belief in achieving ‚Äúcommunion with God through music and dance‚Äù. This specific work, a re-working of a previous painting, demonstrates a degree of nostalgia for his own work. L. L. Zimmerman writes of Chagall's stylistic influence on the theatrical space his works occupied: ‚ÄúHis paintings and theatrical designs, with their complete disregard for the traditional mathematics of space and time, stand out uniquely among the other products of modern artistic and theatrical endeavor.‚Äù  Connection to Fiddler on the Roof  The connection between this painting and the 1964 Broadway musical, Fiddler on the Roof, is often interpreted in very different ways by various theater companies, art historians, and scholars. The musical takes its source material from The Tevye Stories by Sholem Aleichem. Evidence for the connection between Chagall's painting and the title of the musical can be found by placing the work within the context of the Russian Revolution, as it ‚Äúasserts the priority of a specific ethnic culture against the hegemony of Russian society, from which the artist had been institutionally excluded since youth.‚Äù There is also evidence that Chagall often showcased the people of the shtetl, who are at the heart of Sholem Aleichem's stories and, consequently Fiddler on the Roof, in a very sympathetic light. In addition to the ideological similarities between Sholem Aleichem and Chagall's works, the case for a connection between the painting and the musical is strengthened by the fact that the 1964 production of the musical was designed by Boris Aronson, who also wrote one of the earliest monographs on Chagall.

Between 1897 and 1900, the C&O; constructed a new brick station; the 1880 station was converted for use as a freight house. The last C&O; trains on the \\"Big Sandy\\" ran in 1958, ending passenger service to Catlettsburg, although some intercity trains continued to pass. A clause in the original deed required the property to revert to the heirs of its original owners; the heirs declined, and the property was instead transferred to the city. The freight house burned in 1964. =Amtrak service= 1975 map of the James Whitcomb Riley and the Mountaineer showing their split at Tri-State Station Amtrak took over intercity passenger service in 1971. The James Whitcomb Riley passed through Catlettsburg, stopping at nearby Ashland and Huntington but not Catlettsburg. On July 31, 1974, it was announced that a new station would be constructed at Catlettsburg to allow trains to bypass downtown Ashland. The new system would be jointly funded by Amtrak and the Chesapeake and Ohio. On March 24, 1975, Amtrak abandoned Ashland station and began serving Tri-State Station, located between Catlettsburg and Ashland and named for the three-state area it served. The James Whitcomb Riley was supplemented by the simultaneous addition of the Mountaineer service between Norfolk and Chicago, which ran combined with the James Whitcomb Riley west of Ashland. The Mountaineer was replaced by the Hilltopper, whose western terminus was at Tri-State Station, on June 1, 1977. Although the James Whitcomb Riley continued to serve stations west of Catlettsburg, the two trains arrived at Tri-State Station hours apart, effectively eliminating connections between the two halves of the Mountaineer's former route. The James Whitcomb Riley was renamed as the Cardinal later that year; the Hilltopper was discontinued on October 1, 1979, leaving just the Cardinal to serve the station. Around 1988, the station was renamed Catlettsburg. The Cardinal served the station until Ashland Transportation Center opened on March 11, 1998. The Tri-State Station building remains extant but vacant. =Restoration= The city used the Catlettsburg station building as a youth center and women's club for a number of years. By 2004 it was in poor condition; a volunteer group restored the building in 2005 and 2006. A historic caboose was acquired and restored next to the station in 2010. The station is used as a visitor's center during the city's annual Labor Day festivities, which attract some 10,000 tourists. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 2012.

It was founded in 2009 by author Joshua Foer and documentary filmmaker/author Dylan Thuras. It catalogs unusual and obscure travel destinations via user-generated content. The editorial articles comprise a mixture of feature and news articles on topics including history, science and food, in addition to travel and exploration, as well as hosting a collaborative, definitive guide to the world's most obscure places. History Co-founder Dylan Thuras at BookCon in June 2019 Thuras and Foer met in 2007, and soon discussed ideas for a different kind of atlas, featuring places not commonly found in guidebooks. They hired a web designer in 2008 and launched Atlas Obscura in 2009. In 2010, they organized the first of the international events known as Obscura Day. According to Thuras, one of Atlas Obscura's main goals is \\"Creating a real- world community who are engaging with us, each other and these places and getting away from their computers to actually see them.\\" Atlas Obscura has since originated Atlas Obscura Societies organizing local experiences in seven cities: New York, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and Seattle. In 2014, Atlas Obscura hired journalist David Plotz as its CEO. In 2015, Atlas Obscura raised its first round of major funding, securing $2M from a range of investors and angels including The New York Times. In September 2016, the company published its first book titled Atlas Obscura: An Explorer's Guide to the World's Hidden Wonders written by co-founders Foer and Thuras, and Ella Morton under Workman Publishing Company. In 2016, the company expanded into travel with its first two guided trips. Now, in 2019, Atlas Obscura leads unusual trips to places like Mexico to witness the Monarch butterfly migration or Lisbon to learn how to make pasteis de nata. In late 2017, following another funding boost of $7.5M, the site launched Gastro Obscura, a food section covering \\"the distinctive food locations of the world.\\" Samir Patel, formerly of Archaeology magazine became the Editorial Director in 2020. Prior to Patel, Sommer Mathis, formerly of The Atlantic CityLab, was editor-in-chief for three years. In March 2020, Altas Obscura announced new CEO Warren Webster, former president and CEO of Coveteur and co- founder of Patch, almost five months after former CEO David Plotz announced his departure. Atlas Obscura's General Manager of Trips, Mike Parker, received praise for his division's vocal reassurance of travelers displaced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Parker explained to customers via email/blog, \\"When you join one of our trips, we want you to have peace of mind. We want you to know that, if circumstances change, we‚Äôve got your back. If you join a 2020 departure and ultimately decide that it‚Äôs not the right time or place to travel, we‚Äôll help you update your plans by transferring your reservation to a future date, or to another trip, without cancellation penalties.

She was one of the founding staff of the Native American Educational Services College and was inducted into the Chicago Women's Hall of Fame and the Chicago Senior Citizens Hall of Fame. Early life Edith Big Fire Johns was born January 19, 1915 on the Winnebago Reservation in Thurston County, Nebraska Her father was a member of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska and her mother was Nez Perce. From the age of eleven, Johns attended school away from her family at an American Indian boarding school. In 1937, she completed nursing school in Ft. Wayne, Indiana and then moved to Chicago. Career Johns worked at several hospitals in the Chicago area, including the Bethany Hospital and the Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center. Johns spent a decade as a caseworker at St. Augustine's Center for the American Indian and by 1971 was the chief caseworker. Johns was very involved in the urban Indian movement of the 1960s and 1970s, giving speeches and attending meetings. In 1968, Johns attended the National Urban Indian Consultation in Seattle, which was founded to focus on the problems of urban Native Americans, as the National Congress of American Indians was seen as too focused on reservation issues. Johns was one of the founders of the Chicago American Indian Center and served on its Board of Directors between 1960 and 1971. The center offered cultural programs and fellowship allowing members to share their skills. Johns was a skilled beadworker and shared her knowledge of the craft.

NAES was founded in 1974 to address the lack of higher education opportunities for urban Indians and Johns was hired as an instructor in 1975. She taught a course, \\"Dynamics of Community Health\\" which dealt with health care, development and patient rights. Johns worked at the college until 1978, when she left to work as the assistant nursing director of Somerset Residential Care Center. Johns returned to college, attending the College of St. Francis in Joliet, Illinois and earned her bachelor's degree in 1977. At the age of 65, Johns joined the Peace Corps and served as a nurse in Dominica for two years. She also traveled to Australia and New Zealand to meet with indigenous people there.

FCP is valuable to clients of all children and can be applied in many different healthcare settings. Description FCP uses different types of implementations such as intervention planning, providing learning opportunities and information, teaching interaction skills, delivering family therapy sessions, and teaching non-judgment and the positives of non-judgment. To make FCPs successful, it is important to learn about the family system and to properly assess the intervention that respects the participating family.Hecimovic, A., Powell, T. H., & Christensen, L. (1999) and that supports families in meeting their needs. In D. B. Zager (Ed.), Autism: Identification, education, and treatment (2nd ed., pp. 261‚Äì299). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum Family centered practices can be used for many different situations. They can be used for cases such as child abuse and/or neglect. Using the FCP approach may be difficult in the case of caregivers who do not see a need for change.Kemp, S. P., Marcenko, M. O., Lyons, S. J., & Kruzich, J. M. (2014). Strength-based practice and parental engagement in child welfare services: An empirical examination. Children and Youth Services Review, 47(P1), 27-35 When trials of family centered practices were used by the Washington State Social and Health Services, 6% of all participants were deemed to have success and see change. In those trials, circumstances, where children had been removed from their home and placed into another home (i.e. foster care or group home), were taken into account.  Background  The idea of FCP came from Dr John Sullivan, at the Institute for Family Centered Services. Sullivan's goal was to show families that they were important and influential in a child's life. Interventions were designed to assist families in degrading situations. Participants were taught positive peer culture, and the importance of each individual's dignity, respect, and skill. The first participants were brought to the attention of John Sullivan from the Juvenile Justice system. After success was shown, the Family and Children's Social Services began to participate. By 1989, there were multiple organizations using FCP techniques. By the 2000s, the practice had spread to nearly every U.S. state and the idea became a normal intervention in the lives of troubled, abused, neglected, and maltreated children and their families.  Applications  FCP focuses on the family as the primary unit of attention while encouraging strength, respect, and support within the family. Instructors are most often social workers. They begin their work by evaluating the family with the child/children and the family without the child/children. The goal from the evaluation is to build consistent, ethical, and effective child welfare practice within the family. Once the evaluation step is complete, the instructor focuses on building a program in conjunction with the family, rather than simply dictating one. This ensures that the caregivers maintain authority and improve program results. The program concludes after a set period of time, that is usually set by the court or social worker, depending on the severity of the child's case. In developed countries, such as Australia, most hospital settings claim to be family-centered. This means the hospitals have implemented an attitude where they believe that parents are essential to their child's well-being, and therefore crucial to the decision- making process regarding their health.  Effectiveness  After consultations with FCPs, the results in families differ, as no two families are the same. Each family has its own beliefs and values, which the social worker must take into account while helping create a program designed for them. After the evaluation step, if the social worker was able to find out the severity of the child's maltreatment, the goal has been met. Even if use of an FCP is not continued, other steps can be taken to provide for the safety and well-being of the child.

At one time it was highly fashionable, drawing the elite of Buenos Aires for vacations. Early years (to 1940s) In the mid-19th century the beach was the location of a small port. The rancher Patricio Peralta Ramos created the first settlement by the sea. The railway arrived in 1886, bringing the first vacationers. At first the hotels were simple, until the luxurious 3-story Bristol Hotel was built, occupying three blocks. The Bristol opened in 1888, and was patronised by wealthy families of Buenos Aires and other parts of the country who would come to bathe in the sea. Many of the leading citizens of Buenos Aires came to the opening of the Hotel Bristol by overnight train. The first wooden ramblas (promenades) were opened, and the first residences began to be built. When Mar del Plata was declared a city in 1907 the resort was called the \\"Biarritz of Argentina\\". In 1913 the French rambla was opened, with ceramic pavements from Belgium, balustrades and Greco-Roman statues. In the late 1920s wealthy families began to build chalets and mansions near the Hotel Bristol, and spent their days at the beach. They would live in Mar del Plata from November until Easter. The local citizens began to use the beach, calling their section the Playa Popular. Some of the wealthy visitors moved away to the Playa Chica and Playa Grande south of the city.

In 1999 new sand was brought in, and it is now almost from the promenade to the shore. Recent times (from 2000) The beach is the most popular in Mar del Plata, mainly due to its proximity to the commercial centre of the city. Playa Bristol and Plaza Colon, in front of the Casino Central, are the focus of the town for visitors. Both the beach and the water often contain garbage such as plastic bottles or cigarette packages, although six tons of garbage are collected every day. There are two public washrooms. The beach covers . In the high season there are 20,000 visitors each day. There is only a gentle surf, but many of the visitors swim. Four lifeguards rescue five people each day, on average.

The younger Palmer grew up in Malibu, California. Palmer attended Santa Monica College before transferring to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned a degree in finance. Palmer then earned a Juris Doctor from Pepperdine School of Law. Career After clerking for a California superior court judge, Palmer decided to pursue real estate development of multifamily housing instead of law as a profession, founding GH Palmer Associates in 1978. Palmer opened his first major development in Santa Clarita, California in 1985. During the 1990s, Palmer focused on building more than 2000 market-rate housing in downtown Los Angeles and its suburbs.http://www.cp- dr.com/articles/node-2401 In 2001, Palmer completed the 632-unit Medici, the first of a series of downtown Italian-inspired apartment blocks situated beside freeways, which coincided with a revival of downtown Los Angeles. Other buildings in the \\"Renaissance Collection\\" built by Palmer include the Orsini, Visconti, Piero, Da Vinci, and Lorenzo. In 2006, Palmer applied for the Piero II, a mixed-use project, and requested that the City waive the affordable housing requirements.http://www.cp-dr.com/articles/node-2401 The City denied the waiver and Palmer sued the City of Los Angeles (Palmer/Sixth Street Properties LP v. City of Los Angeles) claiming the City's affordable housing zoning requirements in the Central City West specific plan violated the Costa- Hawkins Act.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1077003.html In 2009, the California Court of Appeal ruled that \\"as applied to Palmer's proposed project, the affordable housing ordinance conflicts with and is preempted by the vacancy decontrol provisions of the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act.\\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1077003.html The City of Los Angeles later sued Palmer for negligence after another development, the Da Vinci, intentionally set fire by an arsonist currently in jail, damaged the adjacent freeway and a nearby city government building, eventually settling the case for $400,000. Palmer's most recent building, Broadway Palace Apartments, was completed in early 2017. Broadway Palace Apartments is designed in the Beaux-Arts style with a plaster and cast concrete ground level and top story, separated from the terracotta brick middle stories by string courses, moldings and changes in materials. Notable features include arched openings along the top story, dentils, brackets, pilasters and capitals. The facade fenestration and articulation resembles the historic 1920s-era buildings located on Broadway but different enough to appear new. Palmer has clashed with local government officials and activists, in part due to criticism of the style of his apartment buildings. Councilman Ed Reyes also criticized Palmer for the accidental destruction of an 1887 Victorian-style building. In 2015, Eddie Kim of the Los Angeles Downtown News described Palmer as both the \\"most prolific\\" and \\"most controversial\\" developer in downtown Los Angeles. Palmer, a strong opponent of mandatory affordable housing requirements for real estate development, appears in the Paradise Papers in connection with a Bermuda offshore to hold the registration for his private jet, which is done for security and maintenance reasons, yet he still pays the required California assesses property taxes on aircraft, which Bermuda does not.

Early on, it carried the title Malheur Enterprise and Vale Plaindealer.Malheur Enterprise, WorldCat its circulation has been estimated at 1,207 to 1,277.http://www.orenews.com/vale  Genesis in boosterism  Masthead from the December 4, 1909 issue (Vol. 1, No. 3) The Enterprise started out as a regional booster, with financial backing from Major Leigh Hill (L. H.) French.https://archive.org/stream/whoswhoinnewyork00hame_0#page/512/mode/1up French, who had recently been promoting mining projects in the Klondike gold rush in Alaska and was related by marriage to the Studebaker automobile family, promoted mining, and prizefights. With his backing, the paper envisioned oil wells and irrigation projects as driving a prosperous future for the region. John Rigby, who became the paper's second manager in 1912, has been credited with rallying public opinion behind the Warm Springs Irrigation District. George Huntington Currey purchased the paper in 1917, and then traded it in 1920 for the Baker City Herald. In 1922 brothers Winfield S. and Harry Brown, who had founded other eastern Oregon papers, purchased an interest in the paper.Oregon Exchanges, Vol. 5, No. 3, p. 31. The Enterprise played a role in the election of U.S. senator Robert Stanfield. The Enterprise was sold in 1930. A 1950 book covering the county's early days identified the Enterprise as \\"one of three newsy newspapers still published in Malheur county.\\"  Renewed vigor in the 2010s  By 2015, the paper was on the verge of collapse. In the estimation of renowned journalist Les Zaitz, it was \\"arguably the worst newspaper in Oregon...full of government press releases.\\" In that year, Zaitz was approaching retirement from his multi-decade position as an investigative reporter for the Oregonian, and was planning to retire with his wife, Scotta Callister, at their Grant County ranch. But upon hearing about the Enterprise's troubles, he and Callister, who was retiring as editor of the Blue Mountain Eagle, along with his brother, Lyndon Zaitz, publisher of Keizertimes, formed the Malheur Enterprise Publishing Company in 2015 to purchase the paper. In a 2016 interview, Zaitz professed no grand ambitions with the paper. At the time of the purchase, the paper had but one reporter. Callister ran the paper for the first year, while Zaitz finished his tenure at the Oregonian. Zaitz brought a distinguished resume, having earned widespread recognition for his coverage of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the Rajneeshpuram community of the 1980s, and the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. He had also been a Pulitzer Prize finalist twice, for his coverage of non-profits and Mexican drug cartels.http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/les-zaitz By the time he took the helm, he was ready to fully embrace a turnaround, and insisted to his two reporters that they were going to be the \\"best there ever was,\\" and held their reporting to a high standard. He felt that local newspapers could serve as \\"laboratories\\" for the evolving news industry. In early 2017, the reporting team uncovered what would prove to be a major scandal. A man who killed his ex-wife, and whose arrest caused another death, had previously faked insanity to avoid prison on a kidnapping charge. When the Enterprise sought the release of more than 200 records related to his release, the Oregon Psychiatric Security Review Board sued the Enterprise and its editor. The Enterprise appealed to its readers for legal funds, and Zaitz told the review board that picking a fight with a small paper was like \\"poking a stick in a badger hole.\\" The Seattle Times published a column supporting the Enterprise,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/free-press-state-hits- tiny-paper-with-lawsuit-after-it-seeks-public-records/ and other influential people and agencies expressed support as well. Oregon governor Kate Brown ultimately intervened, ordering the records released. When Investigative Reporters and Editors conferred its national FOI (freedom of information) Award to the team of Zaitz, Braese and Caldwell, it marked the first time in the award's 20-year history that it went to a community paper. The team also earned one of three finalist spots for the 2017 annual award in the Scripps Howard Foundation's First Amendment category.Scripps Howard Awards honor the best in journalism with finalists in 15 categories, Scripps Howard Foundation, Kari Wethington, February 27, 2018.

The award includes the salary of one reporter, as well as extensive support and guidance for their reporting. In a 2018 editorial written under the Local Reporting Network program, Zaitz told the story of how the paper had effected the release of the documents, and stated that the records he had obtained would contribute to future reporting on related issues. In November 2018, Zaitz estimated that the paper's circulation had doubled, and revenue tripled, in the preceding three years.

Alpha Zeta led a movement of international Latin American fraternities that existed in the early part oft the 20th century before becoming defunct. Psi Alpha Kappa, founded at Lehigh University in the fall of 1900, was the first inter- collegiate Latin American fraternity to be established in the United States.

In 2016, NJPW produced three events under the Destruction name; Destruction in Tokyo on September 17, Destruction in Hiroshima on September 22, and Destruction in Kobe on September 25. The events featured nine matches each, six of which were contested for championships. These were events twelve to fourteen under the Destruction name. All three events aired live worldwide on NJPW World with the Kobe event also airing on pay-per-view (PPV) in Japan. Production =Background= 2016 was the first year in which NJPW holds three events under the Destruction name. From 2007 to 2013, NJPW held one Destruction event per year, expanding to two shows in 2014 and 2015. =Storylines= The Destruction shows featured nine professional wrestling matches, each of which involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Kushida, who defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Destruction in Tokyo Kenny Omega defended his status as the number one contender to the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Destruction in Hiroshima Destruction in Tokyo was main evented by Kushida defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Bushi. The two previously faced off for the title on February 14 at The New Beginning in Niigata, where Kushida retained the title. Afterwards, Bushi began eyeing a rematch opportunity with Kushida, which eventually came during the 2016 Best of the Super Juniors tournament, where Bushi defeated Kushida in their final round-robin match on June 6, eliminating the reigning IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship from the finals of the tournament. Following the match, Bushi made a challenge for a title match, which was made official on August 22, the day after Kushida had won the 2016 Super J-Cup. In the buildup to the title match, NJPW noted the similarities between the two wrestlers with both being 33-years old and having come to NJPW from other organizations (Kushida from Smash and Bushi from All Japan Pro Wrestling). Despite having already been granted the title shot by NJPW, Bushi suggested he would boycott the match unless he was nominated as the challenger by Kushida himself. After being pinned by Bushi in a six-man tag team match on September 12, Kushida officially appointed Bushi as his next challenger. Destruction in Tokyo would also feature another title match, where Katsuyori Shibata defended the NEVER Openweight Championship against Bobby Fish. This match was made as a result of events that took place at a Ring of Honor (ROH) event in Las Vegas, Nevada on August 20, where Fish successfully defended the ROH World Television Championship against Shibata. Fish would be the first junior heavyweight wrestler to challenge for the NEVER Openweight Championship since April 2014. In the week leading to the title match, Shibata was sidelined with a cervical spine injury, forcing him to miss NJPW's September 14 and 15 events. However, it was announced that the title match would go on as scheduled. Destruction in Hiroshima was main evented by Kenny Omega taking on Yoshi-Hashi. On August 14, Omega defeated Hirooki Goto in the finals to win the 2016 G1 Climax, becoming the first foreigner to win the annual tournament. During the tournament, Omega suffered three losses, against NEVER Openweight Champion Katsuyori Shibata, IWGP Intercontinental Champion Michael Elgin and Yoshi-Hashi. Omega's loss against Yoshi-Hashi in their opening match on July 22 was considered a major upset, and after winning the tournament Omega called the loss humiliating and nominated Yoshi-Hashi as the first challenger for his G1 Climax winning prize; a contract for an IWGP Heavyweight Championship match on January 4, 2017, at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome. The match was made official on August 22. Other featured matches included reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada taking on Bad Luck Fale. During the 2016 G1 Climax, Fale defeated Okada, who afterwards demanded a rematch with him. Due to Okada already being set to defend the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Naomichi Marufuji on October 10 at King of Pro-Wrestling, the title would not be on the line in the match with Fale. However, Fale stated that if he were to win at Destruction in Hiroshima, he wanted a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at NJPW's New Zealand event on November 12. Also on the card, reigning ROH World Champion Adam Cole returned to NJPW, taking on 2016 Best of the Super Juniors winner Will Ospreay. This would mark Cole's singles match debut in NJPW. On August 29, NJPW announced that the match would be contested for Cole's title. Destruction in Hiroshima's only title match would see The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) defend the IWGP Tag Team Championship against The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). The Young Bucks made a challenge for the \\"heavyweight\\" tag team title on August 21 after successfully defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against The Motor City Machine Guns. Though the two teams work in different weight divisions in NJPW, they had a history with each other from ROH, where the tag team division has no weight limits. This match would mark the first time in NJPW history that the reigning IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions challenge for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Destruction in Kobe was main evented by Michael Elgin taking on Tetsuya Naito. The match was originally announced as a \\"potential\\" IWGP Intercontinental Championship match, provided that Elgin first successfully defended the title against Donovan Dijak at an ROH event on August 27. Elgin went on to defeat Dijak to make the main event of Destruction in Kobe for the title. The match stemmed from the 2016 G1 Climax, where Naito defeated Elgin. Afterwards, Elgin offered a title match to Naito, who accepted. Though he took part in the tournament to crown the inaugural IWGP Intercontinental Champion in May 2011, this would mark Naito's first ever shot at the title. The event also featured outside participation from the Pro Wrestling Noah promotion with Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Naomichi Marufuji teaming with Toru Yano to take on the Chaos quartet of Gedo, Jado, Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi-Hashi. The match not only built up the IWGP Heavyweight Championship match between Okada and Marufuji, but also a GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship match between champions Kotoge and Harada and challengers Gedo and Jado. Toru Yano, who teamed with the Noah trio in the match, was also a member of Chaos, but held the GHC Tag Team Championship with Marufuji in Noah. This led to problems between Yano and Marufuji with the latter beginning to question his partner's ultimate allegiance in the week leading to Destruction in Kobe. The event's second title match was scheduled to feature Matt Sydal, Ricochet and Satoshi Kojima defending the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship against the Bullet Club trio of Adam Cole and The Young Bucks. The champions had won the title on July 3 by defeating another Bullet Club trio, made up of The Young Bucks and Kenny Omega. However, on the day of the show, the champions were stripped of the title due to Sydal failing to make the show because of travel issues with David Finlay replacing him in a new match for the now vacant title. Destruction in Kobe's undercard was also set to feature the culmination of a storyline, where Yoshitatsu had announced a fan poll on Twitter to decide whether Captain New Japan would get to remain a member of his anti-Bullet Club stable Hunter Club. Yoshitatsu had formed the group the previous April with Captain as its first member, but had recently become upset with his stablemates poor performances, which led to him creating the poll. Events =Destruction in Tokyo= Bushi, who captured the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Destruction in Tokyo Adam Cole, who successfully defended the ROH World Championship at Destruction in Hiroshima In the first title match of the show, Katsuyori Shibata defended the NEVER Openweight Championship against Bobby Fish. Throughout the match, Fish worked on Shibata's legitimately injured neck. At the end of the match, Shibata blocked Fish's brainbuster attempt, hit him with a headbutt and locked him in a sleeper hold, which he followed up with his finishing maneuver, the PK, to win the match and make his second successful defense of the NEVER Openweight Championship. After the match, Fish's reDRagon tag team partner Kyle O'Reilly entered the ring and challenged Shibata, which was accepted by the champion. Following the event, it was announced that Shibata would be taken off the rest of the tour and would be replaced in his scheduled tag team matches in Hiroshima and Kobe by Tomoaki Honma and Manabu Nakanishi, respectively. In the main event of the show, Kushida made his sixth defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Bushi. Bushi was accompanied to the match by an unidentified new member of his Los Ingobernables de Japon stable, who had debuted earlier in the week. The man interfered in the match and, after a ref bump, Tetsuya Naito, another one of Bushi's stablemates, entered the ring to also attack Kushida. He was, however, attacked and taken away from ringside by Michael Elgin. Towards the end of the match, Kushida went for his finishing hold, the Hoverboard Lock, but Bushi countered it into a Canadian Destroyer. Bushi then hit his finishing maneuver, the MX, twice to win the match and become the new IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion, ending Kushida's nine-month reign. =Destruction in Hiroshima= The first title match of Destruction in Hiroshima saw the reigning IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions The Young Bucks challenge The Briscoe Brothers for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Towards the end of the match, The Young Bucks went for their finishing maneuver, the Meltzer Driver, but Jay Briscoe countered it into a Jay Driller, after which he pinned Matt Jackson following the Doomsday Device to win the match and retain the title. After the match, The Briscoe Brothers were attacked by the previous IWGP Tag Team Champions, Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa, who demanded a title rematch. The next match saw Adam Cole defend the ROH World Championship against Will Ospreay. Cole retained the title after pinning Ospreay following the Panama Sunrise and the Last Shot. The following match saw reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada defeat Bad Luck Fale in a non-title match to avenge the loss he suffered during the 2016 G1 Climax. The main event of the show featured Kenny Omega defending his contract for an IWGP Heavyweight Championship match at Wrestle Kingdom 11 against Yoshi-Hashi. The match featured outside interference from Omega's Bullet Club stablemates The Young Bucks. Towards the end of the match, Yoshi-Hashi landed his finishing maneuver, the Swanton Bomb, but Omega kicked out of the resulting pinfall attempt. Omega then hit Yoshi-Hashi with a reverse hurricanrana, a knee and then pinned him for the win with the Katayoku no Tenshi. After the match, Yoshi-Hashi's Chaos stablemate Hirooki Goto entered the ring to challenge Omega for his contract. Omega, who had defeated Goto in the finals of the 2016 G1 Climax, responded by telling him to \\"Go to Hell\\". =Destruction in Kobe= Tetsuya Naito, who captured the IWGP Intercontinental Championship in the main event of Destruction in Kobe Prior to the match between the Hunter Club team of Yoshitatsu and Captain New Japan and the Bullet Club team of Chase Owens and Yujiro Takahashi, Yoshitatsu announced the result of his poll; fans had voted Captain out of the group. This led to Captain turning on Yoshitatsu, attacking him with Owens and Takahashi, ending the match in quick fashion. In a backstage interview, Bullet Club leader Kenny Omega welcomed Captain New Japan to the stable, but called his character ridiculous and told him to come up with a new name and costume. The first title match of the show featured the Bullet Club trio of Adam Cole, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson taking on David Finlay, Ricochet and Satoshi Kojima for the vacant NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. The match ended with Ricochet pinning Nick with a shooting star press to win the match and the title. Following the match, Finlay challenged The Young Bucks for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in the ring, while backstage the new champions were challenged themselves by the Chaos trio of Beretta, Rocky Romero and Will Ospreay. The semi-main event of the show saw the Chaos team of IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada, Gedo, Jado and Yoshi-Hashi take on their stablemate Toru Yano and the Pro Wrestling Noah trio of Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Naomichi Marufuji. Yoshi-Hashi won the match for his team by pinning Harada for the win. Afterwards, Okada and Yoshi-Hashi challenged Yano and Marufuji to a match for their GHC Tag Team Championship on October 8, two days before Okada and Marufuji face off for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The main event of the show saw Michael Elgin defend the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Tetsuya Naito. Late in the match, a ref bump led to outside interference from Naito's Los Ingobernables de Japon stablemates Bushi, Evil and Sanada as well as Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kushida, ending with Elgin powerbombing Bushi over the top rope onto his stablemates. Elgin then went to hit Naito with his finishing maneuver, the Elgin Bomb, but Naito countered it into his own finishing maneuver, Destino, then hit the move a second time to win the match and become the new IWGP Intercontinental Champion. Aftermath The day after Destruction in Kobe, it was announced that with Captain New Japan joining Bullet Club, he would be known as \\"Bone Soldier\\" going forward. He made his debut under the name on October 8. That same day, David Finlay, Ricochet and Satoshi Kojima made their first successful defense of the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship against the team that had challenged them backstage at Destruction in Kobe; Beretta, Rocky Romero and Will Ospreay. At a Pro Wrestling Noah show that same day, Gedo and Jado captured the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship from Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada, while Naomichi Marufuji and Toru Yano retained the GHC Tag Team Championship against Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi- Hashi. On October 14, 2016, the Osaka Prefectural Police announced that Matt Sydal had been arrested at the Kansai International Airport upon trying to enter the country for Destruction in Hiroshima under suspicion of cannabis smuggling.

Over the next few days, Charles attempts to lure Constance away with the promise of seeing the world while setting his sights on the family fortune, locked in a safe. Constance is charmed and subservient towards him. At the same time, Charles behaves condescendingly to Julian and taunts Merricat with the idea of stealing her sister. Merricat retaliates by casting magical spells on Charles, vandalizing his room and belongings, and speaking to him only in descriptions of poisonous plants. When Charles threatens to punish her, Merricat throws everything on Charles' desk, including his lit pipe, into a wastebasket. Charles ultimately chases her upstairs and beats her until he discovers that his room is on fire. The fire department arrives, along with the villagers, who call to let the house burn. Constance and Merricat hide downstairs as the fire is extinguished. The villagers rush into the house and vandalize it. The mob seems ready to attack the sisters, but Helen Clarke's husband announces that Uncle Julian has died of smoke inhalation. The mob disperses, and the sisters take refuge in the woods. The following morning, the sisters return home and barricade the doors and windows. With the upper floors destroyed, the remains resemble a turreted castle. Merricat announces that she intends to poison the whole village; Constance reveals that this is what Merricat did once before to their parents and expresses gratitude that Merricat saved her from their wicked father. The villagers leave gifts of food at their door and apologize for destroying their property, but they never respond. Charles returns, begging Constance to let him in. When they remain silent, Charles enters the house by force and attacks Constance. Merricat bludgeons him to death with a snow globe, and they bury him in the garden. Now in the present, the sisters are still cleaning what remains of their house when two village children arrive to taunt them. Merricat steps outside, and the children flee in fear. As Merricat returns, Constance tells Merricat that she loves her, and Merricat, for the first time in the film, smiles.

Only two were built and they were quite soon converted into two different Emsco types, one with one engine and the other with two. Design Zenith American Albatross B-1 photo from Aero Digest June 1929 The Emsco Corporation took its name from the initials of its founder E.M Smith. In early 1929 Emsco bought out the Albatross Corporation and their aircraft, designed by Charles Rocheville. One of these was the American Albatross B-1 of 1928, a high wing braced monoplane with a single engine producing and with accommodation for six passengers. The Emsco Challenger was a development of it and was quite similar apart from having three engines totalling . It was intended as the first of a range of similar Emsco aircraft, differing in having one or two engines. The Challenger's wing was built in two parts, both rectangular in plan out to semi-elliptical tips, which met on top of the fuselage and were mounted with 1.5¬∞ dihedral. They had wooden structures built around two box spars and were fabric covered. Parallel struts from beyond mid- span braced the spars to the lower fuselage longerons and the rear struts were also braced near their midpoints to the upper longerons; all struts were enclosed in wide, airfoil section fairings. Its inset ailerons were long and narrow. The fuselage of the Challenger was built around a rectangular cross- section chrome-molybdenum steel frame and given an oval cross-section by bulkheads. The cabin region was plywood skinned; aft, formers and stringers were fabric covered. One of the three , six-cylinder Curtiss Challenger radial engines was in the nose under a wide-chord fairing. The other two were mounted uncowled on the wing bracing struts, assisted by more struts between engine and upper fuselage and others between the struts. The pilots occupied an enclosed cockpit, placed high and just ahead of the wing leading edge, with side-by-side seating and dual control. A passageway connected the cockpit and the windowed, well furnished passenger cabin. Cabin and cockpit were accessed by a door on the port side, equipped with a built-in ladder, via a compartment containing a curtained-off lavatory and a luggage space. The empennage, like the fuselage, was steel framed and fabric covered. Both fin and tailplane, the latter mounted at mid-fuselage height, had straight, swept leading edges and carried balanced control surfaces with straight, unswept rear edges and round tips. The rudder was deep, extending to the keel, and worked within an elevator cut-out. The Challenger had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Its mainwheels were on faired, cranked axles hinged from the central fuselage underside, braced by drag struts hinged further aft; these members were enclosed in balsa and fabric airfoil fairings. Short, vertical oleo legs were attached to the bottom of the outer engine mountings. The wheels had independent Bendix brakes and were almost entirely enclosed in large dural tube, fabric covered fairings. A small tailwheel was mounted on a rubber- sprung pylon. Development The Challenger was flown for the first time in June 1929 by Jack Reid at Long Beach, California. Immediately afterwards it toured the U.S. West Coast, combining test and publicity flights. Two were built and both were later modified into different types by changing engines. The first became an Emsco B-3A in 1930 with a single Pratt & Whitney Wasp C and the second, with two Wright J-5s, was the only Emsco B-5. Variants ;Emsco B-2 Challenger:As described ;Emsco B-3: Similar to the B-2 but with a greater span (). Longer at , it had an extra passenger seat and was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Wasp C nine-cylinder radial engine. Five were built. One went to Mexico and one to Rumania. Another B-3, initially named he City of Tacoma was used on an unsuccessful attempt to cross the North Pacific, flown by Harold Bromley and Harold Gatty in 1930. In August 1931, renamed the Clarissa Madge it made a successful crossing, The prototype was lost at the end of an attempt on the world duration record; it seems that its pilot, Jack Reid, fell asleep after setting a record time of 38 hr 40 min. Reid died in the crash. ;Emsco B-3A:Emsco B-3A Aero Digest August,1930One of the B-2s was converted to a single Pratt & Whitney Wasp C engine; it retained the shorter span wing of the B-2 but had the longer fuselage of the B-3 and its extra seat. It achieved its Approved Type Certificate early in 1931. Only the B-3A, not the B-3, appeared in contemporary advertisements. ;Emsco B-5: This was a twin engine, six passenger conversion of the other B-2 with Wright J-6-9 nine- cylinder radial engines. It was making early test flights in March 1930. The only B-5 was sold to the Compania Nacional de Aviacion in Guatemala in July 1933.

Career Doneghey was drafted by the Blackhawks in the 12th round of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft before heading to Merrimack to start his college career. In four years with the Warriors Doneghey had an unspectacular but respected tenure, receiving the coaches award in his senior season. After graduating in 1993 with a sociology degree he moved to France and played two seasons for OHC Paris-Viry before retiring as a player. Doneghey returned to the college game in 1995, becoming an assistant for Division III Hamilton College for one year before jumping up to Division I, taking the same job with New Hampshire. In the fall of 1997, with Fairfield ready to begin D-I play the next year, Doneghey accepted the offer to become the team's new head coach. Although Fairfield was still a Division III program at the time they started offering athletic scholarships for the 1997‚Äì98 season (a violation of D-III regulations) and were ruled ineligible for postseason play. The 1998‚Äì99 campaign was the first at the D-I level for not only Fairfield, but the entire MAAC ice hockey conference. Even among a group of newcomers the Stags were woefully unprepared for the level of play, winning only 1 contest all season and being outscored 64 to 227 thorough it all. Despite one of the worst records in NCAA history Fairfield made the conference tournament (all 8 teams qualified) but lost their opening round match to Quinnipiac 13-2. Once the disastrous season ended it came as little surprise when Doneghey was replaced. Doneghey remained in the coaching ranks, returning to his alma mater to serve as an assistant coach for six years before his next big offer came, this time from the Bridgewater Bandits of the EJHL. In his first four years with the team Doneghey got the bandits into the playoffs each season but couldn't win a single game until his fourth attempt, downing the Syracuse Stars 1-0-1 in the quarterfinals before falling in the Semis. He was unable to build on that success, however, and after the Bandits missed the playoffs in each of the next two years he was out as head coach. After almost 15 years in coaching Doneghey switched jobs and became a scout for the Chicago Blackhawks starting in 2009. His move couldn't have come at a more opportune time as the team won its first Stanley Cup that season (its first in 49 years) followed by two more over the next five years.

History Jank formed following the break-up of Downingtown, Pennsylvania duo Panucci's Pizza, which consisted of Lou (formerly Matt) Diamond and Brock Benzel. During Panucci's tenure, Diamond had been introduced to bassist Ruben Polo through mutual friends in the Philadelphia DIY scene, and they later met drummer Sam Becht during the trio's studies at the University of the Arts. After Diamond's other projects disbanded, they decided to start a new band containing light-hearted, tongue- in-cheek lyrics and upbeat, energetic instrumentals, in contrast to the emotional lyricism and acoustic instrumentation of Panucci's Pizza. Spawned in the Kensington, Philadelphia basement DIY-punk scene, Jank played their first show in April 2015, and released their debut album, Awkward Pop Songs, later that year via Honest Face Records. After a few months of touring North America to promote Awkward Pop Songs, they began to develop a cult following among the underground music scene throughout the United States. In early 2016 they recorded a new EP called Versace Summer. The band self-released a remixed version of Awkward Pop Songs, entitled Awkward Chopped Songs, on July 5, 2016 before releasing Versace Summer on July 27, 2016 through Creep Records.c  Breakup and Aftermath  In early September 2016, in the midst of planning multiple tours with Modern Baseball and Sorority Noise, bassist Ruben Polo announced his departure from the band for undisclosed reasons.http://i.imgur.com/o0iqQa9.jpg Following this announcement, vocalist/guitarist Lou Diamond posted a lengthy statement to the band's Facebook page, claiming they had been accused by various people in the Philadelphia DIY music scene of sexual abuse, and offered their perspective of the alleged incident. The band canceled all upcoming shows and tours, and shortly thereafter deleted all traces of their music on the internet, including all of their social media accounts. Their Bandcamp page would later be restored, and their music would also later be re-uploaded onto Spotify. On August 31, 2017, Lou Diamond reappeared with ex-Jank drummer Sam Becht, and announced they had been working on a new project entitled fail better, heal faster. Released for free via Bandcamp, the release contained a link to a website with a disclaimer posted on it, stating that the project is \\"not a band\\" and is a one-off collection of songs intended to be a form of self- therapy for Lou to help cope with the impact the allegations had on their life from the previous year.https://www.failbetterhealfaster.com There would be no promotion, no merchandise, and no tours centered around the project. fail better, heal faster was also released with the intention of sparking conversations in the DIY music scene regarding sexual abuse/abusers and how the behavior should not be tolerated or encouraged. It was claimed that any profits made from people who chose to donate money when downloading the album would be given to various charities including RAINN, The Centre for Justice & Reconciliation, Trans Youth Equality, and The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. However, four days after the album was released, many in the Philadelphia music community voiced concerns regarding the sincerity of the message, and as a result, revealed details of further allegations against Diamond not made public during the initial breakup of Jank. The subsequent release of information caused Becht to publicly distance himself from Diamond and all projects the two had previously worked on, much like Polo had done the year before. This signaled a more definitive end to Jank and the collaborative efforts of its members. Polo continued to play in the band Soul Glo, while Becht joined Remo Drive as a touring drummer and released an album, Selfie in 2019. In 2019, Becht joined a new band called Oolong. They are currently signed to Sun-Eater Records.

Reception and critique In 2017 A highly critical review of Gibson's Early Islamic Qiblas by a subject matter expert on medieval Muslim astronomy, David A. King, author of World-Maps for Finding the Direction and Distance to Mecca: Innovation and Tradition in Islamic Science, many articles on qibla, and several articles in the Encyclopedia of Islam. King argued that early Muslim Arabs were unable to precisely establish Qiblas when building new mosques until later mathematical developments made precision possible. Further, King wrote, many variations in orientation are better accounted for by regional and local practices, imperfect geography, and folk astronomy. King noted Gibson's inadequate grasp of mathematics, citing Gibson's \\"spherical polygons\\" (p. 170) as inexplicable. King summarized his analysis of Gibson's work as an \\"amateurish, non-scholarly document that is both offensive to Muslims and also an insult to Muslim and Western scholarship.\\" Gibson placed a response to King on academia.edu, \\"Dr. King on the other hand is convinced that the sloppy qiblas actually intended to point: east, west, solstices, sunrises and so forth. I have not come across anything in Islamic religious manuscripts that support these Qiblas. But perhaps in time someone, somewhere will stumble across something that will change our understanding of Qiblas. All I have found so far, is that every Muslim expects the Qibla to point to Masjid Al HarƒÅm.\\" Walter R. Schumm analyzed the direction of 60 qiblas to test the claims of King and Gibson.

She became a resident of D∆∞∆°ng N·ªôi, a village outside of Hanoi, after marrying a local farmer. Th√™u is known for her work in documenting land seizures and mobilization for the returns of lands and fair compensation from local authorities. On 20 September 2016 she was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment by The People's Court of ƒê·ªëng ƒêa District in Hanoi on charges of ‚Äúcausing public disorder‚Äù. Th√™u is a prisoner of conscience.  Background  In Vietnam, land is considered people's property - individuals have usage rights, but the government is the administrator of its usage. In late 2007, local authorities seized the family farm of Th√™u without adequate compensation. Th√™u, her husband and two sons are one of more than 350 families in D∆∞∆°ng N·ªôi alone who have been taking their case to local authorities to petition for redress. Th√™u has been active in campaigning against and documenting land confiscations in Hanoi and surrounding provinces. She is calling for adequate compensation for land seizures in Vietnam, supporting others defend their land and calling attention to government expropriation of land at unfair prices. In 2020 she was arrested with a criminal charge.  Prior arrests  Her first arrest was in April 2014 for recording video of land confiscations in H√† ƒê√¥ng district in Hanoi and police attacking protestors with sticks and batons. She was beaten by police and charged with ‚Äúresisting on-duty state officials‚Äù under Article 257 of the Penal Code during the course of her arrest. In September of that year Th√™u and her husband, Trinh Ba Tu, were sentenced to 15 months in prison. After her release in July 2015 she continued to engage in peaceful demonstrations against land seizures by the local authorities. In January 2016 Th√™u was briefly detained in Hanoi for protesting against attempts by the local authorities to confiscate family farms. Th√™u and about 100 people in the central city were broken up when about 200 to 300 police surrounded the demonstrators near 34 Ly Thai To street and herded a group of them onto a bus to the police station.  2016 arrest  On 10 June 2016 several dozen police officers arrived at Th√™u‚Äôs family home in Hoa Binh province in the north of Vietnam to search her house, confiscate her mobile phone and arrest her. Th√™u is detained under Article 245 of Vietnam‚Äôs Penal Code on a charge of ‚Äúcausing public order‚Äù as she had allegedly been involved in disturbances of the ƒê·ªëng ƒêa district in Hanoi. In fact, she and other land petitioners attended a peaceful demonstration to demand the return of their land which was seized by authorities. Her sons, Trinh Ba Tu and Trinh Ba Phuong, and many other land petitioners held a peaceful demonstration in H√† ƒê√¥ng district to call for her immediate release. But prior to that, they had been using social media to spread their own conspiracy about how the government works. As a consequence, police confiscated their cameras and cell phones and erased all data including pictures and videos during their 10-hour detention on 13 June 2016. Following this, the organization who backed them did take this seriously. Th√™u can be held in custody for up to four months while the police investigate her case. If she is found guilty, she could face imprisonment of up to seven years. Th√™u is facing charges that reportedly relate to her role in organizing a peaceful demonstration on 8 April 2016 honoring the tenth anniversary of a pro-democracy group and urging the release of detained human rights lawyer Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn ƒê√†i, but also using social media to spread conspiracy. Her lawyer is Ha Huy Son, who has submitted paperwork to be Dai‚Äôs defense lawyer but was declined by the Ministry of Public Security. Son had his first meeting with Th√™u on 22 June 2016 and advised her to stop the hunger strike that she started on the first day of her arrest. On 20 September 2016 Th√™u was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment by The People's Court of ƒê·ªëng ƒêa district in Hanoi on charges of ‚Äúcausing public disorder‚Äù under Article 245 of the Penal Code. Th√™u appealed against the sentence, citing an unfair trial that failed to meet international standards for justice, but the Hanoi's People's Court upheld her conviction on 30 November 2016.  2020 arrest  On 24 June of 2020, after a long time of spreading conspiracies and hiding their location from the public. Th√™u was located due to the fact that Facebook had let the authority access to all data in Vietnam. She was arrested with charge \\"Making, storing, using, spreading informations, items against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam\\" - Penal Code 117. At the time, she was hiding with her son Tr·ªãnh B√° T∆∞ in Ho√† B√¨nh. At her house, police uncovered many items, recordings, 10 CD, DVD discs and USB devices contain informations against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, together with 3 smartphones that were used to manage their social media accounts.  International response  The recent detention of Th√™u is condemned by various organizations and individuals worldwide. On 12 August 2016, Ian Britza, Member of Western Australian Parliament representing Morley, called for the release of Th√™u by writing a letter to the Prime Minister of Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c. Ian expresses his concerns about Th√™u's current health and well being as she conducted a 13-day hunger strike. In his letter Ian also points out that Vietnam has signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and should commit to them. In addition, human rights organization Front Line Defenders has encouraged people to take action for Th√™u by signing a letter to Ph·∫°m B√¨nh Minh, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam. The letter contains three actions that the Vietnamese government should immediately undertake. First, Th√™u and Dai need to be released urgently and unconditionally and all charges need to be dropped against them. Second, all necessary measures need to be taken to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity and security of Th√™u and her family. Finally, human rights defenders in Vietnam need to be able to carry out their legitimate human right activities.

He was famously called the 'Hound of Kuenring', alongside his brother, Hadmar III of Kuenring, for their martial prowess. He married Adelheid of Falkenstein-Neuburg before 1205. He, along with his brother, Hadmar III, took part in the Fifth Crusade with Leopold VI, Duke of Austria. Whether on or after the Crusade, Henry was given the position of Marshal of Austria, after the previous Marshal, Ulrich of Falkenstein-Neuburg, died childless, after or during the Fifth Crusade. The Altenburg Abbey Dispute After Duke Leopold the Glorious died on 28 July 1230, disputes with his heir, Frederick II, Duke of Austria, infamously called the Warlike or Quarrelsome, rose up almost immediately. When Liutold and Conrad of Altenburg sent an appeal to Duke Frederick on 30 November 1230 for the demarcation of the abbey, the Kuenring brothers and their allies, the Sonnbergs under Hadmar I of Sonnberg, responded with vehement protest, declaring that such a thing would impoverish their houses.

Harris of Cornell University described it as \\"one of the few documents that provide insight into the early growth of the field of Afro-American history and the life of Woodson\\".Harris, p. 1400 Background Greene, at the time a graduate student at Columbia University, worked for the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), established by Carter G. Woodson.Dillon, p. 362. Greene began preparing his diary for publication prior to his death in 1988.McMurry, p. 279. A portion of his diary was also published in Black Dixie (1992). Woodson did not leave an autobiography of his own. This contributed to Greene's decision to have these memoirs published.McMillen, p. 541. At the time of the publication of this book, Greene's descendants had then-unpublished diary segments that took place before and after the time of this work.McMillen, p. 543. Contents Strickland wrote an introduction to the book that contains biographies of Woodson and Greene.Dillon, p. 363. Claudine Ferrell of Mary Washington College wrote that Strickland's introduction, along with this editing and the introductory comments from Greene himself, \\"are invaluable in setting the stage for a work that helps fill, to a small degree, the huge gap in the information on Woodson's tireless and influential work and on black life in the 1920s.\\"Ferrell, p. 351. Merton L. Dillon of Ohio State University wrote that the introduction was \\"graceful\\". Greene began writing in his diary on March 15, 1928,Ferrell, p. 350. the first day of the job; he was hired at age 28, in March 1928.McMurry, p. 278. Originally he believed that Woodson's goal in documenting African-American history was fruitless and that he should have been teaching at an elite university.McMurry, p. 278-279. The book has information on Greene, Woodson, and Charles H. Wesley.Ferrell, p. 350-351. Greene wrote in his diary every night during his day work at the ANSLH, recording his observations of the black community of Washington, DC and Baltimore prior to the Great Depression. Amy Worden in Washington History stated that it was \\"written mostly in a staccato fashion\\".Worden, p. 81. In particular it discusses the middle strata of the DC black community,Collins, p. 458. along with the daily routine of blacks in not only DC but also Virginia and Baltimore. He had conducted interviews in Baltimore and Washington, DC. The diary discusses his life in Washington, DC as well as his organization of his research.Collins, p. 457. He also recorded his time during an unfinished assignment to survey black churches. In addition it discusses the academic rivalry between Woodson and Wesley, Greene's conflicting feelings as an African-American, and his personal conflicts with W.E.B. DuBois. Greene's final entry, which documented a Negro Week event, was on February 10, 1930. After that entry Woodson fired Greene. By the end of the book Greene came to believe in Woodson's mission.McMillen, p. 542-543. Greene credited Wesley for the book being published. Dillon wrote that Greene was not sympathetic towards religion and had conservative beliefs and skeptical feelings towards religious preachers, and therefore the diary was filtered through this mindset. The diary also includes some statements made by Woodson. Bruce Collins of the University of Buckingham stated that according to the diary, the people in Greene's generation were opposed to black churches and therefore were unable to make much progress in their communities at the time; Collins also stated that \\"The diary offers ample testimony to a belief in the need to establish a full and true history of American blacks.\\"Collins, p. 457-458. Reception Ferrell wrote that the book was a discussion of current events, attitudes, and problems in the contemporary African-American community in addition to, as Greene had described it, \\"a melange of happenings and opinions\\" about \\"a potpourri of the economic, social, and political conditions under which Negroes lived in their communities\\"; Ferrell argued that the book met Greene's definition and that its value resides in that. Ferrell also wrote that the editing was \\"deft\\" and that it \\"keeps the text both flowing and informative\\". Linda O. McMurry of North Carolina State University wrote that Greene's personality traits made the diary \\"fascinating and illuminating\\". Neil R. McMillen of the University of Southern Mississippi wrote that the editing was \\"expertly and unobtrusively\\" done.

Once a sediment has been deposited, subsequent changes in the speed or direction of wind or water flowing over it can agitate the grains in the sediment and allow the preferential removal of the finer grains. This action can improve the sorting and increase the mean grain size of a sediment after it has been deposited.Compton, R. R., 1962, Manual of field geology, John Wiley & Sons, 378 p.

Their territory extended northward from their capital, Teanum Sidicinum (modern day Teano), along the valley of the Liri river up to Fregellae, covering around 3,000 km2 in total.(Giacomo Devoto, Gli antichi italici, Firenze, Vallecchi, 1931, p.118). They were neighbors of the Samnites and Campanians, and allies of the Ausoni and Aurunci. Their language was a part of the Osco-Umbrian linguistic family. Origins According to Strabo the area that the Sidicini lived in was taken from the Opici. History =First Samnite War= The Sidicini were mentioned for the first time in 343 BC, when the Samnites declared war on them.Livy, vii.29.4 The Samnites sought to take Teano because of its position as a regional crossroad . The sidicini then sought the help of the Campanians. The Campanians sent an army to assist the Sidicini but were beaten in battle by the Samnites, the Samnites then seized the Tifata hills overlooking Capua (the main Campani city) and, having left a strong force to hold them, marched into the plain between the hills and Capua.Livy, vii.29.5‚Äì6 There they defeated the Campanians in a second battle and drove them within their walls. At this point the Campanians decided to surrender themselves unconditionally into the power of Rome, following which the Romans felt compelled to intervene to protect their new subjects against further Samnite attacks.Livy, vii.29.3-32.1‚Äì2 Modern historians are in some dispute whether this surrender really took place or was invented to absolve Rome of treaty breaking, but generally agree that Rome formed some kind of alliance with Capua.Salmon (1967), p. 197; Cornell (1995), p. 347; Oakley (1998), pp. 286‚Äì9; Forsythe (2005), p. 287 The Romans broke their treaty of friendship with the SamnitesDiodorus, xvi.45.8Livy, vii.19.3‚Äì4. to help the Campani. The First Samnite War ended in 341 with a negotiated peace and renewal of the former treaty between them and Rome. Rome retained her Campanian alliance, but accepted that the Sidicini belonged to the Samnite sphere.Livy, viii.1.8-2.3Salmon (1967), p. 202; Forsythe (2005), p. 288 According to Livy, once peace with Rome had been concluded, the Samnites attacked the Sidicini with the same forces they had deployed against Rome. Facing defeat, the Sidicini tried to surrender themselves to Rome, but their surrender was rejected by the senate as coming far too late. The Sidicini then turned to the Latins who had already taken up arms on their own account. The Campanians joined the war as well, and led by the Latins a large army of these allied peoples invaded Samnium. =Sidicini-Aurunci War= In 337 BC the Sidicini declared war on the Aurunci, and defeated them and forced them out of their capital city of Aurunca, after which the Aurunci made Suessa their capital. In 336 BC the Ausoni joined the Sidicini's side of the war. However the Romans came to the defence of the Aurunci, defeating Sidicini and Ausoni. The capital of the Ausoni, Cales, was occupied, and in 332 BC the Sidicini territory itself was occupied by both consular armies of Rome, but Teano, the capital, resisted the Romans.Livy. \\"8.16\\". City. The Sidicini do not appear in that war or ever again in history, but Teanum goes on as Teanum Sidicinum and its territory as Sidicinus Ager. If the Romans had fought a great battle and had obliterated the Sidicini, there would be some mention of it or some evidence of a discontinuity at Teano. Instead, the city prospered. Smith accords with the general conclusion that between 335 and 326, most likely in 334,Bunbury, Edward Herbert (1873). \\"Sidicini\\". In Smith, William. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography. Volume. II. London: John Murray. pp. 995‚Äì996. the Sidicini consented to lay down their arms and become part of the greater Roman municipality. Livy's omission remains unexplained.

A stream located to the west of the house flows north for 1.1 km (‚Öî mile) and enters the Little Slaney River. History Dwyer memorial, Glenmalure In the aftermath of the 1798 Rebellion, United Irishmen leader Michael Dwyer continued to fight a guerrilla war against government loyalists and yeomen. On 15 February 1799, he and about a dozen comrades were sheltering in three cottages when an informer led a large force of government soldiers to the area. The cottages were quickly surrounded, the first two surrendering, but, following consultation, Dwyer and his men decided to fight on in the third one (Miley Connell's cottage) ‚Äî after negotiating the safe passage of women and children. In the gunfight which followed, the cottage caught fire and only Dwyer remained unwounded. At this stage, Dwyer's comrade, Antrim man Sam McAllister, stood in the doorway to draw the soldiers' fire on him, which allowed Dwyer to slip out and make his escape. Dwyer remained on the run until 1803. The Dwyer‚ÄìMcAllister Cottage, or 'Dwyer's Cottage', as it is more informally known, was acquired by the Irish State from the Hoxey family on 22 August 1948.

Capriles immediately demanded a recount, refusing to recognize the outcome as valid. Maduro was later formally inaugurated as President on 19 April, after the election commission had promised a full audit of the election results.Kroth, Olivia (18 April 2013). \\"Delegations from 15 countries to assist Maduro's inauguration in Venezuela\\". Pravda.ru. Retrieved 18 April 2013. On 24 October 2013, he announced the creation of a new agency, the Vice Ministry of Supreme Happiness, to coordinate all the social programmes.  Rule by decree  Beginning six months after being elected, Maduro has ruled by decree for the majority of his presidency: from 19 November 2013 to 19 November 2014, 15 March 2015 to 31 December 2015, 15 January 2016 to present. = 2013‚Äì2014 = In October 2013, Maduro requested an enabling law to rule by decree in order to fight corruption and to also fight what he called an \\"economic war\\". On 19 November 2013, the National Assembly granted Maduro the power to rule by decree until 19 November 2014. = 2015‚Äì2016 = On 10 March 2015, Maduro asked to rule by decree for a second time following the sanctioning of seven Venezuelan officials by the United States, requesting the Enabling Law to be used to \\"confront\\" what Maduro called \\"the aggression of the most powerful country in the world, the United States\\". Days later on 15 March 2015, the National Assembly granted Maduro power to rule by decree until 31 December 2015. = 2016‚Äì2017 = After a coalition of opposition parties won in the 6 December 2015 elections, the lame duck Assembly named 13 new Justices sympathetic toward Maduro to the Supreme Court. On 15 January 2016, Maduro declared an economic emergency and issued a \\"vaguely worded\\" decree that would grant himself extraordinary powers for 60 days, or until 15 March 2016. Days after on 18 March 2016, the expiration of the decree powers, the Supreme Court granted Maduro the power to rule by decree for an additional 60 days, or until 17 May 2016. Days before his second 60-day rule by decree were to end, Maduro stated on 11 May 2016 that he would continue to rule by decree through the rest of the year until 2017. = 2017‚Äì2018 = While meeting with the Supreme Tribunal of Justice on 15 January 2017, Maduro signed a new economic decree, extending his rule by decree for the sixth time since the original ruling in January 2016. On 19 January, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice established the \\"Decree on the State of Emergency and Economic Emergency\\", granting Maduro to rule by decree further into 2017. On 13 May 2017 at a time of rising unrest during the 2017 Venezuelan protests, President Maduro extended his decree powers for the eighth time since January 2016, allowing him to rule by decree for another 60 days. The powers were extended again on 13 July 2017 for an additional 60 days. On 15 October The Bolivarian government Great Patriotic Pole won 18 of the 23 governorships while the opposition only 5 during the 2017 Venezuelan regional elections On 10 December - The Bolivarian government Great Patriotic Pole won 306 of the 337 Mayorships during the 2017 Venezuelan municipal elections. Cabinet of Maduro Military authority President Maduro among troops during a May 2016 exercise. Maduro has relied on the military to maintain power since he was initially elected into office. According to Luis Manuel Esculpi, a Venezuelan security analyst, \\"The army is Maduro's only source of authority.\\" As time passed, Maduro grew more reliant on the military, showing that Maduro was losing power as described by Amherst College professor, Javier Corrales. Corrales explains that \\"From 2003 until Chavez died in 2013, the civilian wing was strong, so he did not have to fall back on the military. As civilians withdrew their support, Maduro was forced to resort to military force.\\" The New York Times states that Maduro no longer has the oil revenue to buy loyalty for protection, instead relying on favorable exchange rates, as well as the smuggling of food and drugs, which \\"also generate revenue\\". On 12 July 2016, Maduro granted Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez the power to oversee product transportation, price controls, the Bolivarian missions, while also having his military command five of Venezuela's main ports. This action performed by President Maduro made General Padrino one of the most powerful people in Venezuela, possibly \\"the second most powerful man in Venezuelan politics\\". The appointment of Padrino was also seen to be similar to the Cuban government's tactic of granting the Cuban military the power to manage Cuba's economy. It is the first time since the dictatorship of General Marcos Perez Jimenez in 1958 that a military official has held such power in Venezuela. According to Corrales, \\"For all of the ministers of the cabinet to have to respond to a soldier, this is associated with military dictatorships\\". According to Nicol√°s Maduro:  Domestic policy UNASUR special meeting to discuss the diversion of Bolivian President Evo Morales' plane in Europe, 4 July 2013 Maduro denies that Venezuela has been facing a humanitarian crisis. Maduro stuck to his predecessor Hugo Ch√°vez's policies in order to remain popular to those who find a connection between the two. Despite the increasingly difficult crises facing Venezuela, such as a faltering economy and high crime rate, Maduro continued the use of Ch√°vez's policies. After continuing Ch√°vez's policies, Maduro's support among Venezuelans began to decrease, with Bloomberg explaining that he held on to power by placing opponents in jail and impeding upon Venezuela's freedom of press. According to Marsh, instead of making any policy changes, Maduro placed attention on his \\"hold on power by closing off the legal channels through which the opposition can act\\". Shannon K. O'Neil of the Council on Foreign Relations stated that \\"After Chavez's death, Maduro has just continued and accelerated the authoritarian and totalitarian policies of Chavez\\". The rally against Maduro's government in October 2016 The rally in support of Maduro's government in December 2016 Regarding Maduro's ideology, Professor Ram√≥n Pi√±ango, a sociologist from the Venezuelan University of IESA, \\"Maduro has a very strong ideological orientation, close to the Communist ideology. Contrary to Diosdado, he is not very pragmatic\\". Maduro himself has stated that Venezuela must build a more socialist nation, highlighting that the country needs an economic overhaul, a political-military union and government involvement in the workplace. = Crime = One of the first important presidential programs of Maduro became the \\"Safe Homeland\\" program, a massive police and military campaign to build security in the country. Three thousand soldiers were deployed to decrease homicide in Venezuela, which has one of the highest rates of homicide in Latin America. Most of these troops were deployed in the state of Miranda (Greater Caracas), which has the highest homicide rate in Venezuela. According to the government, in 2012, more than 16,000 people were killed, a rate of 54 people per 100,000, although the Venezuela Violence Observatory, a Venezuelan NGO, claims that the homicide rate was in fact 73 people per 100,000. The government claims that the Safe Homeland program has reduced homicides by 55%. The program had to be reinitiated one year later after the program's creator, Miguel Rodr√≠guez Torres, was replaced by Carmen Melendez Teresa Rivas. Murder also increased over the years since the program's initiation according to the Venezuela Violence Observatory, with the murder rate increasing to 82 per 100,000 in 2014. 23,047 homicides were committed in Venezuela in 2018, a rate of 81.4 per 100,000 people. = Economic = When elected in 2013, Maduro continued the majority of existing economic policies of his predecessor Hugo Ch√°vez. When entering the presidency, Maduro's Venezuela faced a high inflation rate and large shortages of goods that was left over from the previous administration of President Ch√°vez. Maduro blamed capitalism for speculation that is driving high rates of inflation and creating widespread shortages of staples, and often said he was fighting an \\"economic war\\", calling newly enacted economic measures \\"economic offensives\\" against political opponents he and loyalists state are behind an international economic conspiracy. However, Maduro has been criticized for only concentrating on public opinion instead of tending to the practical issues economists have warned the Venezuelan government about or creating any ideas to improve the economic situation in Venezuela such as the \\"economic war\\". Venezuela was ranked as the top spot globally with the highest misery index score in 2013, 2014, and 2015 In 2014, Venezuela's economy entered an economic depression that has continued as of 2017. Under Maduro‚Äôs rule, GDP has approximately halved. = Military = Maduro has relied on the military to maintain power since he was initially elected into office. He has promised to make Venezuela a great power by 2050, stating that the Venezuelan military would lead the way to make the country \\"a powerhouse, of happiness, of equality\\". On 12 July 2016, Maduro granted Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez the power to oversee product transportation, price controls, the Bolivarian missions, while also having his military command five of Venezuela's main ports. This action performed by President Maduro made General Padrino one of the most powerful people in Venezuela, possibly \\"the second most powerful man in Venezuelan politics\\". The appointment of Padrino was also seen to be similar to the Cuban government's tactic of granting the Cuban military the power to manage Cuba's economy. According to Nicol√°s Maduro:It was the first time since the dictatorship of General Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez in 1958 that a military official has held such power in Venezuela.  Foreign policy  Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff receiving a photograph of Hugo Ch√°vez from Maduro, 9 May 2013 Maduro with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran, Iran, November 2015 Maduro meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 26 September 2016 Maduro has accused the United States of intervention in Venezuela several times with his allegations ranging from post-election violence by \\"neo-Nazi groups\\", economic difficulties from what he called an \\"economic war\\" and various coup plots. The United States has denied such accusations while analysts have called such allegations by Maduro as a way to distract Venezuelans from their problems. In early 2015 the Obama administration signed an executive order which imposed targeted sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials whom the White House argued were instrumental in human rights violations, persecution of political opponents and significant public corruption and said that the country posed an \\"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\\". Maduro responded to the sanctions in a couple of ways. He wrote an open letter in a full page ad in The New York Times in March 2015, stating that Venezuelans were \\"friends of the American people\\" and called President Obama's action of making targeted sanctions on the alleged human rights abusers a \\"unilateral and aggressive measure\\". Examples of accusations of human rights abuses from the United States to Maduro's government included the murder of a political activist prior to legislative elections in Venezuela. Maduro threatened to sue the United States over an executive order issued by the Obama Administration that declared Venezuela to be a threat to American security. He also planned to deliver 10 million signatures, or signatures from about 1/3 of Venezuela's population, denouncing the United States' decree declaring the situation in Venezuela an \\"extraordinary threat to US national security\\". and ordered all schools in the country to hold an \\"anti-imperialist day\\" against the United States with the day's activities including the \\"collection of the signatures of the students, and teaching, administrative, maintenance and cooking personnel\\". Maduro further ordered state workers to apply their signatures in protest, with some workers reporting that firings of state workers occurred due to their rejection of signing the executive order protesting the \\"Obama decree\\". There were also reports that members of Venezuelan armed forces and their families were ordered to sign against the United States decree. On 6 April 2015, twenty-five (25) ex-presidents issued a Declaraci√≥n de Panam√°, a statement denouncing the VII Cumbre de las Am√©ricas, what they called \\"democratic alteration\\" in Venezuela, promoted by the government of Nicolas Maduro. The statement calls for the immediate release of \\"political prisoners\\" in Venezuela. Among the former heads of government that have called for improvements in Venezuela are: Jorge Quiroga (Bolivia); Sebasti√°n Pi√±era (Chile): Andr√©s Pastrana, √Ålvaro Uribe and Belisario Betancur (Colombia); Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez, Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Guardia, Laura Chinchilla, √ìscar Arias, Luis Alberto Monge (Costa Rica), Osvaldo Hurtado (Ecuador); Alfredo Cristiani and Armando Calder√≥n (EL Salvador); Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar (Spain); Felipe Calder√≥n and Vicente Fox (M√©xico), Mireya Moscoso (Panam√°), Alejandro Toledo (Per√∫) and Luis Alberto Lacalle (Uruguay). Maduro has reached out to China for economic assistance while China has funneled billions of dollars from multiple loans into Venezuela. China is Venezuela's second largest trade partner with two-thirds of Venezuelan exports to China composed of oil. According to Mark Jones, a Latin American expert of the Baker Institute, China was \\"investing for strategic reasons\\" rather than ideological similarities. The Venezuelan military has also used military equipment from China using the NORINCO VN-4 armoured vehicle against protesters during the 2014‚Äì15 Venezuelan protests, ordering hundreds more as a result of the demonstrations. At the 17th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 2016, hosted by Venezuela at Margarita Island, Maduro was elected chairperson by acclamation, a position that he is to hold until the 18th Summit in Azerbaijan in 2019. Maduro's administration spent over US$120 million on the event, and Maduro billed it as a meeting that would \\"be remembered for centuries\\"; according to Al Jazeera, the \\"delegates who did come complained privately of a lack of organisation, delays and shabby hotels\\". The Maduro administration did not respond to a request from Al Jazeera for a list of delegations present; of the 120 NAM member states, media sources estimated between 10 and 15 heads of state attended, including Boliva, Cuba, Ecuador, Palestine, Iran, Syria and Zimbabwe. For only the second time since NAM was founded, India did not attend; of the countries that did attend, many are recipients of Venezuelan oil subsidies, according to Foreign Policy and FOX News. In the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, Maduro has frequently supported the Palestinian cause in international forums including his stance that his country recognizes Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Palestine after the US embassy move to Jerusalem which he called an \\"extremist decision\\" that lacks legal validity and violates international law.Venezuela and the NAM Express Their Absolute Support for the Palestinian causeTimes of IsraelVenezuela Recognizes Jerusalem as the Capital of Palestine as Trump Accelerates US Embassy Move to JerusalemWAFA In January 2019, Maduro reaffirms the unconditional support for the struggle of the Palestinians in defense of their sovereignty in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.President Maduro Relations Palestine In December 2017, Maduro was invited as the special honorary guest at the Extraordinary Summit of the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) in Istanbul, Turkey with the main issue being to unify the response of the Muslim world to the US embassy move to Jerusalem, which Maduro called a \\"colonial act.\\"Muslim Leaders Declare East Jerusalem the Palestinian Capital New York TimesVenezuelas Maduro Appears as Surprise Guest at OIC Summit on Jerusalem On 11 August 2017, President Donald Trump said that he is ‚Äúnot going to rule out a military option‚Äù to confront the government of Nicol√°s Maduro. On 23 January 2019, Maduro announced that Venezuela was breaking ties with the United States following President Trump's announcement of recognizing Juan Guaid√≥, the Venezuelan opposition leader, as the interim President of Venezuela. On 14 January 2019, days after Brazil recognised Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid√≥ as the country's interim president, Maduro called Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro ‚Äúa Hitler of the modern era‚Äù.  2014‚Äìpresent: Venezuelan protests  Since 2014, a series of protests, political demonstrations, and civil insurrection began in Venezuela due to the country's high levels of violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls. Maduro's government saw the protests as an undemocratic coup d'etat attempt orchestrated by \\"fascist opposition leaders and the United States\\". Although Maduro, a former trade union leader, says he supports peaceful protesting, the Venezuelan government has been widely condemned for its handling of the protests. Venezuelan authorities have reportedly gone beyond the use of rubber pellets and tear gas to instances of live ammunition use and torture of arrested protestors, according to organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, while the United Nations has accused the Venezuelan government of politically-motivated arrests, most notably former Chacao mayor and leader of Popular Will, Leopoldo Lopez, who has used the controversial charges of murder and inciting violence against him to protest the government's \\"criminalization of dissent.\\" Protests dwindled through 2015 and into 2016, though a movement to recall Maduro rekindled anti-government sentiment among Venezuelans, culminating with over one million protesting nationwide on September 1, 2016. Protests since then have continued, especially due to controversies surrounding the recall movement and the continued socioeconomic hardships Venezuelans face on a daily basis. Recall referendum The process to hold a recall referendum to vote on recalling Maduro was started on May 2, 2016. On that date, opposition leaders in Venezuela handed in a petition to the National Electoral Council (CNE) that started a several stage process. As of July 2016, the Venezuelan government had stated that if enough signatures were collected, a recall vote would be held no sooner than 2017. The blue line represents percentage that favor recalling President Maduro. The red line represents percentage that do not wish to recall President Maduro. Unfilled dots represent individual results of the polls. Most polls have been discontinued due to the suspension of the recall movement. =Initial petition= On May 2, 2016, opposition leaders in Venezuela handed in a petition calling for a recall referendum. On June 21, 2016, the BBC reported that signatures for a referendum to recall Maduro were being recorded by the National Electoral Council (CNE), with the process ongoing for several days. The petition required 1% of the electorate to endorse it before the next stage of voting could be held. According to opposition leaders, in July during a preliminary signature drive for the recall, the CNE \\"rejected more than half a million signatures for reasons ranging from unclear handwriting to smudged fingerprints.\\" In early July 2016, Barack Obama urged Venezuela to allow the recall referendum. On July 5, 2016, the Venezuelan intelligence service detained five opposition activists involved with the recall referendum, with two other activists of the same party, Popular Will, also arrested. According to a July 27, 2016 article in The Guardian, \\"Venezuela's opposition has demanded authorities move forward on a referendum to force Nicol√°s Maduro from office, amid complaints that the government is digging in its heels to delay the process.\\" Several days before protests on the issue at the headquarters of the CNE had been held after the CNE missed a deadline on announcing whether a recent petition had collected enough valid signatures. The government, in response, argued the protestors were part of a plot to topple Maduro. At the time, a poll by Venebar√≥metro reportedly found that \\"88% of 'likely' voters in a recall would choose to oust Maduro.\\" =Second phase of the referendum= On August 1, 2016, the CNE announced that enough signatures had been validated for the recall process to continue. A date was not set by the CNE for the second phase to take place, which requires raising 20 percent of the electorates' signatures. While opposition leaders pushed for the recall to be held before the end of 2016, allowing a new presidential election to take place, the government vowed a recall would not occur until 2017, ensuring the current vice president would potentially come to power. Reuters reported that the government had launched 9,000 lawsuits alleging fraud in signature collection by that time. On August 9, 2016, the CNE presented a timeline for the referendum that made it unlikely it would be held before the end of 2016, in part due to a new 90-day verification period for signatures. The second stage of the petition was estimated by the CNE to likely take place in October 2016, resulting in a vote likely happening in February 2017. Opposition leaders were reported to be planning a large protest march in response, with leaders accusing the CNE of favoring the incumbent Socialist Party with the wait time. According to Reuters on August 9, \\"Socialist Party leaders have dismissed the recall effort as fraudulent and noted that the elections council found nearly 10,000 signatures corresponding to people who were deceased.\\" Early on September 21, 2016, the National Electoral Council set new guidelines for the recall campaign that The Associated Press described as \\"unfavorable to the opposition.\\" Among other rules, officials announced that signatures would need to be gathered from 20 percent of Venezuelan voters over three days, specifically October 26 until October 28. In addition, officials required campaigners to gather 20 percent from the electorate in each state, although \\"opposition leaders say they should only have to gather signatures from 20 percent of voters nationwide.\\" The opposition, which had asked for 20,000 voting machines, was granted 5,400 by officials. On September 21, 2016, the National Electoral Council announced the recall referendum would not be held before January 10, meaning new elections would be ruled out in favor of the VP assuming Maduro's place until the end of the term in 2019. The CNE said that the vote \\"could be held in the middle of the first quarter of 2017.\\" =Suspension of referendum= On 21 October 2016, the CNE suspended the referendum only days before preliminary signature-gatherings were to be held. The CNE blamed alleged voter fraud as the reason for the cancellation of the referendum. Reaction Opposition leaders responded by calling on protests against the CNE's actions. The day after the government's announcement, several thousand Venezuelans marched through Caracas protesting against the suspension. Demonstrators were led by Lilian Tintori and Patricia Guti√©rrez, wives of arrested opposition politicians. Experts described the suspension as \\"unconstitutional\\". Venezuelan constitutional law expert Jose Vicente Haro stated that the move by the Bolivarian government shows no respect for the constitution while the Washington Office on Latin America called the suspension \\"a setback for democracy\\". =International reactions= Reuters reported on August 4, 2016 that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had stated that \\"we encourage Venezuela to embrace the recall not in a delayed way that pushes it into next year, but to do this as a sign of respect for the constitution of the country and the needs of the people of the country.\\" On August 11, 2016, 15 countries in the Organization of American States released a joint statement urging for the referendum to be held \\"without delay,\\" to \\"contribute to the quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties in the country.\\" Overthrow attempts On 3 May 2020 Venezuelan security forces prevented an attempt to overthrow Maduro by armed deserters from Venezuela‚Äôs security forces. The attempt was organised by former United States Army Special Forces operator Jordan Goudreau and the men were trained in Colombia. Goudreau claimed the operation had involved 60 troops, including two former US special forces members. The Venezuelan government claimed the United States and its Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) were responsible for the operation and had support from Colombia. Juan Guaid√≥ denied involvement in the operation, however, Goudreau claimed that Guaid√≥ and two political advisers had signed a contract with him for $213 million in October 2019.

It is among the countries experiencing an increase in both antisemitic attitudes and in physical attacks on Jews. According to Jeffrey Goldberg, the contemporary situation stands in contrast with the post-war decades, which were marked by a public consensus that antisemitism is morally wrong. 1980s through early 2000s The 1980s were marked by a number of anti-Jewish attacks, the most notorious being the deadly 1980 Antwerp summer camp attack on families waiting with their children for a bus that would carry them to a Jewish summer camp. This attack was part of a wave of attacks on Jewish targets worldwide that included the synagogue in Copenhagen, the bombing of a synagogue in Paris, the 1981 Vienna synagogue attack, attacks on a synagogue in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1983, attacks on synagogues in Buenos Aires and Rosario Argentina in 1984, an attack on a Jewish film festival in Paris in 1985, the 1982 Great Synagogue of Rome attack, and the 1981 Antwerp bombing in which three people were killed and over 100 wounded. In April 2002, the facade of the Charleroi synagogue was sprayed with bullets. In 2003 a 33-year-old man of Moroccan descent parked a car alongside the synagogue of Charleroi, poured gasoline over the car, and set it alight in an attempt to destroy the synagogue. Authorities investigated it as possible terrorism. Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt condemned the attack but stated that he saw no need to raise security around Jewish institutions in Belgium. Firefighters were able to douse the fire before it destroyed the building. Post 2012 According to a JTA report, the number of antisemitic incidents in 2012 was the highest since 2009. 80 antisemitic incidents were reported throughout Belgium in 2012, a 23% increase from 2011 and an overall increase of 34% since 2000. Five of the incidents involved physical attacks, three of which occurred in Antwerp.Anti-Semitism attacks in Belgium highest since 2009 In October 2013, Isi Leibler, the former president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, reported on the alarming increase in the levels of antisemitism in Belgium. Leibler described a wide use of antisemitic caricatures in the media including a caricature on the official central Flanders educational website, comparing Israel to Nazi Germany. In addition, he described an increase of 30% in the number of antisemitic incidents including physical assaults and vandalism of Jewish institutions. Furthermore, according to a survey conducted among eight Jewish communities in eight European Union countries, 88% of Belgium Jews feel that in the course of recent years, antisemitism has intensified in their country. 10% of the Belgian survey respondents reported suffering from incidents of physical violence or threats due to their Jewish affiliation since 2008. Most of the victims did not report the incidents to the police. 2014 was marked by an increased frequency of antisemitic attacks, with antisemitic attacks recorded by the government increasing by 50% over the previous year. The increase is often dated from the May 2014 Jewish Museum of Belgium shooting. Two days later, a young Muslim man entered the CCU (Jewish Cultural Center) while an event was taking place and shouted racist slurs. A month later, a school bus in Antwerp, that was driving 5-year-old Jewish children was stoned by a group of Muslim teens. Towards the end of August 2014, a 75-year-old Jewish woman was hit and pushed to the ground because of her Jewish-sounding surname. Belgian politician Hassan Aarab, running for municipal office in Antwerp on the Christian Democratic and Flemish list, publicly apologized for antisemitic statements. In July 2014, a doctor refused care for Holocaust survivor Bertha Klein, telling her son \\"Send her to Gaza for a few hours, then she will get rid of the pain. I‚Äôm not coming\\".Belgian Physician Tells Jewish Patient: Go to Gaza to Get Rid of Pain, International Business Times, 31 July 2014New threat of antisemitism 70 years after Auschwitz, ITV, 28 January 2015 The incident was ranked as the worst anti-Semitic incident in 2014 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center.WIESENTHAL CENTER TOP 10 LIST: WORST GLOBAL ANTI-SEMITIC/ANTI-ISRAEL INCIDENTS OF 2014, JPost, 29 December 2014 In 2014 The New York Times reported on crowds of protestors near the European Parliament building in Brussels shouting ‚ÄúDeath to the Jews!‚Äù On 14 September, a crowd that had gathered in Brussels to dedicate a plaque memorializing the Holocaust was attacked by \\"youths\\" hurling rocks and bottles. On 18 September, a synagogue in the Anderlecht neighborhood was set on fire in a suspected arson attack. These were among a series of incidents, including an ethnically Turkish butcher in Li√®ge who put up a sign stating that he would serve dogs but not Jews, and a commuter train announcement that the next stop would be ‚ÄúAuschwitz‚Äù and ordering all Jews to get off, that caused growing numbers of Jews to leave, or to consider leaving Belgium. The incidents are concentrated in Brussels, where anti-Jewish activity is driven by Muslims, who constitute about a quarter of the population of the city. In June, the government earmarked $4 million for increased security at Jewish institutions. In 2015 Prime Minister Charles Michel declared a \\"zero tolerance policy\\" towards antisemitism. His government fired the operator of a government hotline assisting victims of the Brussels bombings; the operator had responded to a call requesting assistance transferring two of the wounded home to Israel by insisting that Israel does not exist. The number of families moving from Belgium to Israel in 2015 reached a 10-year high. In 2016 the government-funded, Catholic Sint-Jozefs Institute secondary school in Torhout declared that it was \\"very proud\\" of a retired teacher who won a prize for his antisemitic cartoon at the International Holocaust Cartoon Competition in Iran. Despite a backlash from the Jewish community, the cartoonist was celebrated as a champion of \\"free speech.\\" In January 2019, Flanders banned the kosher and halal slaughter of animals (schechita), which Jewish and Muslim community leaders denounced as racism and a violation of their freedom of religion. From 1 September, the French-speaking region of Wallonia adopted a similar ban.Belgium tests EU rules on halal and kosher slaughter In March 2019, a parade float featuring stereotyped Jewish figures at a carnival near Brussels was widely criticised as antisemitic. The float in the town of Aalst, 25 km (15 miles) from the European Parliament, featured grinning figures of Orthodox Jews standing on large piles of money. Local Jewish organisations said it was \\"typical of Nazism of 1939.\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47454415 The organizers claimed there was \\"never any intention to insult anyone\\" and defended it as \\"a celebration of humor.\\" In August 2019, Dimitri Verhulst wrote in an op-ed in the newspaper De Morgen that \\"being Jewish is not a religion, no God would give creatures such an ugly nose.\\", a quote from french singer Serge Gainsbourg. He also accused Jews of harbouring a superiority complex due to the notion of Jews as the chosen people, and said \\"talking to the Chosen is difficult\\" because they unjustly accuse critics of antisemitism. De Morgen's editor-in-chief defended Verhulst on the basis that the op-ed was \\"a harsh criticism on Israel's politics towards the Palestinian people.\\" Belgian-Jewish journalist Cnann Lipshiz has written that what is most troubling about the current state of antisemitism in Belgium is the fact that officials and opinion-shapers have often defended the perpetrators of antisemitic incidents on the grounds of \\"free speech\\" or that no offense was supposedly intended. According to Lipshiz, \\"classic antisemitism\\" of a type he had thought \\"impossible in an established Western democracy in the heart of Europe,\\" is now \\"mainstream\\" in Belgium.

Career  After leaving R.P.I Kobie took a career at NASA in their Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working on trips from Mars to planet Earth. Kobie Boykins is a senior mechanical engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Boykins has now been working at NASA for 22 years and enjoys working in the laboratory as of 1996. He worked with his team to design the solar array systems for the Mars exploration rovers Spirit and Opportunity, and designed the actuators on the Mars rover Curiosity, the name of both wings. This system generates power so the Mars Rover can operate while on Mars. Two rechargeable batteries are held inside the Mars Exploration Rover; these batteries are power sources for the rover when the sun is not shining. (epically at night time). The rover can generate about 140 watts of power when fully illuminated and need about 100 watts for motion. The solar array system is attached to the rover and looks almost like wings, although they cannot be used for flight they are crucial for the system to function properly. Kobe Boykins and his team allowed, the solar array system out lived its projected life expectancy by a more than a factor of 20. The Mar rover landed on January 25th2004 which was only supposed to last approximately 90 days but the rover system is still online and adventuring mars to this day. Boykins then had the opportunity to design the actuators on the Mars rover Curiosity. The system is attached to the updated Mars Rover and is used for many research activities.

J. A. B Filho., F. B. de Lima Neto, A. J. C. C.. Lins, A. I. S. Nascimento., and M. P. Lima, \\"A novel search algorithm based on fish school behavior,\\" Systems, Man and Cybernetics, SMC 2008. IEEE International Conference on, 2008, pp. 2646-2651. an unimodal optimization algorithm inspired on the collective behavior of fish schools. The mechanisms of feeding and coordinated movement were used as inspiration to create the search operators. The core idea is to make the fishes ‚Äúswim‚Äù toward the positive gradient in order to ‚Äúeat‚Äù and ‚Äúgain weight‚Äù. Collectively, the heavier fishes are more influent in the search process as a whole, what makes the barycenter of the fish school moves toward better places in the search space over the iterations.de Lima Neto, Fernando Buarque, and Marcelo Gomes Pereira de Lacerda. \\"Multimodal Fish School Search Algorithms Based on Local Information for School Splitting.\\" 2013 BRICS Congress on Computational Intelligence and 11th Brazilian Congress on Computational Intelligence. IEEE, 2013 The FSS uses the following principles:http://www.fbln.pro.br/fss/ # Simple computations in all individuals (i.e. fish) # Various means of storing information (i.e. weights of fish and school barycenter) # Local computations (i.e. swimming is composed of distinct components) # Low communications between neighboring individuals (i.e. fish are to think local but also be socially aware) # Minimum centralized control (mainly for self-controlling of the school radius) # Some distinct diversity mechanisms (this to avoid undesirable flocking behavior) # Scalability (in terms of complexity of the optimization/search tasks) # Autonomy (i.e. ability to self-control functioning) Algorithm FSS is a population based search algorithm inspired in the behavior of swimming fishes that expand and contract while looking for food. Each fish n-dimensional location represents a possible solution for the optimization problem. The algorithm makes use of weights for all the fishes which represents cumulative account on how successful has been the search for each fish in the school. FSS is composed of the feeding and movement operators, the latter being divided into three sub-components, which are:J. B. Monteiro, I. M. C. Albuquerque, F. B. L. Neto, and F. V. S. Ferreira, ‚ÄúOptimizing multi- plateau functions with FSS-SAR (Stagnation Avoidance Routine),‚Äù Submitted to IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, 2016. = Individual component of the movement= Every fish in the school performs a local search looking for promising regions in the search space. It is done as represented below: x_{i}(t + 1) = x_{i}(t)+rand(-1,1)step_{ind}, where x_{i}(t) and x_{i}(t + 1) represent the position of the fish i before and after the individual movement operator, respectively. rand(-1, 1) is a uniformly distributed random number varying from -1 up to 1 and step_{ind} is a parameter that defines the maximum displacement for this movement. The new position x_{i}(t + 1) is only accepted if the fitness of the fish improves with the position change. If it is not the case, the fish remains in the same position and x_{i}(t + 1) = x_{i}(t). = Collective-instinctive component of the movement= An average of the individual movements is calculated based on the following: I=\\\\frac{\\\\sum^{N}_{i=1} \\\\Delta x_{i} \\\\Delta f_{i}}{\\\\sum^{N}_{i=1} \\\\Delta f_{i}}. The vector I represents the weighted average of the displacements of each fish. It means that the fishes that experienced a higher improvement will attract fishes into its position. After the vector I computation, every fish will be encouraged to move according to: x_i(t+1)=x_{i}(t)+I. = Collective-volitive component of the movement= This operator is used in order to regulate the exploration/exploitation ability of the school during the search process. First of all, the barycenter B of the school is calculated based on the position x_{i} and the weight W_{i} of each fish: B(t)=\\\\frac{\\\\sum^{N}_{i=1} x_{i}(t) W_{i}(t)}{\\\\sum^{N}_{i=1} W_{i}(t)}, and then, if the total school weight \\\\sum^{N}_{i=1} W_{i} has increased from the last to the current iteration, the fishes are attracted to the barycenter according to equation A. If the total school weight has not improved, the fishes are spread away from the barycenter according to equation B: Eq. A: x_i(t+1)=x_{i}(t)- step_{vol} rand(0,1)\\\\frac{x_{i}(t) - B(t)}{distance(x_{i}(t),B(t))}, Eq. B: x_i(t+1)=x_{i}(t)+step_{vol} rand(0,1)\\\\frac{x_{i}(t) - B(t)}{distance(x_{i}(t),B(t))}, where step_{vol} defines the size of the maximum displacement performed with the use of this operator. distance(x_{i}(t),B(t)) is the euclidean distance between the fish i position and the school barycenter. rand(0, 1) is a uniformly distributed random number varying from 0 up to 1. Besides the movement operators, it was also defined a feeding operator used in order to update the weights of every fish according to: W_{i}(t+1)=W_{i}(t)+\\\\frac{\\\\Delta f_i}{max(\\\\Delta f_i |)}, where W_{i}(t) is the weight parameter for fish i, \\\\Delta f_i is the fitness variation between the last and the new position, and max(\\\\Delta f_i |) represents the maximum absolute value of the fitness variation among all the fishes in the school. W is only allowed to vary from 1 up to W_{scale}/2, which is a user defined attribute. The weights of all fishes are initialized with the value W_{scale}/2. =The pseudo-code for FSS= # Initialize user parameters # Initialize fishes positions randomly # while Stopping condition is not met do # Calculate fitness for each fish # Run individual operator movement # Calculate fitness for each fish # Run feeding operator # Run collective-instinctive movement operator # Run collective-volitive movement operator # end while The parameters step_{ind} and step_{vol} decay linearly according to: step_{ind}(t+1)=step_{ind}(t)-\\\\frac{step_{ind}(initial)}{It_{max}}, and similarly: step_{vol}(t+1)=step_{vol}(t)-\\\\frac{step_{vol}(initial)}{It_{max}}, where step_{ind}(initial) and step_{vol}(initial) are user defined initial values for step_{ind} and step_{vol}, respectively. It_{max} is the maximum number of iterations allowed in the search process. Variations of FSS =dFSS(Density based Fish School Search)= This version excels for multimodal hyper-dimensional functions. It includes modifications in the previous operators: Feeding and Swimming, as well as new: Memory and Partition operators. The latter two were introduced to account for the partition of the main school into subgroups. Some changes were also included in the stop conditions that now also have to consider subswarms.Madeiro, S. S., de Lima- Neto, F. B., Bastos-Filho, C. J. A., & do Nascimento Figueiredo, E. M. (2011, June). Density as the segregation mechanism in fish school search for multimodal optimization problems. In International Conference in Swarm Intelligence (pp. 563-572). Springer Berlin Heidelberg. =wFSS(Weight based Fish School Search)= wFSS is a weight based niching version of FSS intended to produce multiple solutions. The niching strategy is based on a new operator called link formator. This operator is used to define leaders for the fishes in order to form sub-schools.F. Buarque De Lima Neto and M. Gomes Pereira de Lacerda, ‚ÄúWeight based fish school search,‚Äù in Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC), 2014 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2014, pp. 270‚Äì277. =FSS- SAR(Stagnation Avoidance Routine Fish School Search)= In the original version of the algorithm, the individual movement component is only allowed to move a fish if it improves the fitness. However, in a very smooth search space, there would be many moving trials with no success and the algorithm could fail to converge. To solve these issues, was introduced a parameter X for which 0 <= X <= 1 in the individual component of the movement. X decays exponentially along with the iterations and measures a probability for a worsening allowance for each fish. It means that, every time a fish tries to move to a position that does not improve its fitness, a random number is chosen and if it is smaller than X the movement is allowed.J. B. Monteiro, I. M. C. Albuquerque, F. B. L. Neto, and F. V. S.

It adds privacy and security features to the official releases of the Android Open Source Project by Google. History = Project inception and initial releases = The CopperheadOS project was started in 2014 by Copperhead, an information security company based in Toronto, Canada. The company was founded in the same year by James Donaldson, the CEO, and Daniel Micay, the CTO and lead developer, and initially served clients in the Canadian legal and intelligence industries. During this work, the founders noticed an absence of secure, open-source operating systems for mobile devices, and they created CopperheadOS under an open source license to try to address this need. Copperhead announced the development of CopperheadOS in April 2015. According to the announcement, the operating system was designed to be a \\"secure-by-default version of Android\\" aimed at privacy- conscious users. At first, CopperheadOS was licensed under the GNU General Public License, and the project's code was located on GitHub. Copperhead contributed several of their bug fixes and improvements developed for CopperheadOS to the Android Open Source Project, the main project for Android development by Google. In August 2015, Copperhead released the first alpha version of CopperheadOS. At this point, the project was based on CyanogenMod, and included support for the Google Nexus 5 and Samsung Galaxy S4. This was followed by a beta version in February 2016, with support for the Nexus 5, Nexus 9 and Nexus 5X. The beta was based directly on the Android Open Source Project instead of using CyanogenMod, as were subsequent releases. The move away from CyanogenMod and the lack of vendor support led to dropping support for the Samsung Galaxy S4. In May 2016, Copperhead launched an online store where the Nexus 5X could be purchased directly with CopperheadOS pre-loaded. The Nexus 6P was made available for purchase from the store in July of the same year. = License change and departure of Daniel Micay = From October 2016, for versions of CopperheadOS based on Android 7.0 Nougat, Copperhead changed the CopperheadOS license to the Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial-ShareAlike (BY-NC-SA) license. According to Donaldson, this was to prevent other companies from using the CopperheadOS code without paying Copperhead for licensing, in order to keep the project sustainable. Copperhead began selling Google Pixel phones pre-loaded with CopperheadOS in March 2017, in addition to their lineup of Nexus phones. For Nexus devices, users could download and install CopperheadOS for free; however, this option was not made available for Pixel phones. For Pixel phones, users could either buy a phone from the Copperhead store with CopperheadOS pre-loaded, or send their own phone to Copperhead for the operating system to be installed on it. This was done to prevent violations of CopperheadOS's non-commercial license; Copperhead competitors had been selling Nexus phones with CopperheadOS installed without obtaining a commercial license, and Copperhead wanted to avoid this issue with the Pixel. The issue came to a head in November the same year, when Copperhead briefly shut down the update server for Nexus devices in order to stop the continued license violations. The company restored the update server after two days. Copperhead released an alpha version of CopperheadOS for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL in January 2018. Official releases for the Pixel 2 and 2 XL were marked as \\"for internal use\\", and could not be downloaded from the Copperhead website without authentication. This maintained the status quo of only Nexus releases being available for public download. Disagreements between the two founders over business policy became increasingly heated over the first few months of 2018, and led to Donaldson firing Micay in June of that year. Micay responded by posting his dismissal notice on Reddit, and by deleting the cryptographic keys necessary to release updates for the project. Micay said that he considered \\"the company and infrastructure to be compromised\\", and that he would \\"prevent [Donaldson] from harming any users\\". Copperhead failed to provide CopperheadOS updates for several months afterwards. Micay continued the development of the open source parts of CopperheadOS as the Android Hardening project, which was later rebranded as GrapheneOS. According to Donaldson, as of February 2019 he and Micay were in a legal dispute over the incident. = Android Pie and beyond = In March 2019, Copperhead released a version of CopperheadOS based on Android Pie, which had support for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Pixel devices pre-installed with CopperheadOS could be purchased from Copperhead's website. This was followed in February 2020 with a version of CopperheadOS based on Android 10, available for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. As of June 2020, CopperheadOS sources and installation files were not available for public download and could only be obtained from Copperhead's partner network.  Features and compatibility  CopperheadOS is focused on hardening the Android operating system to make it more difficult for attackers to exploit any potential security vulnerabilities. In a 2016 interview, Copperhead CEO James Donaldson said, \\"The point of it is to increase the amount of resources an attacker needs to expend... to the point where hopefully they will just give up.\\" The operating system features several security improvements over stock Android related to how programs interact with memory. It implements the PaX security patches for the Linux kernel, which improves resistance against executing code that has managed to find its way into writable memory. It also features improved address space layout randomization, a version of malloc with better memory layout randomization, and more secure SELinux policies. CopperheadOS also features verified boot, which protects against malware taking over the boot process or the recovery process of the device. There are also various changes from stock Android in user-facing features. CopperheadOS separates the password used to unlock the device from the device's encryption password; users can use a relatively simple password to unlock their devices, but if the wrong password is entered five times in a row, the device reboots and the encryption password must be entered, which would be presumably more difficult for an attacker to guess. The operating system ships with the F-Droid store, from which users can install open-source applications, instead of the Google Play store usually found on Android phones. This is to prevent users from unknowingly installing malicious apps on their devices. The project supports smartphones in the Google Pixel product line. This is done to preserve Copperhead's development resources, and to enable quick patching when Google releases security updates. , the supported phones are the Pixel 2, the Pixel 2 XL, the Pixel 3, the Pixel 3 XL, the Pixel 3a, and the Pixel 3a XL.  Reception  In January 2018, Tarus Balog of opensource.com was favorably impressed by features in CopperheadOS, but he found the lack of Google applications difficult, and was confused by licensing terms and conditions. Balog said he initially used a Nexus 6P because available Pixel and Pixel XL phones from Copperhead were too expensive. At that time source code was available, but he was unable to successfully complete his own build.  Influence  In 2016, a Tor Phone prototype was developed based on CopperheadOS.

At least seven major fires were burning out of control in the north of Portugal on August 9, according to officials, the fire of Arouca and S.Pedro do Sul was the biggest. The authorities say around 3,000 firefighters are trying to extinguish hundreds of forest fires across the country. An emergency was declared in Portugal's northern Norte Region as firefighters battled numerous wildfires. Fire in Madeira  On 9 August 2016 a fire, allegedly by arson, started at the S.

Though still burning in several fronts, the fire was, according to Madeira's regional president Miguel Albuquerque, \\"under control\\". The statement was later qualified. Four deaths are attributed to the wildfire as well as a thousand displaced people. The five-star hotel \\"Choupana Hills\\" was also gutted by the flames. Three suspects of arson are currently detained and one of them is currently in pre-trial detention.

He, along with his brother, Henry I, took part in the Fifth Crusade with Leopold VI, Duke of Austria. The Altenburg Abbey Dispute After Duke Leopold the Glorious died on 28 July 1230, disputes with his heir, Frederick II, Duke of Austria, infamously called the Warlike or Quarrelsome, rose up almost immediately. When Liutold and Conrad of Altenburg sent an appeal to Duke Frederick on 30 November 1230 for the demarcation of the abbey, the Kuenring brothers and their allies, the Sonnbergs under Hadmar I of Sonnberg, responded with vehement protest, declaring that such a thing would impoverish their houses. Frederick, in an act of apathy, waved it off and demanded they accept the new changes. This led to war in the early months of 1231, and it ended with the destruction of Sonnberg castle in April 1231. This dispute led to a complete enmity with Duke Frederick, and the forced acceptance of the Altenburg appeal. It became one of the basis for further rebellions in Austria.

Both were at anchor at Anse √† la Barque, Guadeloupe when their crews burned them on 18 December 1809 to avoid their falling into British hands during an attack by a British squadron comprising His Majesty's Ships , Blonde, , , , , , and . British accounts of the battle generally refer to \\"the two arm√©es en flute and late 40-gun frigates Loire and Seine\\".James and Chamier (1837), Vol. 5, pp.186-87. However, this description is a little misleading. The class were not designed as frigates, and then modified; they were designed as fl√ªtes. Furthermore, they were lightly armed; their armament was heavy enough to deter British privateers, and small naval vessels such as schooners, cutters, and brigs, but not heavy enough to deter sloops or frigates. Loire Loire was laid down in November 1802 and launched on 15 October 1803. She left Nantes on 15 November 1809 in company with her classmate. Loire was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Joseph Lenormant-Kergr√© (or Lernormand Kergr√©), and had been transporting troops and supplies to Guadeloupe at the time of her loss.Fonds Marine, p.378. On the way she and Seine participated in the naval engagement in which the French frigates Clorinde and Renomm√©e engaged HMS Observateur and HMS Junon, capturing Junon. Neither fl√ªte suffered any casualties. Seine Seine was laid down in November 1802 but not launched until 17 September 1806. She left Nantes on 15 November 1809 in company with her classmate Loire. Seine was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Bernard Vincent, and had been transporting troops and supplies to Guadeloupe at the time of her loss. On the way she and Loire participated in the naval engagement in which the French frigates Clorinde and Renomm√©e engaged HMS Observateur and HMS Junon, capturing Junon. Neither fl√ªte suffered any casualties. British vs. French accounts James, in his report on the engagement with Junon, reports that Loire and Seine both fired their guns at Junon, one from in front and one from behind the British frigate, and that the French soldiers on the fl√ªtes discharged their small arms, almost sweeping Junons deck. Troude does not mention small arms, but insists that the two fl√ªtes neither fired their cannon nor received any cannon fire.Troude (1867), Vol. 6, p.79. With respect to the engagement at Anse √† la Barque, Troude reports that the French vessels started to unload their cargo. When the British attacked, Vincent, on Seine, cut her masts and opened her scuttles to flood her. The water did not enter fast enough, so he fired her guns into the hold. This had the effect of starting a fire that led to the explosion that destroyed her, and set fire to Loire, destroying her also.Troude (1867), Vol. 6, pp.80-81.

The play is inspired by the March 1979 arrest of Zhang Quanlong (Âº†Ê≥âÈæô), a young man who impersonated the son of Li Da, deputy of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department. As the play exposed corruption in the establishment and lampooned the impostor's \\"victims\\", there was considerable debate among the literary circles on whether it should be performed publicly. In January 1980, Communist Party of China's propaganda chief Hu Yaobang put an end to the debates by openly criticizing the play as failing \\"to reflect the true spirit and moral perception of Chinese youth during the New Period\\", effectively banning its public performances. Background In 1979, playwright Sha Yexin and actors Li Shoucheng and Yao Mingde (all from Shanghai People's Art Theatre), went to the preliminary hearing of impostor Zhang Quanlong held in Jing'an District, Shanghai. Zhang Quanlong, a secondary school graduate assigned to a rural farm in Chongming Island (off the shore of Shanghai) during the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), had become the talk of the city after his arrest. Because he had a former classmate working in the Shanghai Municipal Government, he often visited this cadre friend in hopes that the \\"connection\\" could get him permanently transferred back to Shanghai. When he was at the cadre's house, he did household chores and answered the phone, and after some time, remembered the names, positions and relationships of many cadres. One time, frustrated he could not get a ticket to the restricted play Much Ado About Nothing, he decided to impersonate the son of Li Da, deputy of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department. Immediately doors opened up for him, and \\"by the Spring Festival of 1979 Zhang had been accepted by the upper crust of Shanghai society and had the run of the city\\". After enjoying a privileged life for months, Zhang was finally exposed and detained when his suspicious neighbors, who noticed him riding in a chauffeured limousine at all hours, reported him to the authorities. His stories, genuine or not, dominated local gossip and won him a dimension of folk hero. According to rumors he said \\"My only crime is that I am not the son of So-and-so.\\" and \\"What would have happened if I were really So-and-so's son?\\" If I Were for Real was written in a little over 2 weeks and rushed into production in August 1979 by the Shanghai People's Art Theatre and briefly toured a few major cities. English translations  (translated by Edward M. Gunn) * (translated by Daniel Kane) Plot summary Li Xiaozhang (ÊùéÂ∞èÁíã), a 26-year-old sent-down youth at a state farm, is frustrated he cannot receive a transfer to the city. His pregnant girlfriend Zhou Minghua (Âë®ÊòéÂçé) has already returned to the city, and without securing his transfer her father would not let them marry. He witnesses how tickets to a popular play (Nikolai Gogol's The Government Inspector, about an impostor) are unavailable to commoners but reserved for cadre members and their families, and decides to play a trick on the theatre director. Posing as the son of a high-level cadre, he immediately gains entrance to the play. Soon many cadres, including the theatre director, a Culture Bureau chief and an Organization Department Political Division head, all fawn over him in the belief that he will in return use his connections for their selfish gains. With their assistance, Li Xiaozhang enjoys a privileged life for more than 2 weeks and even succeeds in receiving his transfer, but is in the end exposed and brought to trial. He admits his guilt but reminds the audience that if he were really the son of a high-level cadre, everything would have been completely legal and accepted. Adaptations The play was adapted into a 1981 Taiwanese film of the same name directed by Wang Toon, which won 3 awards at the 18th Golden Horse Awards: Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay (Chang Yung-hsiang) and Best Actor (Alan Tam). In 1986, Pan Asian Repertory Theatre in New York City staged the play under director Ron Nakahara.

She has been assigned to be part of a delegation from Canada sent to the (fictional) independent nation of Besco to try and negotiate on behalf of the Canadian government for mining rights. Danielle Richard (Macha Grenon), is the newly elected president of Besco. She wants to renegotiate the deal that her predecessors struck with the Canadian government as she finds the terms unfavourable. Additionally the Canadian government has not been adhering to the terms that they had previously agreed to. The two parties meet in secret in a school gym to hash out a deal, with mediator Emily Price (Emily VanCamp) assigned to stay neutral. Initially progress seems to be being made; the Canadian delegation offers to help subsidize some of the costs of mining and environmental protection and offer to help put pressure on the Canadian mining company, Sherman, to help the Besco government. However they abruptly pull out of negotiations and Torpe, the lead Canadian delegate tells president Richard that she must grant Sherman the rights to the mine or Canada will never agree to looser restrictions that will let Besco expand their fishing industry.

The county superintendent of schools started a teachers' library in the courthouse sometime afterward. By this time the community had a library of 800 volumes. with There was an effort by study clubs in town in 1898 to raise money and establish a free public library. The Chariton Federation of Women's Clubs took the lead and opened a library with the books from the courthouse in two rooms above Gibbons Drug Store on the town square. Citizens approved a local tax to support the library the following year. Librarian Margaret Brown and Library Board President Thomas Gay applied to the Carnegie Corporation of New York for a grant to build a library building, and on January 13, 1903 they were awarded $11,000. The Chicago architectural firm of Patton & Miller was chosen to design the new building. It was dedicated on October 28, 1904. The Neoclassical style building is a single-story structure of dark brown rock-faced brick with Bedford stone trim. The symmetrical facade features a projecting portico with stone columns in the Doric order, brick pilasters, a stone cornice, and a triangular brick and stone pediment. The building is capped with a hip roof The interior plan of the building became known as the \\"Chariton Plan\\" because it was first used here before it was used for other libraries in Iowa. In 1993 the Mason City, Iowa architectural firm of Bergland & Cram designed an addition that was added to the rear of the building. The library building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. In 2014 it was included as a contributing property in the Lucas County Courthouse Square Historic District.

It examines black writers in the interwar period, focusing on sites of interaction between Anglophone and Francophone black writers to develop an argument about the generative potential of translation, specifically in the black diaspora. Among other influences, Edwards draws on Stuart Hall's use of the concept of articulation to develop a theoretical use of the French term d√©calage, \\"referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it...[Edwards argues] that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion.\\" Edwards also edited the collection Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies (Columbia University Press, 2004) with Farah Jasmine Griffin and Robert G.

A member of the Indian National Congress, she was elected to the Lok Sabha from Karur, Tamil Nadu in 2019. Having joined politics at a young age, Jothimani served separate terms as the General Secretary and Vice President of Indian Youth Congress and Tamil Nadu Youth Congress respectively.  Early life and education  Jothimani was born on 9 August 1975 at Periya Thirumangalam, Aravakurichi, Karur District to Sennimalai and Muthulakshmi. Her father Sennimalai was a farmer. She lost her father Sennimalai in her childhood. With the support of her mother Muthulakshmi, she completed her Graduation at Sri G.V.G Visalakshi College for Women, Udumalaipet. During her college days, she was elected as Chairman of College Students Union. She was an active participant in the NSS Camps in college and took part in social service activities.

She is known to be fluent in Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi and English. She was an active worker in Indian Youth Congress and a close associate of the Indian National Congress president Rahul Gandhi. She has represented the Indian Youth Congress at international forums like American Council for Young Political Leaders that was held in the US in 2006 and Asian Young Leader's Summit 2009 in Malaysia. She was also selected for Vital-Voice of Asia Asian Women Leaders Meet held in New Delhi in 2010. Jothimani then unsuccessfully contested the 2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election after securing the Indian National Congress' candidature from Karur constituency. = Tamil Nadu state assembly election, 2016 = In July, 2015, Jothimani launched her election campaign from Aravakurichi constituency for 2016 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election. She has intensified the campaign on the ground and through social media as well. She has been meeting various sections of the people in the constituency and called upon them to give a \\"missed call\\" if they supported her candidature. Calendars and pamphlets explaining the initiative have been distributed across the constituency. Her Facebook and Twitter account with the hashtag, 'Aravakurichi 2016,' are replete with postings and pictures of her interaction with voters of the constituency. She has also formed youth groups to reach out to the voters. Between the time the DMK and Congress declared that the national party ‚Äì Congress would contest from 41 seats and the announcement about which the seats were, there was a rather extended period of silence, filled with suspense. When Aravakurichi did not figure on the Congress list, Jothimani unleashed a volley of strong criticisms and even threatened to contest as an independent candidate. But the alliance leader put its foot down, refusing to concede. For one, this is one of the rare seats that the DMK bagged in the last Assembly election. More importantly, the sitting MLA, the one who is seeking re-election this time, is K C Palanisamy, an important leader in the party affairs in many ways. After a meeting with her supporters, she said that she has decided not to contest in the Aravakurichi constituency in the overall interest of the Congress party. The Election was about to be held on 16 May 2016. Then the election commission postponed it to 23 May 2016 and again postpone the polling along with Thanjavur Assembly constituencies to 13 June 2016. Finally Election Commission cancelled polls to Aravakurichi and Thanjavur Assembly seats. = 2019 Election to the Parliament = Jothimani attained the Indian National Congress' candidature for the Indian general election, 2019 from Karur constituency of the Lok Sabha. In what was seen as a major upset by many media outlets and political analyst, Jothimani went on to defeat veteran All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader, M. Thambidurai who had previously served as Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha Speaker and in the Union Cabinet.  Activism  = Controversy with BJP Karu Nagarajan = During a live interview in a private television about the spread of COVID-19 in India on May 18, 2020, a Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Karu Nagarajan made sexist remarks against Jothimani when she criticized the Bhartiya Janata party in mishandling the Immigrant crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Jothimani quit the show on live television claiming that the BJP spokesperson made personal remarks after he was unable to answer her questions. The video went viral and Jothimani received huge support from people. The hashtag trended on social media.

At a height of , Verr√ºckt became the world's tallest water slide when it opened on July 10, 2014, surpassing Kilimanjaro at Aldeia das √Åguas Park Resort in Brazil. The ride was designed in-house, led by John Schooley with assistance from park co-owner Jeff Henry. It was featured on an episode of Xtreme Waterparks that aired on the Travel Channel in June 2014 shortly before the ride opened. Verr√ºckt permanently closed in 2016 following a fatal incident involving the decapitation of a ten-year-old. Verr√ºckt was originally scheduled to open in June 2013, but difficulties during various stages of construction and testing resulted in several delays. Sandbags loaded into rafts during testing were often seen going airborne. The ride's final design saw rafts reach a maximum speed of . Verr√ºckt was well-received upon opening, winning a Golden Ticket Award from Amusement Today in 2014. After the son of Kansas state legislator Scott Schwab died on the ride in 2016, amusement park safety laws were updated to require state inspection of all attractions. It was later revealed that at least 13 other people had suffered non-fatal injuries from hitting the netting above the slide on Verr√ºckt. Criminal charges led to the arrests of several individuals, including the park's owner, operations manager, and lead ride designer. The charges were ultimately dismissed with the finding of multiple procedural issues with the case's presentation. The incident's aftermath, however, resulted in a rapid decline of the company's reputation and financial standing. History =Background= Original plans for Schlitterbahn Kansas City, Schlitterbahn Waterparks' first park outside Texas, called for a $750 million complex that included hotels and resort areas. Officials in Wyandotte County, Kansas, where it was to be built, were delighted when the company announced the plans in 2005, seeing Schlitterbahn's plan as the culmination of efforts to draw residents of the Kansas City metropolitan area to spend their disposable income in Kansas rather than Missouri. State legislators from the area passed a law allowing Schlitterbahn to \\"self-inspect\\" its attractions as it did in Texas, unlike all other amusement parks in Kansas, which were subject to state inspection. However, the full plans never came to fruition. The Great Recession two years later forced many amusement park operators, including Schlitterbahn, to scale back their plans and focus on making their existing parks profitable in the challenging economy. Schlitterbahn Kansas City was reduced to a $180 million park without any lodging, and was not open for a full season until 2010. It was successful, but not to the degree Schlitterbahn and co-owner Jeff Henry had originally expected. =Construction= In November 2012, Schlitterbahn announced plans for the creation of the world's tallest and fastest water slide at their Kansas City park, to open in summer 2013. No name was given during the announcement, while specifications on the height of the ride were kept secret in order to ensure that the completed ride would set a world record for its creation. The water slide was conceived on the spur of the moment by Henry, after a team from Travel Channel's Xtreme Waterparks asked at a trade show what he was working on. After initial attempts to pitch the idea to vendors at the show failed, Henry decided to build the slide himself, enlisting John Schooley as the ride's lead designer. Henry had described the new ride to the Travel Channel crew as a \\"speed blaster\\", a term he had likewise improvised. He and Schooley knew that Schlitterbahn had to live up to the hype Henry had created and design something previously unheard of. \\"Basically we were crazy enough to try anything,\\" Schooley later recalled. Henry pressed his design team to complete the ride at a faster pace than usual; many of those involved worked almost around the clock. Calculations that were normally allotted three to six months instead had five weeks to be completed. As they began testing, rafts kept going airborne on the ride's large bottom hump. In November 2013, the ride was officially named Verr√ºckt, the German word for crazy or insane, with the opening date pushed back until the start of the park's 2014 season. The Guinness Book of World Records named Verr√ºckt the world's tallest water slide in April 2014, before it was even finished. At , it surpassed the Kilimanjaro at Aldeia das √Åguas Park Resort in Brazil. When the park opened, delays in construction and testing of the ride led to its opening date being pushed back to June 5, and then June 29, after the lower portion of the ride was rebuilt, to coincide with a television special about the ride; the park later cancelled this opening date and two days of media previews following further delays. An unnamed lifeguard at the park told Esquire in 2019 that he saw some of the later tests, which the park primarily did after it had closed for the day, with only select employees usually those who had been with the company for the longest allowed to watch. In his case, he saw the Xtreme Waterparks crew ride the ride. \\"The only time I saw the slide run successfully was on the Travel Channel episode, but I wouldn't even call that successful\\", he recalled, since the raft in that case got stuck on the second hump. Sandbags on the raft frequently went airborne at that point as well; some viral videos of this leaked out. \\"I told my friends and family it was only a matter of time until someone died on Verr√ºckt\\", the lifeguard said. A safety consultant hired by the park shortly before Verr√ºckt's scheduled opening told Henry it was unfinished and unsafe. When complete, he recommended that only riders 16 and over be allowed on the ride. Henry, who had no formal training in engineering, decided 14 was better. Right before the opening, however, he dropped any age limit. =Operation= The ride was eventually completed and officially opened on July 10, attracting national media coverage. Among the first riders was then Kansas Governor Sam Brownback. The riders who had seen the videos of sandbags flying off the rafts went on anyway‚Äîone local judge told Esquire later that she rode the water slide ten times that day, and an employee who had loaded the sandbags during testing said he went down twenty times over its first two days. \\"That should tell you something about how I felt about it\\", he said. However, Henry and Schooley, while watching riders that day, noted how many rafts seemed to be going airborne on the lower hump, into the netting meant to keep them on the slide if that happened. Two months later, Verr√ºckt was voted the world's \\"Best New Waterpark Ride\\" at the 2014 Golden Ticket Awards. However, at least thirteen riders suffered non-fatal injuries, such as concussions or slipped and herniated discs many of which had longterm effects after either hitting the netting or being thrown into it. After a Missouri man thrown from the raft suffered facial injuries in June 2016, the park's operations manager allegedly attempted to cover up the incident, telling lifeguards what to write in their reports; it is believed that was not the only accident where this happened. Even some riders who were uninjured were unnerved by Verr√ºckt. A Kansas City man who had made a point of going down it due to favorable experiences with the Texas Schlitterbahn parks recalled having to grab the raft's auxiliary straps when the Velcro ones holding him came loose after the first drop; he was thankful that his son had used the weight limit as an excuse not to ride. A local woman whose boyfriend held her in the raft likewise noted to Esquire that the netting and hoops on the lower hump showed signs of many instances where people had collided with it. Design Verr√ºckt was designed to consist of two drops, the initial being a 17-story plunge, with a five-story uphill midsection. The ride was designed to accommodate the use of three-person rafts, each weighing and carried up by conveyor to the top of the slide, while riders were required to climb 264 steps to reach the top. To avoid issues with rafts lifting off the slide, rider groups were weighed twice ‚Äì once at the bottom and again at the top before riding ‚Äì to make sure that their combined weight was between and , and that no single rider weighed over . The starting point of the ride, at , was taller than either Niagara Falls or the foot-to-torch portion of the Statue of Liberty. As it was beyond the that zoning codes permitted, the design required a variance (the height was increased from its initial plan of , which was also above the limit). After the announcement of the ride's height and the certification of its world record on April 25, 2014, Schlitterbahn tore down most of the lower part of the ride, in order to rebuild and re-engineer it after sandbags were seen flying off the ride during testing. As a result, the second drop was changed from 45 degrees to 22 degrees, an extra was added to the uphill portion of the ride to slow down rafts, and a series of metal hoops and netting supported by them were added into areas where rafts had flown off in early testing. Fatal incident On August 7, 2016, Caleb Schwab, the 10-year-old son of Kansas state representative Scott Schwab, died while riding Verr√ºckt. The raft he was riding went airborne during the ascent of the second hill and impacted a metal support of the netting, decapitating him. The other two passengers, both women, were injured in the incident ‚Äì one suffered a broken jaw, while the other suffered a facial bone fracture and needed stitches. In the immediate aftermath, the park was closed pending an inspection. Although the park reopened three days later, the ride remained closed. It was reported that the boy, who weighed , had been allowed to sit in the front of the raft, rather than between the two women accompanying him ‚Äî one weighed , while the other weighed . This led to an uneven weight distribution, leading some experts to conclude that the uneven distribution of weight may have contributed to the raft going airborne, despite the cumulative weight of being less than the maximum recommended weight of . Engineers who inspected the ride also commented that the ride's netting, used in areas where riders travel up to , \\"posed its own hazard because a rider moving at high speeds could easily lose a limb if they hit it\\". Their findings revealed that the use of the metal brace and netting system in the design, along with the use of hook and loop straps to restrain the riders, went against guidelines set by ASTM F-24 Committee on Amusement Ride and Devices. According to the guidelines, Verr√ºckt should have incorporated the use of a rigid over-the- shoulder restraint for riders, and an upstop mechanism to prevent the rafts from going airborne. Aftermath After Schwab spoke to his fellow legislators about his son's death and its effect on him, they voted to change the law that had allowed Schlitterbahn to self-inspect, requiring that all the state's amusement park attractions be regularly inspected by the state. In November 2016, Schlitterbahn announced that Verr√ºckt would be demolished following the conclusion of a criminal investigation. The Schwab family settled with several involved parties including Schlitterbahn for approximately $20 million in early 2017. Settlements involving the other two riders who were injured in the accident were undisclosed. In July 2018, a judge approved a plan by the park to disassemble the ride beginning the following September. The ride's teardown was placed on hold indefinitely in August 2018, resulting from ongoing discussions in multiple court cases that were filed after the incident. The park eventually began dismantling the ride in November 2018, and the work to remove the ride was completed within two months. The park didn't operate the following season, and the company's reputation and finances were negatively impacted. Two of the company's water parks in Texas were sold in June 2019 for $261 million to Cedar Fair, a major owner of amusement parks nationwide including Kansas City's Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun. =Criminal charges= On March 23, 2018, a grand jury issued an indictment against Schlitterbahn and Tyler Austin Miles, former director of operations, charging them with involuntary manslaughter, aggravated battery, aggravated child endangerment, and interference with law enforcement. The indictment accused the park of negligence, concealing design flaws, and downplaying the severity of previous injuries reported on the ride. The 2018 indictment against Schlitterbahn wrote that Henry and Schooley \\"lacked technical expertise to design a properly functioning water slide\\" and did not perform standard engineering procedures or calculations on how the slide would operate. Instead they used \\"crude trial-and-error methods\\" to test its performance, out of haste to launch the ride. According to court documents, Schooley conceded that, \\"If we actually knew how to do this, and it could be done that easily, it wouldn‚Äôt be that spectacular.\\" Three days later, on March 26, Henry was arrested in Cameron County, Texas, in connection with the incident. A day later, on March 27, the Kansas Attorney General's office released a new indictment against Henry, Schooley, and Henry & Sons Construction Company ‚Äî privately owned by Schlitterbahn ‚Äî charging them with second-degree murder in addition to seventeen other felonies. Schooley was arrested at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport after returning from a trip to China on April 2, 2018. The defendants were arraigned in April 2018, and the first criminal trial began in October of that year. On February 22, 2019, criminal charges were dismissed against Henry, Schooley, and Miles due to the fact that inadmissible evidence had been presented to the grand jury.https://mediaassets.kshb.com/NWT/Alyssa/Judge%20Burns'%20Ruling.pdf The judge's ruling called out state attorneys for presenting the Xtreme Waterparks episode to jurors as fact, instead of as a \\"fictional and dramatized version of events created for entertainment purposes\\", and expert witnesses for claiming that the designers of the slide were negligent in not following ASTM standards, despite the fact that the law at the time did not require that those standards be followed.Judge Dismisses Murder Charges Over Boy's Death On Kansas Waterslide, National Public Radio, Bill Chappell, February 25, 2019.

The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called \\"dying of a broken heart\\". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses. Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement. The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing. Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically. During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising. Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide. Women on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter. This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions. It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50 Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter. Gender differences Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women. Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability. Journal of Health and Social Behavior. (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07. The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed men that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 National Survey of Families and Households. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a Center for Epidemiologic Studies‚Äî Depression scale (CES-D), and found that men were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than women were. Men were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to their female counterparts. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married men had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Men in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on male mortality. Experimenters involved in the study regarding: The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes, took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage. Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so. Although some of these women were shown to extract themselves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are more likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family. In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a man's spouse affected his physical activity. Men's physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms. In the year following the death of a spouse, men are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die. Men in the youngest age group of this study (55‚Äì 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse. Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood mortality is largest and doesn't decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for white males, compared to only the third month for white females. Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed nine years‚Äô worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18% increase in ‚Äúall-cause mortality‚Äù for men whose wives died first; for women, the risk is 16%. Although the percentage of males was higher than females, it is not a significant difference to state that men are more affected than women. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that ‚ÄúThe death of a wifehusband is associated with ana 18%greater increaserate in all-cause mortality for menwomen, and the death of a husbandwife is associated with a 16%lesser increaserate in all-cause mortality for womenmen, after adjusting for covariates.\\" Religious differences A 2009 study by Ernest L. Abel and Michael L. Kruger compared the likelihood of death for Catholic as compared to Jewish widows, based on the graves of Jewish and Catholic couples in the Midwest. The data suggested that the widowhood effect was stronger in Jewish than in Catholic couples. Catholic women lived 11 years after the death of their spouse while Jewish women lived 9.5 years after the deaths of their husbands. Similarly, the Jewish men lived 5 years after the death of the wives while the Catholic men lived about 8 years after the death of their wives. Dietary health effects of widowhood Experiencing the loss of a spouse often changes many components of the widows‚Äô life. The recently widowed individual is forced to change their everyday routine, which often puts immense stress on the recent widower/widow. Research has found that surviving spouses tend to experience significant weight loss after the deaths of their mates. It has been theorized that these changes in weight are the result of differences in dietary intake before and after the death of a spouse. Danit R. Shahar et al. (2001) surveyed 116 older individuals in order to track their weight and eating habits over the course of their longitudinal study. Half of the participants were widowed and the other half were nonwidowed. The study found that the widowed subjects were more likely to eat meals alone than the married individuals. The diets of the widowed subjects consisted of more commercial foods than their counterparts, but they also lost a significant amount of weight compared to the married group. Danit R. Shahar et al. (2001) hypothesized that this weight loss was the result of the widowed participants not finding as much enjoyment in eating as the once did. This lack of fulfillment during meals was correlated to a lack of companionship while eating. Widowed subjects had less of an appetite and as a result lost weight over the course of the study. Mental health effects of widowhood The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person's mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse's death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues. The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Men may become more depressed in widowhood compared to women because men may not have a strong enough support group. Married men also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Women may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while men tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in men tends to be higher than in women. Takotsubo and the widowhood effect Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the broken heart syndrome. Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55‚Äì64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55‚Äì64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon. Effects of widowhood on social life Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends. It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic. With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression-like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals. Urban, rural and race variations A 2015 study conducted by Rosato, O‚ÄôReilly and Wright revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versus white families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas. In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort. Whites were found to have ‚Äúa large and enduring widowhood effect‚Äù because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years. The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014). Possible causes It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., & Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased mortality rate of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood. In April 2016, the American Heart Association published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as \\"broken heart syndrome\\". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.  Widowhood effect solution  Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect.  Coping mechanisms  There is no universally accepted ‚Äúproper‚Äù method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one's primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual's bereavement (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized ‚Äúas an active coping strategy‚Äù as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‚Äòjob‚Äô of one's deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

Plot After bitter wars and natural disasters, the earth is devastated, depopulated and chaotic; morality and law no longer exist. Marauding gangs terrorize the last gatherings of peace-loving people, who often gather around churches. Only a small group of volunteers - the Rangers - fight back against injustice. In Texas in 2020, degenerate villains raid a monastery in which pretty Maida took refuge, when five roving Rangers show up. The battle-hardened men quickly succeed in repelling the attackers and restoring order. However, during the incident, one of her saviors named Catch Dog falls into disgrace as he tries to rape Maida. He is eventually rejected by his comrades. Later, Ranger Nexus separates from his friends, taking Maida with him. Five years later, Nexus and Maida live with their little daughter a seemingly safe life in the settlement of Free Town. In addition to basic services, the community operates a power plant and uranium mine. The village's energy reserves soon lure in dark outlaws. One day, disaster strikes as Catch Dog manages to bring down Free Town with his gang. Catch Dog himself acts on behalf of the \\"Black One\\", a totalitarian ruler who subjugates the population with his thugs. In an attempt to resist, Nexus dies. The able-bodied men are enslaved and used as laborers in the uranium production, the women are sold to different bars in the area. At some point, the three remaining Rangers meet Maida and set her free from her master, a gambler. The three encounter and manage to enlist the help of an indigenous tribe. Ultimately, the Rangers and the recruited warriors succeed in taking back Free Town. The regime of terror is overthrown. Both Catch Dog and Black One are killed, and in the midst of combat, also one of the Ranger succumbs to his injuries. In the end, Maida and her daughter can expect a happier future. The two remaining Rangers leave. Production In a 1996 interview, D'Amato stated that Eastman \\"didn't feel confident enough in the action scenes and so I dealt with those, leaving him to the direction of the actors. But in this case, the name recorded at the Ministry (director's credit) was mine.\\" D'Amato received directing credit, although Eastman directed most of the dialogue scenes according to D'Amato. Eastman also stated in 1996, that \\"These (post- atomic) films, which were made in the wake of the various Mad Max movies, were decidedly crummy. The set designs were poor....and the genre met a swift and well-deserved death. I only wrote these awful movies for financial reasons....no attempt at originality was made at all.\\" Release 2020 Texas Gladiators was passed by Italian censors in 1984. The film has been released under several titles, including Anno 2020: I Gladiatori del Futuro (lit. Year 2020 Gladiators of the Future), Futoro, 2020: Freedom Fighters, 2020: The Rangers of Texas and Sudden Death. The film was released on VHS in 1985 by Media Home Entertainment. Reception In his book Horror and Science Fiction Film IV, Donald C Willis described the film as an \\"undistinguished actioner\\" that had a \\"long wait for the climactic novelty of a battle waged with bows and arrows, cycles, shields, rifles, machine guns, and hatchets\\" Donald Guarisco (AllMovie) noted how the film did not \\"follow the usual formula of ripping off The Road Warrior or Escape From New York (though it does take some visual cues from those sources).\\" but was closer to a spaghetti western that was \\"updated with some futuristic gadgetry.\\" The review referred to the story telling as \\"fairly brain-dead\\", noting that first half of the film is hard to follow as it moved from scene to scene with no transitions or any connecting scenes to explain a passage of time. The review commented on the characters as \\"cardbaord\\" and the dialogue as \\"often hilarious\\" noting that \\"there is some type of action every few minutes in this flick. The end result is daft but never dull and that duality makes Anno 2020 - I Gladiatori Del Futuro good late-night fodder for fans of trashy b-movies.\\" TV Guide referred to the film as \\"an inept action picture\\" that was derivative of the \\"infinitely superior \\"Mad Max\\" series\\" and that \\"One can go on and on pointing out the innumerable problems of the film or that the director must be morally spent, but the fact will remain that 2020 Texas Gladiators is nothing but more egesta from the Italian exploitation factory.\\" See also *List of action films of the 1980s *List of Italian films of the 1980s *Mad Max series legacy and influence in popular culture  References  =Footnotes= =Sources=  * External links * Italian science fiction action films 1980s science fiction action films Films directed by Joe D'Amato Post-apocalyptic films Films set in Texas Films set in 2020 Italian films about revenge 1980s exploitation films ","title":"2020 Texas Gladiators"},{"id":"51289841","text":"The Dom≈æale Tigers are an American football team from Dom≈æale, Slovenia.

Throughout her career, Barton studied infertility and conception. Her pioneering research and practice were inspired by experience as a medical missionary in India, where she saw the harsh treatment of childless women. At the time, infertility was widely believed to be the woman's fault. Barton understood that both men and women could be infertile. Both the identification of the male as an infertile partner and the introduction of treatments that used \\"instrumental insemination\\" met with strong social disapproval. This was true even when using the husband's sperm, a process known as artificial insemination by husband, or AIH. Artificial insemination by donor, AID, was even more contentious, raising questions of adultery, illegitimacy, and perjury. This led to practices of secrecy. In one of her research papers on fertility and conception, Barton reports successfully treating over 1,000 women using AID, 600 cases between 1944-1954 and another 431 women from 1955 to the end of December 1962. Thousands more women were treated at her clinic for AIH. Barton's second husband, sex researcher Bertold Wiesner, is believed to have been in charge of recruiting sperm donors for Barton's clinic. He and a small number of other donors may have provided the majority of the sperm used, resulting in the birth of hundreds of half-siblings, most of whom had no knowledge of their conception. The clinic's patient records were destroyed, but DNA testing has identified groups of half-siblings. The Barton clinic has been the subject of the documentaries Offspring (2001) and Bio-Dad (2009) by Barry Stevens and of a play by Maud Dromgoole.  Early life and marriages  Mary was born in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in a family of several generations of surgeons and doctors. She attended Norwich High School for Girls from 1915‚Äì1923, and in October 1923 she commenced studies at the London School of Medicine for Women. She received her Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery from the University of London in 1929.

The couple practised in a missionary hospital. They divorced in 1939; she retained his name for the rest of her professional career. Mary Barton married Austrian physiologist Bertold Paul Wiesner in 1943. They had a son, Jonathan, and a daughter, Ruth. Early career Mary Barton and her first husband were medical missionaries in pre-partition India, then still ruled by Britain. She witnessed the way in which women would be punished or even killed for being childless. At the time, it was taboo to suggest that it might be the husband, and not the wife, who was infertile - not only on the Indian subcontinent but also in the United Kingdom. Barton understood that both men and women could be infertile. As early as 16 October 1943, she was the lead author on an article in The British Medical Journal, discussing \\"Sterility and Impaired Fertility\\" in both men and women. It was signed by many of the researchers active in the field in Great Britain at that time.  The Barton Clinic  The Royal Free Hospital's site in Gray's Inn Road, as Barton would have known it. Mary Barton returned to London and established a fertility clinic as early as 1940, one of the first people to do so. She was a pioneer of artificial insemination by husband (AIH) and Artificial Insemination by Donor (AID) for married couples unable to conceive a child due to male infertility. The practice was medically ground-breaking, helping women conceive 1,500 babies using AID and thousands more using AIH. While Mary Barton's offices are frequently referred to as the \\"Barton Clinic\\", she practiced from a single consulting room, plus an office for her medical secretary, Miss Gwen Jenkins, who worked with her for some 30 years. Barton's offices were in the Harley Street area of London, in Portland Place in the 1950s and in Wimpole Street in the 1960s. Barton also worked at a fertility clinic at the Royal Free Hospital, a significant teaching hospital which became part of the newly formed National Health Service in 1948. It is likely that this was a \\"clinic\\" shared with colleagues. Her private clinic, on the other hand, operated outside of the NHS. Barton's second husband, biologist and physiologist Bertold Wiesner, was associated with the Royal Northern Hospital, as was genito-urinary surgeon Kenneth Walker. Barriers to treatment for infertility were psychological, social, and also financial. It was extremely difficult for couples to find \\"an appropriate and sympathetic practitioner\\" who could carry out insemination. Couples were referred to London's clinics from all over England, and as far away as Rome and South Africa. In addition to possible travel expenses, Barton's patients paid significant fees to the clinic. Artificial insemination was not something just anyone could afford; patients tended to be from the middle and upper classes. Actual treatment was not a simple matter. Barton was both a researcher and a clinician. She worked closely with each couple to diagnose and address possible causes of infertility. In cases where the husband was already diagnosed as sterile, AID could be considered as a possible option. Patients underwent preliminary examinations to establish \\"whether the basic attributes of fecundity were present\\". Barton reported that upon examination, 76% of wives with infertile husbands themselves displayed factors relating to severe infertility. Two of the most prevalent factors in women were cervical dysfunction and pelvic infection. They could only considered for AID if these underlying problems could be addressed, which might require several months of preliminary treatment. Where AID was eventually attempted, the clinic's conception rates were relatively high, reported at 58% (1944-1954) and 67% (1955-1962). Given both social taboos around the subject of infertility and the lack of legal regulation for such work at the time, Barton insisted on total secrecy about the service she offered, telling the parents they should never let their children find out how they had been conceived or identify the donors. The practice of secrecy was in turn criticized as fraud, deception, and conspiracy, leading to increased opposition to AID. It is not surprising that the clinic records appear to have been destroyed, possibly when the London clinic closed in 1967 or after Wiesner's death in 1972. The issue of whether adoptees have a right to obtain information about donor parents is still hotly debated.  Controversial nature of insemination  In 1945 Barton, Walker, and Wiesner published a paper about artificial insemination in the British Medical Journal. The main focus of the article was artificial insemination by husband, used in cases of impotence, failure to ejaculate during intercourse, and female dyspareunia (painful intercourse). They also noted that donor sperm had been used in rare cases of male sterility or to avoid hereditary disease. Because these services were new, there were no medical or legal regulations governing them. While successful artificial insemination births were documented late in the 19th century, the practice was not widely accepted as ethical in Britain, even when used for the breeding of farm animals. There was strong social stigma about such work. It was argued that artificial insemination was a form of adultery. Donor-conceived children were considered illegitimate, even if the husband had agreed to the procedure, and the registration of the husband's name on the birth certificate of such a child was considered perjury. =Wand Report= In response to Barton's article, Geoffrey Fisher, then Archbishop of Canterbury established a religious commission on artificial human insemination in December 1945. It was chaired by John William Charles Wand, the Bishop of London. Its purpose was \\"To consider the practice of human artificial insemination with special reference to its theological, moral, social, psychological, and legal implications.\\" The commission published its report, sometimes referred to as the Wand Report, in 1948. Artificial human insemination was seen as posing social and legal threats to the institution of marriage and the status of children, not least due to secrecy and deception around a child's paternity. The commission noted that children of donors might intermarry and commit incest without knowing that they were closely genetically related, with genetic risks to their offspring. Another fear was that preferential choice of male children might cause a gender imbalance in society. The commission called unsuccessfully for AID to be made a criminal offense. There was one dissenting vote, from Walter Matthews, the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Matthews suggested that the psychological issues to be faced by AID children might be similar to those of adopted children. He also opposed the commission's interpretation of AID as adulterous, arguing that the \\"spiritual elements which constitute the sin of adultery are absent\\". =Feversham Committee= In 1958, a government committee known as the Feversham Committee was appointed \\"To enquire into the existing practice of human artificial insemination and its legal consequences; and to consider whether, taking account of the interests of the individuals involved and of society as a whole, any change in the law is necessary or desirable.\\" It was chaired by Charles Duncombe, 3rd Earl of Feversham and the meetings were held privately. The committee requested oral and written testimony from 100 organizations and individuals in Great Britain and worldwide. The responses they received were predominantly religious, with some medical and very little legal representation. Its conclusions were published in July 1960. Mary Barton was one of those who testified before the committee. At the time that the Feversham Committee surveyed the field, only six doctors in Britain regularly provided artificial insemination by donor, all in England: Bernard Sandler (Manchester), Margaret Jackson (Exeter), Mary Barton, Philip Bloom, Reynold Boyd, and Eleanor Mears (all in London). Artificial insemination was much more widely used in other countries, particularly in the United States and Israel. The Feversham Committee's proceedings provide valuable indicators of how infertility and artificial insemination were viewed in Britain, by people holding a wide range of perspectives. Many of those who spoke to the commission had little experience in the practice of AID. Nonetheless, they often held strong views, and made their moral objections clear, even when they admitted to having little factual knowledge. It is clear that more couples sought assistance than could be treated. Sometimes doctors reported intentionally intimidating those seeking help. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh testified that \\"it is our intention to make the whole thing rather difficult\\". Those seeking and providing treatment - couples, donors, and doctors - were often pathologized. That social stigma around artificial insemination was strong is illustrated by the words of Lord Blackford, who appealed to the House of Lords to \\"reject with horror this brain-wave of Beelzebub\\". Blackford had moved to make artificial insemination by donor illegal, as being a form of adultery, but in the end he withdrew his motion. He stated that his second objective, a full debate on the topic, had been achieved. In this context, Lord Blackford's comments on Mary Barton, who he identified as \\"a leading exponent in this field\\", are of particular interest. Others who read the Feversham Committee's report considered that, far from reflecting a full debate, it was lacking in necessary factual background, \\"vague\\", \\"superficial\\", \\"totally inadequate\\", and in the end \\"inconclusive\\". The committee clearly disliked the idea of AID. At the same time, they did not consider regulation practical, and feared to increase AID's visibility by giving it any form of official recognition. Choice of donors A concern of both critics and proponents of artificial insemination was the quality of the donor sperm. Barton emphasized that donors should be free of disease (transmissible or hereditary) and \\"characteristics of possible genetic significance\\" (which included both alcoholism and criminality). Barton also stated that the donors for her clinic were perceived to be \\"above average\\" intelligence. In choosing a donor for a couple, Barton tried to find a match who was physically similar to the parents, particularly the father. While emphasizing that there was no guarantee of a child's appearance, it was hoped that a resemblance would occur and make it easier for the family to connect emotionally. Barton did not mention eugenics as a reason for using AID in her 1945 paper. However, the Wand Report noted that parents might wish to use AID when \\"the paternity of a man endowed with outstanding qualities is desired\\" and quoted from The Uniqueness of Man by Julian Huxley. Eugenicists were certainly interested in Barton's work, and their motivations went far beyond Barton's goal of helping childless women to conceive. The possible impact of sperm donation on the population of male offspring was much discussed (females received less attention). The Wand Report worried that donors might have \\"absurd and inflated opinions of [their] own worth and ability\\", and be attracted for by pride. personal power, and freedom from responsibility for progeny. Were those attracted likely to be \\"abnormal and unbalanced\\" or even \\"psychopaths\\"? Would such characteristics appear in their children? The possibility of paying for sperm donation also raised concerns about the desirability of the possible donors. In contrast, obstetrician Margaret Jackson argued that a sperm donor was likely preferable genetically to a random sexual encounter or \\"fling\\" with a \\"fancy man\\". As Barton and others informed the Feversham commission, it was difficult to find donors. They were often former patients, husbands of patients, members of the doctors' family, or acquaintances. In 1945, Barton warned of the emotional danger attendant on donation from a known individual such as a husband's brother; such situations often resulted in \\"emotional disturbance\\" for all involved. Donors were expected to remain separate from the families whose children they engendered. It was recommended that donors and recipients be kept unaware of each other's identities. An unfortunate result of such secrecy, pointed out by the Wand and Feversham reports, was a lack of research on the impact on families, either positive or negative. Identity of donors In their 1945 paper in the British Medical Journal, Barton and fellow authors Walker and Wiesner explained that they used a \\"small panel of donors\\" that they considered of \\"intelligent stock\\". Wiesner was responsible for recruiting donors for Barton's clinic. DNA evidence suggests that many of the babies were conceived using sperm from Wiesner himself. His son, Jonathan Wiesner, underwent DNA testing in 2007 which provided a basis for identifiction. Some estimates suggest that of the more than 1,000 successful AID pregnancies Barton reported, Wiesner may have been responsible for as many as 2/3, or 600 children. Another major donor was neuroscientist Derek Richter, who may have fathered more than a hundred babies. It is unclear whether Barton knew that much of the sperm used came from her husband. She kept records of donors identified with code names. Documentary filmmaker Barry Stevens has stated \\"it's possible he [Bertold Wiesner] didn't tell his wife and she believed the donations were coming from a lot of different men\\". Regardless, as a scientist specialising in fertility (among other areas), Wiesner himself should have been aware that there were genetic risks created by his fathering so many children. Such risks were known and were identified in the Wand Report.  Legacy  Mary Barton's clinic was one of the first in Great Britain to offer artificial insemination. The clinic helped an unknown number of previously childless women to conceive babies. Estimates are that thousands of women were able to conceive as a result of artificial insemination with their husband's sperm. Possibly as many as 1,500 more women conceived using artificial insemination by donor. The majority of the sperm donations may have come from a few progenitors. The question of whether donors should be anonymous continues to be contentious, and laws vary widely from country to country. Mary Barton and Bertold Wiesner likely believed that after the destruction of the clinic's records, the parentage of the children conceived at the clinic would be untraceable. They could not have foreseen the implications of contemporary research into the structure of DNA. The increasing availability of consumer genetic tests has made the anonymity of sperm donation practically impossible. Laws regulating human artificial insemination were eventually introduced, but not until Britain's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990. Since 1991 the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has regulated clinics in Britain. A sperm donor can donate for use by no more than ten families. Donor information must be kept on record and children born after 2005 can apply for that information once they are 18. Availability and quality of donor sperm continue to be concerns.

The bout took place at the Olympiahalle in Munich, Germany on 18 February 2012. Klitschko won via a unanimous points decision after the full twelve rounds to retain his title. Background and Build Up Vitali Klitschko had first become a heavyweight champion in 1999, when he picked up the WBO title for knocking out Herbie Hide. In his third defence against Chris Byrd, Klitschko was forced to retire from the fight with a shoulder injury at the end of the ninth round, and despite being well ahead on the scorecards this meant he lost his title and his undefeated record. Five consecutive victories followed before a fresh world title challenge against Britain's Lennox Lewis in 2003. In a close, hard hitting fight, Klitschko was once again ahead on the scorecards before the referee called an end to the fight at the end of the sixth round, deeming a deep cut on Klitschko's face meant that he was unable to continue. With Lewis now retired, within a year Klitschko faced Corrie Sanders for the vacant WBC heavyweight title and won via knockout in the eighth round. After just one defence, he made his first retirement from boxing. After returning to the ring after a four-year absence in 2008, he regained the WBC title at the first attempt by stopping Samuel Peter after eight rounds. He then saw off a series of challengers, mostly recently Tomasz Adamek, and was now looking to make an eighth consecutive defence of his crown. Meanwhile, challenger Dereck Chisora had become British heavyweight champion in May 2010 after knocking out veteran Danny Williams, and added the Commonwealth title to his name after stopping Sam Sexton four months later. Chisora had been chasing a fight with Vitali's fellow world champion and brother Wladimir, and with that fight scheduled to happen on 11 December 2010, Klitschko pulled out just days prior with a torn abdominal muscle. The rescheduled fight for 30 April 2011 was also cancelled so [Wladimir] Klitschko could fight David Haye on July 2. With [Vitali] Klitschko due to fight Adamek, this left Chisora with no other option than to face his mandatory challenger for the British title, the upcoming Tyson Fury. Chisora's 14-0 win streak ended at the hands of the undefeated Fury, who won via twelve round unanimous decision. Chisora then challenged for the vacant European heavyweight title against Finland's Robert Helenius on the Fins home turf in Helsinki. The close fight ended in a split decision victory for Helenius, yet many observers felt this was a robbery and that Chisora had won the fight. Off the back of this, Vitali agreed to make his next defence of his title against Chisora.http://www.thesweetscience.com/articles/13841-new-wbc- ratings-are-out However, Chisora was heavily criticised for his behaviour at the pre fight weigh in after slapping Vitali across the face when the two went face to face during the staredown, and caused yet more controversy just before the fight when he spat water in the face of Wladimir whilst in the ring before the pre fight introductions. The now 40 year old Klitschko would go into the fight with a record of 43-2, while the 28 year old Chisora was entering just his 18th professional fight with a record of 15-2. The fight An injury to Klitschko's left shoulder in the third round prevented him from using his jab and left hand as effectively as normal, but he was still able to keep the hard charging Chisora at bay for the majority of the fight. Despite the constant pressure applied by Chisora, Klitschko was able to use his height and reach advantage to land many powerful right hands to outland his opponent and stay in control. At times Chisora was able to unleash and land some punishment of his own, with most of his work coming to the body and his best round being the twelfth and final round. All three of the judges scored the fight to Klitschko with scores of 118-110, 118-110 and 119-111. Despite the fight being fairly one sided, Chisora earned credit for his chin and heart, and also for giving Klitschko his most competitive fight since his defeat to Lennox Lewis in 2003.

The game was released on floppy disk for the IBM PC, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. Gameplay The game is a platformer where players control a character within a dreamworld trying to overcome a nightmare. Players encounter enemies including ghosts, ghoulies, and monsters and must avoid them by jumping and climbing around them, or must defeat them using a variety of weapons. Players progress through many screens across various levels to complete the game by advancing the alarm clock from midnight to 8:12 A.M. Reception Richard C. Leinecker, reviewing the PC DOS version of the game for Compute! magazine, noted that the game suffered from poor documentation containing numerous errors. The documentation also only explained how to use a joystick, although the game can be played with a keyboard. He also found mistakes in the programming such as the character sprite appearing out of position, either just above or below ledges and objects in the game. He speculated that the sloppy programming may be a consequence of trying to keep costs down for a budget title.

The novel is the second in the author's \\"Goldfields\\" trilogy, being preceded by The Roaring Nineties and followed by Winged Seeds.Austlit - Golden Miles by Katharine Susannah Prichard Plot outline Set in the Western Australian goldfields during the period 1914 to 1927, the novel follows the story of Sally Gough and her family. Gough is running a boarding house, her husband and one son are in the undertaking business, one son is at school, another in an assayer's office and the last is working down the mines. Critical reception A reviewer in Western Mail (Perth) referred to any novel from Prichard as an \\"event\\", and went on: \\"What would be merely background to the narrative of a lesser novel is more than background in this story, for the Golden Mile is part of the life of all those who, in this book, are associated with it. In one way or another the Golden Mile, in one or another of its various phases, is an ever present factor whether, the character is a miner or a housewife. Much of the detail is authentic...Some sections of this novel are provocative and challenging‚Äîa novel which deals in part with social and industrial conditions is not likely to be otherwise. But the story itself is a colourful and entertaining tale, one of human courage and endurance and of those human qualities which helped to build Australia into a nation.\\"\\"A Goldfields Story\\", The Western Mail, 30 September 1948, p14 In The Age the reviewer was impressed with the novel's human warmth: \\"The author's great sympathy with the less fortunate is an outstanding feature of the book. So surely has she handled her material that one loses sight of the great amount of research that has gone into its making.

History Harriet Anne Cook (c. 1855 ‚Äì November 1943) in 1885 founded a school in a spare room of a house on The Parkway, Knightsbridge owned by Euphemia Clark, whose husband, M(atthew) Symonds Clark, was a brother of John Howard Clark. Harriet was the author of an unpublished personal account Reminiscences of Life on the Government Farm 1874‚Äì1884 (1942).Donated to Archives Department in 1943; copies are held by the University of Adelaide and Old Government House, Belair National Park. Her sister Edith Agnes Cook (1859 ‚Äì 2 April 1942), principal of the Advanced School for Girls in Franklin Street, Adelaide, married Samuel Grau \\"Sam\\" H√ºbbe ( ‚Äì c. 15 October 1900) on 3 January 1885, and late that year resigned from the school, to be replaced by Madeline Rees George (c. 1851‚Äì1931). She opened a school in her house in partnership with Harriet, whose students formed the nucleus of Knightsbridge School, as they decided to name it. Boys were accepted in the youngest classes, but older classes were restricted to girls. There was no uniform, and no organised sport. Enrolments soon outgrew the space available and they purchased another house in Statenborough Street, which served until 1921, when they retired. Postscript In 1922 the school was taken over by Misses Jones and Wells, \\"who are employing the Dalton and Montessori methods\\", but appears not to have survived beyond 1922. The Misses Jones and Wells were, with Calder, Eurhythmics teachers, of which Heather Gell was in South Australia the chief exponent.

Ram fighting is a blood sport between two rams (large-horned male sheep), held in a ring or open field. It is commonly found in sheep or goat husbandry culture in Africa, Asia and Europe. In Nigeria, Uzbekistan and Indonesia, ram fighting gains popularity among locals. Although categorized as a blood sport and an act of animal cruelty, ram fights rarely resulted in the death of the defeated ram, as the loser often is allowed to flee the arena. History Ram fight in Tbilisi, c. 1884 In the wild, ram fights occurs naturally as a bovine behaviour to settle dominance hierarchy ‚Äî a contest for alpha male status among virile rams, by ramming their heads into others. Traditionally, the male aggressiveness is not a desirable quality among sheep husbandry, as the sheep farmers prefer a docile sheep and eliminate the aggressive ones through series of selective breedings. This is the main practice of sheep domestication over time. However, farmers and shepherds traditionally may take ram fighting as an occasional pastime or entertainment, and look for this behaviour as the sign of virility, health, and also good gene and immune system. In some cultures it has been developed into a \\"game\\" or a sport, or even held as \\"national pastime\\" which sometimes involves betting. Today in some countries, there are efforts to bring the fighting into mainstream by regulating the rules, ensure the fairness and the welfare of the fighting rams. In Uzbekistan, ram fighting is held as part of Asrlar Sadosi. In West Java, Indonesia, ram fighting is held as popular entertainment and ritual. It is associated with the town of Garut, near Bandung. In Nigeria, owners of the participating rams have made large investments to specially train their rams since their youth solely for competitions only, in which there are grand prizes, such as automotive vehicles, for the winners of these fights.

The episode was written by series creators Jim Kouf and David Greenwalt, and was directed by Norberto Barba. Plot Opening quote: \\"And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\\" Eric (James Frain) meets with the Baron (Reg E. Cathey) to discuss their move. Eric then lets him spit his substance on one of his bodyguards, severely beginning his transformation into a zombie. Baron then makes a ritual to lead all the zombies to Portland. Nick's (David Giuntoli) and Juliette's (Bitsie Tulloch) relationship begins to build up now that she knows about the Grimm world. Renard (Sasha Roiz) is told by his informant that Eric possessed death certificates and passports. In Vienna, Adalind (Claire Coffee) is knocked unconscious by Frau Pech (Mary McDonald-Lewis), who uses a potion to impersonate her appearance. Nick and Wu (Reggie Lee) are called to a building where the zombies were sent. Nick is attacked by a zombie driver, Al (Timothy Whitcomb), whom he knocks unconscious. He and Hank (Russell Hornsby) take Al to the spice shop, where Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) state that to cure him, they have to stimulate the central nervous system through the use of a substance. Eric meets with Renard to discuss his mother and asks Renard to come with him to Europe. While inspecting a car that was left in the road, Nick senses something and notices containers at the port. Stefania (Shohreh Aghdashloo) meets with \\"Adalind\\", and then explains that, for their purposes, they will take Frau Pech's heart. Stefania and her henchmen knock out \\"Adalind\\" and take her heart from the stomach. Adalind returns to her normal form, certain that her powers are back. The antidote works and Al is restored to normal, but he can't remember what happened while he was in that state but he remembers that a man with a top hat may be responsible. Adding that his car was found near containers, Nick deduces that the zombies could be being kept on the harbor. They decide to go to the harbor to give them the antidote but not before Nick gives Rosalee the key to hide. Nick, Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette arrive at the harbor and Baron begins opening containers, unleashing the zombies onto them. Rosalee manages to give the antidote to some zombies but as there are too many, they are forced to escape. Nick then hears Baron and decides to go after him on the top of a container. They fight on it until both fall inside the container. Baron flees and Nick finds a coffin with a passport for a man named \\"Thomas Schirach\\" and a picture of himself. Baron then appears and spits his substance onto him. Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette are forced to flee when the zombies surround them. Eric arrives at the container with Baron where they are planning on transporting the coffin, which contains Nick in a coma while he is becoming a zombie.

This was a 9% improvement over the first season, which averaged 6.35 million viewers. =Critical reviews= \\"Goodnight, Sweet Grimm\\" received mostly positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Goodnight Sweet Grimm' gave me similar jolts of delight and excitement. I should immediately note that these feelings are marked by many asterisks, because comparing this show to Buffy dooms Grimm to languish in a towering shadow of cultural significance and wild entertainment. After two full seasons, Grimm is nowhere close to accomplishing what Buffy had already done. It just gets a bit too hard not to note the similarities at a certain point, especially since David Greenwalt's work lends better to the parallels than Jim Kouf's work on Taxi (the Jimmy Fallon one) or Snow Dogs. Grimm shares a good amount of DNA with Angel, as a more adult detective procedural without the coming-of-age plotlines ‚Äî though I would probably watch that. (Quick, someone get on a prequel web comic that shows Aunt Marie's early life becoming a legendary feared Grimm.)\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.8 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Nick's fate in 'Goodnight, Sweet Grimm' might have become obvious in the final minutes of the finale, but watching those suspicions play out didn't lessen the weight of it. They only made it more exciting.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind, wrote: \\"So, season two: better or worse than season one? Overall, I go better ‚Äì season two hasn't been without its faults (Juliette's amnesia went on for way too long, a lot of vagueness about the serialized plot), but I think it had some pretty high highs and felt more self-assured. Plus, the finale was much less frustrating than last season, which makes me think that season three will be in a position to hit the ground running.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 2) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"Goodnight, Sweet Grimm"},{"id":"51290511","text":"Northern Canadian Shield taiga is a taiga ecoregion located in Canada, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) categorization system.

Benefatti became noted for his tender care of the ill during epidemics of plague and both Pope Benedict XI - a close personal friend - and Pope John XXII held him in high esteem. Benefatti's reputation for personal holiness endured in the centuries after his death and the confirmation of his local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - allowed for Pope Pius IX to confirm the late bishop's beatification on 22 September 1859. Life Giacomo Benefatti was born in Mantua at some point in the mid 1200s to nobles. He enrolled in the Order of Preachers in 1290 and was later ordained to the priesthood. He acquired his master's degree in his theological studies from the University of Paris and later earned his doctorate in theological studies. Benefatti became a close and personal friend of the fellow Dominican friar Cardinal Niccol√≤ Boccasini who later ascended as Pope Benedict XI. The new pontiff appointed him as a papal legate and then appointed him as the Bishop of Mantua at the beginning of 1304. Benefatti decided to raise funds for refurbishing churches in the diocese as well as rebuilding the Mantua Cathedral. As a bishop he attended the coronation of King Henry VII in Milan and participated in the Council of Vienne. He also knew Ludovico I Gonzaga when the latter aided in providing donations for the cathedral renovation. Bishop Benefatti became noted among the faithful of the diocese for his careful attention to poor people as well as for his ardent dedication to the ill during a period of plague epidemic. He also served as a papal legate for Pope John XXII. The pontiff held him in high esteem and in 1320 conferred episcopal consecration on Benefatti who had not received it at that point - but sources differ on whether it was in 1320 or back in 1304 after being appointed as bishop. He earned the moniker of the \\"Father of the Poor\\". Benefatti died on 19 November 1332. His remains were found to be incorrupt in 1480 after the Dominican church he was interred in was undergoing reconstruction and his remains were found to be still incorrupt in 1604. His remains were moved to the diocese's main cathedral in 1823. Beatification Benefatti's beatification received ratification on 22 September 1859 once Pope Pius IX confirmed the local 'cultus' - or popular veneration - to the late bishop existed after his death and endured through the centuries.

This was because Rangers were viewed as a \\"Protestant club\\" and as a deliberate contrast to their Old Firm rivals, Celtic who were viewed as a Catholic club. Rangers' policy was ended in 1989 when they signed Mo Johnston, under manager Graeme Souness.  History  =Origins= Prior to the First World War, Rangers did not have any policy regarding players' religion, and at that time the club did have a number of Catholic players. In the 1920s, following the rise in popularity of the Orange Order in Glasgow where Rangers players and directors attended functions, Rangers quietly introduced an unwritten rule that the club would not sign any player or employ any staff member who was openly Catholic. An indication that the policy was specifically anti-Catholic rather than Protestant-only was Rangers' signing of Egyptian international Mohamed Latif in 1934. The policy was not acknowledged publicly until 1965 when Ralph Brand, on leaving the club for Manchester City, told the News of the World that Rangers operated a Protestants-only policy. Two years later vice-chairman Matt Taylor was asked about perceived anti- Catholicism with the ban on Catholics at Rangers; he stated \\"[it is] part of our tradition ... we were formed in 1873 as a Protestant boys club. To change now would lose us considerable support\\". Northern Irish club Linfield, which shares a similar culture to Rangers, had a similar policy, though not as strict as Rangers', until the 1980s, as a contrast to their Big Two rivals Glentoran. Despite the policy, some Catholic players did play for Rangers during this time. Don Kitchenbrand kept his Catholicism secret and Laurie Blyth left the club after his Catholic faith was discovered. Some former Rangers players also stated that the policy extended to non-Catholic players who married Catholics. In 1980, for example, Graham Fyfe said that he had to leave Rangers because he had married a Catholic woman. The former Rangers player and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has written that although Rangers' management knew of his decision to marry a Catholic, he experienced \\"poisonous hostility\\" from the club's PR officer Willie Allison.Ferguson, Alex. 1999 Managing my Life By contrast, Celtic never had a similar policy banning players of any religion. Celtic manager Jock Stein, himself Celtic's first Protestant manager, once stated that if he was offered a Catholic player and a Protestant player, he would sign the Protestant. When asked why he said: \\"Because I know Rangers would never sign the Catholic\\". In 1976 a friendly at Aston Villa was abandoned because of hooliganism by Rangers fans. This included fans attacking a pub that had been bombed by the IRA three years prior, which drew particular criticism from the Orange Order. The Orange Order stated \\"Let us be perfectly blunt. The same examples of low animal life who force their support on Glasgow Rangers are one and the same with the foul- mouthed drunks who cause us great embarrassment every July when they turn up to 'support' our annual rallies\\". In response, the Rangers manager Willie Waddell declared an intent to change the media perception of Rangers being a sectarian club. While he denied the existence of the signing policy, he stated that \\"no religious barriers will be put up at this club regarding signing of players\\" and pledged to remove supporters from Ibrox Stadium who did not accept it. Despite this assertion, no senior Catholic players were signed by Rangers following it; promising youth player John Spencer did join the club in 1982 and quietly progressed through the ranks, while having to deal with hostility from both sides of the Glasgow religious divide as a result. =Maurice Johnston signing= As manager of Rangers, Graeme Souness signed Maurice Johnston, an openly Catholic player. Graeme Souness became Rangers manager in May 1986 and declared his intent to build a team based only on merit, saying that signing players who observed another religion or had a different skin colour \\"felt completely normal\\". In the summer of 1989, Rangers signed Mo Johnston, a former Celtic player and openly Catholic. Johnston had recently agreed to return to Celtic from Nantes, but the deal had not been completed, and signing such a prominent ex-Celtic player was an especially big coup for their rivals. This was Rangers' first signing of an openly Catholic player since the policy was introduced. There were claims in the media that it was done to counter a FIFA inquiry into sectarianism. Johnston's agent Bill McMurdo felt that Rangers would need a \\"very special person\\" to cope with the pressure of being the first player to break the policy. Before signing Johnston, Souness had also been interested in signing other Catholic players, and had approached players including John Collins, Ian Rush and Ray Houghton. Following the signing of Johnston, the general secretary of the Rangers Supporters Association, David Miller, stated \\"It is a sad day for Rangers. Why sign him above all others? There will be a lot of people handing in their season tickets. I don't want to see a Roman Catholic at Ibrox. It really sticks in my throat.\\" Having received a leak that the transfer was about to happen, the Belfast Telegraph reported the deal before it was announced. This prompted a group of loyalists to gather outside the newspaper office demanding the story be retracted, while their telephone switchboard was busy with angry callers. The Rangers kitman refused to lay out Johnston's kit before each match as a protest against a Catholic playing for Rangers. Some fans responded by burning their season tickets, although this view was not shared by all of the Rangers supporters. Some welcomed the fact that they had got one over their rivals, while the Johnston signing brought back some lapsed fans who had been troubled by religious discrimination. Rangers' attendances and season ticket sales continued to grow in the following years. The signing arguably caused greater upset amongst the Celtic support, as it had been expected that Celtic would re-sign Johnston. Indeed, Johnston had been signed on what amounted to a pre-contract agreement by Celtic in May 1989 and had then been prematurely presented to the media as their new signing. Johnston was fined by FIFA for breaking his agreement with Celtic, who could have prevented Johnston from playing by completing the deal. Celtic manager Billy McNeill wanted to pursue this option, but the Celtic board decided against this. Celtic supporters felt Johnston had betrayed them, calling him Judas, while Souness was given little or no credit for ending this source of anti-Catholic discrimination. =1990s onwards= After signing Johnston, Rangers did not sign any further Catholic players for several years. The club did not make another major Scottish Catholic signing until Neil McCann in 1998. In the same year, Rangers lifted a ban on players making the sign of the cross at the behest of Gabriel Amato but warned them not to do it in front of supporters. Gennaro Gattuso, an Italian Catholic who played for Rangers in the 1997‚Äì98 season, alleged that his teammates ordered him to take off his crucifix necklace. In 1999, fellow Italian Lorenzo Amoruso became the first Catholic captain of Rangers. In 2002 defender Fernando Ricksen said that Rangers' Catholic players had to hide their religion because of sectarianism at the club. He stated that he had been receiving sectarian phone calls, and \\"If you're Catholic and you play for Rangers, then you are a Protestant. If you play for the Protestant people, you don't play for the Catholic people.\\" In 2006, Rangers appointed their first Catholic manager, Paul Le Guen, and in 2013 signed Jon Daly, an Irish Catholic player.  Depictions in the media  The policy was parodied in the BBC comedy Scotch and Wry in 1979, where the Rangers manager (played by Rikki Fulton) unwittingly agrees to sign a young Catholic player (Gerard Kelly), on the recommendation of a Rangers scout (Gregor Fisher). When the player says he had to leave a match early to attend mass, the manager tries to find excuses for voiding the contract to avoid breaking the policy.Old Firm Facts on football's greatest sitcom moments, Glasgow Live, 6 April 2018 See also *Sectarianism in Glasgow *Athletic Bilbao signing policy Notes References Rangers F.C.

History Mabel was a granddaughter of Arthur Hardy (1817‚Äì1909) and Martha Hardy, n√©e Price (1821‚Äì1904), and daughter of Herbert Mansell Hardy (1856‚Äì1927) and Miriam Isabella Hardy, n√©e Cunningham (1855‚Äì1950). Mabel and her brother Frederick Mansell Hardy (died 1965) were twins, born prematurely, yet each was to have a long and fulfilling life. The family fortune, once considerable, was quite dissipated, and Mabel was brought up in respectable middle-class Malvern.Barbara Wall A Short History of Stawell School: The forgotten school on Mount Lofty published for Mount Lofty Districts Historical Society by Peacock Publications 2012 She was educated at a small school run by the Misses Hack,Gulielma \\"Guli\\" Hack, later Magarey (1867‚Äì1951) and Ethel Hack, later Malcolm (1869‚Äì1947) daughters of Charles Hack and Annie Brooks Hack, n√©e Meyrick, had a school on South Terrace, City, then Rose Terrace, Wayville. who lived opposite. She then studied in State schools in Gilles Street and Grote Street. A bursary allowed her to study for a few years at the Jacob sisters' Tormore House School in North Adelaide. Caroline Jacob gave her a position at Tormore House, then from 1907 to 1911 at her Unley Park School, teaching English and History, and the money earned funded evening studies at Adelaide University. She won the Tinline Scholarship in History and the John Howard Clark scholarship in English Literature, and graduated BA in 1914. From 1916 to 1918 she taught at St Peter's College Girls' School in North Adelaide. Following her interest in history, from 1919 to 1921 she worked as a researcher for George Pitt at the South Australian Archives. She next taught at the Church of England Girls' Grammar School (closed 1929) in Bowral, New South Wales, then in 1923 was appointed senior mistress under Dora Gillam at the newly opened Woodlands Girls Grammar School in Glenelg, South Australia. In 1925 she met a new member of staff, Patience Hawker, who had ideas about forming a school of her own based on Frensham School, where she had enjoyed life as a student. Mabel spent the following year in England and on the Continent, studying teaching methods and curricula. With a loan from her mother, Patience purchased the mansion \\"Arthur's Seat\\" in Crafers, South Australia near the summit of Mount Lofty. Patience and Mabel made the mansion, renamed \\"Stawell\\", their residence, with rooms for boarders, and had classrooms built away from the residence. Part of their philosophy of teaching was Helen Parkhurst's Dalton system which gives the student a great deal of control over her own work, where the teacher is a resource and adviser rather than a lecturer, and students are encouraged to aid one another's learning. Patience, who held the position of managing director of the company structured to run the school, quit teaching in 1928 and left Mount Lofty to marry and raise a family. Though maintaining her friendship with Mabel, she had little more to do with teaching or day-to-day decisions. Mabel's school was highly successful for its first ten years, but with the Great Depression of the 1930s enrolments declined, and with declaration of war in 1939 the school shifted to 84 Mills Terrace, North Adelaide, and closed in December 1940. Mabel Hardy moved in with her mother at 4 Thornber Street, Unley Park, formerly Kyre College for boys. The well-known educator Ellen Thornber also lived on Thornber street, at number 39. Unley Park School for Girls, later a branch of Tormore House School, which Mabel once attended, was at number 37. Semi-retired, she took occasional teaching jobs: some months at Prince Alfred College in 1941 and a year at Woodlands in 1944, and kept in close touch with her ex-students. She moved back to the Hills, not far from the Mount Lofty Railway Station, then around 1951 to Hawthorn, then finally to 74a Fisher Street, Fullarton, where she died.

A distant relation of the main family line, he was born as Shrimant Narayanrao Dinkarrao Bhonsle and was adopted at the age of eight by the widow of Rajaram II. Owing to his youth, he reigned under a regency until he had attained his majority. In 1875, he was presented with a sword of honour by the future Edward VII and on New Year's Day, 1877, was knighted with the title of Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India(KCSI), at the age of 13, the youngest knight ever of that honour. Later that same year, he also became the youngest recipient of the Empress of India Medal. Alleged Madness & The Kolhapur Affair By 1882, Sir Shivaji VI had become insane ‚Äì at least, so it was strongly asserted ‚Äì and was placed under the protection of British Government, with a Regent appointed for the state, Karbhari Mahadeo Barve. This aroused a considerable controversy. British officials and doctors reiterated that Shivaji VI was suffering from an incurable madness. This official version received support from English newspapers such as the Times of India and the Bombay Gazette. However, this was strongly disputed by some Indian-owned newspapers such as Induprakash, Mahratta and Kesari ‚Äì the later two in English and Marathi respectively, founded shortly before by Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a prominent leader of the Indian Independence movement. In the Kesari, there was a public questioning of the diagnosis, treatment and mental state of Chhatrapati. The Kesari, then under the editorship of Agarkar and the Mahratta under Tilak, argued that Shivaji VI was not mad and the little instability in his mental state was caused by the maltreatment given to him by the servants and officials appointed to take care of him. They especially accused Mahadeo Barve, the British-appointed Regent of Kolhapur, of complicity in a conspiracy to make Shivaji VI mad. Letters published in the Kesari and Mahratta, allegedly written by Mahadeo Barve to his subordinate officials, indicated his involvement along with some British officials and native servants in a plot to poison Shivaji VI. To clear himself of the charges, Mahadeo Barve filed a defamation case against Tilak and Agarkar. The trial which followed brought into the public sphere the private life of Shivaji VI and the ill treatment meted out to him by British officials. The Kesari published the verbatim account of the High Court trial drama, which in its editors' opinion exposed to public scrutiny the barbarous attitude of the British officers towards Shivaji VI. On July 16, 1882 the jury found Tilak and Agarkar guilty on the charge of slander against Mahadeo Barve and sentenced them to four months imprisonment at Dongri jail in Bombay. Even during the trial, Kesari published articles which questioned the physical control of British officers over the body of Shivaji VI and expressed fears regarding danger to Shivaji VI's life from officers appointed to protect him. In spite of such accusations, British Government did not remove Shivaji VI from the custody of these officers. Death & aftermath Eventually, Shivaji VI died as a youngster in 1883. The whole episode became famous as the Kolhapur Prakaran(affair). Removed to Ahmednagar, Sir Shivaji VI died a year later on December 25, 1883 at the age of 20, in a scuffle with, or due to beating received from a British soldier appointed to take care of him ‚Äì Private Lloyd Passingham. He was succeeded by Shahu as he had left no heir. The manner of his death was widely regarded as a vindication of the accusations made by the Indian nationalists, in spite of the court ruling against them, the whole issue being a landmark in the development of the Indian Independence Movement.

Cerveri served as an inquisitor for Piedmont and Liguria and knew of the threats against his life being an inquisitor - a small group of heretics killed him in Cuneo. The late priest's death attracted hundreds and a local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - and this local devotion allowed for Pope Pius IX to approve Cerveri's beatification on 22 September 1853. Life Bartolomeo Cerveri was born in 1420 in Cuneo and was noted in his childhood for his piousness and devotion to the faith. He became a professed member and an ordained priest for the Order of Preachers before making his solemn profession. He lived in the Piedmont region where the heretical Catharists ran rampant and killed Saint Peter of Verona and the Blesseds Peter of Ruffia and Antonio Pavoni. Cerveri obtained his licentiate as well as his master's and doctorate's degree - on 8 May 1452 - at the University of Turin in an occasion that was the first and last time when someone received all three at the same time. He taught there until 1453 until he was appointed as the prior of the Savigliano convent. Cerveri converted heretics and this led to his appointment as an inquisitor for Piedmont and Liguria in 1451 in which it was clear to him that he would soon be targeted and killed. Being a Dominican in that region at that time was dangerous and meant that heretics could take their hatred out on the new Dominican inquisitor. He made his final confession before he set off for his final trip alongside two of his companions - the brothers Giovanni and Gianpietro Riccardi. He said of it: \\"I go there as an inquisitor and there I must die\\". On the road in Cervere he and his two companions were attacked though the five attackers wounded the companions but killed him after riddling him with dagger wounds. Those that washed his remains before his funeral found that despite the wounds he had not bled. His remains were relocated in 1802. Beatification The confirmation of the late priest's local 'cultus' - or popular and enduring veneration - received the papal approval of Pope Pius IX on 22 September 1853 which allowed for the pontiff to confirm his beatification.
