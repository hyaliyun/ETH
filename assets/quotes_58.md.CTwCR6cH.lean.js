Opened on 21 May 2009, the mosque's name, given by the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura is derived from the Arabic word, مودة which literally means affectionate. The name was taken from the Quran Surah Ar-Rum verse 21: > \\"And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among > yourselves, that ye may dwell In tranquillity with them, and He has put love > and Mercy between your (hearts): Verily In that are Signs for those who > reflect.\\" Al-Mawaddah Mosque The mosque was built under the Phase 4 of the Mosque Building Fund programme to cater to the large demographic of young families in the Buangkok and Sengkang area. Aside from its numerous family friendly features for the young and the old, it also boasts a number of environmentally friendly features that are energy-conserving. Due to this mosque has attained the Greenmark Certification (2009 & 2011) from the Building and Construction Authority.MUIS Mosque Management The open-to-all concept and \\"Family Friendly\\" theme proposed by the mosque promises various programmes and facilities to enhance community bonding among the different races and families across the different age groups.Al-Mawaddah Mosque (About Us) The mosque's capacity is increased to 4,000 worshipers during peak periods.http://v1.almawaddah.sg/about/ Services Other than serving the religious needs of the Muslim community, the institution also provides other social services which are in line with the concept of a mosque being a multi- functional institution and a prime agent to facilitate towards an excellent Muslim Community. This encompasses the four core areas of the pillars of the mosque's activities, namely: #Islamic Learning #Social Development #Family and Youth Development #Religious Services and Referrals Cleric comments on disciplining wife Ustaz Mohammad Zaid Isahak, executive Imam of the Al- Mawaddah Mosque, attracted media attention when his article \\"How to deal with stubborn wives\\" (translated title) was published on national Malay newspaper Berita Harian on 13 October 2017. The religious scholar had responded to a question on an advice column on whether a husband could \\"distance himself from a wife who refuses to obey him\\". Ustaz Zaid said that husbands should try gentle persuasion to remind their wives of their obligations their husbands, if their advice is unheeded, husbands can then leave or ignore his wife for a short period of time. The column article suggests that if such measures do not work, it is permissible under Islamic law to hit a wife, as long as it is not on the face, leaves no visible marks on her body, and that the husband is certain that the act of hitting a wife will change her disobedience. The article sparked an outcry on social media and prompted a response from politician Faishal Ibrahim and head of the Office of the Mufti Ustaz Irwan Hadi, denouncing spousal violence of any form. Berita Harian posted clarifications from Ustaz Zaid later, saying the Quranic verse he had cited was not an excuse for a husband to physically punish or insult his wife, and it should be interpreted in the modern context\\".

The playable species of StarCraft include the Terrans, humans exiled from Earth who excel at adapting to any situation; the Zerg, a race of insectoid aliens obsessed with assimilating other races in pursuit of genetic perfection; and the Protoss, a technologically advanced humanoid species with psionic abilities that attempts to preserve their civilization and strict philosophical way of living from the Zerg. Each of these races is the focus of a series of missions in the single-player campaign of each StarCraft real-time strategy game. In addition to these three, various non-playable races have also been part of the lore of the StarCraft series; the most notable of these is the Xel'Naga, an ancient god-like race which features prominently in the fictional histories of the Protoss and Zerg. The original StarCraft has sold over 10 million copies internationally since its release in 1998, and remains one of the most popular games in the world. One of the main factors responsible for StarCraft's positive reception is the attention paid to the three unique playable races, for each of which Blizzard developed completely different characteristics, graphics, backstories, and styles of gameplay, while keeping them balanced in performance against each other. Previous to this, most real-time strategy games consisted of factions and races with the same basic \\"chess\\" play styles and units with only superficial differences. The use of unique sides and asymmetric warfare in StarCraft has been credited with popularizing the concept within the real-time strategy genre. Contemporary reviews of the game have mostly praised the attention to the gameplay balance between the species, as well as the fictional narratives built around them. Design A Protoss warrior and a Zerg creature, as they appeared during StarCraft's production in 1996 Throughout the course of the game's development, the races and graphics of StarCraft changed drastically from writer Chris Metzen's original concept art. In particular, since their initial public debut at E3 1996, the Zerg have seen extensive changes to their visual design. This was primarily due to Blizzard's attempt to steer the game away from the visual appearance, unveiled at the 1996 E3, that had earned the game a derisive label of \\"Warcraft in space\\". The Zerg were originally known as the \\"nightmarish invaders\\", later becoming the \\"Zurg\\", and then renamed again to the current spelling to avoid any potential trademark conflicts with Pixar's Toy Story character of Emperor Zurg. In the early alpha versions built by Bob Fitch, the Zerg still showed their insect-inspired base, but their appearance was heavily dominated by spikes and bright shades of blue and purple. Early Protoss concept art showed a green and blue color scheme in their mechanical armor. Closely hewing to the familiar visual style of Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, the build received much criticism from video game industry press, prompting a redesign of the game engine and an overhaul of the races' respective visual designs. This new version, unveiled in early 1997, still used the Warcraft II engine as its base, but with distinct changes. The Terrans and the Protoss were detailed to a much greater extent than at E3 1996, revealing many of the game's units in forms similar to those of the final product. Blizzard Entertainment also began the careful task of balancing the game's three races. However, in February 1997, Bob Fitch declared that, despite these efforts, the game engine was simply incapable of delivering features requested by the developers: cloaking, burrowing, and many other special effects. The development team therefore embarked upon a two- month overhaul of the graphics engine. This new beta version was far closer to the release version, as the races took on their now-recognisable graphical styles: the brown insectoid design of the Zerg, the sleek yellow armour of the Protoss, and the grey machinery of the Terrans. Most of the unit designs were established at this point, their graphics only undergoing minor changes. Several game features were also added at this stage that never made it into the final release, such as ships banking as they turned, transport ships landing on the ground to pick up and drop off passengers, and efficiency ranks, although Terran units would retain ranks as a purely aesthestic feature. The Terran Valkyrie-class missile frigate also appeared in this build of the game, although it was removed before the final release, only to be reintroduced later in the Brood War expansion. Protoss factions The Protoss are a sapient humanoid species in the StarCraft series, originating from Aiur, a jungle planet on the fringe of the galaxy. They were once largely tribal, though four societies now dominate: the conservative Khalai Protoss, the exiled Nerazim, the abandoned Purifiers, and the sadistic Tal'darim. The Protoss are depicted as a physically large and strong species with natural psionic affinities. Their technology is the most advanced of any race depicted in the series, designed to complement and enhance their psionic mastery, and they are generally characterized by their social and political hierarchies, strict moral codes, and deeply philosophical culture. A full single-player campaign has been dedicated to the Protoss in each StarCraft installment to date. Attributes Society Protoss society is shown in the background of the series to have been tribal with a strong warrior culture until a planet-wide civil war allowed a mystic, Khas, to access a natural psionic link shared by all Protoss. Khas' discovery and teachings, labelled the Khala, are then used as the principle underlying a new caste-based society. The Judicator caste forms the Conclave, the ruling body of the Khalai Protoss. The Templar caste constitutes the military, and the Khalai caste includes all other Protoss. The player controls a Templar character in the Protoss campaigns of all the video games to date. Both the Tal'darim and the Purifiers are sought out by Artanis in Legacy of the Void to unite all Protoss factions to fight Amon. The Daelaam are the unified protoss of the Khalai, Nerazim, Tal'darim, and Purifiers; their armed forces are named likewise. ;Khalai Khalai society is depicted as collectivist, being stubbornly conservative while maintaining the warrior culture and honor values of the tribal system. Due to the Zerg Overmind's invasion and the subsequent destruction of Aiur, the remaining Khalai are adopted by the Nerazim while recuperating their massive losses. With the Conclave gone, they elect Artanis to be the Hierarch, their representative. The Protoss eventually repel and kill the Overmind, but Zeratul, a Nerazim, uncovers disturbing things about Khala: that its foundation is corrupted by a fallen Xel'Naga named Amon, and though Zeratul's sacrifice awakened Artanis and left Aiur with a handful of survivors, the rest are under Amon's thrall. They rediscover an ancient worldship, power it up, then reorganize their forces against Amon. After the war, they resettle in Aiur, rebuilding it with their allies. Their tech initially was based on the Conclave's tastes. But after the discovery of the Spear of Adun, they upgraded their tech from the data of the worldship. ;Nerazim The backstory presented in StarCraft's manual and in the novel Shadow Hunters also portrays the rise of a second society of Protoss known as the Nerazim. They are a sizeable minority of the Protoss who reject the Khala out of fear of losing their individuality inside the psychic link. The Nerazim are treated as heretics by the Khalai Protoss and are forcibly evicted from Aiur. Despite their persecution, the majority of Dark Templar do not hold anything against their estranged brethren, seeking to defend Aiur in any way they can. The Nerazim are presented as nomadic, liberal society, only settling on the planet Shakuras to study a Xel'Naga temple there. During the Brood War event, the Protoss lose their homeworld of Aiur to the Zerg (even with the Overmind being destroyed by Tassadar), and the Khalai Protoss are forced to escape and seek refuge on Shakuras, by then the homeworld of the Nerazim. After the conclusion of StarCraft, the two groups begin to reconcile, but the reconciliation is marred by mutual distrust. Initially, they rejected the Khala by severing the psionic link on their heads, and due to that, Khalai made them heretics, but only Adun, a Khalai who knew the group's plight sacrificed himself to let the Nerazim escape the Conclave's punishment. They made their colony in Shakuras and assisted any friendly Protoss and Terran Raynor, but Amon sent his own Zerg brood to destroy it during his rampage across the sector, destroying the planet is the only solution. The deed was done after overloading the Xel'Naga temple built on the planet. The current Matriarch Vorazun allied herself with the Hierarch Artanis. Their technology was outdated and only relied on Void energies to power them, but help from Artanis updated their tech. ;Tal'darim StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty also depicts a third faction of Protoss, known as the Tal'darim. Left behind on Aiur during the Zerg invasion, the splinter group lost their connection to the Khalai society and regressed to a state of aggression and fanaticism. During the events of Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void the Tal'darim society is further explained to worship Amon, a Fallen Xel'Naga who seeks to extinguish all life and recreate the universe in his image. The Tal'darim follow a hierarchy known as the 'Chain of Ascension' which they believe, the higher up the chain, the closer they come to Amon, individuals wanted to be Highlord must challenge the current in a duel. Tal'darim warriors can challenge other Tal'darim in higher ranks to ascend in the chain through a rite called Rak'Shir. And they 'communicate' with Amon due to a substance called 'breath of creation', or terrazine. But, another Highlord contender, Alarak, knew Amon never wanted them to be 'ascended', or transformed into Hybrid, organized a Rak'Shir against the current Highlord Ma'lash. He was successful and used his newfound authority to command his race against Amon and temporarily allied themselves with Artanis. But after the war, they left their planet Slayn to find their new home, leaving those who wanted to join the Daelaam. Their fleets were either salvaged, stolen from other Protoss factions, or built from scratch. ;Purifiers Starcraft II: Legacy of the Void introduces a fourth subfaction of the Protoss race, the Purifiers. The Purifiers are synthetic constructs created by the Protoss which house either preserved spirits of fallen Protoss warriors, preserved memories of warriors or AI created by the Khalai to use as battle weapons. The Purifiers rebelled against the Khalai Protoss in 'ancient' times because they weren't viewed as equals, but rather as tools used by the Protoss in battle. The Purifiers were deactivated and sealed away in a large vessel known as the 'Cybros' and brought to a planet known as Endion where they were supposed to be buried. But they were only locked on the planet. They were reactivated by Artanis after retrieving a Purifier robot formed after his friend 'Fenix'. They plan to release Cybros from stasis, then the Purifiers elect Talandar, formerly Fenix to be their representative to Daelaam. Their tech was entirely robotic. Protoss worlds According to the manual Protoss conquered hundreds of worlds, but vital infrastructure is probably only on two of them: *Aiur: Protoss jungle homeworld situated somewhere on the Galaxy rim. Its position was unknown for a long time, then it was assaulted and conquered by the Zerg. The Overmind settled here, but it was destroyed by Tassadar. Aiur lies close to the galaxy rim, directly opposite of Char with the Koprulu sector buffering them. * Shakuras: Twilight planet. originally colonized by the Nerazim, it became an asylum for all Protoss After the loss of Aiur. Several Xel´Naga artefacts and temple can be found here. Shakuras position lies in galactic halo – situated anywhere in the range of tens of thousands of light year – outside the main galactic disc. Later it was exposed and assaulted by the Zerg. The Protoss however managed to preserve it. Depiction The Protoss are tall and muscular humanoids, with two luminous eyes, typically gold, green, or blue. With two fingers flanked by two opposable thumbs on each hand, two large toes on each foot (four small toes in earlier games), digitigrade legs, broad chests and shoulders with narrow waists, the Protoss are very agile and physically strong. A bony crest extends back from the crown of the head, with long neural strands sprouting from the back of the head. These strands facilitate the basic psychic communal link all Protoss naturally share. Each Protoss has a different skin shade that corresponds to the tribe from which they are descended. They do not possess any visible ears (but they can hear, as when Terrans speak to them or hear what they are thinking), mouths, or noses, but are able to communicate telepathically and possess strong olfactory sensitivities. Protoss do not need to eat or drink, but are shown in The Dark Templar Saga to instead absorb energy from a form of photosynthesis. The average life expectancy for a Protoss is about one thousand years. Little is known of the internal anatomy of the Protoss, as their bodies disintegrate after death. In contrast to the other two species, Protoss units and buildings display smooth and elegant designs, usually emphasizing gold and blue colors on armor and vehicles/ships and feature blue energy highlights. The dark templar units tend to display silver rather than gold and have green energy highlights. In Starcraft II, the Protoss are also featured in dark shades with green energy highlights. These Protoss were corrupted by the Hybrids. The Protoss Tal'darim faction sports black/grey with red colors and also features red energy highlights. The Purifiers sport generally white with black accents and feature orange energy highlights. Protoss units are generally more expensive and slower to produce in-game compared to Zerg or Terran units, but are also more powerful and efficient in combat. All Protoss units and buildings are protected by a regenerating energy shield, further increasing the amount of damage that they can withstand. Although there is no way of natively healing or repairing Protoss units, injured biological units can be healed by friendly Terran or Zerg medical units, and damaged mechanicals can be repaired by a late-stage Spear of Adun upgrade, or by the Carrier unit. By 2505 in the Legacy of the Void expansion to StarCraft II, the Protoss develop a new method to restore their shields, by using Sentries which perform as mobile shield batteries. Appearances The Protoss are the focus of the third chronological campaign of StarCraft. In the events immediately preceding the beginning of the game, the Khalai Protoss have become aware of a Zerg invasion of Terran worlds, and respond by dispatching a fleet commanded by the high Templar Tassadar to destroy infested Terran worlds. Tassadar instead disregards his orders to massacre the Terran populations, attempting to destroy the Zerg by conventional means. Tassadar later meets a Dark Templar, Zeratul, and embraces the Dark Templar culture, prompting the Khalai Protoss to brand Tassadar as a traitor. Zeratul unwittingly reveals the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur to the Zerg, leading to a Zerg invasion that devastates the planet. At the end of StarCraft, Tassadar sacrifices himself to save his people and their Terran allies by destroying the Zerg Overmind by crashing his carrier, the \\"Gantrithor\\", directly into the hivemind. The Protoss return in Episode IV of Brood War, the expansion to StarCraft. Following immediately on from the conclusion of StarCraft, Zeratul and a ranking templar Artanis evacuate the surviving Khalai Protoss from Aiur to the Dark Templar world of Shakuras. After the Zerg follow them to Shakuras, Zeratul and Artanis harness the energy of a resident Xel'Naga temple, scouring the planet of all the Zerg. The Protoss attempt to rebuild their lives on Shakuras, but are interrupted by a Zerg raid commanded by Sarah Kerrigan that kidnaps the dark templar leader Raszagal. Using Raszagal as leverage, Kerrigan coerces Zeratul into killing a new Overmind in incubation. Zeratul complies, but later kills Raszagal after it is revealed she has been brainwashed by the Zerg. Zeratul disappears while Artanis takes leadership and tries to reconstruct his people's civilization. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty introduces the fanatical Tal'darim, who are at odds with Jim Raynor while he attempts to find Xel'Naga artifacts for the Moebius Foundation. More significantly, Zeratul discovers that some force has successfully combined Protoss and Zerg genetic material, creating a race of incredibly powerful hybrids. Zeratul travels to Aiur to probe the corpse of the Zerg Overmind for information on an apocalyptic prophecy, and unexpectedly finds Tassadar in an ethereal form. Memories found in the Overmind's cortex depict a vision of a future in which Kerrigan is killed, whereupon the hybrids (led by an entity known only as the Dark Voice) take control of the Swarm, destroy all other forms of life, then obliterate the Zerg as well. The Protoss are the last society left standing against the Dark Voice's armies. Zeratul finds Raynor, knowing his intent to track down and defeat the Queen of Blades, and tells him to spare her life. Zeratul is the early protagonist until his death at the hands of Artanis, who later became a player character in StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void. Zeratul reveals what the prophecies further after giving his memory onto Raynor. He was shocked upon learning the worst truth, an ancient race tries to destroy all life in the Universe and recreate it to his will. He tried to warn Artanis, leader of the Protoss, but was set aside when the Protoss launches an attack on Aiur to reclaim it. But the invasion is a trap set by the ancient one who corrupts the protoss, save for anyone who has no connection to Khala. Zeratul was killed trying to save Artanis by severing his nerve cords. Wracked with guilt, Artanis regrouped all survivors and set off to find survivors. Shakuras was overran by Zerg and Hybrid and the surviving Dark Templar Protoss, chose to destroy Shakuras by overloading the temple. They also ended Hybrid production by destroying the facilities, along with the Terrans that served Amon, the Ancient Xel'Naga. They also find an ancient and sealed race named Purifiers and the former Xel'Naga's minions, the Tal'darim sided with him, with the condition that he help a rogue Ascendant to kill the leader in a duel to the death. They later reclaim Aiur again, this time successfully liberating the corrupted Protoss. Kerrigan and Raynor appears later, when another Xel'Naga calls them to the Void, Kerrigan absorbed the Xel'Naga's powers and used it to kill Amon once and for all. Terran factions The Terrans are a fictional future version and evolved species representing of humanity in the StarCraft series. The Terrans are the most splintered of the StarCraft species, consisting of multiple factions and nations that not only fight the other races but each other as well. Considered an adaptive and mobile species \\"too stubborn or stupid to know when to give up\\" when faced with existential threat, the Terrans are noted in the lore of the series for their ability to quickly access and drain a planet's resources. The Terrans have been dedicated a full campaign in each real-time strategy video game installment to date, and are defined in-game by their specialization of units and tactics of defense, tanking, mobility, and overwhelming concentrated firepower; they are the only faction to not field any melee unit. In the series' storyline, the Terrans are usually displayed as being caught in the conflict's crossfire between the Protoss and Zerg; they are forced to fight superior alien powers on two-front war at tremendous technological and evolutionary disadvantage, each determined to destroy the other, while also dealing with frequent internal strife, civil wars and revolutions. Attributes Society The Terrans are depicted as diversified, individualistic and fragmented, with multiple factions vying for dominance over each other. Numerous factions are used throughout the series, ranging from national governments and corporations to rebels and criminals, although only four \\"Government\\" factions exhibit any major influence on the overall story arc. The Koprulu sector—nicknamed the \\"Terran Sector\\"— is a fictional star cluster in space colonized by terrans that infringes upon Protoss imperial territory, with frequent incursions from the Zerg. It is situated on the galactic fringe of the Milky Way, 60,000 light years from Earth. The sector is further subdivided into at least five \\"zones\\". Most of its star clusters and planets are inhospitable to life, lacking any \\"Gaia worlds\\" that rivals Earth's biodiversity. Terran settlements are sparsely populated being riddled by chaos and anarchy; law and order are concentrated within the sparse few capitol worlds able to support dense population centers numbering in the billions. Still, the sector offers a vast range of natural resources. War in the sector is a brutal affair; every week there's another skirmish, insurgency, sortie, planned offensive, counter strike, police action, border conflict or plain old-fashioned war breaking out. Life expectancy for terran soldiers are measured in mere seconds. ;United Earth Directorate The first faction referred to in the backstory of the series is the United Earth Directorate (UED), headquartered within the Orion Arm's Local Bubble of the Milky Way galaxy. A unified government representing nearly all nations of Earth and associated colonies both within and outside the Solar System, the UED claims to operate under a policy of \\"enlightened socialism\\" but is noted for its harsh methods of public order and media censorship. It is also seen as an advocate for eugenics, resulting in the mass murder of millions and exile of other unwanted criminals and genetic mutants for colonization of the distant Koprulu Sector of the galaxy in which the series takes place. The UED remains outside the events of the series until Brood War, where it takes interest in the discovery of the Protoss and Zerg, the first contact between humanity and aliens. The player controls the UED faction in Episode V of Brood War. ;Confederacy of Man The exiled prisoners from Earth form the Confederacy of Man in the Koprulu Sector. A de facto plutocracy, the Confederacy's inner workings are elaborated on in the novels Liberty's Crusade, Speed of Darkness and Nova. Taking the role of the primary antagonistic faction in StarCraft's Episode I, the Confederacy is shown as the most powerful faction in the sector at the beginning of StarCraft; in the novels, it is depicted as being brutal toward the public and corrupt at the highest levels on its capital Tarsonis. The player gets to control a division of the Confederate Security Forces in the prequel shareware campaign for StarCraft. Due to the brutality of the regime, it is opposed by a variety of rebel groups and is eventually overthrown by the Sons of Korhal. The Sons of Korhal, a rebel group led by Arcturus Mengsk that the player controls during Episode I of StarCraft, form the Terran Dominion to replace the destroyed Confederacy, with the planet Korhal IV as the capital. The Dominion is an autocracy with Mengsk as its emperor. The Dominion's operations are built on in The Dark Templar Saga series of novels. Although Mengsk sees himself as a benevolent dictator, he is shown to be just as harsh as his predecessors. Mengsk's actions during his campaign against the Confederacy make an enemy of Jim Raynor, one of the Sons of Korhal commanders. After Mengsk betrays other members of his command staff and reveals his real objectives of obtaining ultimate power, Raynor deserts and forms a resistance movement to the Dominion, labeled Raynor's Raiders. Described in the novels as a small army primarily consisting of members from Raynor's former colonial militia, the Raiders use the hijacked former flagship of the Sons of Korhal, the Hyperion, as their base of operations. In Queen of Blades, the group is described as being amongst the most wanted fugitives and rebels of the Dominion. The player assumes the role of Raynor in leading the group in StarCraft II Wings of Liberty. Terran worlds The \\"Koprulu Sector\\" has a radius of 2000-9000LY. It lies somewhere on the galaxy rim cca 60 000 light years far away from the Sol System. Terran worlds are in the sector known as Koprulu. The main capital worlds (Tarsonis, Korhal, Umoja and Moria) lies not far from each other. Chau Sara and Mar Sara were recently founded border colonies, located between Antiga and Charr (as mentioned in one of the pre-briefings). All remaining Terran worlds are within the sector. Travel time between worlds average 10 days from \\"core words\\" to border colonies. The superluminal speed of the UED supercarriers that transported 40,000 people from the Earth was 2143*c (i.e. they overcame the distance of 60 000 LY in 28 years). The UED expeditionary fleet, that was sent to take control over the Koprulu sector, were capable of covering 333LY per day (manual indicates the UED flight took 6 months); meaning that Earth engine technology improved 28-168 times by the start of the Great War and Brood Wars. In prologue of the original Zerg campaign, Zerg destroyed nine of thirteen pre-existing Terran worlds. This forced billions of displaced Terran refugees to found new colonies on frontier worlds previously considered uninhabitable; the current number of terran worlds is unknown. Except for Earth and Gantris VI, the following planets are all situated in Koprulu sector, relatively close to each other. *Earth: Gaia world. Terran homeworld. United Earth Directorate (UED) capitol world. *Gantris VI: UED colony. The original destination of the Terran supercarriers Nagglfar, Argo, Sarengo and Reagan, it is situated some 2143 LY from Earth between the Earth and the Koprulu sector. *Chau Sara: Savannah world. Terran Confederacy colony. First known occurrence of the Zerg. First known destruction by the Protoss. *Mar Sara: Savannah world. Terran Confederacy colony. Overran by the Zerg. Destroyed by the Protoss. *Korhal IV: Desert world. Terran Dominion capitol world. Former prosperous Terran Confederacy colony, destroyed by nuclear weapons during the rebellion. *Tarsonis: Jungle world. Terran Confederacy capitol world. Assaulted by the Sons of Korhal and overran by the Zerg. *Moria: Savannah world. Kel-Morian Combine capital world. Very rich resource deposits. *Antiga: Savannah world. Former border world of the Terran Confederacy. Former Sons of Korhal base of operations. Overran by the Zerg. Destroyed by the Protoss. *Braxis: Arctic world. Former Protoss colony, now populated by Terrans. At least one habitable moon. *Umoja: Gaia world. Umoja Protectorate capital world. *Char: Terran Dominion border world with orbital platforms. Annexation by the Zerg. Depiction The Terrans are displayed as standard humans, the scrappy improvisers of StarCraft, relying on cobbled-together technology and a resilient spirit to spread southern hospitality around a cold and unfeeling universe. Rambunctious outcasts from a dignified civilization, they roam the fringes of the galaxy armed with over-the-top weaponry: flamethrowers, rocket launchers, and whatever other explosive devices they can get their mitts on. They are portrayed in-game in powered combat suits and with other war machines such as futuristic tanks and space battlecruisers in use by their militaries. Some Terrans are displayed with cybernetic implants. Human behavior in the fictional history presented in StarCraft's manual also points to the Terrans having the ability to access and deplete a planet's natural resources at an \\"alarming\\" rate. The Terrans are also noted in the backstory of the series as having a developing psionic potential. This psionic potential is what entices the Zerg to attack the Terrans, in hope of incorporating these traits into the Zerg gene pool. This psionic element is shown in Terran military technology through Assassins known as Ghosts. Established as one of the iconic parts of StarCraft, Ghosts are Terrans who are born with ranging psionic abilities-- from simple telepathy to advanced powers such as telekinesis or a special ability shown by Nova, where she can kill an entire skyscraper of people in a single thought known as a mind blast. These agents are cultivated by the military after being abducted from their former lives and put through an espionage training regime that can cost them their lives. In-game, the Ghost unit is equipped with a cloaking device and is designed for scouting and designating targets for nuclear strike, and has been developed further through the lore of the series to the extent that the StarCraft: Ghost sub-series was once planned, specifically focusing on the life of a Ghost, Nova. In-game, Terrans tend to favor traditional modes of warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles in combination with regular infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even tactical nuclear warheads, many Terran units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a dedicated \\"melee combat\\" unit. Terrans are more adaptive than the other two races and are able to produce units at an average expense. Primary base structures can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. Terran buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units. Appearances The player is first fully introduced to the Terrans in Episode I of StarCraft. For a number of years before the game begins, the Confederacy is shown to be fighting a slowly losing war against the Sons of Korhal. When the Zerg and Protoss make their existence known, the pace of the war quickly changes. The player, accompanied by Jim Raynor, joins up with Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal, and helps bring about the fall of the Confederacy by using Confederate technology to lure the Zerg into destroying the Confederate capital Tarsonis. In the process however, Mengsk abandons his second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to the Zerg on Tarsonis. As a result of the brutal tactics used by Mengsk and his needless sacrifice of Kerrigan to the Zerg, Raynor abandons Mengsk and his newly formed Dominion to search for the lost Kerrigan. When Raynor finally finds her on the planet Char it is revealed that she had been captured and infested by the Zerg Overmind. He then meets Zeratul and Tassadar and consequently becomes an ally to the Protoss. Raynor's forces assist the Protoss in defending their homeworld from the Zerg and in destroying the Zerg Overmind in the game's conclusion. In Brood War's Episode V, the player takes the role of a captain in a UED expeditionary force, sent to pacify the wartorn sector after news of the discovery of the Zerg and Protoss makes its way to Earth. The UED force meets success in its initial battles, quickly bringing the Dominion to its knees and taking captive a new Overmind growing to replace the one killed by Tassadar. However, the UED fails to capture Mengsk, who allies with Raynor, Kerrigan and the Protoss templar Fenix. The UED is slowly beaten back by this mutual alliance, and although Kerrigan betrays her new allies, her Zerg forces eventually annihilate the UED fleet. Regrouping his surviving forces, Mengsk begins to reconstruct his empire, although he is still opposed by Raynor and his troops. Raynor is the protagonist and player character of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Over the course of the campaign Raynor's Raiders (as his army is known) fight the Zerg and Mengsk's empire simultaneously. At the behest of a group known as the Moebius Foundation, the Raiders gather the pieces of a Xel'Naga artifact, until it is revealed that the foundation is actually led by Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus's son. Valerian intends to use the artifact's power to destroy the Queen of Blades, proving to the empire's citizens that he will be a worthy successor to the throne. Raynor begrudgingly finishes assembling the artifact and joins the imperial army in an assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char, but not before uncovering proof of Mengsk's treachery on Tarsonis and broadcasting it across the sector. The Terran forces on Char use the artifact to partially restore Kerrigan's humanity, significantly weakening her, but Raynor refuses to kill her. After the victory in Char, the increasingly unstable Emperor wanted to destroy Kerrigan and Raynor, which led the former to regain the Zerg powers she lost and gained Primal ability by consuming the first spawn pool's essence, and the latter got imprisoned and faked execution. She rescued her love, and she and Raynor destroy Arcturus once and for all. After that and Arcturus's son Valerian assumed the Emperor title, they were once again at war, this time against Amon and 'Narud' and their army, from Zerg, to mind- controlled Terran thralls. After repelling the thralls, they joined others to the Void, to end Amon once and for all. A few years later, an Arcturus Mengsk loyalist tried to foment rebellion, but was crushed. Zerg factions The Zerg Swarm is a terrifying and ruthless amalgamation of biologically advanced, arthropodal species of xenomorphic \\"hyper-evolutionary\\" superorganisms; they are the overriding antagonists for much of the StarCraft series. Unlike the Protoss and the Terrans, the Zerg are not \\"tool-makers\\", lacking technological inclination; instead, they \\"force-evolve\\" genetic traits by directed mutation in order to match such technology. Operating as a hive mind-linked \\"chain of command\\", the Zerg strive for \\"genetic perfection\\" by assimilating the unique genetic code of advanced species deemed \\"worthy\\" into their own gene pool, creating numerous variations of specialised strains of Zerg gifted with unique adaptations. Despite being notoriously cunning and ruthlessly efficient, the majority of Zerg species have low intelligence, becoming mindless beasts if not connected to a \\"hive-cluster\\" or a \\"command entity\\". As with the other two primary races, the Zerg are the subject of a full single-player campaign in each of the series' real-time strategy video games. Zerg units are designed to be cost-efficient and fast to produce, encouraging players to overwhelm their opponents with sheer numerical advantage. Since the release of StarCraft, the Zerg have become a video gaming icon, described by PC Gamer UK as \\"the best race in strategy history\\". The term \\"Zerg Rush\\" or \\"zerging\\" has entered video gaming lexicon to describe sacrificing economic development in favour of using many low-cost fast/weak units to rush and overwhelm an enemy by attrition or sheer numbers. The tactic is infamous; most experienced real-time strategy players are familiar with the tactic in one form or another. Attributes Biology Zerg have two cell types at birth — one which creates random mutations, and another that hunts these mutations — the result being that any mutations that survive are the strongest of all. Despite being a hive-minded species, the Zerg understand the principles of evolution and incorporate this into the development of their species. Zerg purposely situate themselves in harsh climates in order to further their own evolution through natural selection. Only the strongest are the ones with the best mutations survive, and they assimilate only the strongest species into their gene pool. Society It was stated in an interview by Blizzard employees that the Zerg are universally feared, hated, and hunted by all the sapient species of the Milky Way.2011-05-31, http://sclegacy.com/feature/3-events/1018-hots- fansite-interview May 2011 HoTS Fansite Interview The Zerg are a collective consciousness of a variety of different races assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by and unified by their absolute obedience to the Zerg collective sentience known as the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. Zerg creatures are rapidly and selectively evolved into deadly and efficient killers to further the driving Zerg imperative of achieving absolute domination. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated toward a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive worker to a warrior strain. StarCraft's manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch. The quest for 'genetic perfection' is a pseudo-religious concept to Zerg that drives them on a steady state of evolution and conflict; the zerg believed there was a state that the zerg could reach where they no longer needed to evolve, that their evolutionary form would never have to change again because they could already adapt to any situation. Abathur, an evolution master, doubted that this was possible, but reasoned that \\"chasing the illusion of perfection\\" was, regardless, tactically sound. The vast majority of the Zerg do not have any free will as they are genetically forced to obey the commands of those further up the Zerg hierarchy, although they are sufficiently intelligent to form strategies and work as a team on the battlefield. Despite this, the average Zerg has no sense of self preservation. Along with the Overmind, the cerebrates are the only Zerg with full sapience, each with its own personality and methods, although they too are genetically incapable of disobeying the Overmind. The Overmind also possesses the ability to reincarnate its cerebrates should their bodies be killed, although Protoss dark templar energies are capable of disrupting this process. If a cerebrate is completely dead and cannot be reincarnated, the Overmind loses control of the cerebrate's brood, causing it to mindlessly rampage and attack anything. As a result of the Overmind's death in StarCraft and the subsequent destruction of a new Overmind in Brood War, the remaining cerebrates perished, as they could not survive without an Overmind. Sarah Kerrigan replaced the cerebrates with \\"brood mothers\\". These creatures fulfil much the same purpose, but are loyal to Kerrigan and could survive her temporary departure during the events of Starcraft 2. An exception to all of this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them under the control of the main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind. Zerg worlds Zerg have conquered and/or infested many worlds, but only two of them are important: *Zerus: Jungle world. Located in the galactic core' Theta quadrant of the Milky Way. It is the birthworld of the zerg. The position of the Zerus is known from the manual. It is situated near the Galaxy core. The Galaxy disc has a radius of 49 000 LY. The Zerg covered some 30-40 000 LY during their search for Protoss homeworld. *Char: Volcanic world. Current Zerg capital world. Former Terran Dominions world. The new Overmind grew here, but later it was enslaved by the UED. Eventually the planet was regained by the Zerg under Kerrigan's control. The Zerg settled to infest other Terran worlds during their search, lies on the borders of the Terran sector. Because the Zerg ran across the Terrans first, it can implicate, that the Koprulu sector lies approximately on the line with Zerus, Char and Aiur. Depiction The Zerg were created from the native lifeforms of Zerus, who had the natural ability to absorb the \\"essence\\" of creatures they killed, transforming their bodies to gain new adaptations. The Xel'Naga created the Overmind and bound the primal Zerg to its will. They gave the Overmind a powerful desire to travel across the stars and absorb useful lifeforms into the Swarm, particularly the Protoss, their previous creation, so as to become the ultimate lifeform. The Zerg are a completely organic race, making no use of lifeless technology and instead using specialized organisms for every function efficiently fulfilled through biological adaptation and planned mutation of the Zerg strains. Their buildings are specialized organs within the living, growing organism of a Zerg nest, as are the Leviathans \\"space ships\\" that carry them across space. Zerg colonies produce a carpet of bio-matter referred to as the \\"creep\\", which essentially provides nourishment for Zerg structures and creatures. The visual aesthetic of the Zerg greatly resembles that of invertebrates such as crustaceans and insects (and certainly draws inspiration from the creatures from the Alien movies). The Zerg are shown to be highly dependent on their command structure: if a Zerg should lose its connection to the hive mind, it may turn passive and incapable of action, or become completely uncontrollable and attack allies and enemies alike. Zerg buildings and units are entirely organic in-game, and all Zerg can regenerate slowly without assistance (though not as quickly as Protoss shields or Terran medivac). Zerg production is far more centralized than with the Terrans and Protoss; a central hatchery must be utilized to create new Zerg, with other structures providing the necessary technology tree assets, whereas the other two races can produce units from several structures. Zerg units tend to be weaker than those of the other two races, but are also cheaper, allowing for rush tactics to be used. Some Zerg units are capable of infesting enemies with various parasites that range from being able to see what an enemy unit sees to spawning Zerg inside an enemy unit. In addition, Zerg can infest some Terran buildings, allowing for the production of special infested Terran units. Appearances In StarCraft, the Zerg are obsessed with the pursuit of genetic purity, and are the focus of the game's second episode. With the Xel'Naga-empowered Protoss targeted as the ultimate lifeform, the Zerg invade the Terran colonies in the Koprulu Sector to assimilate the Terrans' psionic potential and give the Zerg an edge over the Protoss. Through the actions of the Sons of Korhal, the Zerg are lured to the Confederate capital Tarsonis, where they capture the psionic ghost agent Sarah Kerrigan and infest her. Returning to the Zerg base of operations on Char, the Zerg are attacked by the dark templar Zeratul, who accidentally gives the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur to the Zerg Overmind. With victory in sight, the Overmind launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet. However, at the end of the game, the Protoss high templar Tassadar sacrifices himself to destroy the Overmind, leaving the Zerg to run rampant and leaderless across the planet. The Zerg return in Brood War initially as uncontrolled indiscriminate killers without the will of the Overmind to guide them. Through the early portions of Brood War, Sarah Kerrigan is at odds with the surviving cerebrates, who have formed a new Overmind to restore control of the Swarm. Through allying herself with the Protoss, Kerrigan strikes at the cerebrates, causing disruption of their plans. Eventually, the UED fleet takes control of Char and pacifies the new Overmind with drugs, putting the cerebrates and most of the Zerg under their control. Kerrigan retaliates by forming a tenuous alliance with the remnants of the Dominion and the forces of Jim Raynor and Fenix, their subsequent victories turning the tide against the UED. However, she later betrays the alliance by dealing long-term damage to the infrastructures of her allies and killing Fenix. Proceeding to blackmail Zeratul into killing the new Overmind, Kerrigan's forces destroy the remnants of the UED fleet, giving her full control of the Zerg and establishing the Swarm as the most powerful faction in the sector. In StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, Jim Raynor and the rebel forces who oppose both the Dominion and the Zerg, manage to secure an ancient Xel'Naga artifact and after successfully infiltrating Char, they use it to subjugate the Zerg and restore Kerrigan's human form. Once again without a unified leadership, the Zerg get divided into multiple broods feuding over control of the Swarm. This situation persists until the events of StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm. Kerrigan, believing Raynor to have been killed in a Dominion surprise attack, enters the original Zerg spawning pool to become the Queen of Blades again. This time she is no longer motivated to destroy humanity, having kept more of her original mindset due to the non-interference of the Zerg Hive Mind, and by extension, the Dark Voice, Amon. Kerrigan is the protagonist and player character of StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm. After being deinfested, she was taken in Valerian Mengsk's hideout to research on her, until the Dominion attacks the facility, she escaped along with the rest of the facility, except Raynor, who was captured by Nova. She later learned that Raynor was executed and seeks revenge on Arcturus. As she enters a Leviathan, she controls the local Swarm inside, and starts rebuilding her forces from scratch. She later evolved into a Primal Zerg after a confrontation with Zeratul, leading her to the origins of the Zerg. She became a Primal, after absorbing the spawning pool and killing Primal Leaders to collect essence. With her newfound power, she initially takes the fight to the Dominion after subduing countless Queens. She was later shocked after she knows that Raynor survived and held by Dominion as a bargaining chip. She organizes a raid, rescuing Raynor but the man fell into disbelief that the one he saved, returns to being a monster. She also confronted an ancient Shapeshifter creating Hybrids at the behest of her former rival named Alexei Stukov. She later prepared to end Arcturus Mengsk's reign by killing him in his palace in Korhal. She later left to confront the Shapeshifter's master and only by allied effort, they finished them. Kerrigan left them to her Broodmother Zagara's control. Xel'Naga The Xel'Naga (whose name, according to the original StarCraft manual, means \\"Wanderers from Afar\\") are an ancient race that has been featured in the lore of the StarCraft series but did not make an appearance until the Starcraft II: Legacy of the Void expansion pack. The Xel'Naga plays important roles in the backstories to both the Protoss and Zerg, being responsible for manipulating the evolution of the two races, along with an unknown number of other species. It was speculated that a player could control the Xel'Naga in StarCraft II but Blizzard Entertainment firmly denied this. Attributes In the manual to StarCraft, the Xel'Naga are described as a race determined to create the perfect lifeform. The Xel'Naga are also stated to have come from another galaxy and to have \\"seeded and cultivated thousands of various species\\" in their time. According to Legacy of the Void, the Xel'Naga cannot reproduce. Instead, they perpetuate their existence by cultivating and uplifting two other races, one possessing the \\"purity of form\\" and the other, the \\"purity of essence\\". After reaching the evolutional maturity, these races meet at a Xel'Naga temple called \\"Ulnar\\", receive the Xel'Naga's essence, merge and become the next Xel'Naga. When a Xel'Naga dies, its essence is sent to a realm known as \\"the Void\\" (not be confused with the real-world astronomical term). Legacy of the Void's epilogue campaign implies that death in the Void is the true end for a Xel'Naga. The Xel'Naga guided the evolution of the Protoss, a species the Xel'Naga believed possessed purity of form. However, after revealing themselves to their seemingly successful experiment, their presence caused the Protoss to devolve into a fearful and tribalistic mindset. Believing their experiment a failure, the Xel'Naga were shunned and eventually attacked by the Protoss while departing Aiur. The Xel'Naga then discovered the Zerg, small parasitic larvae that could control the nervous systems of other species. The Xel'Naga saw this as purity of essence, and guided the evolution of the Zerg as well. However, the Zerg were animals, concerned only with self- preservation. To help further the Zerg as a species, the Xel'Naga created the Overmind, a central consciousness to organize the Zerg. They hid their existence from the Overmind, however. On becoming aware of their existence (after being filled with an overriding directive it could not fight off), the Overmind attacked the Xel'Naga, infesting and destroying the greater whole of the race. In StarCraft II Wings of Liberty, Xel'Naga watchtowers provide vision in a large circular radius around the tower. Appearances The Xel'Naga appearance in the StarCraft series is limited. One Xel'Naga shapeshifter appeared in Brood War and Wings of Liberty but disguised as the humans Samir Duran and Emil Narud. (\\"Duran\\" backward being \\"Narud\\".) The Xel'Naga villain, Amon, appeared in Wings of Liberty as two glowing eyes only. The only benevolent Xel'Naga character, Ouros, appeared in Wings of Liberty disguised as the spirit of the Protoss hero Tassadar. It is no sooner than the Legacy of the Void's epilogue campaign that all the three characters appear in their true forms and die. Although the Xel'Naga rarely appear during the novels and the video games, various relics left behind from their legacy are scattered throughout the series. One such relic appears in Brood War, a large temple on the planet Shakuras containing the power to wipe the planet clear of other species. Transcript. During the course of Brood War, the Protoss activate the temple and use it to destroy all of the Zerg on Shakuras. Transcript. In addition, other structures have been shown in the series. In the novel Shadow of the Xel'Naga, the three main species fight for control of a large Xel'Naga artifact on the planet Bhekar Ro, but accidentally activate it. The artifact releases a creature incubating in the structure, which proceeds to convert the nearby Xel'Naga-empowered Protoss and Zerg forces into energy for nourishment, before disappearing into space. After this, the novel Firstborn reveals that numerous other similar artifacts are discovered by the Terran Dominion within its borders. The Dominion heir Valerian Mengsk consequently sends an archaeological team under Emil Narud to investigate these relics. Wings of Liberty also features a Xel'Naga relic that was broken into pieces. James Raynor and Valerian Mengsk reunite the pieces and, during a bloody invasion of the volcanic Zerg planet of Char, use the relic to restore Sarah Kerrigan back into her human form; the artifact also plays a significant role in Legacy of the Void. Cultural impact Merchandise The first series of action figures The species of StarCraft have been popular enough to inspire the creation of several collectable statues and toys based on in-game units. The first series of action figures was released by ToyCom in 2003 and included the Terran heavy infantry firebat with markings similar to some original StarCraft concept art for the firebat and a hydralisk, the Zerg medium assault warrior strain. A series of toys were also made available in 1998, featuring two colour variations of the Terran marine, another hydralisk and a Protoss zealot, the basic Protoss infantry ground unit. In addition, 1/30 scale model kits for the marine and hydralisk were released in 1999 by Academy Hobby Model Kits. A second series of collectable statues, which included one based on the Terran ghost, a Terran espionage agent with psychic powers, was in development but appears to have been cancelled. Critical reception Before StarCraft, most real-time strategy games consisted of factions and races with the same basic play styles and units with mostly superficial differences. Thus, the uniqueness and variety of the species in the StarCraft series has been well received by many of the industry's critics. In their review for StarCraft, IGN's Tom Chick stated that the balance and difference between the races was \\"remarkable\\", continuing to praise the game's \\"radical\\" approach to different races and its high degree of success when compared with other games in the genre. IGN was also positive about the unit arrangements for the three races, crediting Blizzard Entertainment for not letting units become obsolete during extended play and for showing an \\"extraordinary amount of patience in balancing them.\\" GameSpot was complimentary of the species in its review for StarCraft, describing the races as being full of personality. Stating that the use of distinct races allowed for the game \\"to avoid the problem [of equal sides] that has plagued every other game in the genre\\", GameSpot praised Blizzard Entertainment for keeping it \\"well balanced despite the great diversity.\\" Other reviews have echoed much of this positive reception. The site The Gamers' Temple described the species as \\"very diverse but well-balanced, \\" stating that this allowed for \\"a challenging and fun gaming experience.\\" Allgame stated that the inclusion of three \\"dynamic\\" species \\"raises the bar\\" for real-time strategy games, complimenting the game for forcing the player to \\"learn how [the aliens'] minds work and not think like a human\\". Commentators have also praised the aesthetic design of the three races; in particular, the powered armor worn by the Terran Marine was rated eleventh on in a Maxim feature on the top armor suits in video games, and ninth in a similar feature by Machinima.com. This positive view, however, is not universally held. For example, Computer and Video Games, while describing the game as \\"highly playable, \\" nevertheless described a \\"slight feeling of déjà vu\\" between the three races.

The first baseman and native of Helena, California, appeared in 263 games in Major League Baseball over all or parts of six seasons (1950–1951; 1953–1956) for the Brooklyn Dodgers and Detroit Tigers. He threw and batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed . Baseball career Dodgers Belardi played baseball at Bellarmine College Preparatory of San Jose, where he graduated in 1948. He also attended Santa Clara University. Big and powerful, Belardi began his career in the Dodgers' farm system in 1949, playing part of that season for the Nashua Dodgers of the New England League, but due to economic hard times, the league was on shaky footing and Belardi was promoted to Triple-A before the New England circuit failed in midseason. In Brooklyn, Belardi's path was blocked by the presence of eight-time National League All-Star first baseman Gil Hodges, then entering the prime of his career. Belardi played sparingly, getting into only 13 total games in and , and spending much of 1951 and all of 1952 in the minor leagues. He saw the bulk of his MLB action during the and campaigns. In 1953, he appeared in 69 games, including 36 starts at first base, as the Dodgers won their second consecutive National League pennant. Belardi batted .239 over the regular season, with 11 home runs and 34 runs batted in. He came to bat twice in the 1953 World Series as a pinch hitter, going 0 for 2 as the Dodgers fell to the New York Yankees in six games. Tigers In 1954, Belardi was used strictly as a pinch hitter during the season's early months, collecting two hits and two bases on balls in 11 plate appearances, before Brooklyn traded him to the Tigers for three players and cash in a June 9 waiver deal. In Detroit, he received an extended opportunity to play, getting into 88 games, with 71 starts at first base. Again, he hit 11 home runs and set a personal best with 58 hits, but he batted only .232 with 24 runs batted in. Most of Belardi's season took place in the minor leagues, as he made only three appearances as a pinch hitter for the Tigers during April. But he was able to bounce back and spend all of as the Tigers' backup first baseman, hitting a career high .279 with six home runs in 79 games and appearing in the starting lineup 26 times, including once as the Tigers' left fielder. It was his last season in the majors. In MLB, Belardi posted a .242 career batting average (143-for-592) with 71 runs, 13 doubles, 5 triples, 28 home runs, 74 RBI and 66 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .986 fielding percentage primarily as a first baseman and a few games as an outfielder. Late career During the 1956–1957 offseason, he was included in a couple of significant trades. On December 5, Detroit sent him to the Kansas City Athletics in an eight-player deal. Then, on February 19, 1957, he was a part of one of the many trades the late-1950s Athletics made with the New York Yankees. In the transaction—which would include 13 players in all—he was sent to the Bombers along with pitchers Bobby Shantz and Art Ditmar and young third baseman Clete Boyer. Those two hurlers would help the Yankees win three pennants in four seasons, and Boyer would become a regular on five World Series entrants. But Belardi did not make the Yankee varsity. He spent the final year of his professional career by hitting .220 in 1957 with their Double-A farm team, the New Orleans Pelicans. Belardi's baseball career was curtailed by injuries he suffered in a car accident.Obituary for Wayne Belardi, newspapers.comThe Washington Post (25 October 1993): Obituary for Wayne Belardi He died at age 63 in Santa Cruz, California.

Wind is one of many forms of weather which can affect sport. Due to a tailwind helping to enhance the speed of the athlete in events like certain sprint races (100 and 200 metres), 100/110 metres hurdles, the triple jump and the long jump, there is a limit to how much assisting wind the athlete may perform under if the performance is to establish a record. If a tail wind exceeds the result cannot be registered as a record on any level. However, the results within that competition still are valid because all athletes in a race would get equal assistance, and in field events it is just the luck of the circumstance at the moment of the attempt. The wind assistance maximums are only in regard to the validation of a record. The exceptions are the combined events like heptathlon and decathlon. Here, the total score may be accepted even though some of the results had a tail wind of more than 2.0 m/s. Here, in events where wind velocity is measured, the average velocity (based on the algebraic sum of the wind velocities, as measured for each individual event, divided by the number of such events) shall not exceed +2.0 m/s (Rule 260.18).http://www.iaaf.org/about-iaaf/documents/rules-regulations Higher average velocity was previously allowed as long as no individual event would exceed +4.0 m/s but the IAAF removed this rule in 2010.https://www.usatf.org/groups/officials/files/resources/rules/2010-IAAF- Approved-Rule-Changes.pdf There have also been cases where the prevailing wind has aided point to point long distance races like the 2011 Boston Marathon, however the nature of point to point courses invalidate allowable records by design. Notable cases of strong wind assistance 100 metres Obadele Thompson ran the 100 metres in 9.69 seconds in April 1996 in El Paso. The result would have been a new world record, had it not been for the tail wind of >5.0 m/s.Commonwealth All-Time Lists (Men) – GBR Athletics This was then bettered by Tyson Gay in June 2008, when Gay ran a time of 9.68 seconds with the help of a +4.1 m/s tailwind. That mark was surpassed when Usain Bolt set the current world record the following year, 9.58 with a legal +0.9 tailwind. Tyreek Hill ran the 100 metres in 9.98 seconds in May 2013, which would have made him the youngest to break the 10-second barrier, had it not been for the 5.0 m/s tailwind. That mark was also surpassed when Trayvon Bromell set the current world junior record 9.97 with a legal +1.8 wind at an even younger age the following year. When the women's world record holder Florence Griffith Joyner ran her 10.49 in 1988, the official wind reading was 0.0. Many observers have later noted evidence of a significant wind, suggesting the anemometer was defective. 200 metres Leroy Burrell ran 200 metres in 19.61 seconds in May 1990 at College Station, Texas, well under the world record at the time (19.72 – Pietro Mennea – Mexico 1979) but with a tail wind of 4.0 m/s. Also, Michael Johnson ran in 19.70 seconds on 22 June 1996 during a semi-final race at the US Olympic Trials in Atlanta with a tail wind of 2.7 m/s.All-time men's best 200m - wind-assisted – The Track and Field all-time Performances Homepage The next day, in the final race, he improved the long- standing world record to 19.66 seconds, which he improved further at the Olympic Games with a 19.32 in the same city in August.World Record Progression - 200 m men – The Athletics Site 100/110 metres hurdles Renaldo Nehemiah ran a would-be 110 metres hurdles world record of 12.91 seconds in June 1979 in Champaign, Illinois with a tail wind of 3.5 m/s.

Since then, other athletes have registered faster wind-assisted times, but none of them better than the world record (12.20 seconds by Kendra Harrison) as of July 2016. Triple jump Willie Banks became the first athlete to break the 18-metre-barrier in the triple jump, but with a tailwind of 5.2 m/s his 18.20 m jump in July 1988 in Indianapolis was not recognized as a world record. Mike Conley jumped 18.17 at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and the tail wind of 2.1 m/s was only marginally non-legal.All-time men's best triple jump - wind-assisted marks – The Track and Field all-time Performances Homepage Jonathan Edwards, who later became the first athlete to legally break the 18-metre-barrier with his current world record jump, jumped 18.43 metres in June 1995 in Villeneuve d'Ascq in a tailwind of 2.4 m/s. In May 2007, Keila Costa became the first South American woman to break the 15-metre-barrier. Her 15.10 m jump in Uberlândia, Brazil had a tail wind of 2.7 m/s.All-time women's best triple jump - wind-assisted jumps – The Track and Field all-time Performances Homepage Her legal personal best jump was 14.43 at the time, and the South American record was 14.53 metres. The next month Costa improved the South American record to 14.57 metres. Long jump In the long jump, Iván Pedroso jumped 8.96 metres in Sestriere, Italy in 1995 to break the world record by one centimetre – however, the result was never accepted due to wind assistance problems. The wind gauge did show a legal tail wind of 1.2 m/s, but this was declared void as someone had been standing in front of the gauge, thereby interfering with the wind measurement and rendering the result unusable.TRACK AND FIELD; Pedroso's World Mark In Long Jump in Doubt, New York Times, August 4, 1995 When Mike Powell set the world record at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics, moments before, Carl Lewis broke the existing world record by Bob Beamon with an 8.91, only to have it invalidated for record purposes by the +2.9 wind. Still in the competition, Powell then needed to jump over the world record to win the competition. He succeeded, and the wind had died down to only +0.3, enough to record a legal wind for the record as well. In a later competition, Powell jumped 8.99, also in Sestriere, but without setting a record due to a +4.4 wind. At the 2009 IWAS World Games, Paralympian Wojtek Czyz broke his own F42 classification world record twice. Wind readings of +4.0 and +4.1 invalidated both jumps.IWAS World Games 2009 - Athletics Results Also, two Oceanian records were not recognized. Gary Honey jumped 8.39 metres in July 1984 in Sacramento, California, and Peter Burge jumped 8.48 in September 2000 in Gold Coast, Queensland. Both results had too strong tailwind. Only weeks after Burge's jump, the Oceanian record was improved with a legal 8.49 metres jump by Jai Taurima. In July 1992 in Sestriere, former world record holder for women Heike Drechsler jumped over the world record mark with 7.63 metres, with a tail wind of 2.1 m/s.All-time women's best long jump - wind-assisted jumps – The Track and Field all-time Performances Homepage Combined events Dan O'Brien's decathlon result of 8844 points from June 1991 in New York City was better than the world record at the time, but not recognized due to wind assistance.All-time men's best decathlon - wind-assisted series – The Track and Field all-time Performances Homepage The next year O'Brien set a legal world record of 8891 points, which has since been improved further.World Record Progression - decathlon men – The Athletics Site In the heptathlon, wind-assisted series have been rare. Tatyana Chernova greatly outperformed the current world junior recordWorld Junior Records and Best Performances – GBR Athletics of 6542 points with a wind-assisted score of 6768 points in June 2007 in Arles, France.

This is due to the wind advantage that might take place for a straight course. The Athens Classic Marathon (from Marathon to Athens) has a too long distance, although it is too hilly to give any records.

Biography Early life The Gancia family is famous as the owners of an Italian wine- producing company (Carlo is named after the founder of the dynasty in 1850, called Carlo Gancia). Carlo is the eldest of the 5th generation of Gancias. Carlo Vallarino was born in Canelli, Asti. Italy. His father, Piero Vallarino Gancia, was an amateur racing driver, who in 1966 was the first Brazilian Motor Racing Champion, driving an alfa Romeo Giulia Ti Super, he was among the founders of the Confederação Brasileira de Automobilismo, the national motorsport authority of Brazil. Piero was also the Owner of Team Jolly Gancia, who raced Alfa Romeos in Brazil. For Jolly Gancia drove Emilio Zambello (Piero's business partner), Carlos Pace, Emerson Fittipaldi, Wilson Fittipaldi, Ciro Cayres, Ubaldo C. Lolli, Marivaldo Fernandes, Totó Porto, Chico Lameirão, Celso Lara Barberis, among others. Jolly Gancia chief mechanic was Giuseppe Perego, a Milanese who had worked for Isotta Fraschini and Maserati, under Guerino Bertocchi. Perego's right-hand man was Spaniard Manolo Pazos Torres. Jolly Automóveis was founded in 1966 and became the importer for Brazil of Alfa Romeo and then of Lamborghini and in 1970 of Ferrari. After growing up in Brazil, Carlo studied in Switzerland, UK and in San Diego, California where he obtained an MBA. He went on to work in several businesses in Saudi Arabia in construction, in Brazil in car dealerships and banking, in Switzerland and Luxembourg in banking and in Monaco in financial services. Motorsport Gancia was involved in motorsport from an early age, helping Brazilians get into Formula One, drivers such as Emerson Fittipaldi, Carlos Pace and Nelson Piquet to obtain sponsorship. He also ran a go-kart factory which helped to start Ayrton Senna's racing career. In addition, Gancia himself also raced at a competitive level, in a series of Brazilian Touring car racing championships. By 1992, Gancia was assisting Pedro Diniz's racing career, and met Italian Formula 3000 team owner Guido Forti. The two made a deal whereby Diniz drove for the Forti team in F3000 in 1993 and 1994, and Gancia bought the shares of Guido Forti's original business partner, Paolo Guerci, thus taking over the role of fundraising. Forti moved up to F1 in with Diniz as one of the team's drivers. Although Gancia had helped to secure a good budget, the FG01 chassis was slow and unsuccessful. When Diniz broke his original three-year contract with the team by moving to Ligier for , much of the sponsorship disappeared and Gancia looked towards Indy Car racing as an alternative. When the Shannon Racing Team company arrived mid-season as a potential major sponsor, Gancia sold his shares and left the team. A few months later, an ownership dispute between Shannon and Guido Forti led to the team's collapse and withdrawal from F1. Gancia currently is the president of for Image Sports Marketing, a US-based company with subsidiaries in São Paulo which represents, promotes, markets and televises American open-wheel racing formulae such as the IndyCar Series in Brazil.

Further chemical tests are needed to prove that the substance is blood. Confirmatory tests are the tests required to confirm the analysis. Confirmatory tests cost more than simpler presumptive tests so presumptive tests are often done to see if confirmatory tests are necessary.

This time Orczy sets the action in post-revolutionary France. The book takes the form of a novel but is divided up into nine inter- connected short stories about the mysterious Man in Grey's adventures in tracking down Royalist criminals for the Government. Plot summary Set in Napoleonic France in 1809, the west of the country is being terrorised by a group of reckless criminals known as \\"Chouans\\" (Screech Owls) because they inflict terror by night and go to ground during the day, hiding out in the remains of chateaux left in ruins after the revolution. The group, which contains some of France's most historic names, commit their crimes under the guise of Royalist convictions, but whether they really seek to reinstate the Bourbon royal line, or whether they are just a pack of lawless brigands is open for debate. > \\"Theirs were the hands that struck whilst their leaders planned—they were > the screech-owls who for more than twenty years terrorised the western > provinces of France and, in the name of God and their King, committed every > crime that could besmirch the Cause which they professed to uphold.\\" They are as much an enigma as the one man who has succeeded in bringing some of these fugitives to justice, a mysterious figure known only as \\"The Man in Grey\\", who is a secret agent for the Government. The Stories Silver- Leg The man in Grey has come to Alençon as the secret agent of His Imperial Majesty's Police, tasked with tracking down a band of Chouans who have been terrorising the region. On the way, the coach he is on is attacked and robbed by the group of brigands whose leader is a one-legged man known as \\"Silver- leg\\". The man in grey follows the robbers to their den and observes them bickering over the money. Their leader threatens to turn the others in to the police if they cause trouble, and escapes with the loot after telling them how to find out where their share will be buried. After making his way into town, the man in grey presents himself to the local authorities with a letter from the Chief of Police, insisting that they give him every assistance in carrying out his duties. M. de Saint-Tropèze, who is M. le Procureur Impérial, is not happy at the intrusion by the secret agent and complains to anyone who will listen that it is unwanted and unnecessary interference. The Man in Grey, who gives his name only as \\"Fernand\\" insists on being told about seemingly unconnected burglary and murder which happened the day before, despite M. de Saint-Tropèze insisting they are nothing to do with the Chouans. From there he starts to piece together what has happened despite the local police deliberately keeping information from him. When Silver-leg informs on the other gang members as revenge for their insubordination, the Man in Grey takes the opportunity to wait where the cash has been buried until they try to get their own back on their leader. Eventually Silver-leg appears with a shovel, but to the amazement of the two Chouans who are lying in wait for him, he removes his wooden leg and straightens out a perfectly normal leg in its place. They fall on him and shoot him, after which the Man in Grey shoots them. The infamous Silver-leg turns out to be no other than M. le Procureur Impérial, and as a result, the truth has to be covered up for the good of the government, as the public cannot be allowed to know that such a high-profile authority figure was involved in such villanies. > For the sake of officialdom, of the government of the new Empire, the memory > of such a man as M. de Sant-Tropèze must remain for ever untarnished.  * The Spaniard November 1809 and the public have been told that the man with the wooden leg is still at large while M. le Procureur Impérial died a hero's death helping to capture a gang of Chouans. There is widespread public condemnation about the Police's ineptitude in the affair, which isn't helped when one of their main detractors, M. de Kerblay, a lawyer and member of the Senate, is robbed at gunpoint in his house in Alençon. The Chouans take 20000 francs in the raid, but M. de Kerblay is more upset about the theft of a diamond ring given to him by the emperor and offers a reward of 5000 francs for its return. The Chief Commissionary of Police, M. Lefèvre, is excited by the reward and is keen to do business with a one-eyed informer who turns up a week later, promising to lead the police to the leader of the gang in return for immunity and money. The man in grey forbids Lefèvre from paying the informer, but he won't speak without cash, so Lefèvre decides to give him 2000 francs of his own money. In return the informer tells the Chief Commissionary that the leader \\"The Spaniard\\" is meeting with a German Jew at Chéron's farm that evening to dispose of the ring. Neglecting to tell the secret agent what he has found out, M. Lefèvre takes a squadron of police to the farm after dark, but despite being shot at, inside the farm house all they find are four members of Chéron's family who have been tied up in the loft. The chouans having left several hours earlier. M. Lefèvre returns to find the Man in Grey waiting for him. He berates the Commissionary for nearly ruining everything and insists they go straight back to the farm with ten men. They arrive about 5am and the Man in Grey orders the police to wait until they hear a shot. He then heads off in the direction of the farm house, and once out of sight, removes his grey cloak and hat to reveal his disguise – the shabby clothing of a beggar. The man in grey bursts into the farm house to find a group of chouans, he tells them he has been sent to warn them that the police are coming; they fall for his story and start to get back into their earlier disguise, as members of the missing farmer's family. In their midst is a short dark woman with a Spanish accent, as she hides something in the chimney, the Man in Grey realises that is the mysterious \\"Spaniard\\" who stands before him now, but the Spaniard is a woman. Seeing the Man in Grey looking at her, the Spaniard realises than he is not what he seems and draws a pistol, but he manages to escape before he is shot and the sound of gun fire alerts the police who arrest the gang.  * The Mystery of Marie Valliant Following the capture of the Spaniard, Lefèvre finally realises that The Man in Grey is very astute, and from then on give him his complete allegiance – to the extent that when M. Leblanc, sous- préfet of Bourg-le-Roi, has serious concerns about the behaviour of his children's governess, it is the commissary who advises him to ask for assistance from the mysterious personage who enjoys the special confidence and favour of M. le Due d'Otrante himself. So it follows that around the end of November 1809, M. Leblanc arrives at The Man in Grey's lodgings in Alençon. Leblanc lives with his wife and two children at a house called Les Colombiers, near Bourg-le-Roi. It is an old Manor, which once belonged to the exiled Comtes de Mamers, who emigrated at the outset of the Revolution and has settled in England. Leblanc employed a governess, Marie Vaillant for his children, Adèle (14), and Ernest (12), the previous summer. The governess was recommended by Monseigneur the Constitutional Bishop of Alençon but it is her recent conduct which is concerning him. A young, pretty woman, Marie soon gains the love of the children and seemed to be perfect for the job, but recently Mademoiselle Vaillant had changed, flirting outrageously with every man she comes across. In particular, she has turned the head of their butler Lavernay, but despite both of them assuring their employers they would be discreet, within a couple of weeks they had been spotted together on clandestine meetings after dark. Madame Leblanc had then decided that she must get rid of the girl, though had relented to allow her to stay until the end of the month, unless any further indiscretions came to her attention. The governess had since been exemplary in her behaviour, but M. Leblanc still did not trust her, especially as she seems to have an un-natural hold over his son Ernest, who worships her. The Man in Grey listens carefully then dismisses Leblanc, telling him to go home and watch over his family carefully as his son may be in danger, but to return if there are any developments. It is not long before M. Leblanc is back, this time in distress, for his son has gone missing following his wife's final dismissal of the governess. Meanwhile, Marie Vaillant has returned to the family home, soaking wet and in some distress, only to lock herself in her employers' bedroom before they could find out what has gone on. After asking some questions, the Man in Grey directs them to the ruins of a neighbouring house at Saut-de-Biche where they find the body of the butler and eventually rescues the missing child, who has collapsed in a hidden tunnel between the two houses. It turns out that Marie Vaillant had been sent by the Royalist faction to secure the treasure hidden by the Comte de Mamers in one of the lurking-holes of Les Colombiers. Unable to secure access to the tunnel by herself, she first enlisted the help of the butler and then of Ernest.  * The Emeralds of Mademoiselle Philippa The de Romaines, who left France at the very outset of the Revolution, have recently returned from England and made their home in the tumbledown lodge just outside St. Lô. It is the invalid Mme. la Comtesse, now a widow, who has returned to Torteron along with M. le Comte Jacques, her son, and Mademoiselle Mariette, her daughter, neither of whom has spent any time in France. The last 19 years have not been kind to Mme, and these days she is waited on by her only daughter while her son enjoys the good life, devoting his entire attention to Mademoiselle Philippa, a dancer. The Man in Grey has instructed M. Moulin, the préfet, to keep a close eye on the émigrés, but they appear to have no connection with the Chouans, so Moulin is somewhat surprised when the agent declares that his staff will be watching the family from now on. Soon after, Mademoiselle Mariette comes to see Monsieur le Commissaire because her brother has disappeared in mysterious circumstances. The Man in Grey sends for Mademoiselle Philippa and when she arrives it becomes apparent that the rogue has run off with her emeralds: A necklace, tiara and earrings which were a gift from the Emperor of Russia and worth the best part of a million francs. She has not seen Jacques in two days, when he left her taking the jewels under the guise of showing them to his mother. The Man in Grey insists that the sister is lying for he saw Jacques enter the house, yet he also fails to discover anything suspicious in the Lodge and after three hours' persistent search, is forced to confess that he is baffled. Suspicion over the disappearance soon turns on the mysterious secret agent and he also disappears. A month later and there is still no news of either M. le Comte or the Man in Grey. Mme. la Comtesse announces her intentions to move to Italy with her daughter. The morning they are due to leave, Mariette goes to church where she is first approached by a verger, who passes her a bulky bundle, and then a workman who warns her not to leave yet, as there are police spies outside. She follows him to a safe room in the church and sends for her mother. It soon becomes obvious that Mme. is not the invalid she makes out to be and the two women don disguises for their journey. Mme la Comtesse puts on the clothes of a young man but when Philippa turns up unexpectedly with the Man in Grey, it soon becomes clear that Jacques and his mother are one and the same. Despite having her jewels returned, the dancer is horrified at the trick that has been played upon her, meanwhile the de Romaines—mother and daughter—are taken to Rennes, where they are tried and imprisoned.  * The Bourbon Prince M. Moulin, is meeting with Monseigneur the Constitutional Bishop of Alençon after hearing rumours that the Comte d'Artois, brother to the uncrowned King of France, is planning to land in Normandy. Moulin is despairing about the situation having overheard a group of Chouans talking about how an enthusiastic army would meet the Prince and sweep the upstart Emperor from his throne. The Bishop appears bored with the matter, for Moulin has been bending his ear for over an hour. Insisting it doesn't concern him, he dismisses the Préfet, suggesting that the Man in Grey can handle the matter. Once M. Moulin has left, the Bishop waits until after dark then opens the tall windows in his room and welcomes in the Comte d'Artois, who is dishevelled after his rough sea journey. The Prince, who is in France at the invitation of the Bishop is concerned that he has been followed by spies. Leaving the Prince in his apartment with instructions on how to access to a hiding place behind a secret panel, the Bishop meets with his valet, Sébastien, who had led the Prince to the Bishop's private château. Sébastien tells him that the town is bristling with spies and that he had mistakenly shot and killed Grand-Cerf, one of the Bishop's keepers, in mistake for a spy. The Bishop starts to worry about the Man in Grey, who has already foiled several Chouan plots. Several hours later the Man in Grey meets M. Moulin to discuss the situation. Moulin confirms that the Comte d'Artois has landed but is shocked to hear that he was met by the Bishop's valet – insisting that the Bishop's loyalty is beyond question. The Man in Grey is not convinced and insists that the château is searched immediately. M. Fantin, commissary of police of Granville is agitated at having to carry out the Man in Grey's orders in what he sees as an abominable insult to the Bishop. yet, even when news reaches the police that a thief has been killed at the château during a robbery attempt that evening, the Man in Grey refuses to back down and announces he will meet the commissary and his squadron at the château. When they get there they find a body burnt beyond recognition, the Man in Grey questions Sébastien who reports that the rascal had overturned a lamp, was burned to death and nearly set fire to the château in the process. M. Fantin hopes the Man in Grey will drop the matter, but after asking the valet why it took so long to report the crime, he orders Fantin to make a thorough search of the château and grounds despite his protestations. The men search the château from top to bottom, finding the secret room but no sign of the Prince. In the meantime the Monseigneur shows neither interest nor emotion, doing very little during the course of the search except accepting the ministrations of a servant who remained with him throughout, bathing his forehead with vinegar and mixing him fresh glasses of orange-flower water. After the squadron have gone, the Bishop turns to his servant, who is none other than the Prince, and with a sigh of relief starts to tell him how lucky they have been. Their luck doesn't last long, for the Man in Grey bursts in with a squadron of Police and confronts the Bishop. He tells the Prince that as the Emperor deprecates revenge and bloodshed he will be taken to Avranches under guard and put of the brig Delphine for an immediate return trip to England. The Bishop, resigned that the plot has failed, is told by the agent that he has 24 hours to exile himself to his estate in the South, and he should consider himself lucky nothing worse will happen to him.  * The Mystery of a Woman's Heart Mme. de Plelan is distraught at the sudden departure of the Monseigneur. He has sent a letter to Madame warning her and her daughter Constance to destroy any compromising papers, as the police are likely to pay them a visit. Mme. de Plelan despairs about the Man in Grey, who is killing their hopes one by one, and asks if there are no men who can rid the King of such a foe. Constance tells her mother she has come up with a plan to get rid of their enemy just as the police arrive at the house. As her mother composes herself for the police visit, Constance leaves her to return the small metal box she is carrying to its hiding place in her room. When Constance eventually reappears, she looks somewhat different... For she has changed from her plain morning dress into a clinging gown of soft silk; her neck and arms are bare; her is done up and she is wearing makeup and perfume. The Man in Grey gives her a look of admiration, while Constance, flirting heavily, pleads for him to stop the unmarried sergeant from going through her personal belongings. Swayed by her beauty, the Man in Grey announces himself at her service and Constance drags him off to her room. After a while Madame hears her daughter singing and goes to investigate, she finds her daughter playing the spinet while the agent gazes at her with ardent admiration. On a table at his elbow is the tin box, with its lid open. Only a few papers remain at the bottom of the box; the others he has in his hand. At the sight Madame almost faints, Constance runs to her assistance, thanking the Man in Grey for being considerate. He leaves taking the box and papers with him. The agent gone, Constance assures her mother that there were only worthless letters in the box but announces triumphantly that she has the mysterious agent wrapped around her little finger. Less than a month later, early February 1810, and a woman is making her way along the main road which cuts straight through the woods between Alençon and Plelan. She meets with a man she calls Blue-heart, who confirms he is ready to shoot the 'vermin'. As Blue-heart hides in the thicket, the woman is approached by another man, who tries to take her in his arms. As they walk she talks at random, but the Man in Grey wants only to speak of the love that he now feels for her. Having received a note earlier saying that she would walk with him he is deliriously happy, too unsophisticated to wonder at Mademoiselle de Plelan's agreeing to meet with a man far beneath her in station. He is far too infatuated by this time to see any ulterior motives in this unconventional act. After a while Constance makes her excuses and leaves him, insisting that she does not want her friend Annette to see them together. Left alone, the Agent starts to walk back towards town and into her trap. Blue-Heart, has been joined by four other Chouans, keen to lend him a hand and as the Man in Grey approaches they grab him and are about to shoot when there is a piercing cry from nearby. The Chouans let the agent go and scurry into the undergrowth. Soon after Constance falls into his arms and he realises she has saved his life at the same time he realises that it was she who had set him up. She pushes him away and implores him to leave before the Chouans return, insisting that their ways lie apart for they have nothing in common. At that she plunges into the undergrowth to comfort the Chouan assassin leaving the Man in Grey to mourn his foolish hopes.  * The League of Knaves Mid February 1810 and the Man in Grey has received warning that de Livardot, one of the leaders of the Chouans has recently arrived in Jersey from England, and plans to land in France. The Emperor is due to visit the area in less than a month to stay with the Duc de Gisors and his imminent visit is occupying the local officials. The Man in Grey announces that he is going to meet de Livardot when he lands on French soil, leaving the prefect of Caen, M. Laurens, and M. Carteret, chief commissary of the district (who are very happy to see the back of the agent) in charge of the Emperor's safety. When they show surprise that he is going alone, he tells them that if he is not back in time for the Emperor's visit they should assume that the Chouan leader has got the better of him. A couple of weeks have passed and the local group of Chouans are wondering why they have not seen or heard from de Livardot, indeed most of them know very little about him. Blue-Heart tells them that they knew each other as children, in the days when Monsieur le Chevalier his father lived in the house, Les Acacias, which now belongs to the Duc de Gisors. Livardot has been sent from England to help because he is from the area and knows the house well. Hearing the familiar call of the screech owl, they realise that de Livardot has finally arrived. He identifies himself with a secret pass phrase and tells the other Chouans that his delay was caused by the accursed spy who jumped him at Dog's Tooth and nearly got the better of him. De Livardot goes on to tell them how, despite dislocating his knee, he eventually outmanoeuvred the agent, who fell to his death on the rocks below. The group start to work, plotting to kill the Emperor during his stay at Les Acacias. The Chouans have stored two kilograms of gunpowder in the disused cellars under the house and they intend to blow it up tomorrow evening when the Emperor is asleep. The next day the town is a buzz with strangers cheering on the Emperor. The celebrations last through into the early hours of the following day and it is 3am before the citizens of Caen go to bed. Half an hour later they are woken by a huge explosion – a glow lights up the horizon – Les Acacias is on fire. In the Rue aux Juifs, the Chouans and their local supporters are waiting for news from de Livardot and Blue-heart who went to set the fuse. Convinced the Emperor is dead they start to celebrate only for Blue-heart to come rushing in, shouting that they have been betrayed, for the Emperor is still alive and Les Acacias was empty when the explosion occurred. Finding themselves surrounded by police, the Chouans give up and are arrested, consoling themselves that at least de Livardot has escaped – that is until they spot him in the middle of a group of police officers. Thinking him arrested like the rest of them, they are even more distraught to be told that de Livardot is actually the Man in Grey, and the Chouan leader has been locked up in Bicêtre since his arrival.  * The Arrow Poison The Man in Grey has sent Hippolyte Darnier, a trusted servant of the republic to take an important letter, implicating the Marquis de Trevargan in the failed plot to blow up the Emperor, to the Minister of Police in Paris. Darnier takes the Paris diligence with around ten other passengers, one of who is a young woman in a dark cloak and hood. The woman who appears to be a nun spends the trip reading her book and keeps away from her fellow passengers. When the coach stops off at a small posting inn for the night, the young woman walks into the private room where Hippolyte Darnier is having his solitary supper, telling one of the serving maids that she is travelling in his company. The next morning Darnier is found dead in his room and no trace of the young woman or the missing letter can be found anywhere. The man in Grey concludes that Darnier has been murdered for the letter and summons the widow of the dead man to break the news to her. She takes the news badly and can shed no light on who might want to kill her husband. M. le Marquis de Trevargan, who has previously been above suspicion, is regretting writing the letter which had fallen into the hands of the Man in Grey. The day after the death of Darnier he is visited by M. Carteret, the commissary and the Agent, who question him. The Marquis insists the letter was a forgery and challenges them to produce it so he can prove it. Madame la Marquise is equally indignant at the aspersions being cast upon her husband. When the Man in Grey tells her that the letter has not been destroyed and that Darnier is still alive she pales noticeably and knocks over a table. Convinced he has his murderer in Madame la Marquise, the agent is thrown to find that she has a solid alibi, as she was entertaining children from the local Convent School during the day of the murder. Hanging around the Trevargan neighbourhood at night looking for clues, the Man in Grey finds himself face to face with Madame Darnier. He walks her home and the following day summons her to the police station where he assures the sneering commissary that he is about to unmask the murderer. He advises his colleagues to keep quiet regardless of what happens and when the widow arrives he tells her that her husband is still alive, for the poison did not quite kill him. He tells her that the doctor thinks it would be good for her husband to see her immediately. With a look of horror in her eyes, Madame Darnier, scratches her hand with the same poison she used to kill her husband (for the Man in Grey has only pretended that Darnier is still alive) and is soon beyond help. The Man in Grey reveals that Madame Darnier was the daughter of Leclerc, a man who for years devoted himself to the fortunes of the Trevargans. He and his family are devoted heart and soul to the Marquis and his cause. His daughter going so far as to kill her husband to save the family she loved. However the Trevargans will not escape justice for long, as the agent had only sent a copy of the letter to the Minister and still has the original in his possession.  * The Last Adventure The Marquis de Trevargan, Blue-Heart and White-Beak, several of the Chouans who were captured following their recent attempt to assassinate the Emperor have escaped while being held at Evreux. The Man in Grey and M. Gault, the commissary of police of Evreux have been riding hard all day towards Paris, so they can inform Monsieur le Ministre of the escape in person. Passing through Mantes after dark, the Man in Grey dismounts to see what has upset his horse – only to discover the body of a man in a ditch. The man has been murdered and his shoes are missing. M. Gault thinks they should leave the matter to the local police and is somewhat miffed when the Man in Grey insists that the commissary must remain in Mantes and await further instruction on pain of instant dismissal, while the agent continues to Paris. After riding all night, the Man in Grey finally meets with the Minister of Police. They soon ascertain that the murdered man was Hector Duroy, a messenger sent by the minister to take an important message concerning the Emperor's movements to the Man in Grey. When the Minister realises that the Chouans have escaped and are probably the ones who killed his messenger, he is horrified at the possible consequences. The minister comments that one of the missing Chouans had been paid to kill the Man in Grey by Constance de Plelan. As far as he is aware Constance has been staying at Evreux and, as she is Monsieur de Trevargan's niece, he suspects that she has been involved in the escape. The Man in Grey turns ashen at the mention of Constance's name but otherwise keeps his emotions in check. The Emperor is heading towards Chartres to visit his ex-wife Josephine. He is travelling in his private berline, harnessed with four bays, which are exceedingly swift. The Man in Grey asks for the swiftest horse from the stables and within twenty minutes Fernand is back in the saddle, all thoughts of fatigue behind him. About a kilometre from Maintenon along the main Paris to Chartes road is an isolated inn called 'The Farmer's Paradise'. The intermittent traffic on the road means the inn is usually quiet but this afternoon there is a reasonable crowd inside. About an hour earlier a lady and a gentleman had arrived from Dreux on a hired chaise, it's now 3pm and M. le Marquis de Trevargan is sitting with his niece, Constance de Plelan, at a trestle-table in a corner of the coffee-room. The other escaped Chouans are also present, but before they discuss their plans they dump a drunkard out into the corridor, where he rolls over contentedly and settles down to sleep in the doorway. With the landlord sent away and the drunkard removed, Blue-Heart and White-Beak tell the Marquis that they have laid a trap for the Emperor by scattering nails and broken glass over the road about a km from the Inn. This will cause his horses to go lame at which point they can overpower him and shoot him with the pistol procured by Constance. Suddenly the drunkard in the corridor is standing upright pointing a gun at them – it is the Man in Grey. He seizes Constance and forces the rebels to kneel down or he will shoot her. She pleads to them to let the agent kill her for the greater good of the Royalist cause, but they will not have a woman's blood on their hands so they wait as instructed. As time passes they hear the sound of the Emperor's coach and the murmur of voices indicating it had been held up, but still the Man in Grey keeps his pistol to Constance's head, threatening to shoot her should they make any noise at all. Another hour goes by and through the open window the sound of the murmur of voices has given way to renewed clanking of metal chains, as the heavy travelling chaise once more starts on its way. The noises are then replaced by the sound of a number of horses galloping along at breakneck speed, as a posse of police arrive at 'The Farmer's Paradise', to arrest the rebels. The men are all subsequently tried for the murder of the messenger and for plotting against the Emperor, for which they are condemned to penal servitude for life. Constance de Plelan however, was never brought to trial. Powerful influences were said to have saved her.  * Category:1918 short story collections Category:Historical short story collections Category:Short story collections by Baroness Emma Orczy Category:Cassell (publisher) books ","title":"The Man in Grey (short story collection)"},{"id":"13108972","text":"Sean Stoddart (born 20 January 1987) in Edinburgh, Scotland,Bamford, R.(2007).

It is on a hill overlooking the village of Disley, Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. Its benefice is combined with that of St John, Furness Vale. History The original church was intended as a chantry chapel for the fifth Sir Piers Legh of Lyme in the early 16th century but Sir Piers died before it was completed. It was built between 1527 and 1558, in which year it was consecrated and became a parish church. Aisles were added to the church in 1828 by Thomas Lee, and they were enlarged in 1835 by Samuel Howard. Architecture Exterior The church is built of buff sandstone and originally had a lead roof. This was replaced by modern materials during the 1980s. The plan of the church consists of a west porch and tower, a four-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, and a single-bay chancel. The tower has four stages, with angle buttresses. The parapet is castellated and includes the bases of eight pinnacles. On top of the tower is a wrought iron weather vane that was formerly on Stockport parish church. The tower has a three-light west window with straight mullions and three-light louvred bell openings. On the south face is a sundial. The porch was originally on south of the church. This is castellated with crocketted pinnacles and a central cross. Interior Inside the church are galleries at the west end and over the aisles. In the 19th-century restoration the 16th-century roof was retained. Richards considers this to be \\"the glory of the church\\". It is camber beam in type and is richly moulded and decorated with bosses, angels and crows' feet. The memorials include a number to members of the Legh family of Lyme Park, Including Thomas Legh who died in 1857, and to William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, who died in 1898. There is also a floor memorial to Joseph Watson, the park keeper at Lyme for more than 64 years, who died in 1753 at the age of 104. On the parapet of the west gallery are the coat of arms of George IV. The windows contain medieval glass from the Continent. The organ was built by Samuel Renn in 1836 and rebuilt in 1882 by Alex Young. It was renovated in 1949 by Jardine and restored by Church and Company of Stamfordham in 1977. The organ case of 1836 by Renn is still in place. There is a ring of six bells, all cast by Thomas Mears II at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1837. The parish registers begin in 1591. External features The lych gate built in 1891 is listed at Grade II. In the churchyard the box tomb of Samuel Brady dated 1814 is also listed at Grade II. In 1958 a cross base for twin Anglo-Saxon crosses was discovered in the churchyard. It is listed at Grade II, and is a Scheduled Monument. The churchyard also contains the war graves of six soldiers of World War I, and a Merchant Navy Master, an army officer, and a sergeant of World War II.

It was constructed by Lockheed Martin and is based on the A2100AXX satellite bus. It has two very large antennas, each measuring 12 meter in diameter. Launch occurred on 12 February 2000, at 09:10:54 GMT. The launch was contracted by ILS, and used a Proton-K/DM3 carrier rocket flying from Site 81/23 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. History At the time of its launch, it was the heaviest commercial payload to be launched by a Proton. During its launch, the Block DM3 upper stage made three burns instead of the usual two. This was the first time that the Block DM had used a three-burn ascent profile. Following its launch and on-orbit testing, it was placed in geostationary orbit at 123° East, from where it provides communications services to Asia. It is equipped with 88 transponders, allowing it to cover the entire continent with 140 spot beams. The satellite is controlled by ACeS Satellite Control Facility situated in Batam island, Indonesia. The Garuda 1 was originally to be supplemented by a second satellite (Garuda 2), but the plan never materialized. An anomaly with some of the antennae was discovered in September 2000, and significantly reduced the satellite's communications capacity. A few years later more anomalies were found, further reducing its capacity by more than 50%. Several curative actions have been taken by ACeS engineers to salvage the satellite and it is expected to survive another 5–7 years. In mid-2015, the satellite experienced another malfunction, making it in unusable state. After the malfunction, the satellite was finally retired and was moved into a graveyard orbit.

Alternatively, Psilocladius was included herein, in which case it was united with and became a junior synonym of the Psilocladinae, but this appears to be incorrect and the latter group is nowadays usually included in the Lampyrinae. Stenocladius, though usually placed in the Ototretinae, might actually belong to the present subfamily, but more study of this peculiar genus is necessary. Related to the Luciolinae and Ototretinae, the Cyphonocerinae appear to be one of the most primitive living lineages of fireflies. In fact, this group is so plesiomorphic that Cyphonocerus was not recognized as a firefly and placed in the Drilidae when it was first described. Cyphonocerus can display weak light signals, while Pollaclasis (and Stenocladius) have only the plesiomorphic pheromone signals like their relatives.

In historical sources, he was sometimes referred to as \\"E. D. Campbell.\\" In at least one source, he was incorrectly referred to as \\"Edward Campbell.\\" Biography Erasmus D. Campbell was born in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, and lived for a time in Connecticut. He arrived in La Crosse, Wisconsin, in 1854. He initially worked as a cashier in a bank owned by J. M. Levy. He studied law and eventually entered a law partnership, Campbell & Wood. In 1857, Campbell was elected Mayor of La Crosse. As mayor, Campbell advocated for the building a work-house, the purchase and establishment of a poor farm, the construction of a city hall, a new jail, additional school houses, and other infrastructure improvements. Shortly after he took office, the City Council passed a bond measure to pay for an expanded city jail. The city selected and purchased a lot of farmland for a poor farm near Shelby. His year as mayor was ultimately marred by the Panic of 1857, in which Campbell lost a significant portion of his personal wealth and property. Later that year, at the 1857 Wisconsin Democratic Party Convention, Mayor Campbell was nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor in the 1857 election. Among convention delegates, Campbell received 83 votes to 51 for Henry M. Billings. Campbell ran alongside Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Milwaukee Mayor James B. Cross. Campbell defeated his opponent in the general election, Milwaukee abolitionist lawyer Carl Schurz, but his running-mate, Mayor Cross, was defeated by Republican Alexander Randall. In his later years, Campbell retired to a farm near Shelby. He died in La Crosse, April 16, 1873.

Although her family was not wealthy, Webb cites her parents' hard work as teaching her \\"that I could be anything, do anything if I wanted it badly enough and was willing to work hard enough.\\" Webb had always created stories in her head, and when she turned nine she began to write them down. After she married, Webb continued to invent stories but grew too busy to write them down. To help pay the family's bills, she sold vacuum cleaners and took jobs working in factories or at fast food restaurants. After the birth of their first child, Webb's husband joined the military, and she entered college. After Webb earned a degree in Business Administration, her husband was stationed in Berlin, Germany. Webb worked as a secretary in the commanding general's office. She and her family returned to the United States in 1985, and Webb accepted a position as an executive secretary at NASA. In 1995, after a chronic illness, Webb decided to focus on her stories again. For three years, she researched the romance novel market and wrote. In 1998, she sold her first novel, a comedic romance novel, to Kensington Books' Precious Gems line. Six weeks later, she sold a second novel, this time to Harlequin's Intrigue line. Her first Harlequin Intrigue concerned a private investigation agency run by Victoria Colby. Since that book, Webb has written over two dozen novels that are connected to the Colby Agency. In 2007, she began a second series, The Equalizers, which focuses on Victoria Colby's son, Jim Colby. Awards Webb is a Romantic Times Career Achievement Winner. She has been nominated five times for Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice Awards, winning twice.

In the 1936–45 period, Francoist Spain had many official enemies: Loyalists to the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39), Liberals, socialists of different stripes, Protestants, atheists, intellectuals, homosexuals, Freemasons, and Basque, Catalan, and Galician nationalists.Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed., vol. 21, p. 836. Fascists viewed the purging of leftists from Spain as the political reaction that was required in order to re-establish the monarchy in place of the Second Republic. The Francoist Repression was motivated by the right-wing notion of a limpieza social, a cleansing of society. This meant the killing of people viewed as enemies of the state began immediately upon the Nationalists' capture of a place. Ideologically, the Roman Catholic Church legitimized the killing by the Civil Guard (national police) and the Falange as the defense of Christendom. Throughout Franco's rule (1 October 1936 – 20 November 1975), the Law of Political Responsibilities (Ley de Responsabilidades Políticas), promulgated in 1939, reformed in 1942, and in force until 1966, gave legalistic color of law to the political repression that characterized the dismantling of the Second Republic; and served to punish Loyalist Spaniards. Historians such as Stanley Payne consider the White Terror's death toll to be greater than the death toll of the corresponding Red Terror.  Background  The end of the monarchy of King Alfonso XIII (r. 1886–1931) precipitated Gen. Francisco Franco's reactionary coup d'état (17 July 1936) against the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39), which launched the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) After the flight of King Alfonso XIII (r. 1886–1931), the Second Spanish Republic was established on 14 April 1931, led by President Niceto Alcalá- Zamora, whose government instituted a program of secular reforms, which included agrarian reform, the separation of church and state, the right to divorce, women's suffrage (November 1933), the socio-political reformation of the Spanish Army, and political autonomy for Catalonia and the Basque Country (October 1936).President Alcalá-Zamora's reforms to Spanish society were continually blocked by the right-wing parties and rejected by the far-left- wing National Confederation of Labour (CNT, Confederación Nacional del Trabajo). The Second Spanish Republic suffered attacks from the right wing (the failed coup d'état of Sanjurjo in 1932), and the left wing (the Asturian miners' strike of 1934), whilst enduring the economic impact of the Great Depression. After the general election in February 1936 was won by the Popular Front — a coalition of leftist parties (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Republican Left (IR), Republican Union (UR), Communist Party (PCE), Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and others), the Spanish right wing planned their military coup d'état against the democratic Republic to reinstall monarchy. Finally, on 17 July 1936, a part of the Spanish Army, led by a group of far-right-wing officers (the generals José Sanjurjo, Manuel Goded Llopis, Emilio Mola, Francisco Franco, Miguel Cabanellas, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, José Enrique Varela, and others) launched a military coup d'état against the Spanish Republic in July 1936. The generals' coup d'état failed, but the rebellious army, known as the Nationalists, controlled a large part of Spain; the Spanish Civil War had started. Franco, one of the leaders of the coup, and his Nationalist army, won the Spanish civil war in 1939. Franco ruled Spain for the next 36 years, until his death in 1975. Besides the mass assassinations of republican political enemies, political prisoners were interned to concentration camps and homosexuals were interned to psychiatric hospitals.  Red and White Terrors  From the beginning of the war, in July 1936, the ideological nature of the Nationalist fight against the Republicans indicated the degree of dehumanisation of the lower social classes (peasants and workers) in the view of the politically-reactionary sponsors of the nationalist forces, the Roman Catholic Church of Spain, the aristocracy, the landowners, and the military, commanded by Franco. Captain Gonzalo de Aguilera y Munro, a public affairs officer for the Nationalist forces, told the American reporter John Thompson Whitaker: The Nationalists committed their atrocities in public, with assistance from the local Catholic Church clergy and from the upper social classes of the place (land and people) to be politically cleansed. In August 1936, the Massacre of Badajoz featured a great crowd of rich people and a Mass before the shooting of some 4,000 Republicans. Among the children of the landlords, the joke name Reforma agraria (agrarian reform) identified the horseback hunting parties by which they killed insubordinate peasantry and so cleansed their lands of communists; moreover, the joke name alluded to the grave where the corpses of the hunted peasants were dumped: the piece of land for which the dispossessed peasants had revolted. Early in the civil war most of the victims of the White Terror and the Red Terror were killed in mass executions behind the respective front lines of the Nationalist and of the Republican forces: Common to the political purges of the left-wing and right- wing belligerents were the sacas, the taking out of prisoners from the jails and the prisons, who then were taken for a paseo, a ride to summary execution. Most of the men and women taken out from the prisons and jails were killed by death squads, from the trade unions, and by the paramilitary militias of the political parties (the Republican CNT, UGT, and PCE; the Nationalist Falange and Carlist). Among the justifications for summary execution of right-wing enemies was reprisal for aerial bombings of civilians, other people were killed after being denounced as an enemy of the people, by false accusations motivated by personal envy and hatred. Nevertheless, the significant differences between White political terrorism and Red political terrorism was indicated by Francisco Partaloa, prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Madrid (Tribunal Supremo de Madrid) and a friend of the aristocrat General Queipo de Llano, who witnessed the assassinations, first in the Republican camp and then in the Nationalist camp of the Spanish Civil War: Historians of the Spanish Civil War, such as Helen Graham, Paul Preston, Antony Beevor, Gabriel Jackson, Hugh Thomas, and Ian Gibson concurred that the mass killings realized behind the Nationalist front lines were organized and approved by the Nationalist rebel authorities, while the killings behind the Republican front lines resulted from the societal breakdown of the Second Spanish Republic: In the second volume of A History of Spain and Portugal (1973), Stanley Payne said that the political violence in the Republican zone was organized by the left- wing political parties: That, unlike the political repression by the right wing, which \\"was concentrated against the most dangerous opposition elements\\", the Republican attacks were irrational, which featured the \\"murdering [of] innocent people, and letting some of the more dangerous go free. Moreover, one of the main targets of the Red terror was the clergy, most of whom were not engaged in overt opposition\\" to the Spanish Republic. Nonetheless, in a letter-to-the-editor of the ABC newspaper in Seville, Miguel de Unamuno said that, unlike the assassinations in the areas held by the Republic, the methodical assassinations effected by the White Terror were ordered by the highest authorities of the Nationalist rebellion, and identified General Mola as the proponent of the political cleansing policies of the White Terror. When news of the mass killings of Republican soldiers and sympathizers — General Mola's policy to terrorise the Republicans — reached the Republican government, the Defence Minister Indalecio Prieto pleaded with the Spanish republicans: Moreover, despite his political loyalty to the reactionary rebellion of the Nationalists, the right-wing writer José María Pemán was concerned about the volume of the mass killings; in My Lunches with Important People (1970), he reported a conversation with General Miguel Cabanellas in late 1936: Civil War The Ruins of Guernica, destroyed by the Condor Legion of the German Luftwaffe The White Terror commenced on 17 July 1936, the day of the Nationalist coup d'état, with hundreds of assassinations effected in the area controlled by the right-wing rebels, but it had been planned before earlier.Espinosa, Francisco.

Guernica was not the only town bombarded by German planes. The front page headlines of the Diario de Almeria, dated June 3, 1937, referred to the press in London and Paris carrying the news of the \\"criminal bombardment of Almeria by German planes\\". Lérida, Durango, Granollers, Alcañiz, Valencia and Barcelona by the Luftwaffe (Legion Condor) and the Italian air force (Aviazione Legionaria) (according to Gabriel Jackson estimates range from 5,000 to 10,000 victims of the bombings), killings of Republican POWs, rape, forced disappearances — including whole Republican military units such as the 221st Mixed Brigade — and the establishment of Francoist prisons in the aftermath of the Republicans' defeat. Goals and victims of the repression The main goal of the White Terror was to terrify the civil population who opposed the coup, eliminate the supporters of the Republic and the militants of the leftist parties, and because of this, some historians have considered the White Terror a genocide. In fact, one of the leaders of the coup, General Mola said: In areas controlled by the Nationalists, government officials, Popular Front politicians (in the city of Granada 23 of the 44 councillors of the city's corporation were executed), union leaders, teachers (in the first weeks of the war hundreds of teachers were killed by the Nationalists), intellectuals (for example, in Granada, between 26 July 1936 and 1 March 1939, the poet Federico García Lorca, the editor of the left- wing newspaper El Defensor de Granada, the professor of paediatrics in the Granada University, the rector of the university, the professor of political law, the professor of pharmacy, the professor of history, the engineer of the road to the top of the Sierra Morena and the best-known doctor in the city were killed by the Nationalists, and in the city of Cordoba, \\"nearly the entire republican elite, from deputies to booksellers, were executed in August, September and December...\\"), suspected Freemasons (in Huesca, where there were only twelve Freemasons, the Nationalists killed a hundred suspected Freemasons), Basque, Catalan, Andalusian or Galician nationalists (among them Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera, leader of Democratic Union of Catalonia Unió Democrática de Catalunya, Alexandre Boveda, one of the founders of the Partido Galeguista and Blas Infante, leader of the Andalusian nationalism), military officers who had remained loyal to the government of the Republic (among them the Army generals Domingo Batet, Enrique Salcedo Molinuevo, Miguel Campíns, Nicolás Molero, Nuñez de Prado, Manuel Romerales and Rogelio Caridad Pita), and people suspected of voting for the Popular Front were targeted, usually brought before local committees and imprisoned or executed. The living conditions in the improvised Nationalist prisons were very harsh. One former Republican prisoner declared: > At times we were forty prisoners in a cell built to accommodate two people. > There were two benches, each capable of seating three persons, and the floor > to sleep on. For our private needs, there were only three chamberpots. They > had to be emptied into an old rusty cauldron which also served for washing > our clothes. We were forbidden to have food brought to us from outside, and > were given disgusting soup cooked with soda ash which kept us in a constant > state of dysentery. We were all in a deplorable state. The air was > unbreathable and the babies choked many nights for lack of oxygen... To be > imprisoned, according to the rebels, was to lose all individuality. The most > elementary human rights were unknown and people were killed as easily as > rabbits... Because of this mass terror in many areas controlled by the Nationalists, thousands of Republicans left their homes and tried to hide in nearby forests or mountains. Many of these huidos later joined the Spanish maquis, the anti- Francoist guerrilla force that continued to fight against the Francoist State in the post-war era. Hundreds of thousands of others fled to the areas controlled by the Second Republic. In 1938 there were more than one million refugees in Barcelona alone. In many cases, when someone fled the Nationalists executed their relatives. One witness in Zamora stated: \\"All the members of the Flechas family, both men and women, were killed, a total of seven persons. A son succeeded in escaping, but in his place they killed his eight-months- pregnant fiancé Transito Alonso and her mother, Juana Ramos.\\" Furthermore, thousands of republicans joined Falange and the Nationalist army in order to escape the repression. In fact, many supporters of the Nationalists referred to the Falange as \\"our reds\\" and to the Falange's blue shirt as the salvavidas (life jacket). In Granada, one supporter of the Nationalists said: Another major target of the Terror were women, with the overall goal of keeping them in their traditional place in Spanish society. To this end the Nationalist army promoted a campaign of targeted rape. Quiepo de Llano spoke multiple times over the radio warning that \\"immodest\\" women with Republican sympathies would be raped by his Moorish troops. Near Seville, Nationalist soldiers raped a truckload of female prisoners, threw their bodies down a well, and paraded around town with their rifles draped with their victim's underwear. These rapes were not the result of soldiers disobeying orders, but official Nationalist policies, with officers specifically choosing Moors to be the primary perpetrators. Advancing nationalist troops scrawled \\"Your children will give birth to fascists\\" on the walls of captured buildings, and many women taken prisoner were force fed castor oil, then paraded in public naked, while the powerful laxative did its work.

Source: Ministry of Justice of Spain Estimates of executions behind the Nationalist lines during the Spanish Civil War range from fewer than 50,000 to 200,000 (Hugh Thomas: 75,000, Secundino Serrano: 90,000; Josep Fontana: 150,000; and Julián Casanova: 100,000.Casanova, Julián. The Spanish Republic and Civil War. Cambridge University Press. 2010. New York. p. 181. Most of the victims were killed without a trial in the first months of the war and their corpses were left on the sides of roads or in clandestine and unmarked mass graves. For example, in Valladolid only 374 officially recorded victims of the repression of a total of 1,303 (there were many other unrecorded victims) were executed after a trial, and the historian Stanley Payne in his work Fascism in Spain (1999), citing a study by Cifuentes Checa and Maluenda Pons carried out over the Nationalist-controlled city of Zaragoza and its environs, refers to 3,117 killings, of which 2,578 took place in 1936. He goes on to state that by 1938 the military courts there were directing summary executions. Many of the executions in the course of the war were carried by militants of the fascist party Falange (Falange Española de las J.O.N.S.) or militants of the Carlist party (Comunión Tradicionalista) militia (Requetés), but with the approval of the Nationalist government. Cooperation of the Spanish Church The Spanish Church approved of the White Terror and cooperated with the rebels. According to Antony Beevor: \\"Cardinal Gomá stated that 'Jews and Masons poisoned the national soul with absurd doctrine'... A few brave priests put their lives at risk by criticizing nationalist atrocities, but the majority of the clergy in nationalist areas revelled in their new-found power and the increased size of their congregations. Anyone who did not attend Mass faithfully was likely to be suspected of 'red' tendencies. Entrepreneurs made a great money selling religious symbols... It was reminiscent of the way the Inquisition's persecutions of Jews and Moors helped make pork such an important part of the Spanish diet.\\" One witness in Zamora said: \\"Many priests acted very badly. The bishop of Zamora in 1936 was more or less an assassin—I don't remember his name. He must be held responsible because prisoners appealed to him to save their lives. All he would reply was that the Reds had killed more people than the falangist were killing.\\" (The bishop of Zamora in 1936 was Manuel Arce y Ochotorena) Nevertheless, the Nationalists killed at least 16 Basque nationalist priests (among them the arch-priest of Mondragon), and imprisoned or deported hundreds more. Several priests who tried to halt the killings and at least one priest who was a Mason were killed. Regarding the callous attitude of the Vatican, Manuel Montero, lecturer of the University of the Basque Country commented on 6 May 2007:Manuel Montero a El País, 6/5/2007, «Otros \\"mártires\\" de la Guerra Civil» Repression in the South and the drive to Madrid The White Terror was especially harsh in the southern part of Spain (Andalusia and Extremadura). The rebels bombed and seized the working-class districts of the main Andalusian cities in the first days of the war, and afterwards went on to execute thousands of workers and militants of the leftist parties: in the city of Cordoba 4,000; in the city of Granada 5,000; in the city of Seville 3,028; and in the city of Huelva 2,000 killed and 2,500 disappeared. The city of Málaga, occupied by the Nationalists in February 1937 following the Battle of Málaga, experienced one of the harshest repressions following Francoist victory with an estimated total of 17,000 people summarily executed. Carlos Arias Navarro, then a young lawyer who as public prosecutor signed thousands of execution warrants in the trials set up by the triumphant rightists, became known as \\"The Butcher of Málaga\\" (Carnicero de Málaga). Over 4,000 people were buried in mass graves. Even towns of rural areas were not spared the terror, such as Lora del Rio in the province of Seville, where the Nationalists killed 300 peasants as a reprisal for the assassination of a local landowner. In the province of Córdoba the Nationalists killed 995 Republicans in Puente Genil and about 700 loyalists were murdered by the orders of Nationalist Colonel Sáenz de Buruaga in Baena, although other estimates mention up to 2,000 victims following the Baena Massacre. Paul Preston estimates the total number of victims of the Nationalists in Andalusia at 55,000. Troops of North Africa The colonial troops of the Spanish Army of Africa (Ejército de África), composed mainly of the Moroccan regulares and the Spanish Legion, under the command of Colonel Juan Yagüe, made up the feared shock troops of the Francoist military. In their advance towards Madrid from Sevilla through Andalusia and Extremadura these troops routinely killed dozens or hundreds in every town or city conquered. but in the Massacre of Badajoz the number of Republicans killed reached several thousands. Furthermore, the colonial troops raped many working-class women and looted the houses of the Republicans. Queipo de Llano, one of the Nationalists leaders known for his use of radio broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare, said:  Postwar  When Heinrich Himmler visited Spain in 1940, a year after Franco's victory, he claimed to have been \\"shocked\\" by the brutality of the Falangist repression.Packer, George \\"The Spanish Prisoner\\" The New Yorker October 31, 2005 In July 1939, the foreign minister of Fascist Italy, Galeazzo Ciano, reported of \\"trials going on every day at a speed which I would call almost summary... There are still a great number of shootings. In Madrid alone, between 200 and 250 a day, in Barcelona 150, in Seville 80\\". While authors like Payne have cast doubts on the democratic leanings of the Republic, \\"fascism was clearly on the other\\". Repressive laws According to Beevor, Spain was an open prison for all those who opposed Franco. Until 1963, all the opponents of the Francoist State were brought before military courts. A number of repressive laws were issued, including the Law of Political Responsibilities (Ley de Responsabilidades Políticas) in February 1939, the Law of Security of State (Ley de Seguridad del Estado) in 1941 (which regarded illegal propaganda or labour strikes as military rebellion), the Law for the Repression of Masonry and Communism (Ley de Represión de la Masonería y el Comunismo) on 2 March 1940, and the Law for the Repression of Banditry and Terrorism (Ley para la represión del Bandidaje y el Terrorismo) in April 1947, which targeted the maquis. Furthermore, in 1940, the Francoist State established the Tribunal for the eradication of Freemasonry and Communism (Tribunal Especial para la Represión de la Masonería y el Comunismo). Political parties and trade unions were forbidden except for the government party, Traditionalist Spanish Falange and Offensive of the Unions of the National-Syndicalist (Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista or FET de las JONS), and the official trade union Spanish Trade Union Organisation (Sindicato Vertical). Hundreds of militants and supporters of the parties and trade unions declared illegal under Francoist Spain, such as the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Español), PSOE; the Communist Party of Spain (Partido Comunista de España), PCE; the Workers' General Union (Unión General de Trabajadores), UGT; and the National Confederation of Labor (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo), CNT, were imprisoned or executed. The regional languages, like Basque and Catalan, were also forbidden, and the statutes of autonomy of Catalonia and the Basque country were abolished. Censorship of the press (the Law of Press, passed in April 1938) and of cultural life was rigorously exercised and forbidden books destroyed. Executions, forced labour and medical experiments At the end of the Spanish Civil War the executions of the \\"enemies of the state\\" continued (some 50,000 people were killed), including the extrajudicial (death squad) executions of members of the Spanish maquis (anti–Francoist guerrillas) and their supporters (los enlaces, \\"the links\\");in the province of Córdoba 220 maquis and 160 enlaces were killed. Thousands of men and women were imprisoned after the civil war in Francoist concentration camps, approximately 367,000 to 500,000 prisoners were held in 50 camps or prisons. In 1933, before the war, the prisons of Spain contained some 12,000 prisoners,Tusell, Javier. La dictadura de Franco. Ediciones Altaya. Madrid. 1996. p. 227. just seven years later, in 1940, just one year after the end of the civil war, 280,000 prisoners were held in more than 500 prisons throughout the country. The principal purpose of the Francoist concentration camps was to classify the prisoners of war from the defeated Spanish Republic; men and women who were classified as \\"unrecoverable\\", were put to death. After the war, the republican prisoners were sent to work in militarised penal colonies (Colonias Penales Militarizadas), penal detachments (Destacamentos Penales) and disciplinary battalions of worker-soldiers (Batallones Disciplinarios de Soldados Trabajadores). According to Beevor, 90,000 Republican prisoners were sent off to 121 labour battalions and 8,000 to military workshops. In 1939, Ciano said about the Republican prisoners of war: \\"They are not prisoners of war, they are slaves of war\\". Thousands of prisoners (15,947 in 1943) were forced to work building dams, highways, the Guadalquivir Canal (10,000 political prisoners worked on its construction between 1940 and 1962), the Carabanchel Prison, the Valley of the Fallen (Valle de los Caídos) (20,000 political prisoners worked in its construction) and in coal mines in Asturias and Leon. The severe overcrowding of the prisons (according to Antony Beevor 270,000 prisoners were spread around jails with capacity for 20,000), poor sanitary conditions and the lack of food caused thousands of deaths (4,663 prisoner deaths were recorded between 1939 and 1945 in 13 of the 50 Spanish provinces), among them the poet Miguel Hernández and the politician Julián Besteiro. New investigations suggest that the actual number of dead prisoners was much higher, with around 15,000 deaths just in 1941 (the worst year).Gómez, F. M. (2015). La gran acción represiva de Franco que se quiere ocultar. HISPANIA NOVA. Primera Revista de Historia Contemporánea on-line en castellano. Segunda Época, 183–210. Just as with the death toll from executions by the Nationalists during the Civil War, historians have made different estimations the victims of the White Terror after the war. Stanley Payne estimates 30,000 executions following the end of the war. Recent searches conducted with parallel excavations of mass graves in Spain (in particular by the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, ARMH) estimate that the total of people executed after the war arrive at a number between 15,000 and 35,000.Fosas Comunes – Los desaparecidos de Franco. La Guerra Civil no ha terminado, El Mundo, 7 July 2002 Julián Casanova Ruiz, nominated in 2008 among the experts in the first judicial investigation (conducted by judge Baltasar Garzón) against the Francoist crimes\\"Aportaremos trozos de verdad a un 'puzzle' que resolverá Garzón\\", El País, 23 de octubre de 2008. estimate 50,000. Historian Josep Fontana says 25,000. According to Gabriel Jackson, the number of victims of the White Terror (executions and hunger or illness in prisons) just between 1939 and 1943 was 200,000. A Francoist psychiatrist, Antonio Vallejo-Nájera, carried out medical experiments on prisoners in the Francoist concentration camps to \\"establish the bio-psych roots of Marxism\\".\\"Psychology in Francoist Concentration Camps\\" (1997) in Psychology in Spain, published by the Spanish College of Psychologists Vallejo Najera also said that it was necessary to remove the children of the Republican women from their mothers. Thousands of children were taken from their mothers and handed over to Francoist families (in 1943 12,043). Many of the mothers were executed afterwards. \\"For mothers who had a baby with them—and there were many—the first sign that they were to be executed was when their infant was snatched from them. Everyone knew what this meant. A mother whose little one was taken had only a few hours left to live\\". Stanley Payne observes that Franco's repression did not undergo \\"cumulative radicalisation\\" like that of Hitler; in fact, the opposite occurred, with major persecution being slowly reduced. 95% of death sentences under Franco's rule occurred by 1941. During the next thirty months, military prosecutors sought 939 death sentences, most of which were not approved and others commuted. On October 1, 1939, all former Republican personnel serving a sentence of less than six years were pardoned. In 1940 special military judicial commissions were created to examine sentences and were given the power to confirm or reduce them but never to extend them. Later that year, provisional liberty was granted to all political prisoners serving less than six years and in April 1941, this was also granted to those serving less than twelve years and then fourteen years in October. Provisional liberty was extended to those serving up to twenty years in December 1943.Payne, Stanley G., and Jesús Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.210-211 Fate of Republican exiles Furthermore, hundreds of thousands were forced into exile (470,000 in 1939), with many intellectuals and artists who had supported the Republic such as Antonio Machado, Ramon J. Sender, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Rafael Alberti, Luis Cernuda, Pedro Salinas, Manuel Altolaguirre, Emilio Prados, Max Aub, Franciso Ayala, Jorge Guillén, León Felipe, Arturo Barea, Pablo Casals, Jesús Bal y Gay, Rodolfo Halffter, Julián Bautista, Salvador Bacarisse, Josep Lluís Sert, Margarita Xirgu, Maruja Mallo, Claudio Sánchez Albornoz, Americo Castro, Clara Campoamor, Victoria Kent, Pablo Picasso, Maria Luisa Algarra, Alejandro Casona, Rosa Chacel, Maria Zambrano, Josep Carner, Manuel de Falla, Paulino Masip, María Teresa León, Alfonso Castelao, Jose Gaos and Luis Buñuel.

The photo was taken on 6 May 1945 When Nazi Germany occupied France, Franco's politicians encouraged the Germans to detain and to deport thousands of Republican refugees to the concentration camps. 15,000 Spanish Republicans were deported to Dachau, Buchenwald (including the writer Jorge Semprún), Bergen-Belsen, Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg (among them the politician Francisco Largo Caballero), Auschwitz, Flossenburg and Mauthausen (5,000 out of 7,200 Spanish prisoners at Mauthausen died there). Other Spanish Republicans were detained by the Gestapo, handed over to Spain and executed, among them Julián Zugazagoitia, Juan Peiró, Francisco Cruz Salido and Lluis Companys (president of the Generalitat of Catalonia) and another 15,000 were forced to work building the Atlantic Wall. Moreover, 4,000 Spanish Republicans were deported by the Nazis to the occupied Channel Islands and were forced to work building fortifications; only 59 survived. Thus, thousands of Spanish refugees (10,000 fighters in 1944) joined the French Resistance—among them Colonel Carlos Romero Giménez—and the Free French Forces. Purges and labour discrimination Memorial plaque in Pamplona with the list of teachers murdered and cracked down by the Spanish Nationalists, 1936 and later The Francoist State carried out extensive purges among the civil service. Thousands of officials loyal to the Republic were expelled from the army.Tusell, Javier. La dictadura de Franco. Ediciones Altaya. Madrid. 1996. p.174 Thousands of university and school teachers lost their jobs (a quarter of all Spanish teachers). Priority for employment was always given to Nationalist supporters, and it was necessary to have a \\"good behavior\\" certificate from local Falangist officials and parish priests. Furthermore, the Francoist State encouraged tens of thousands of Spaniards to denounce their Republican neighbours and friends: Campaign against Republican women Republican women were also victims of the repression in postwar Spain. Thousands of women suffered public humiliation (being paraded naked through the streets, being shaved and forced to ingest castor oil so they would soil themselves in public), sexual harassment and rape. In many cases, the houses and goods of the widows of Republicans were confiscated by the government. Thus, many Republican women, living in total poverty, were forced into prostitution. According to Paul Preston: \\"The increase in prostitution both benefited Francoist men who thereby slaked their lust and also reassured them that 'red' women were a fount of dirt and corruption\\". Furthermore, thousands of women were executed (for example the 13 roses) among them pregnant women. One judge said: \\"We cannot wait seven months to execute a woman\\". Furthermore, under the Francoist legislation, a woman needed her husband's permission to take a job or open a bank account. Adultery by women was a crime, but adultery by the husband was a crime only if he lived with his mistress. Marriage law The divorce and marriage legislation of the Republic was retroactively reversed, with the divorces retroactively unmade and the children of civil marriages made illegitimate. Homosexuals Homosexuals were first sent to concentration camps. Then the 1954 reform of the 1933 \\"Ley de vagos y maleantes\\" (\\"Vagrancy Act\\") declared homosexuality illegal. Around 5,000 homosexuals were arrested during Francoism due to their sexual orientation.ORTIZ HERAS, M. (2013). La violencia política en la dictadura franquista 1939–1977. La insoportable banalidad del mal. Editorial Bomarzo. Page 55.  Aftermath  The last concentration camp, at Miranda de Ebro, was closed in 1947. By the early 1950s the parties and trade unions made illegal by the Francoist State had been decimated by the Francoist police, and the Spanish maquis had ceased to exist as an organized resistance. Nevertheless, new forms of opposition started like the unrest in the universities and strikes in Barcelona, Madrid and Vizcaya. The 1960s saw the start of the labour strikes led by the illegal union trade Workers' Commissions (Comisiones Obreras), linked to the Communist Party and the protest in the universities continued to grow. Finally, with Franco's death in 1975, the Spanish transition to democracy commenced and in 1978 the Spanish Constitution of 1978 was approved. After Franco's death, the Spanish government approved the Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law (Ley de Amnistia de 1977) which granted a pardon for all political crimes committed by the supporters of the Francoist State (including the White Terror) and by the democratic opposition. Nevertheless, in October 2008 a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzón, of the National Court of Spain authorized, for the first time, an investigation into the disappearance and assassination of 114,000 victims of the Francoist State between 1936 and 1952.\\"At Last, Spain Faces Up to Franco's Guilt\\" TIME This investigation proceeded on the basis of the notion that this mass-murder constituted a crime against humanity which cannot be subject to any amnesty or statute of limitations. As a result, in May 2010, Mr. Garzón was accused of violating the terms of the general amnesty and his powers as a jurist have been suspended pending further investigation. In September 2010, the Argentine justice reopened a probe into crimes committed during the Spanish Civil War and during Franco's reign. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Council of Europe and United Nations have asked the Spanish government to investigate the crimes of Franco's reign.

L. M. Burns, UNTSO, Moshe Sharett, Israeli Prime Minister, General Vagn Bennike, UNTSO. 1954 Vagn Bennike (6 January 1888 – 30 November 1970) was an army engineer and demolitions expert. During the occupation of Denmark during World War II he worked in the Danish resistance movement in Jutland, where he was attached to the army's illegal tasks unit. In the summer of 1944 he took charge of resistance operations in Jutland, and was at times criticized by other resistance groups for the priority in operations he gave to his loyalty to the army. On 28 April 1945, with the liberation of Denmark, he was promoted to Major General, and spent the next 8 years as Inspector General of Engineers. He was subsequently appointed in 1953 to succeed William E.Riley as the UN overseer in charge of monitoring the truce lines between Israel and her Arab neighbours, becoming Chief of Staff of UNTSO, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, a post in which he served for the period between June 1953 and August 1954. One of his first decisions, in September 1953, was to overrule his predecessor Riley's go-ahead to Israel for work on the proposed hydro-electric project from B'not Yaakov Bridge to Lake Kinneret, which ran through part of the demilitarized zone. Vagn Bennike suspended the work until multilateral negotiations could settle the dispute.

The character first appeared on-screen on 16 September 2007. He appeared as a regular character for two years before departing on 11 December 2009 after being imprisoned for the murder of Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier). He returned on 28 May 2010 after managing to break out of prison with the help of his cellmate Robbie Sloan (James Fleet), whom Tony later betrayed by shooting him dead. The character departed once again on 9 June 2010 after being killed off at the conclusion of his storyline. He was a local businessman, disliked by many of Weatherfield's residents for his ruthlessness. His storylines revolved around his business deals, his relationships with Carla Connor and Maria Connor, and the murder of Liam Connor. Tony was named \\"Bad Boy\\" of 2009 at the All About Soap Bubble awards, and \\"Villain of the Year\\" at The British Soap Awards 2009. Storylines Backstory Prior to arriving in Weatherfield, Tony was born in Scotland in 1971, followed by his younger brother Patrick. His father had a heart attack aged 39. Tony, however, had witnessed this, but didn't phone an ambulance as he felt his mother didn't need his father. His grandfather had died aged 42 from a heart attack. In 1998, Tony married Lindsay (Susie Amy), who later had an affair with his brother, Patrick. Tony was a womaniser and only cared about money and mostly himself. He had run a business known as \\"Gordons Catalogues\\", and was also a property developer. In 2006, Tony and Lindsay divorced although she thought that he would eventually come back to her. 2007–2010 Tony arrives in Coronation Street in September 2007 as the owner of a clothing firm, giving a contract to Carla Connor (Alison King) and Liam Connor's (Rob James-Collier) lingerie factory Underworld. He was unpopular with local residents for commissioning a new housing development in the area, destroying a bat roost in the process, much to the anger of bat enthusiast Roy Cropper (David Neilson). Planning to expand the Underworld factory, Tony attempts to convince shopkeeper Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) and mechanic Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) to sell their properties to him. When Kevin refuses, Tony enlists his friend Jimmy Dockerson (Robert Beck) to sabotage his business and persuades Kevin's daughter, Rosie Webster, to give him the garage accounts. He also bullies elderly resident Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope) out of his home, wanting to redevelop the site. Tony begins a relationship with Carla, unaware she has romantic feelings for Liam. She breaks up with him in order to prove her feelings to Liam, but they later reconcile, becoming engaged. However, Rosie is aware of Carla and Liam's feelings for each other and tries to seduce Tony, but he makes it clear that he is not interested; so she shows him footage of Carla and Liam kissing the morning after their one-night stand. In revenge, he hires Jimmy as a hitman to kill Liam, running him over on Tony's stag night. A distraught Carla briefly leaves the country but marries Tony upon her return. Upon discovery of Carla's affair with Liam, his widow Maria (Samia Ghadie) begins to suspect Tony's involvement in his death. She confides in Jed Stone, who threatens to go to the police. Tony strangles Jed and initially believes him to be dead. He plans to dispose of his body, initially concealing his body inside a clothing container in Underworld, but is shocked to discover that Jed is in fact, still alive when the staff return and hear him shouting for help. He offers him a new flat in Wigan and £3,000 to leave the area and keep his secret. Maria begins a vendetta against Tony but he attempts to depict Maria as mentally unstable, raising Carla's suspicions in the process. When Carla eventually confronts Tony and demands the truth, she tells Tony that she loved Liam more than him, and Tony admits to having him killed. Carla escapes and flees to Los Angeles. Tony has a short-lived relationship with hairdresser Natasha Blakeman (Rachel Leskovac). Maria begins to soften towards Tony when she finds him at Liam's grave. They become friends, and Tony supports her during her pregnancy and delivers her son, who she names Liam Anthony; his forename in honour of his late father and middle name as a tribute to Tony. Liam's parents disapprove of the developing relationship, leading Tony to threaten that if they do not leave Maria alone, they will never see their grandson again. Eventually, the relationship becomes romantic and Maria and Tony become engaged. Carla returns to Weatherfield, and instructs Tony to sell his shares in Underworld to her and leave the country; or she will tell the police what he did. Tony hires Jimmy to kill her but changes his mind at the last moment. Carla escapes from Jimmy by knocking him unconscious but Tony makes her think she has murdered him, leading them to call a temporary truce. Carla then leaves the country again. While Maria visits her parents in Cyprus, Tony suffers a heart attack. He is taken to hospital by Roy, with whom he had previously clashed over the new housing development and confesses Liam's murder to him. He tries to buy Roy's silence but it doesn't work so he begins threatening him. Roy and his wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) report him to the police and Roy decides to go bat spotting at the canal. When Maria comes looking for answers, Hayley tells her everything, unaware Tony is hiding behind the café counter with a knife. This upsets Tony even more and he goes to the canal and tries to kill Roy, but Tony's phone rings alerting Roy, so he pushes Roy in the water but has a change of heart, rescues him and confesses everything to the police. On 11 December 2009, Carla visits Tony in prison where he admits that Jimmy is still alive. He asks her if she thinks Maria will forgive him and she tells him that she never would and that he would be going to hell on his own, before leaving. Tony reappears on 28 May 2010, as he plots his escape from prison with the help of cellmate Robbie Sloan (James Fleet). Tony feigns a heart attack after initiating a riot at the prison and is quickly taken to hospital by ambulance. Robbie runs the ambulance off the road and frees Tony and they head for Weatherfield. Together, they plan to take Carla and Hayley prisoner in the factory. Robbie tricks Carla into entering the factory with him alone, holds her at gunpoint and then leaves her tied to a chair and gagged with duct tape while he lures Hayley to the factory too. Tony appears, taking the tape off Carla's mouth allowing her to speak, announces his intention to kill them, double-crosses Robbie by revealing that he never intended to pay him the full amount that he promised, and after tricking Robbie into giving him his gun; shoots him dead. Maria gets caught in the siege after she goes into the factory and Tony holds her prisoner too. However, he lets her go and she goes to the pub and tells everyone that Tony is holding Carla and Hayley hostage. Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly), Gary Windass (Mikey North) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), amongst others, arrive outside the factory to try and help. Becky attempts to break the door down with a large pole. Tony later releases Hayley after Carla pleads with him, pushing her out of the door and causing her to fall over before setting fire to Underworld, after dousing the building with petrol, determined that he and Carla would die together. However, Carla manages to untie herself and, after a violent struggle, manages to escape, shooting Tony in the process. Tony walks into view, looks out of the open factory doors at the crowd watching from the street and then deliberately walks back into the fire. The factory explodes and Tony is killed. His and Robbie's bodies are removed from the building the following day. Character creation and casting In August 2007, it was announced that actor Gray O'Brien had been cast as Tony, with The Mirror's Brian Roberts heralding him as the new Coronation Street \\"heartthrob\\". O'Brien stated of his casting: \\"I'm delighted to be joining the cast of Corrie. Tony is a great character and I hope I'll be well received by the viewers. I've had a great time [on River City], but I'm looking forward to the new challenge.\\" In June 2009, it was reported O'Brien had been asked by producers to return to the show at a later date to complete Tony's storyline. Tony's initial exit aired in November 2009 and O'Brien performed in pantomime before resuming filming in Spring 2010 for the conclusion to the story, which involved the character taking several others hostage in a siege at the factory, before killing himself in an explosion. Character development In an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy, O'Brien described the dynamics behind his character ahead of the murder storyline, stating: \\"He does have boundaries - and the boundaries are that he won't be told 'no'. Anything up to that point is good enough. I don't think he's a murderous person. Tony killing Liam is just circumstances. He's come from nothing and has worked his way up. He's a respected businessman and he thinks it's all about fairness - you play with the sword, you die by the sword. He truly believes that everyone has a price. Up until this point, that's his game. His ambition is that he wants to retire in his mid 40s with several million in the bank. But now, something's come up to stop all that- Liam.\\" When interviewed by BBC News O' Brien spoke of the feasible length that his bad-boy character could remain on the show: \\"Coming in to play the Coronation Street villain has a life span, so I was aware of that. I knew he was going to be villainous, but I think it was all based on audience reaction that they liked him and the writers just went with it. So it's been a really organic process, I don't think I expected this to happen, quite as it has happened. I've got great faith in the writers at Coronation Street and entrust that they'll keep the momentum with the character going. He's a great character to play and he's popular so I do trust whichever way it ends will be the correct ending.\\" ITV publicity describe him as liking having power and making a lot of money but hating the competition that goes with it. Reception In March 2009, at the All About Soap Bubble awards, the character won the trophy for 'Bad Boy'. Two months later at the British Soap Awards Gray won 'Villain of the Year'. Tony, who is a fan of Celtic, dislikes their rivals Rangers. In one episode he remarks: \\"I could no more fancy Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) than I could support Glasgow Rangers\\". Supporters of Rangers took offence to this remark and flooded the ITV switchboard with calls of protest as they thought the remark was a retaliation for the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots involving Rangers fans. Ironically, it was revealed that his brother has a season ticket for the club. He also once said he was a modern Robert the Bruce - fighting for his honour in the street and the business world. The Scottish Tourist Board claimed that this remark lead to a 4% increase in the historical figure from tourists. Gareth McLean of the Radio Times has described Tony as \\"the sort of man who would steal your teeth and come back for your gums\\" and commented that his friendship with Maria Connor softened his character. In an advance press screening of the Liam Connor murder episodes, soaps editor for Digital Spy Kris Green applauded Gray O' Brien for his portrayal of Tony by saying that both he and co-star Alison King \\"steal the show.\\" References External links * Tony Gordon at ITV Soaps Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional Scottish people Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Male villains Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Fictional people from Glasgow Category:Television characters introduced in 2007 Category:Fictional prison escapees Category:Fictional suicides Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Tony Gordon"},{"id":"13109359","text":"Rennerod is a Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") in the district , in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

Unlike most leagues that were dormant for years in between playing, the KITTY was much the same from 1903 to 1955, through its inactive years. Clifton C. Gosnell was league president in 1906, after which the league stopped playing, and was president in 1910–1911 when play resumed. Then Dr. Frank H. Bassett was league president 1912–1914, 1916, 1922–1924, and 1935–1937, through the active times and the inactive. Hopkinsville, Kentucky was represented for 28 of the 31 active seasons of the KITTY League, while Paducah, Kentucky made it for 23. League name revived In 2004, the league was reincarnated as a summer collegiate league called the KIT League. Several of the names of the old Kitty League teams, such as the Fulton Railroaders, Owensboro Oilers, and Union City Greyhounds, were brought back. Although the league maintains a name similar to the previous league, the new KIT League is missing any teams from Illinois and has two teams from Missouri.

He was managing director and chief designer of Ogle Design from 1962 until 1999. He oversaw design of the Bush Radio TR130 radio, the Raleigh Chopper, the Bond Bug, the Reliant Scimitar GTE, the Anadol A1 (FW5), a series of lorry cabs for Leyland, and the Marble Run toy (sold by Kiddicraft). Early life He was born in Vienna in 1926, but went to school in Brno. The family left Czechoslovakia in 1939, and Karen reached England in 1942. He studied aeronautical engineering at Loughborough College. Career He worked for Hunting Percival, makers of the Proctor and the Provost trainer, then the Air Registration Board. He enrolled at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. He joined the Ford design studio in 1955. He then worked briefly for David Ogle before moving to Hotpoint and to Phillips where he set up their studio for white goods. In 1962, Karen was invited to take charge of Ogle Design following the death of David Ogle in a car accident. He was managing director and chief designer until 1999. While there, he designed Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder for the Star Wars films; the Landspeeder was built around the chassis of a Bond Bug. In 1969 Ogle Design under Tom Karen was given the task to design a modern caravan for the recently acquired Eccles brand of caravans for CI (Caravans International) by Sam Alper of Sprite Caravans. The Eccles Amethyst was launched in 1969 at The Caravan and Camping Exhibition. Seen as ‘The Caravan if the Future’ with blown plastic exterior panels and each year the interior would be tweaked to keep the look fresh and modern. Sadly the design was slightly ahead of its time and Eccles reverted to a more traditional look by 1975 which became one of the best selling caravans in Britain at that time. Honours In 2001, Karen received an honorary degree from Loughborough University. In 2018, Karen was awarded an OBE in the 2019 New Year Honours for his services to design. Karen on fastbacks In March 1969, shortly after the launch of the Reliant Scimitar GTE which he had designed, and of the Ford Capri (which he did not design), Karen had the opportunity to give his opinion on fastback designs. He claimed to be \\"baffled\\" by \\"the case for fastbacks\\" because he thought there was \\"nothing good to be said for them except that some people think they look alright\\". \\"Aerodynamically they're lousy, headroom in the back is lousy, for visibility they're lousy, with a lot of glass they're lousy, from a weight point of view, and they give no boot access\\". Book In 2010 Karen published a book, Ogle & The Bug. Personal life Karen lives in Cambridge.

The park was privately owned. It was formerly known as \\"Cairns Wildlife Safari Reserve\\", \\"Mareeba Wild Animal Park\\" and \\"Out of Africa Reserve\\". After being purchased by a Sydney lawyer, the zoo was renamed \\"Shambala Animal Kingdom\\". The zoo was closed in April 2013 citing financial reasons. The park maintained a collection of both exotic and native animals. Most exotic animals were transferred to Indonesian wildlife parks. History Cairns Wildlife Safari Kuranda Highway entrance sign The zoo was originally opened by David Gill in 2003 (who owns South Lakes Safari Zoo in England) as the Mareeba Wild Animal Park. It was closed by involuntary liquidation in 2004 after delays in obtaining permits to move animals from Tipperary Station in the Northern Territory and David Gill returned to England. Zoo consultants were hired by the zoos administrators. In September 2006 Udo and Jenny Jattke purchased the zoo and spent $100,000 upgrading the facility. It re-opened in September 2006 as Cairns Wildlife Safari Reserve. Many of the volunteers were offered keeper positions by the new owners.. The zoo was sold in 2012 and changed its name from Cairns Wildlife Safari Reserve to Shambala Animal Kingdom. The zoo closed in 2013 after a number of failed attempts to sell as a zoo and subsequently the land and animals were sold separately. Main attractions The park maintained a large lion pride, primates, and rhinoceros among other animals. It had a number of behind the scenes encounters and tours.

In 2007, the park negotiated with Sea World in Gold Coast, Queensland to populate Sea World's new hippo exhibit. In 2008 the zoo started its Sumatran tiger breeding program in line with recommendations from the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA). The zoo's resident male tiger and a female on loan from Perth were paired together. In 2009 the female gave birth to a cub on 13 December, the cub died only 17 days later from severe gastroenteritis. In March 2009 the park welcomed two Asian small-clawed otter's from UnderWater World at Mooloolaba. In November 2009 the park was granted Full Institutional membership by the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA). It is one of only three zoo's in Queensland to obtain ZAA accreditation.http://www.arazpa.org.au/ARAZPA-Institutional- Members/default.aspx Since 2012 this membership has been cancelled by the Zoo Aquarium Association. In March 2010 the zoos only siamang was joined by two males from Melbourne Zoo. Incidents In September 2006 an adult male African lion escaped its enclosure through a break in the fence. Tim Husband, the zoo curator at the time, secured the animal in a holding area until vets arrived to tranquillise it and return it to its enclosure. In May 2010 it surfaced that staff at the zoo were going without pay and had been on pay cuts for around six weeks to ensure the animals did not go hungry. Staff complained to a local newspaper about the issues. In March 2012 Shambala Animal Kingdom was removed as a member from the Zoo Aquarium Association for unknown reasons.

History  Faith Methodist Church started in 1966 as a Methodist Chapel to serve the residents of Queenstown. Before the church building was completed, worship services were conducted in the open air and later in a temporary shed. In 1967, the founding pastor of Faith Methodist Church, Rev T.C Nga and his team saw to the completion of the church building, which they share with their sister Chinese Methodist Church. The church was named Faith Methodist Church in honour of God’s faithfulness in the entire project and in memory of Faith Goh, the only daughter of Dr Goh and Mrs Goh Kok Kee, who were gracious donors to the church building fund. In time, Faith's membership grew and the church facilities were inadequate to meet the needs of the congregation. Hence, the church building was redeveloped from 2002 to 2003. Today, the church building houses a 1000-seat sanctuary, 800-seat worship hall, two levels of parking, as well as a kindergarten, playground, library and a columbarium. The building is also equipped with lifts and ramps to cater to seniors who are mobility- challenged. From 38 attendees when it first started, Faith’s congregation has grown to some 2,500 today. Faith has been committed to community service and missions. It has set up Lakeside Family Centre, Jurong Preaching Point (now Agape Methodist Church) and FaithActs community service agency, and is actively involved in international ministry.

During his career, he made over 300 appearances in the Football League and won 2 caps for the Republic of Ireland. He began his career as an apprentice with Blackpool and went on to break into the first-team before joining First Division side Leeds United in 1979 for a fee of £100,000. He spent two seasons with Leeds before moving to Bolton Wanderers in 1981. He later played for Derby County, Mansfield Town and Cardiff City before retiring due to a severe knee injury. Club career Blackpool Born in Hammersmith in London, Chandler had represented the West London schoolboys team when he was spotted by Dave Johnston, son of former England international Harry Johnston, who was working as a teacher at Chandler's school. His teacher recommended him to Blackpool, who offered him a spot as an apprentice before eventually handing him his first professional contract in August 1976. He made his professional debut in September 1977 in a match against Blackburn Rovers. His performances for the Tangerines saw him selected to represent the Republic of Ireland under-21 side during the 1979–80 season and his Blackpool manager Stan Ternent informed Chandler that a number of clubs had traveled to watch him play in the match. Following the match, Chandler was approached by Dave Blakey, who was working as a scout for Leeds United, and was told about the Yorkshire-based club's interest in signing him. Leeds United He traveled to Leeds several days later, in September 1979, to sign for the club for a fee of £100,000. Chandler had originally been told by manager Jimmy Adamson that he was regarded as \\"one for the future\\" at the club, but just two weeks after signing for the Whites, he was named in the matchday squad as a substitute in a match against Manchester City on 29 September 1979. During the match, Paul Madeley suffered a concussion and was unable to continue. Chandler was introduced as a substitute, making his debut for the club during a 2–1 defeat. After a second appearance as a substitute in a 2–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, Chandler was handed his first start for the club in a 2–1 victory over Southampton. He made 17 appearances during his first season and scored twice, in matches against Tottenham Hostpur and West Bromwich Albion. The following season, Adamson was replaced as manager by Allan Clarke. Chandler had injured his ankle just prior to Clarke's arrival, which kept him out for six weeks after the new manager's installment. Upon his return, Chandler was put straight into the first-team due to an injury to Arthur Graham, playing in a 2–1 defeat to Nottingham Forest on 22 October 1980. His lack of playing time meant he was severely short of match fitness and he struggled to complete the 90 minutes. He was dropped from the squad by Clarke for the following game and went to discuss his situation at the club with him, but Clarke told him, \\"When you've done what I've done in the game come back and see me. Until then turn around and get out!\\". His relationship with Clarke quickly deteriorated and the pair rarely spoke. Out of contract at the end of the season, Chandler only appeared sporadically for the club for the remainder of the year. He was not offered a new deal at Elland Road by Clarke, but remained with the club's reserve side at the start of the 1981–82 season. Later career Chandler subsequently joined Bolton Wanderers in October 1981, becoming a first-team regular as the Trotters suffered relegation from the Second Division during his second season with the club. He thrived under manager John McGovern, who told Chandler that he was \\"the best player at the club\\". Between 1983 and 1985 Chandler scored 37 league goals, and finished as the club's second highest scorer in his final two seasons, behind Tony Caldwell. His form led Derby County to pay £38,000 to sign him in 1985 but, after two unsettled years at the Baseball Ground and a brief loan spell with Mansfield Town, he was persuaded to return to Bolton by manager Phil Neal for £20,000. Bolton had been relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time in their history but went on to win promotion at the first attempt after finishing third during the 1987–88 season. However, Chandler played little part in the success, having suffered a serious knee injury after falling awkwardly whilst jumping to head a ball in only his fourth game of the season, a League Cup tie against Wigan Athletic. Although he was expected to miss the remainder of the season, he did return to make one appearance as a substitute in a match against Colchester United at the end of the season. The following season, Chandler again suffered injury trouble and struggled to return to the same level he was playing at prior to his injury, later stating that he was \\"never the same player after that\\". He argued frequently with manager Neal which, along with his injuries, restricted his appearances; however, he did feature in the club's Associate Members Cup success, scoring a goal in a 4–1 win over Torquay United in the final. He joined Cardiff City in November 1989 for a fee of £15,000 but, after appearing in just 28 games for the Bluebirds, he was forced to retire due to a knee injury in December 1990. International career Eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland via his parentage, Chandler won one cap for the under-21 side in 1979. He made his debut for the senior side on 29 September 1979 as a substitute before being handed his first start one month later on 29 October, playing the first half of a 3–2 defeat to the United States before being replaced by Paddy Mulligan. Later life Following his retirement from football, Chandler worked in a number of different professions including advertising and as a double glazing salesman. He later worked in a care home for five years and obtained a diploma in counselling in his spare time. After working alongside youth offenders in Preston, he became a pupil welfare officer in Blackpool.

Biography Peggy Webb has born and raised on a farm in Lee County, Mississippi. As a child she would often sit in the hayloft and write down her stories. Her first publication came through her husband, the owner of a water well contracting business. As the secretary of the state trade organization, he was responsible for publishing a newsletter. Webb assisted him with the newsletter, and, to fill space, began a humor column. This was picked up in the late 1960s by two trade magazines, The Water Well Journal and Ground Water Age. Over two hundred of her columns were published. In 1984, while writing her master's thesis at the University of Mississippi, Webb wrote her first romance novel. Her first novel was rejected because publishers thought it had too much comedy and not enough romance. Bantam Books purchased her second novel, Taming Maggie, and, in order to complete the revisions Bantam required, Webb had to postpone the defense of her thesis. She did eventually receive her M.A. in fine arts, the same summer that her first novel was released. Taming Maggie, reached number one on the Waldenbooks bestseller list, earning her their award for Bestselling New Romance Author. With its success, Bantam rethought their rejection of Webb's first novel. After she made changes to further emphasize the romance, Bantam published the book as Birds of a Feather. This novel reached number two on the romance bestseller list, and is considered to be the first true comedic romance. Webb currently writes for Harlequin and Silhouette. Her novels for them are published in approximately 17 languages. She is a five-time nominee for Romantic Times Reviewer's Choice Awards. Webb currently lives outside Tupelo, Mississippi.

He was best known for his achievements in 1986 when he was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. Background Bred by Franklin Groves' North Ridge Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, Capote was out of the mare Too Bald, a daughter of the 1960 American Champion Older Male Horse, Bald Eagle. He was sired by the 1977 U.S. Triple Crown champion, Seattle Slew. Trainer D. Wayne Lukas acquired Capote for $800,000 at the 1985 Keeneland July yearling sale for the partnership of Barry A. Beal, Lloyd R. French, Jr. and prominent horseman Eugene V. Klein. Racing career At age two in 1986, Capote made four starts, winning three times. He won the Grade I Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita Park, then on the same track, he competed in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile against a field that included Gulch, winner of that year's Grade I Belmont Futurity and Hopeful Stakes; Polish Navy, who had won the Grade I Champagne and Cowdin Stakes; future American Horse of the Year and Hall of Famer Alysheba; and Bet Twice, who went on to win the 1987 Belmont Stakes. Ridden by Laffit Pincay, Jr., Capote took the lead early in the race and held it throughout to win by 1¼ lengths. Capote's performances in 1986 earned him U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt honors, and he went into the 1987 racing season as the winterbook favorite for the 1987 Kentucky Derby. However, the colt's three- year-old campaign was not a success. Out of six starts, his best finish was a third. Capote also finished sixteenth in a seventeen-horse field in the Kentucky Derby. Stud record Retired to stud duty, from 1989 through to the end of 1991, Capote stood at the famed Calumet Farm, which had purchased a fifty percent interest in him. The bankruptcy of Calumet resulted in Morven Stud of Charlottesville, Virginia, eventually acquiring the fifty percent share as an equal partner with Capote's original owners. His owners then moved him to Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, Kentucky. Before being pensioned in November 2003 as a result of neurological problems, Capote was the sire of 21 graded stakes winners among 62 stakes winners. His progeny included Grade I winners Capote Belle, Matty G., Agincourt, and: * Basim - won the 1992 Anglesey Stakes and was voted Ireland's 2-year-old Champion; * Boston Harbor - in 1996 he duplicated Capote's success, winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and earning U.S. Champion 2-year-old honors; * Surfing Home - multiple Grade I winner, 1995 Horse of the Year in South Africa.

In recognition of his service, in 1866, he was appointed to the brevet rank of brigadier general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865. He was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served in the United States Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers, which at times was both a part of and separate from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. After graduating from West Point as a second lieutenant in the Class of 1842, he served in the Mexican–American War, building fortifications to protect American supply lines in the advance on Mexico City. After the end of the war, he was stationed in Washington, D.C., where he served as architect for the Scott Building and Quarters Buildings at the U.S. Soldiers' Home and took over the completion of the Smithsonian Institution Building after dissatisfaction with the pace of the first architect caused him to be dismissed. After the completion of the Smithsonian in 1855, he traveled to New England, where he supervised the rebuilding of the Minot's Ledge Lighthouse, a project widely considered to be one of the most difficult to be attempted by the U.S. Government up to that time. During the American Civil War, he served as an advisor to the Engineering Brigade of the Army of the Potomac and became chief engineer of the defenses of Washington, D.C. Following the conclusion of hostilities, he served as chief engineer of the Military Division of the Pacific, making him the head engineer for every military construction project on the West Coast. In later years, he persuaded the U.S. government to acquire Pearl Harbor from the Kingdom of Hawaii and supervised numerous irrigation and land reclamation projects in California's central valley. He died on December 15, 1878, in San Francisco, California. Pre-Civil War Alexander was born in Nicholas County, Kentucky,Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607–1896. \\"Barton Stone Alexander\\", Chicago: Marquis Who's Who. 1963. He entered West Point in the fall of 1838. Alexander was a diligent student, and corrected an entering weakness in mathematics to graduate seventh of 56 cadets in the Class of 1842. Between 1843 and 1848, he worked on several fortification projects along the East Coast of the United States, including Forts Pulaski, Jackson, and the defenses of New York City.Introduction to Central Valley Irrigation projects, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. , p. 19. In 1848, he participated in the Mexican–American War as a second lieutenant of engineers, helping build defenses to protect American supply lines as Winfield Scott's army advanced on Mexico City. After the conclusion of the war, now-First Lieutenant Alexander returned to West Point for a four-year assignment as Treasurer and Superintending Engineer for the Cadets' Barracks and Mess Hall.Field, Cynthia R. \\"Director's Column: The Second Architect of the Smithsonian Building.\\" Smithsonian Preservation Quarterly, Fall 1994 edition. The Smithsonian, Washington, D.C. In 1852, Alexander was assigned to Washington, D.C., where he assisted in the design and construction of several government buildings. The first of these was the Scott Building of the U.S. Soldiers' Home, now known as the Armed Forces Retirement Home. The building was named for General Winfield Scott, who donated $100,000 for the establishment of the Soldiers' Home in 1851. It served as the central focus of the complex, and still stands today.History of the Soldiers' Home and adjacent Lincoln Cottage Accessed September 5, 2007 Constructed in the Romanesque Revival style, the Scott Building features a round-arched motif utilizing white Vermont marble.Poppeliers, John C. and Chambers, S. Allen. What Style Is It?: A Guide to American Architecture. John Wiley and Sons, 2003. p. 56 Most of Captain Alexander's contributions dealt with the interior structure of the Smithsonian \\"castle.\\" At the same time as his work on the Scott Building, Alexander was asked to take up the challenge of completing the Smithsonian Institution Building, the progress of which had bogged down under architect James Renwick, Jr. In August 1853, Alexander accepted, and by 1855, the Smithsonian Building was complete. During construction, Alexander slightly altered Renwick's original design by placing the Smithsonian's main lecture hall on the second floor. The change allowed for superior acoustics and a wider space than could be found on the first floor.Upper Main Hall diagram, The Smithsonian. Accessed September 5, 2007 To support the large lecture hall and the central core of the building, Alexander arranged for the installation of fireproof masonry- encased iron structural columns. These would prove their value on January 24, 1865, when a fire broke out on the roof above the lecture hall. The resulting blaze destroyed the hall and damaged much of the rest of the structure. Thanks to the fireproof columns, however, the Smithsonian building did not collapse.Scott, Pamela.

Minot's Ledge Lighthouse Minot's Ledge lighthouse in a storm. Following his work on the Smithsonian, but before the Scott Building finished construction, Alexander traveled to New England, where he was assigned to a project at the entrance of Boston harbor. That project, the rebuilding of Minot's Ledge Lighthouse, was widely considered to be one of the most difficult to be attempted by the U.S. Government up to that time.Kelley, Robert. Battling the Inland Sea: Floods, Public Policy, and the Sacramento Valley. University of California Press, 1998. p. 126. Designed by Brigadier General Joseph Totten, head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lighthouse was intended to replace a structure that had been destroyed in an 1851 storm. With multiple ships wrecking on the ledge annually, the need for a lighthouse was crucial.Boston Marine Society, Committee Report, November, 1838. Appointed superintendent of the lighthouse construction in April 1855, newly promoted Captain Alexander modified Totten's design in accordance with conditions at the site. Because the site of the lighthouse was continually awash, except at low tide and calm seas, the work of preparing the interlocking granite blocks and iron framework of the lighthouse was done at nearby Government Island, adjacent to Cohasset, Massachusetts.History of Minot's Ledge Lighthouse, Cohasset Chamber of Commerce. Accessed September 5, 2007 The work progressed slowly, hampered by the partially submerged nature of the site, violent storms that wracked the area, and the fact that preparatory work had to be done away from the building site. During construction, a particularly violent storm hit the construction site, sweeping away much of the iron framework intended to support the stone shell of the lighthouse. Captain Alexander was discouraged, reportedly saying, \\"If wrought iron won't stand it, I have my fears about a stone tower.\\"Minot's Ledge Lighthouse History. Accessed September 5, 2007. Those fears were allayed when news reached Alexander that the damage had been due to a ship striking the lighthouse, rather than from just the storm alone. Work recommenced on building the lighthouse, and the final stone was laid on June 29, 1860, five years after Alexander and his workmen first landed at the ledge. The final cost of about $300,000 made it one of the most expensive lighthouses in United States history. Civil War Following the completion of the Minot's Ledge Lighthouse project in 1860, the secession of South Carolina and the beginning of the American Civil War allowed Alexander to put his skills to military use for the first time since the Mexican-American War. On May 24, 1861, he was among several hundred engineers who marched into Virginia to begin building fortifications to protect Washington, D.C., which was located on the border between the Union state of Maryland and the Confederate state of Virginia.U.S., War Department, The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, (Washington, D.C.: The Government Printing Office, 1880-1901), Series I, Volume 2, Chapter 9, p. 38. In July 1861, the force that had marched into northern Virginia on May 24 found itself opposed by a large Confederate States Army force that had marched up from the south. In the haste to meet the Confederates in battle, Alexander found himself serving as an infantry officer and was assigned to the 1st Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia, under the command of Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler.Official Records, Series I, Volume 2, Chapter 9, p. 333. It was a situation common to the young Union Army, which found itself short of experienced officers. Many engineer officers building defenses south of Washington were assigned to a regiment or division during the First Battle of Bull Run. Alexander received a brevet to major in the regular army for his service during the battle.Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, Stanford University Press, 2001, , p. 100. Engineering Brigade Following the defeat at Bull Run, the Union Army retreated back to the defenses of Washington. Throughout the remainder of 1861, the newly named Army of the Potomac, under the direction of its new commander, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, expanded and improved the improvised defenses that had been built in the seven weeks between the occupation of Northern Virginia and the Battle of Bull Run. New regiments arrived in Washington daily, and were placed in camps in and around the city. Two of these new arrivals—the 15th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 50th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment—were designated \\"engineer regiments\\" and placed under the superintendence of Lt. Col. Alexander.History of the Topographical Engineers, Engineers in the Civil War section. Accessed September 5, 2007. Following a brief training period under Alexander, the two regiments were declared to be an \\"Engineering Brigade\\" and placed under the command of Brig. Gen. Daniel P. Woodbury. Woodbury's brigade was itself under the command of Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac. Alexander remained attached to the Engineering Brigade as an assistant.Official Records, Series I, Volume 5, Chapter 14, p. 24. Alexander continued in this role during the Engineering Brigade's deployment with the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign, several times performing ably under hostile fire. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel for his service at the Siege of Yorktown, as of May 4, 1862. Following the abandonment of the campaign and the return of the Army of the Potomac to northern Virginia, General Barnard, now chief engineer of defenses of Washington, D.C., requested Alexander serve as his aide-de-camp. Alexander accepted and served in that capacity throughout 1862.Official Records, Series I, Volume 19, Chapter 31 Part 2 (serial 28), p. 420 When the Topographical Engineers and the Army Corps of Engineers were merged on March 3, 1863, Alexander (whose permanent U.S. Army rank was captain until this time) was promoted to major, while retaining his brevet (honorary) rank of lieutenant colonel.U.S. War Department, General Order No. 79, March 31, 1863. September 5, 2007. The enormous complex of defenses that protected Washington, D.C., in 1865 made that city one of the most heavily defended locations in the world. In August 1863, as part of his duties as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named as a member of a board of military officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian board that he had created in 1862.Official Records, Series I, Volume 29, Chapter 41 Part 2 (serial 49), p. 443. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments of guns and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.Official Records, Series I, Volume 29, Chapter 41 Part 2, pp. 394-95, 443 Defenses of Washington, D.C. On June 1, 1864, General Barnard was named the chief engineer of the Armies in the Field by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.Official Records, Series I, Volume 36, Chapter 48 Part 3 (serial 69), p. 600 This move made Alexander the chief engineer for the defenses of Washington, filling the position vacated by Barnard's departure. It was a role he would take until well after the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865. The appointment was largely a caretaker role, as the final number of guns and forts had been established by the 1863 commission, and the Union Army's success in the field meant that no major force could threaten Washington. The only exception to this came in late July 1864, when Confederate forces under the command of Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early attacked Washington's defenses from the north during the Battle of Fort Stevens. Following the conclusion of the war, Alexander presided over the drawdown in U.S. Army forces in Washington and the gradual decommissioning of the forts surrounding the city. On May 9, 1865, Alexander was ordered to stop work maintaining and improving the forts surrounding Washington as part of cost-cutting measures.Official Records, Series I, Volume 46, Chapter 58 Part 3, (Serial 97), p. 1119 Alexander, not wishing to see Washington return to its defenseless pre-war state, recommended that some forts be continually maintained in order to preserve them for future needs.Official Records, Series I, Volume 46, Chapter 58 Part 3, (Serial 97) p. 1130 The recommendations were accepted, but Alexander's ability to follow through on them was limited by an August order to \\"not incur expenses for hired labor\\" and the inability of the chief engineer of the District of Washington to furnish the large numbers of enlisted men needed to continue the upkeep.Engineer Orders and Circulars, Orders, Issuances, 1811 – 1941, Records of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, Record Group 77, Archives I, National Archives and Records Administration A2379, B.S. Alexander to Richard Delafield, December 5, 1865; Letters Received, 1826-66 By January 1866, no funds were available even to keep Alexander's offices open, and on January 13, 1866, he declared, \\"...

Alexander to Richard Delafield, July 14, 1866, Letters Received, 1826-66. California years The irrigation and reclamation of the Central Valley of California was the focus of the Alexander Commission headed by Col. Alexander. On March 4, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Alexander for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general in the Regular Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p, 731. Following his closure of the offices of the defenses of Washington, D.C., he was briefly ordered to New England, where he supervised the renovation of various minor fortifications and river improvements in Maine. That posting came to an end on January 7, 1867, when he was ordered to the West Coast as the chief U.S. Army engineer in the region.Introduction, Corps of Engineers , p. 20. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on March 7, 1867. As chief engineer to the Military Division of the Pacific, he was the top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officer on the entire American Pacific Coast.Kelley, p. 127 Upon his arrival on the West Coast, he visited locations from Alaska to the Mexican border in order to analyze the work that would be needed. Between 1868 and 1870, he surveyed numerous California harbors and made engineering suggestions as required. One of these suggestions resulted in the construction of a 7,000-foot breakwater that made Long Beach harbor accessible to large amounts of shipping for the first time. In 1870, he suggested that landowners near Colusa, California, construct levees to contain the Sacramento River within a single channel. The plan would reclaim swampland and control the river's annual floods, making large-scale farming possible. The plan was eagerly seized upon by local residents.Kelley, p. 128 In the spring of 1872, Col. Alexander and Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield, commander of the Military Division of the Pacific, sailed from San Francisco, California, to Honolulu in the then-independent Kingdom of Hawaii on a secret mission to evaluate Hawaii's ports in terms of defensive capabilities and commercial facilities. Fellow civil war veteran Alfred S. Hartwell was their host, who was on the kingdom's supreme court at the time. They recognized the great potential of Pearl Harbor as a \\"harbor of refuge in time of war,\\" and on May 8, 1873, recommended that the War Department acquire the harbor.Historical Background of PACAF , courtesy U.S. Defense Department. Accessed September 5, 2007. Their suggestion resulted in the signing of the reciprocity Treaty of 1875 between the United States and Hawaii. As part of the treaty, Hawaii ceded the area of Pearl Harbor to the United States in return for trade agreements benefiting Hawaiian sugar planters. The treaty was signed on September 8, 1876, helping pave the way for eventual American annexation of the Kingdom.Pearl Harbor: Expansion Westward Accessed September 5, 2007. Irrigation and land reclamation Following his return to California, Col. Alexander was appointed president of a board appointed by the U.S. Congress to study the potential of irrigating the San Joaquin Valley, Tulare Valley, and Sacramento Valley.War Department, Adjutant-General's Office, Special Orders No. 73, April 9, 1873. Washington, D.C. The board, which became known as the Alexander Commission, conducted a survey of the California Central Valley throughout the summer and fall of 1873. The Commission's report declared that large-scale irrigation was possible and that much land could be reclaimed from the swamps around the Sacramento River. The report was not initially acted upon, but was the first professional survey of the valley and set the stage for further development. In 1874 and 1875, Alexander was assigned to a board examining the problem of keeping the Mississippi River Delta from silting up and becoming an impediment to ship traffic. During the course of his tenure on the board, he traveled to Europe in order to examine European solutions to the problem. At the end of 1875, Alexander was asked by the state government of California to examine a proposed irrigation project in the San Joaquin Valley. Busy with other projects, Alexander appointed an associate, William Hammond Hall, to head the project.

Biography Family background Schomberg was the second son of Captain Sir Alexander Schomberg and Mary Susannah Arabella, the only child of the Reverend Henry Chalmers, and niece of Sir Edmund Aleyn. His brother was Captain Sir Charles Marsh Schomberg. Early naval career He entered the Navy in April 1785 as a first-class volunteer aboard , the official yacht of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, commanded by his father in the Irish Sea. He later served as a midshipman aboard , under the command of Captain Lambert Brabazon, for about 2½ years, before joining the 98-gun , flagship of Sir Richard Bickerton at Plymouth, late in 1789. He went on to serve aboard the frigate , Captain Edmund Dodd, attached to the Channel Fleet, and then in the 50-gun , flagship of Sir John Laforey on the West Indies Station. There he was promoted to lieutenant on 26 July 1793, to serve aboard the sloop , Captain Lord Henry Paulet, and then the frigate , Captain William Hancock Kelly. In Solebay he commanded 50 men of the Naval Brigade, part of the forces commanded by Sir Charles Grey, during the operations against Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Guadeloupe in 1794. He also took part in the unsuccessful attempt recapture Guadeloupe, which had been unexpectedly and successfully re-taken by French Republican forces under Victor Hugues. Schomberg served for a short time in , the flagship of Sir John Jervis. However, at the end of the year, having suffered a severe attack of yellow fever, he was sent home to recuperate. On 22 June 1795 Schomberg was appointed to the 56-gun , Captain Henry Trollope, stationed in the North Sea. As an experiment, she was armed with only carronades, twenty-eight 32-pounders on the upper deck and twenty-eight 68-pounder carronades on the lower, giving her a distinct advantage in weight of metal against ships armed with standard 32- and 28-pounders in a close action. This was demonstrated on 15 July 1796 when Glatton fought a French squadron of four frigates, two ship-corvettes, a large brig-corvette and an armed cutter off the coast of Flanders. In a short but violent confrontation Glatton attacked the French squadron just before nightfall, her heavy guns doing great damage to the enemy, though she was severely cut up in her sails, rigging and masts. After spending the night making repairs, Glatton sought out the enemy, but they declined a renewal of the engagement, and sailed for Flushing. The French ships were believed to be the razee Brutus, and the frigates , Magicienne and Républicaine. It was reported that they had suffered considerable damage, and one sank in the harbour. During the action, Schomberg, commanding the lower deck, found that he did not have enough men to fight all the guns on both sides, so resorted to forming them into gangs, who loaded and ran the guns out, then moved on to the next gun, while two men pointed and fired. Schomberg was commended for his conduct, and on 28 July was appointed first lieutenant of the frigate . Unfortunately, the ship was destroyed by an explosion while moored at Plymouth Dock while he was travelling to join her, and it was not until January 1796 that he received command of the 14-gun brig , in which he served on the coasts of Holland and Norway, at Newfoundland, off Cherbourg, and on the Guernsey and Jersey stations. He was promoted to commander on 2 April 1798, but remained in Rambler until 1 January 1801, when he was promoted to post-captain. Post- captain In 1804 he held temporary command of the 98-gun off Brest. He commanded the frigate from October 1806, and on 31 October 1807 he was appointed to command of the frigate Loire. In early 1808 Loire and the frigate , Captain John Ayscough, sailed to the seas around Greenland on fishery protection duties, venturing as far north as 77° 30' N. At the end of the same year, accompanied by and , he escorted a convoy of 168 transport ships, carrying 14,000 troops, from Falmouth to Corunna. He then co-operated with Spanish partisans on the coasts of Galicia, Asturias, and Biscay, brought 100 Russian prisoners-of-war from the Tagus to England, and on 5 February 1809 captured the French ship Hebe (which later served as ). Early in 1810 he transported a battalion of the 60th Regiment from England to Barbados; and during the siege of Guadeloupe, he commanded a squadron stationed to intercept enemy vessels. He returned to England with the French Captain-General Jean Augustin Ernouf and his suite on board, surviving a hurricane which sank two transports full of prisoners. He then proceeded to the coast of Norway, where he saved the sloop from an attack from eight Danish brigs. Until 1812 Schomberg was chiefly employed in command of a light squadron in the Baltic. He once escorted an outward-bound West India convoy as far as Madeira; and in December 1810 narrowly escaped disaster being in company with , shortly before she was wrecked. On 21 March 1812 he was appointed to command of , and on 13 August to the 74-gun . He took part in the blockade of Rochefort and L'Orient, and in 1814, with the 74-gun and 20-gun , transported troops from Bordeaux to Quebec, somehow managing to cram no less than 1,000 men on board each 74 in addition to their usual complements. York was paid off in August 1815. At the end of the war Schomberg made several suggestions to improve the victualling the seamen and marines, some of which were eventually adopted several years later. One of these was to substitute tea for half the usual ration of spirits. In 1818 he privately circulated a paper Naval Suggestions, outlining his ideas; and in 1832 published his Practical Hints on Building, Rigging, Arming, and Equipping His Majesty's Ships-of-War, &c.; Post-war career Schomberg remained unemployed until on 1 March 1829 he was appointed to the 74-gun . He commanded her in the Mediterranean until promoted to rear admiral on 22 July 1830. On 23 November 1841 he was promoted to vice admiral, and to admiral on 9 October 1849. Admiral Schomberg died at Bognor, Sussex, on 13 January 1850. Personal life Schomberg was twice married, firstly to Catherine Anna, only daughter of Stepney Rawson Stepney, of Durrow, Ireland, by whom he had one son, Herbert Schomberg, who became a naval officer and eventually attained the rank of rear admiral; and secondly on 1 October 1804, to Anne, the youngest daughter of Rear-Admiral Richard Smith of Poulton-cum- Seacombe, by whom he had two further sons; Charles Frederick Schomberg, who became a vice admiral, and George Augustus Schomberg who became an officer in the Royal Marine Artillery.

Background Tasso was bred by Gerald Robbins and Timothy Sams of Waldemar Farm, subsequently renamed Stonehedge Farm South. Out of the mare Ecstacism, Tasso was from the first crop of Fappiano, a son of the very influential Champion sire Mr. Prospector. Tasso's wins as a two-year-old helped make Fappiano the leading freshman sire of 1985. In the Fasig-Tipton Florida sales of 1984, Tasso was sold for $100,000 to Bertram Firestone, but Firestone was reportedly dissatisfied and returned the colt. Tasso was also offered at the Fasig-Tipton Saratoga sales, but his reserve price of $50,000 was not met. Tasso subsequently raced for Gerald Robbins and was trained by Neil Drysdale. Racing career Tasso raced seven times at age two in 1985, scoring five wins with one second and one third. After misbehaving in the post parade, he finished third in his first start on May 31, 1985 in a maiden special weight race at Hollywood Park in California. He returned nearly two months later with a win in a similar race, then followed up with a victory in a 1-mile allowance race at Del Mar racetrack. On September 11, he stepped up in class to enter the Grade I Del Mar Futurity, where he was ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr. to a close win over the filly Arewehavingfunyet. He was then shipped to Keeneland race track in Kentucky, where he first finished second in an allowance race and then won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes. For the most important race of the year for his age group, Tasso's owner had to pay a supplemental fee of $120,000 to enter the colt in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, which was raced that year at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York. Tasso was the third betting choice in a field of 13; Storm Cat was the favorite. In the early stages of the race, Storm Cat raced in third and then went to the lead around the far turn. Tasso was in eighth place down the backstretch then moved to the outside of the field and started to close ground, catching Storm Cat in the final stride to win by a nose. Tasso's performances earned him U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt honors for 1985. Racing at age three, Tasso again made seven starts, ending the season with two wins, two seconds, and two third- place finishes. He began his 3-year-old campaign with a three-length win in the Manassa Mauler Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack. He then finished second in the Gotham and fourth in the Wood Memorial, so his connections decided to bypass the Triple Crown series. Instead he was entered in the Withers Stakes, in which he finished second, and then the Jersey Derby, in which he finished third. After a short break, he returned with a win in the El Cajon Stakes at Del Mar. He finished the year with a third-place finish in the Yankee Valor Handicap. At age four, Tasso started nine times, winning two allowance races. The highlight of the year was a dead heat for second behind Ferdinand in the Grade I Hollywood Gold Cup. Stud career Retired to stud, Tasso met with only modest success. In 2000, he was moved to the Janadriyah Stud Farm near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, owned by Prince Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah. As of 2009, he was a pensioner at that farm.

Intuitively, a family of surfaces evolves under mean curvature flow if the normal component of the velocity of which a point on the surface moves is given by the mean curvature of the surface. For example, a round sphere evolves under mean curvature flow by shrinking inward uniformly (since the mean curvature vector of a sphere points inward). Except in special cases, the mean curvature flow develops singularities. Under the constraint that volume enclosed is constant, this is called surface tension flow. It is a parabolic partial differential equation, and can be interpreted as \\"smoothing\\". Existence and uniqueness The following was shown by Michael Gage and Richard S. Hamilton as an application of Hamilton's general existence theorem for parabolic geometric flows. Let M be a compact smooth manifold, let (M',g) be a complete smooth Riemannian manifold, and let f:M\\\\to M' be a smooth immersion. Then there is a positive number T, which could be infinite, and a map F:[0,T)\\\\times M\\\\to M' with the following properties: * F(0,\\\\cdot)=f * F(t,\\\\cdot):M\\\\to M' is a smooth immersion for any t\\\\in[0,T) * as t\\\\searrow 0, one has F(t,\\\\cdot)\\\\to f in C^\\\\infty * for any (t_0,p)\\\\in(0,T)\\\\times M, the derivative of the curve t\\\\mapsto F(t,p) at t_0 is equal to the mean curvature vector of F(t_0,\\\\cdot) at p. * if \\\\widetilde{F}:[0,\\\\widetilde{T})\\\\times M\\\\to M' is any other map with the four properties above, then T\\\\leq \\\\widetilde{T} and \\\\widetilde{F}(t,p)=F(t,p) for any (t,p)\\\\in [0,\\\\widetilde{T})\\\\times M. Necessarily, the restriction of F to (0,T)\\\\times M is C^\\\\infty. One refers to F as the (maximally extended) mean curvature flow with initial data f. Convergence theorems Following Hamilton's epochal 1982 work on the Ricci flow, in 1984 Gerhard Huisken employed the same methods for the mean curvature flow to produce the following analogous result: * If (M',g) is the Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}, where n\\\\geq 2 denotes the dimension of M, then T is necessarily finite. If the second fundamental form of the 'initial immersion' f is strictly positive, then the second fundamental form of the immersion F(t,\\\\cdot) is also strictly positive for every t\\\\in(0,T), and furthermore if one choose the function c:(0,T)\\\\to(0,\\\\infty) such that the volume of the Riemannian manifold (M,(c(t)F(t,\\\\cdot))^\\\\ast g_{\\\\text{Euc}}) is independent of t, then as t earrow T the immersions c(t)F(t,\\\\cdot):M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} smoothly converge to an immersion whose image in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} is a round sphere. Note that if n\\\\geq 2 and f:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} is a smooth hypersurface immersion whose second fundamental form is positive, then the Gauss map u:M\\\\to S^n is a diffeomorphism, and so one knows from the start that M is diffeomorphic to S^n and, from elementary differential topology, that all immersions considered above are embeddings. Gage and Hamilton extended Huisken's result to the case n=1. Matthew Grayson (1987) showed that if f:S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^2 is any smooth embedding, then the mean curvature flow with initial data f eventually consists exclusively of embeddings with strictly positive curvature, at which point Gage and Hamilton's result applies. In summary: * If f:S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^2 is a smooth embedding, then consider the mean curvature flow F:[0,T)\\\\times S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^2 with initial data f. Then F(t,\\\\cdot):S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^2 is a smooth embedding for every t\\\\in(0,T) and there exists t_0\\\\in(0,T) such that F(t,\\\\cdot):S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^2 has positive (extrinsic) curvature for every t\\\\in(t_0,T). If one selects the function c as in Huisken's result, then as t earrow T the embeddings c(t)F(t,\\\\cdot):S^1\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^2 converge smoothly to an embedding whose image is a round circle. Physical examples The most familiar example of mean curvature flow is in the evolution of soap films. A similar 2-dimensional phenomenon is oil drops on the surface of water, which evolve into disks (circular boundary). Mean curvature flow was originally proposed as a model for the formation of grain boundaries in the annealing of pure metal. Properties The mean curvature flow extremalizes surface area, and minimal surfaces are the critical points for the mean curvature flow; minima solve the isoperimetric problem. For manifolds embedded in a Kähler–Einstein manifold, if the surface is a Lagrangian submanifold, the mean curvature flow is of Lagrangian type, so the surface evolves within the class of Lagrangian submanifolds. Huisken's monotonicity formula gives a monotonicity property of the convolution of a time-reversed heat kernel with a surface undergoing the mean curvature flow. Related flows are: * Curve-shortening flow, the one- dimensional case of mean curvature flow * the surface tension flow * the Lagrangian mean curvature flow * the inverse mean curvature flow Mean curvature flow of a three-dimensional surface The differential equation for mean-curvature flow of a surface given by z=S(x,y) is given by :\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t} = 2D\\\\ H(x,y) \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)^2} with D being a constant relating the curvature and the speed of the surface normal, and the mean curvature being : \\\\begin{align} H(x,y) & = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{ \\\\left(1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)^2\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 S}{\\\\partial y^2} - 2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 S}{\\\\partial x \\\\partial y} + \\\\left(1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)^2\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 S}{\\\\partial x^2} }{\\\\left(1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)^2\\\\right)^{3/2}}. \\\\end{align} In the limits |\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x}\\\\ll 1 and |\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial y}\\\\ll 1 , so that the surface is nearly planar with its normal nearly parallel to the z axis, this reduces to a diffusion equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\ abla^2 S While the conventional diffusion equation is a linear parabolic partial differential equation and does not develop singularities (when run forward in time), mean curvature flow may develop singularities because it is a nonlinear parabolic equation. In general additional constraints need to be put on a surface to prevent singularities under mean curvature flows. Every smooth convex surface collapses to a point under the mean-curvature flow, without other singularities, and converges to the shape of a sphere as it does so. For surfaces of dimension two or more this is a theorem of Gerhard Huisken;. for the one-dimensional curve- shortening flow it is the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem. However, there exist embedded surfaces of two or more dimensions other than the sphere that stay self-similar as they contract to a point under the mean-curvature flow, including the Angenent torus.. Example: mean curvature flow of m-dimensional spheres A simple example of mean curvature flow is given by a family of concentric round hyperspheres in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}. The mean curvature of an m-dimensional sphere of radius R is H = m/R. Due to the rotational symmetry of the sphere (or in general, due to the invariance of mean curvature under isometries) the mean curvature flow equation \\\\partial_t F = - H u reduces to the ordinary differential equation, for an initial sphere of radius R_0, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\text{d}}{\\\\text{d}t}R(t) & = - \\\\frac{m}{R(t)} , \\\\\\\\\\\\ R(0) & = R_0 . \\\\end{align} The solution of this ODE (obtained, e.g., by separation of variables) is :R(t) = \\\\sqrt{R_0^2 - 2 m t}, which exists for t \\\\in (-\\\\infty,R_0^2/2m)..

Common names include fique, cabuya, pita, penca, penco, maguey, cabui, chuchao and coquiza.Ewa Kulak - La magia del fique History The Indigenous peoples of the Americas extracted and used the fique fibers to make garments, ropes, and hammocks—among many things—for several centuries before the arrival of Spanish conquerors. In the 17th century, Dutch colonists carried the plant from their Brazilian colonies in Pernambuco to the island of Mauritius. The native inhabitants of the island learned to use the fibre and called it “caraguatá- acú” “croatá-acu” or “gravata”-acú”. The fibre was also introduced to St. Helena, India, Sri Lanka, Algeria, Madagascar, East Africa, Mexico and Costa Rica. In the 18th century, in Dagua, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, the priest Feliciano Villalobos started the first rope and wrapping materials manufacturing industry; his products were made of fique. In 1880 the Colombian government reported a yearly production of three million kilograms of fibres, the exportation to Venezuela of two million, the fabrication of five millions pairs of alpargatas and four million metres of rope. Between 1970 and 1975 the fique industry suffered a crisis brought about by the development of polypropylene, which costs less and is produced faster. Today, fique is considered the Colombian national fibre and is used in the fabrication of ethnic products, Colombian handicrafts and recently (since July 2007) has been used for the heat protectors (handmade in Barichara) placed around the Colombian coffee cups sold in the Juan Valdez coffee shops worldwide.http://www.juanvaldezcafe.com/index.php?id=1465 Uses *Packing: The main use of the Colombian cabuya is for the fabrication of sacks and packages for agriculture. According with the number of threads, the products are classified as: **Dense: 6000 to 10,000 threads per square metre. Used for flour and small grains such rice. **Semidense: 4800 to 5500. Used for bigger grains such coffee and beans. **Loose: 300 to 360. Used for fruits, vegetables and panela. *Ropes: with cabuya one can make very resistant ropes and strings of different calibres, from threads to manilas one inch in diameter. Such ropes are used in the industries of transportation, construction, sailing and many others. *Arriería accessories: many of the elements used in the pack animals, such as enjalmas, cinchas, retrancas, lazos, pretales, tapa de enjalma, and cinchos are handmade with fique. *Tapestry: the mixed and crude cabuya is used in rugs and tapestry of different size and quality. The fibres can be stained with different organic materials, such as avocado seed, achiote and eucalyptus cortex. *Others: handcrafts, purses, bags, handbags, mattresses, curtains, shoes, umbrellas, baskets and many other products.  Subproducts  *Pulp: Used to produce organic fertilizer and paper *Leaves juice: Can be used for fabrication of soap, fungicides, alcoholic beverages (homemade tapetusa), organic fuel and animal food. *Floral stem: The strong floral stem of the fique plant is used in the construction of houses and ladders. *Bulbs: The pickled terminal bulbs of the plant are edible. *Medicinal uses: Peasants use the leaves in topic preparations for treatment of boils. The extract of leaves is used against horse lice. Cultivation The fique can be obtained from several species of Furcraea, such as F. macrophylla Baker, cabuya Trel, andina Trel, and castilla. Depending of the process of the fiber and the species used, many varieties of fique fibers can be obtained. Among others:  Main varieties  *Ceniza (ash-colored) *Espinosa (rough texture) *Castilla or Golden border *Sisal  Secondary varieties  *Cabuya verde (green) *Uña de águila (eagle nail) *Negra común (black common) *Chachagueña *Genoia *Tunosa común (common spiked) *Jardineña *Espadilla *Rabo de chucha (opossum tail). Optimal conditions for the growing of the fique plant are: *Temperature: 19 °C – 23 °C *Altitude: 1,300 m – 1,900 m *Annual rainfall: 1,000 mm – 1,600 mm *Sunlight: 5–6 hours/day *Soil: dry, rich in silicates. Fique crops bring nitrogen to the soil, improving its fertility. The plant is very adaptable to different ecological conditions. A fique plant can produce 1 to 6 kg of fiber each year. Diseases *Llaga macana or rayadilla: a viral disease that attacks all varieties of fique and all the parts of the plant, especially in crops over 1900 m altitude. The disease has no chemical control. It must be managed with preventive measures. *Pink disease: caused by the fungus Corticium salmonicolor. The disease damages the leaves, disrupting the fibers. Treatment is undertaken with copper-based fungicides. Peasants treat this disease by applying ashes to the base of the leaves. *Leaf cochineal (Diaspis bromelia): caused by a parasitic insect. *Leaf beetle: a beetle that perforates the base of the leaves.

Despite a claim in the Playbill that \\"the story of this drama is essentially true and accurate,\\" much of it is a fictionalized account of the life of Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe. Overview While the plot refers to his rebellious anti-clerical views, the main focus is on Marlowe's romantic relationship with Emelia Bossano, a woman he supposedly lured away from William Shakespeare. Other historical figures who put in an appearance are Richard Burbage, Matthew Parker, Ingram Frizer, and Queen Elizabeth I. In keeping with the general rock music tone of the score, neither the set nor costume designs (miniskirts, Day- Glo tights and silver lamé jumpsuits) suggested the show was a period piece, although the action is set in 1593. Production The Broadway production was directed and choreographed by Don Price. The musical opened at the Rialto Theatre on October 12, 1981 and ran for 48 performances and 8 previews. The cast included Patrick Jude as Marlowe, Lisa Mordente as Emelia, John Henry Kurtz as Burbage, Raymond Serra as Parker, Robert Rosen (who later performed under the pseudonyms OZN and Robert Ozn) as Frizer, and Margaret Warncke as the Queen. Mordente was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical. In his review in the New York Times, Frank Rich described Marlowe as \\"a wholly ridiculous show that is much more fun to sit through than many merely mediocre musicals . . . If Marlowe isn't quite a classic of its kind, that's a matter of size, not content. Tacky-looking and sparsely populated, this show lacks the Titaniclike splendor and expenditure of Broadway's all-time fabulous wrecks.\\"Rich, Frank. \\"Theater.

Trained by D. Wayne Lukas, Boston Harbor had a spectacular two-year-old season in which he won six times and finished second once in his seven starts. That year, his sweep of four Kentucky stakes races earned the colt an extra million dollars in bonus money. Ridden by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey, Jerry Bailey, Boston Harbor capped off 1996 with his fourth straight win, capturing the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, run that year at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. His performances earned him 1996 U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt honors and his earnings of $1,928,605 set a new record for juveniles. Boston Harbor raced only once at age three, finishing off the board. A severe leg injury ended his racing career and he was retired to stud duty at his owner's Overbrook Farm in Kentucky. In the fall of 2001, Boston Harbor was sent to breeders in Japan and is standing at the renowned Shizunai Stallion Station in Hokkaidō. Among Boston Harbor's notable progeny is the millionaire colt, Cafe Bostonian, and the multiple stakes winning millionaire filly, Healthy Addiction.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Chester. History A church has been on this site, adjacent to a former motte and bailey castle, since at least medieval times but only the base of its tower, which dates from the early 16th century, remains. The remainder of the church was rebuilt in 1870 in Perpendicular style by the Chester architect John Douglas. Architecture Exterior The church is built in red sandstone with grey slate roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a north aisle, a chancel with a north vestry, and a half-timbered gabled north porch. The two- stage tower has a short spire within its crenellated parapet. It has diagonal buttresses and, on the west face, a four-light window. On the south side of the tower is a small ringers' window and the belfry windows have two lights. The east window has five lights and contains panel tracery. On the exterior north wall of the tower are pitted marks which are said to have been made by muskets fired during the Civil War. Interior Inside the church is a fragment of a medieval coffin, and, on the west wall, a royal coat of arms of Charles II dated 1660. The tomb of Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley, who died in 1617, his wife, Elizabeth, who died in 1588, is beneath the tower. The octagonal font probably dates from the 17th century. Late 19th-century stained glass is in the east window. There is a ring of six bells, the oldest of which date from about 1500, from 1618, and from 1681. Two bells dated 1870 are by John Warner and Sons, and the newest bell was cast by Gillett & Johnston in 1929. The parish registers begin in 1570 but are not complete. External features The lych gate canopy and its wing walls are listed at Grade II. The lych gate has an oak frame on a sandstone plinth and a half-hipped roof of Westmorland slate with a red tile ridge. The wing walls are of red sandstone. In the churchyard is a sundial dated 1732.

It is the fourth main installment in the Guitar Hero series. The game was launched in North America in October 2008 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles, and a month later for Europe and Australia. A version of World Tour for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X was later released by Aspyr. While the game continues to feature the use of a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of rock music, Guitar Hero World Tour is the first game in the Guitar Hero series to feature drum and microphone controllers for percussion and vocal parts, similar in manner to the competing Rock Band series of games. The game allows users to create new songs through the \\"Music Studio\\" mode, which can then be uploaded and shared through a service known as \\"GHTunes\\". World Tour received generally positive reviews, with critics responding positively to the quality of the instrument controllers, the customization abilities, and improvements in the game's difficulty compared with the previous Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Gameplay Guitar Hero World Tour builds on the gameplay from previous Guitar Hero games, in which players attempt to simulate the playing of rock music using special guitar-shaped controllers. World Tour expands beyond the core guitar-based gameplay by introducing the ability to play drums and sing vocals, and supports the ability for up to four players to play together in a virtual band through these different instruments. Successfully hitting notes increases the player's or band's score, as well as increase the \\"Rock Meter\\" that represents the song's performance. Missed notes are not scored and negatively affect the Rock Meter. If the Rock Meter drops too low, the song ends prematurely, with the virtual audience booing the band off stage. Completing a consecutive series of notes successfully will increase a scoring multiplier for that player up to 4x. This multiplier is doubled when the player activates star power. Similar to Rock Band, the band shares a common score, scoring multiplier and band performance meter while each player has their own performance metric; the band also shares the same \\"Star Power\\" meter, though any player may activate it at any time. A player that performs poorly and reduces their performance meter to zero can still continue to play, but they drain the overall performance meter for the band, requiring the other players to make up for this. Successfully completing a song garners a three to five-star rating based on the accumulated score, and rewards such as in-game money that can be used to buy new guitars and outfits for characters. The guitar interface remains relatively unchanged in World Tour. As with previous Guitar Hero titles, the guitar and bass player must hold down the correct fret button(s) on the controller while strumming in time with the notes as they scroll on-screen. One addition to the guitar gameplay is the ability to play notes while holding a sustained note. Additionally, the bass guitar player is required to play notes representing an open E string, which is shown on-screen as a solid line across their note track. To play these notes, the bass guitar player strums the controller without pressing any fret button keys. The drum interface is similar to the guitar's interface, with each on-screen note track equivalent to a colored drum head on the controller, with the bass drum indicated by a line across the note track. The drum player only needs to hit the correct drum pads simultaneously to the note gems to successfully play their track. There are also marked sections indicating drum fills wherein the player may play any notes they wish in a 'solo' to gain points. The vocal track requires the player to match the pitch of the notes in a manner similar to Karaoke Revolution to be successful. Special sections of each player's note track are marked with glowing notes, which, if completed successfully, builds up Star Power. Once enough Star Power is accumulated, it can be released via various means to double the band's current score multiplier. For guitar and bass, this is done by lifting the guitar controller vertically or (though not in bass) by pressing a button on the guitar face; for drums, by striking both cymbal pads on the controller at the same time; for vocals, by tapping the microphone or making a similarly quick sound. Star Power's use has been modified over previous Guitar Hero entries in that Star Power can now be accumulated even when Star Power is in use by successfully completing additional Star Power phrases, which extends the Star Power's duration. In addition to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals). Game modes The primary single-player game mode is Career mode, which can be played on the lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, or vocals. Career mode has been slightly altered from previous Guitar Hero games. After creating a band, selecting or creating an avatar, and then selecting an instrument, the player is then presented with one of several gigs containing two to five songs each. Most gigs end with an encore song that is not revealed until the other songs are completed. Two of the lead guitar gigs feature \\"boss challenges\\" with Zakk Wylde and Ted Nugent; these boss challenges, featuring original songs by Wylde and Nugent, are different from Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rocks boss battle, removing the focus on attack power-ups and instead featuring a call-and- response mechanic similar to the existing Face-Off mode. The gigs are arranged by difficulty based on the selected instrument. The player is awarded in-game money for each song completed, and completing each gig can also award additional money for meeting certain criteria, such as never letting the Rock Meter drop below a certain level or playing the first several notes of a song perfectly. Completing a gig can also unlock one or more gigs with more difficult songs to complete. Additional awards, such as customization items, are also awarded for completing gigs. The player's accumulated earnings across any of the single player Career Modes are tracked and used to rank the player's overall performance level. Gameplay of a whole band playing Billy Idol's \\"Rebel Yell\\". On top is vocalist, bottom from left to right: Guitar, Drums, Bass Band Career mode is similar to the solo Career mode, with the game songs presented as several gigs to be completed. A band must have at least two players to proceed. The second player may be either a local player or one over the network. Players may be at different levels of progression in the game, but still gain benefits for successfully completing songs when playing together. The in-game interface features vocals along the top of the screen, and three tracks underneath, for bass, drums, and guitar; only tracks for active players are shown. Full four-player bands can compete with other bands online in a Battle of the Bands mode. Both single players and bands can play a setlist of up to six songs in Quickplay mode, still earning in-game money rewards for their performances. Existing competitive modes from the series, including the Battle Mode from Guitar Hero III, are also present in the game. The Wii version of the game features a special \\"Mii Freestyle\\" mode that allows players to use their Miis as their characters as they improvise songs via the guitar and drum controllers or using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Characters and customization Players are able to alter aspects or characters or customize their own character within Guitar Hero World Tour. Players are able to use the Create-a-Rocker mode which is based on the Create- a-Skater mode in Neversoft's Tony Hawk series and the advanced character creation scheme from the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series. Players can change their character's poise, clothing, tattoos, makeup, and age. Selected characters from previous Guitar Hero games are available as templates for creating a rocker. Previous games featured Gibson Guitars, but as a result of a lawsuit with Gibson Guitars, branded guitars are not featured; instead, the player can create a customized guitar from various components, such as bodies, fretboards, and headstocks. The player's in-game drum set and microphone can also be similarly customized. The 14 starting characters of the game can be customized too; however, their customization is limited to clothing and accessories only. Activision had formed partnerships with several instrument equipment manufactures to be featured in the game, including Ampeg, Audio- Technica, EMG Pickups, Ernie Ball, Evans Drumheads, Guitar Center, Krank Amplification, Mackie, Marshall, Orange County Drum & Percussion, Pork Pie Percussion, Regal Tip, Sabian, Vox and Zildjian. In addition to the computer- and player-controlled characters, avatars of notable musicians are featured in the game, either with motion capture or the licensing of their image for their character. Such playable artists include Hayley Williams of Paramore, Jimi Hendrix, Ozzy Osbourne, Zakk Wylde, the Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan, Sting, Ted Nugent, and Travis Barker. New venues in the game include virtual recreations of real arenas, such as Ozzfest, Amoeba Music, Live Nation's House of Blues, Sunset Strip and San Francisco's AT&T; Park. One venue showcases the trademark art style of Tool and was developed in collaboration with the band. World Tour is the first Activision game on the PlayStation 3 to support dynamic in-game advertising provided by IGA Worldwide; similar advertising for the Xbox 360 version is provided by Massive Incorporated. Instruments Guitar and bass guitar \\"Slider Gems\\", note gems connected by a semi-transparent colored line, can be played by sliding one's fingers up and down the touch-sensitive pad on the new World Tour guitar controller, or, alternatively, by simply pressing the corresponding fret button like with hammer-ons and pull-offs (albeit without needing to strum at all) if using an older Guitar Hero controller that does not have the touch-pad. PS3 version of the Guitar Hero World Tour controller RedOctane developed a new guitar controller for World Tour. The unit is approximately 25% larger than previous controllers, making it closer to the size of a real guitar. The new controller includes a longer whammy bar and places the Star Power button directly below the strum bar, improving the access of these features. The strum bar itself was made quieter and longer. The neck of the guitar is detachable, similar to the Gibson Les Paul controller for Guitar Hero III, but the connector has been hardened to avoid connection issues experienced with the previous unit. The neck of the guitar features a touch-sensitive pad just toward the body end from the normal five fret buttons. The player can use either the fret buttons or the touch pad to play regular notes. The pad also allows the player to play notes via tapping or via \\"tap strumming\\" similar to the slap bass method for bass guitar, and to alter the pitch of sustained notes. Guitar tracks feature notes connected by a semi-transparent purple line, (except for the Wii and PlayStation 2 version, in which semi-transparent gems replace this purple line) called \\"Slider Gems\\"; the player can play these notes by sliding their fingers up and down the touch pad or by tapping the fret buttons without strumming. The touchpad can also be used for sustained and staccato notes in the music studio feature while recording guitar, and is used for finer control over loops when recording other instruments. Drums PS3 version of the Guitar Hero World Tour drum kit World Tour features a wireless six-piece drum kit, with a bass drum pedal and five velocity-sensitive drum pads, which Activision has stated provide the \\"most realistic drum experience ever in a video game\\". Generally, the pads represent the snare drum (red), the tom-tom drum (blue), the floor tom (green), the hi-hat cymbal (yellow), and the crash cymbal (orange), however, they can be used for other percussion instruments depending on the song. The bass drum is represented by a purple, horizontal line on the highway, which players must use the drum pedal to hit. The drum kit was designed with help from John Devacka, the developer of MTV Drumscape, and developed key patents used for most modern music games that are now owned by Activision. Special note gems on the drum track, representing accent notes, are \\"armored\\", requiring the player to strike the corresponding drum head harder in order to break the armor and score more points. During song creation, the velocity sensitivity feature of the drum pad allows players to alter the sounds made by the drums. The drum set also has a MIDI input port in the back, allowing users to connect a compatible MIDI drum kit to play in the game. The Wii version of the drum controller includes a slot for the Wii Remote to fit into, enabling it to become wireless, much like the guitar controller introduced for the Wii version of Guitar Hero III. Microphone The official microphone used for vocals uses a USB connection. For other consoles, such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a headset can also be used as an alternative, but has proven to be less reliable as it tends not to pick up the audio from the player. When playing vocals, a standard game controller, or Wii Remote on the Wii version, is necessary in order to navigate menus, select difficulties and pause. The microphone can also be used as a standard recording device when connected to a casual PC USB port. The computer recognizes the device as a Logitech Recording Device. Logitech and Activision announced that the former company would produce \\"premium\\" instruments to be released later in 2008. Instrument compatibility World Tour works with older Guitar Hero guitar controllers. Activision stated during their E3 2008 press conference that Xbox 360 users would be able to use the existing Rock Band instrument controllers as well as other third party controllers in Guitar Hero World Tour; Rock Band instruments for the PlayStation 3 are not guaranteed to work in World Tour, though Sony is attempting to help make these units compatible. All Rock Band original Harmonix instruments for PlayStation 2 work with World Tour. According to issue 027 of the UK's Official PlayStation Magazine, all Guitar Hero and Rock Band PS3 controllers are cross-compatible with all games (except for Guitar Hero: World Tour drums on Rock Band, however some require patching, which is done automatically when connected to the internet). Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 instruments also work on the PlayStation 2 versions of World Tour, as well as later Guitar Hero games. Console makers have helped to ensure instrument compatibility between current and upcoming guitar and band games. Both Sony and Microsoft announced that instruments for World Tour, Rock Band 2, and Konami's Rock Revolution would work between all three games on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The Wii version of the game only supports guitar controllers from previous Guitar Hero games, and \\"no compatibility with any other peripherals\\". World Tour adjusts the tracks in the game to account for the instrument controller being used. For example, sections of the lead guitar track that are designed to be played on the new World Tour controller's touchpad can be played by tapping the frets on older controllers without strumming. When using Rock Bands drum controller, which has one fewer percussion pad than the World Tour unit and lacks velocity sensitivity, two of the lanes on the \\"World Tour\\" drum board merge, reducing the note track to four drum pads and bass pedal, and no armored notes are presented. Development The fourth major entry to the Guitar Hero series, at the time named Guitar Hero IV, was officially announced upon the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games in December 2007. \\"We couldn't have done it without Red Octane's support.\\" says the Guitar Hero Team. The game's new name, Guitar Hero World Tour, was officially announced by Activision in May 2008. Activision and RedOctane had previously registered for trademarks on \\"Guitar Villain\\", \\"Drum Villain\\", \\"Keyboard Hero\\", \\"Drum Hero\\" and \\"Band Hero\\". Analysts speculated that future Guitar Hero would need to include additional instrument peripherals in order to compete against former Guitar Hero developer Harmonixs Rock Band. Activision's CEO Bobby Kotick and early previews of the game revealed that Guitar Hero IV would branch out into other instruments and vocals. According to the Game Informer preview, the addition of drum functionality came from work initially done towards the Drum Hero title. This work was later folded into the Guitar Hero series after Neversoft was chosen as developer of the series. Neversoft's Allen Flores stated that with the addition of the existing drum gameplay, the development of World Tour took under a year, starting development immediately after the release of Guitar Hero III. The drum instrument controller was designed to be more realistic, with input from Chad Smith (of Red Hot Chili Peppers), Stewart Copeland (of The Police) and Travis Barker (of Blink-182), all of whom requested the elevated cymbal pads. The ability to open-strum the guitar was a feature that was planned for Guitar Hero III but was removed before release, finding that it was too difficult on the guitar tracks. However, they built this feature in from the start of World Tour development for the bass guitar tracks. Bright describes the development of the note track for a given song once it has been licensed for the game as a parallel effort, a process that they have found to be more efficient than their previous work on the Tony Hawk games. Once the song was mixed for use by the development team, a \\"tempo map\\" was created by one developer; this map denotes the beats in the music which then can be used by the rest of the development team. Once the tempo map was complete, the song was then distributed to the various teams, such as the specific instrument teams or to the animators, to complete the song. Note-for-note tracking from the song was then performed, and in some cases, changes were made to account for sections that cannot be replicated on the game controllers; the final track represented the note track for the Expert difficulty of the song. Note tracks were then reduced and adjusted to create the note tracks for the lower difficulties in the game. A difficulty assessment was made using the final note tracks to determine where the songs were to be placed in the soundtrack progression. The difficulty model is based on that from Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, which was adjusted from the Guitar Hero III model after the team received negative feedback from players regarding a \\"brick wall\\" in the difficulty progression in that game. The song list for World Tour started as the list of songs that Neversoft wanted to include in Guitar Hero III, but had failed to get into the game or as downloadable content; the list was eventually expanded to over 500 songs. The song list was then prioritized based on what the team thought would be best in the game, and then going after the music that would take the longest time to license, as was the case for the Jimi Hendrix songs. While songs were selected to make sure that guitar, bass, and drums all had great parts, they also opted for songs that would be strong for one single instrument as to make the game still appealing for those playing the single player modes. Some songs were also suggested through the licensing efforts by Activision for inclusion in the game. Flores stated that the inclusion of caricatures of recording artists in the game was either due to the team seeking that specific artist for the game, or the artist approaching the development team and requesting to be part of it. The band Tool, which hasn't licensed its music since 1996, allowed for the inclusion of three of its songs in World Tour as long they were involved with the artwork and tracking of the songs for the game, leading to the creation of the art- like Tool venue. Bright noted that they had support for \\"epic drum solos\\", in which the band animation would focus on the drummer, but removed this feature from the game's final release due to its complexity. They also had to remove the \\"Jam Over\\" mode planned for the game's music creation section that would have allowed players to start with one of the game's songs and play over it on their instruments; this feature was removed in order to keep the final product polished and on-time. The custom song creation feature was inspired by the current \\"hacking environment\\" that has arisen from the first two Guitar Hero games, where players would create new tracks and share them with others. Hands-On Mobile has secured the worldwide rights to create a mobile phone version of the game to be released later in 2008. A version of the game has been rated by the ESRB for Microsoft Windows computers, though Activision has not officially confirmed this version. A PC version of Guitar Hero World Tour was confirmed by Intel on February 27, 2009 and displayed at CeBIT on March 3–8, 2009 in Hannover, Germany.ESL World: Intel Gaming Hall Bundling and promotion World Tour is available in several bundle packages, as well as the stand-alone game. In addition to a game bundle that includes a wireless guitar for each platform, the game can be bought in one of two bundles that include the guitar, drums, and microphone controller. The second bundle, only available through RedOctane's store, also includes a T-shirt, keychain, and a recharging kit. Players in the United Kingdom who pre-order the full band bundle also received a second guitar controller for bass players. The bass guitar is the Les Paul guitar, the same model as bundled with Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. During the Christmas season of 2008, Some retailers, such as Target, sold in-store a dual guitar bundle which included two identical wireless Les Paul styled guitars from previous game versions and did not include the new guitar with the tapping area. Activision created a series of television advertisements directed by Brett Ratner based on the famous scene from Risky Business where Tom Cruise dances to Bob Seger's \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" in a shirt and underwear, each featuring a different set of celebrities lip synching to the lyrics while using the new instrument controllers. The first ad included athletes Kobe Bryant, Tony Hawk, Alex Rodriguez, and Michael Phelps. Another ad spot featured model Heidi Klum; two versions of Klum's ad exist, one a \\"director's cut\\" where she is wearing less clothing. A subsequent commercial featuring model Marisa Miller was banned from airing as too racy. A YouTube viral video entitled \\"Bike Hero\\" showed what appeared to be a teenager riding a bike along a route marked with symbols similar in appearance to the in-game note tracks with LED lights on the handlebars blinking in time to the notes to the song \\"Prisoner of Society\\" by The Living End. The video was later determined to be the work of a viral marketing company Droga5 in cooperation with Activision to promote the Guitar Hero games. The viral advertisement was considered a success, with about 3.5 million views since its release. Soundtrack All of the 86 songs in the game are master recordings, a first for the series. Project director Brian Bright claims that they have \\"a pretty even split between the '80s, '90s, and classic rock\\" with a \\"good amount of emerging bands\\". Some of the songs from the disc are exportable to both Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero for a small fee, with music licensing rights limiting which songs can be exported. Custom songs Guitar Hero World Tour allows for players to create their own songs note-by-note or in real-time. Guitar Hero World Tour allows players to create their own songs through the \\"Music Studio\\" and share them with others through the Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection internet capabilities. The Studio is similar to Apples GarageBand software. The player can create the tracks for each song by playing it in real or slowed time, with the game quantizing offbeat notes to the nearest beat as set by the player, or tracks can be constructed one note at a time. The notes played by the user are the default \\"Expert\\" difficulty track, and the lower difficulty versions are generated by the game. Players can create the tracks for lead, rhythm, and bass guitars and for drums, selecting from a number of different sounds and kits for each instrument. Distortion and other effects can be added to these tracks through Line 6 amplifiers in the \\"GHMix\\" mode. Players cannot record vocals directly, but can create a hum-along vocal line in the Studio. PlayStation 3 users with MIDI- compatible computers are also able to connect their computer to the console and use it for song composition; a similar feature is sought for Xbox 360 owners. Eurogamer reported that a crew at Activision was able to successfully create a \\"perfectly respectable cover\\" version of the first verse of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by Nirvana. Custom songs can be uploaded to the \\"GH Tunes\\" service, allowing other players to rate songs and search and download songs by these ratings. A Showcase service provides some of the best user works alongside new songs from popular artists for players to download. Players can only upload five songs to the service at the start, but players that have highly rated songs gain the ability to upload more. Bright stated that uploaded songs would be actively monitored, and that covers of copyrighted songs would be removed from the service while also taking down any other requests made by copyright owners. The PlayStation 2 version of the game features custom song creation, but does not support the uploading service. Downloadable content In addition to custom songs, players of the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions are able to download new licensed songs for the game. This is the first game in the Guitar Hero series to support download functionality on the Wii. Wii users are able to store downloaded songs on either the Wii's internal memory or on an SD Card in a \\"Rock Archive,\\" and then are able to add songs to playlists from this. When playing tracks stored on an SD Card, each song is automatically copied to a \\"content cache\\" on the Wii's flash memory for play and then deleted after the song is finished. This requires about 200 free memory blocks on the Wii. Neversoft and Activision expressed intentions to release downloadable content more frequently. Downloadable content is available through the in-game store and includes full album downloads and more regular releases compared to Guitar Hero III. Most existing downloadable content for Guitar Hero III is not playable in World Tour, due to the lack of having tracks for all four instruments for the latter game. However, with the release of Metallicas Death Magnetic, the developers were able to prepare the tracks in Guitar Hero III to have the required portions needed for World Tour, and thus these tracks are forward-compatible. Activision has also stated that they are considering a monthly subscription service to deliver downloadable content to users for future games. Most of the downloadable content (152 of 158 songs as of early August 2009) is exportable to both Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero, updated to include new features introduced in those games. However, Guitar Hero 5 downloadable content is not playable in World Tour. Technical issues Users encountered several technical issues with the instrument controllers upon release of the game. Most often cited was the drum controller failing to register drum hits by the player. Some users have also found that, despite the assurance of instrument compatibility, the PlayStation 3 World Tour drum kit does not work with Rock Band 2, however the 1.1 patch for Rock Band 2 on PS3 has fixed this issue. Users have also noted that the wireless guitar strum bar may fail after a few hours of playing. Activision has acknowledged that drum sets from earlier manufacturing processes may be prone to these errors, and have set up several support threads on their Guitar Hero forums to address the issue and assist users in equipment replacement. Reception Guitar Hero World Tour has received generally positive reviews from critics, many making comparisons between it and the Rock Band series. 1UP noted that while World Tour is not as good a \\"party game\\" as Rock Band, the game still provides \\"great peripherals and fun-to-play music\\" and delivers what the player should expect. GameTrailers stated that \\"another viable challenger has stepped onto the stage.\\" IGN's review was lukewarm, noting that \\"A number of things it tries to accomplish were already done better in Rock Band\\", but stated that the game would be a good \\"stepping point\\" for the next iteration of the series. While reviewers were satisfied with the single player modes of the game, the Band tour mode was considered weaker than Rock Bands Tour mode. The interface for a full band, despite being similar to Rock Band, was found to be confusing, making it difficult to determine if a fellow bandmember was about to fail or identifying how much Star Power the band had accumulated. The Band tour was found to be little different from the single player modes, and lacked the additional incentives and challenges that Rock Band had. The note charts and the game's difficulty curve were found to be significantly easier than the more punishing ones in Guitar Hero III. Critics did observe poor note charting, stating that some of the song charts \\"simply don't match the music\\" and that \\"you'll be asked to hit notes where there are none, or not hit notes that are there.\\" The soundtrack was generally praised for containing all master recordings. However, critics found that the setlist contains very few standout hits, and that the inclusion of a number of foreign-language and difficult-to-recognize songs weakened the overall list. Reviews also commented on the number of songs that overlapped with Rock Band 2s set list. Reviews of the instrument peripherals for World Tour were mixed. The new touchpad on the guitar controller was found to be imprecise to make it difficult to use during difficult song sections and would sometimes fail to register taps or slides; some of these issues were attributed to initial manufacturing problems. The drum kit has been praised for the ease of setup, the drum pad layout, and the response of the drums, though the lack of a means to fix the location of bass drum pedal was seen as a drawback when compared to the Rock Band drum kit. The music creation feature of the game, while seen as a useful addition to the game, was found to be difficult to use, suffered from on-screen lag that could interfere with song creation, and the quality of the resulting songs were compared to ring tones for cell phones. The character customization in World Tour was generally seen as an improvement over the limitations of Rock Band. However, reviewers noted that the use of the real-life celebrities against the cartoon-like visuals, along with the emphasis on the band and not individual players, made their presence \\"anachronistic\\". The Wii version received additional praise from reviewers, mostly from the changes in the Wii operation to accommodate the game's Music Store and online play features. The Mii Freestyle Mode was also found to be a good addition, allowing the game to be accessible for younger players. IGN noted that most of the credit for the Wii version is due to Vicarious Visions, as that \\"the only real aspects that hold the game back from being truly amazing overall are - oddly enough - the ones implemented by Neversoft's core design\\". It was awarded Best Music/Rhythm Game on the Wii by IGN in its 2008 video game awards. IGN also nominated it for several other Wii-specific awards, including Best Family Game, Best Online Multiplayer Game, and Game of the Year. World Tour sold more than 534,000 units during its first week of release, less than half of the sales of Guitar Hero III during the same period, with the Wii version selling the most with 183,000 units. During the month of November 2008, 978,000 units were sold, with 475,000 being for the Wii platform. The Wii version was the fifth best- selling game of December 2008 in the United States, selling in excess of 850,000 copies. The PlayStation 2 version was the 17th best-selling game and best-selling PlayStation 2 game of the same month in that region. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions did not rank, but ranked the sixth and fifth best- selling games respectively for their respective systems. World Tour sold 3.4 million copies across all platforms in North America during 2008. Full band bundles represented 41% of all unit sales of World Tour through January 2009, equating to 61% of the game's revenue, while 35% of unit sales and 27% of total revenues came from the guitar and game bundle. In a March 2011 list, the NPG Group placed World Tour as the 7th highest-grossing game in the United States since 1995.

It is currently the smallest township in Rowan County by population. Geography Disambiguation Cathey's Creek Meeting House. Mount Ulla may refer to several geographical entities: * Mount Ulla Unincorporated * Mount Ulla Township (created in 1868) * the area with Mount Ulla zip code and/or address * the areas outside of Mount Ulla township and/or zip code boundaries that are marked as Mount Ulla in historical or contemporary documents, accounts, and memoirs. Mount Ulla community (Mount Ulla Unincorporated) or the village of Mount Ulla does not have clearly defined boundaries. The community is smaller in area than the administrative township or the area that lists Mount Ulla as its address. The Mount Ulla Township is a legislatively defunct administrative subdivision for voting precincts, tax-listings, and census districts thus does not coincide or reflect local inhabitants historical perception of Mount Ulla boundaries. It consists of several unincorporated communities such as Mount Ulla Unincorporated and Bear Poplar Unincorporated. Mount Ulla Township was formed after the Civil War by the requirements of the North Carolina Constitution of 1868. Previous to that time, the subdivisions were Captain's Districts from the time of the American Revolution. While the Captain's Districts referred primarily to the militia, it served also for the election precinct, the tax listing and tax collecting district. Mount Ulla Township was mentioned on Shaffer's Township map of North Carolina in 1886. Mount Ulla zip code area has an outline that does not coincide with Mount Ulla Township boundaries. It stretches into Iredell county community such as Mazeppa, does not come as far north as township's border, stretches into Steele township in the east, Atwell Township in the southeast, and reaches down past township's southern boundary along NC-150 into Atwell township. As a result, a number of historic communities become part of larger Mount Ulla Community - Miranda and parts of Millbridge. Due to the ambiguous and arbitrary nature of boundaries in rural Rowan county communities, historical and contemporary documents at times record location as Mount Ulla when the location may belong to a neighboring community in other documents or may carry a different geographical address. Location Mount Ulla Township is located in the Piedmont region, western Rowan County, North Carolina, United States. Its outline is defined by natural and man-made landmarks. Township's Northern boundary follows in the vicinity of Knox Road, Knox School Road, and Beaverdam Creek, stopping short of Backcreek Church Road. The Eastern border zigzags its way to North Carolina Highway 801, follows NC-801 to Graham Road, Lyerly Road, Upright Road, and Sloan Road. The Southern border neatly follows North Carolina Highway 150. The Western border coincides with the administrative line between Iredell and Rowan counties. Mount Ulla Township occupies . Topography Mount Ulla area landscape is typical for Piedmont plateau - rolling hills with elevations up to 800 (250 meters) above sea level punctuated by springs that feed into Beaverdam, Withrow, Back, and Sills creeks, which flow to the South Yadkin River. Geology Mount Ulla is located in Charlotte Belt of western Piedmont Plateau geological region. It is characterized by Paleozoic era intrusive rock formations - granitic rock, quartz, diorite, and gabbro. The soils are predominantly yellowish to brownish red sandy clay loam and dark brown clay loam, Cecil-Pacolet and Hiwassee-Mecklenburg respectively. Climate The latitude of Mount Ulla is 35.6580828 degrees North. According to Köppen climate classification, the climate is temperate humid subtropical with four distinct seasons. According to United States Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zone map Mount Ulla is 7b zone. Flora Mount Ulla township is a heavily developed agricultural community of pastures and crop fields. Agricultural activity reduced native plant population and introduced foreign species that became invasive. In the 1750s the area \\"was not a primeval forest, but instead a vast prairie of peavines and great stretches of grass and cane-breaks. Scarcely a shrub could be seen, and game abounded\\". Native Flora Natural forest growth consisted of red, white, and post oak, shortleaf pine, hickory, poplar, elm, dogwood, sourwood, cedar, black and sweetgum, locust, walnut, sassafras, pawpaw, and persimmon. Native perennials include common blue violet, dogfennel, passion flower (maypop), pokeweed, wild garlic. Agricultural and Horticultural Flora Agricultural crops evolve with time. In the beginning of the 20th century cotton and tobacco were popular. In the 21st century Mount Ulla farmers grow corn, barley, wheat, soy, and sorghum. Weed Flora Local weed flora can be divided into two categories - non-native plants that have become invasive and threaten native flora as well as native southeastern North American plants if they interfere with intended and desirable plant growth. Some pasture weeds that were introduced from Europe are Canada thistle, chickweed, clover, corn speedwell, cornflower, dandelion, deptford pink, field sorrel, henbit, lambsquarters, Queen Anne's lace. Invasive weed grasses found in Mount Ulla vicinity are crabgrass, bermuda grass. Invasive vines are kudzu and Japanese honeysuckle. Invasive trees include Bradford pear and mimosa. History Etymology Presumably, Mount Ulla was named for a village in Ireland called Oola (Ulla in Irish spelling). According to a different source, Rev. Andrew Y.Lockridge, the second minister at the Back Creek Presbyterian Church, named the community in 1830. The reasons for the name remain unknown but it is believed it is of literary origin since Rev. Lockridge was an ardent student of literature. There is speculation that Rev.Lockridge named the community in reference to a biblical man Ulla in the Book of Chronicles 7:39. There is a new hypothesis that Mount Ulla was named after Ulaid, a Gaelic over-kingdom in north-eastern Ireland during the Middle Ages. Ulaid gave its name to the province of Ulster, the ancestral homeplace of the Scotch-Irish settlers in Mount Ulla vicinity. Mount Ulla Post Office was established in 1842-1843, a name change for Wood Grove Post Office. In 1846 Mount Ulla in Rowan County appeared in the Table of Post Offices in the United States. Emblem In December 2019 Mount Ulla Historic Preservation Society unveiled the sign paying respect to the historic nature of Mount Ulla. A Ukrainian designer Nazar Burega created the sign. Rich symbolism of the emblem pays tribute to Scots-Irish Presbyterians and German Lutherans who settled the area in the mid-1700s. Exploration and Colonization Prior to European colonization, Western Rowan where Mount Ulla is located was the home of Native Americans. In February 1567 A Spanish explorer Juan Pardo visited a Native American settlement of Guatari, near present day Salisbury, North Carolina. War, disease, and forced resettlement during Andrew Jackson's presidency led to the extinction of native people in the area. The First Carolana Charter Long before it was Mount Ulla, the land became an English colony. In October 1629 King Charles I of England granted to his Attorney General, Sir Robert Heath, the territory between 31 degrees and 36 degrees North latitude in the New World. This is the region lying from about thirty miles north of the Florida state line to the southern side of Albemarle Sound in North Carolina. It was incorporated under the name Province of Carolana. There is a hypothesis that French Huguenots sought the colony as a haven from persecution. The plans to plant the colony never materialized, thus presented a case for a failed colonization attempt. The Carolina Charter of 1663 In March 1663 King Charles II of England issued a new charter for the vast territory from the southern border of the Virginia Colony at 36 degrees north to 31 degrees north to eight English noblemen who were his strong supports in restoration to the throne after the English Civil War and Oliver Cromwell's decade long rule of England. The new eight rulers of the Province of Carolina became known as Lords Proprietor. The charter gave the Proprietors power to plant colonies, to create and fill offices, to erect counties and other administrative subdivisions, and other rights and privileges. The rights of the people were set forth as well as the common rights of Englishmen. They were guaranteed English personal and property rights, liberty of conscience, and all liberties and rights enjoyed by King's subjects residing in England. Settling of the Province of Carolina was a difficult enterprise. None of the original Lords Proprietor ever set foot in the colony thus had little understanding of the territory over which they held enormous power. Two of the Proprietors failed to contribute their shares to development of the colony. Men sent over as Governors never held any office making ruling of the new colony even more difficult. False promises and demand to pay quit-rent in sterling rather than marketable commodities contributed to discord and confusion in the new colony. As a result of this, there was difficulty enforcing English law, laws were passed that conflicted with English law, piracy and smuggling flourished, currency had become almost worthless, manufacturing was competing with English industry. Collection of quit-rent on land granted to colonists was a continual problem. The Proprietors were disillusioned in their quest to gain quick riches in the Province of Carolina. In 1712 Carolina colony split into two separate provinces South and North Carolina. By 1729 shares of only three original Proprietors remained in the hands of the families of their original owners and nearly fifty individuals owned or claimed to own the original eight shares. Advisers to the Crown were more interesting in gaining control of the colony. Granville District In 1728 seven of eight Lords Proprietor drew up and offer to surrender their interests in Carolina to King Charles II. In 1729 almost all of North Carolina became a royal colony. One Lord Proprietor who did not surrender his rights to the land in Carolina was John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, a great-grandson of Sir George Carteret who was one of the eight original Lords Proprietor to the Province of Carolina. John Carteret's share consisted of the country lying south of the Virginia border to 35.4 degrees north latitude. The south boundary was surveyed from the coast to Bath in 1743, then to the corner of what is now Chatham County, on Deep River. In 1746, the line was extended westward to Coldwater Creek at a point approximately fourteen miles southwest of the present site of Salisbury. This area became known as Granville District. The section of Granville district lying between the Yadkin and Catawba rivers was described by contemporaries as fertile, well-watered, virtually treeless meadowland. Myriads of little rivulets, combining to form large creeks, flowed from countless sequestered springs. Earlier 17th century colonial settlers usually established themselves along the navigable rivers because communication with England was important. In 18th century when immigrants began to settle the backcountry of North Carolina, land travel prevailed. Home sites increasingly began springing up along the upper reaches of creeks. Each home place nearly always included a fresh water spring providing one source of water for people and one for the animals. It was common practice on the frontier for important creeks to bear the name of the first man to settle upon them. Withrow Creek and Sills Creek in the vicinity of Mount Ulla serve as reminders of the frontier pioneers who settled the area by mid-eighteenth century. The Irish Settlement The first recorded settlement on the lands of present day Mount Ulla bears the name \\"The Irish Settlement\\" of 1747-1749. The homesteads were set up in the headwaters of Second Creek along Beaverdam, Withrows, Gillespies (present day Back Creek), and Sills Creeks in what was Bladen County at the time. By 1750 there were enough settlers to form a new administrative division on the frontier - Anson County. In 1753 three hundred and fifty residents of Anson county petitioned to the North Carolina legislature to form Rowan County, where Mount Ulla remains till this day. The area that became known as Mount Ulla was settled largely by the descendants of Scotch-Irish (also known as Ulster Scots), an ethnic group of mostly Protestant Scottish people who migrated to Ulster, Ireland as part of planned colonization of Ireland sanctioned by of James VI of Scotland and I of England. Scotch-Irish immigrants to West Rowan came from the original colonial settlements in Pennsylvania and Virginia travelling down Great Wagon Road. Along with the Scotch-Irish came another nationality - the Germans aka Pennsylvania Dutch. Revolutionary Era In summer 1774 delegates from Thirteen Colonies were called to convene in Philadelphia. The need to elect representatives for the Province of North Carolina at the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia prompted a mass meeting in July, 1774 in Wilmington, North Carolina. North Carolinians set the date for the First Provincial Congress of North Carolina for August 20 at Johnston County courthouse, later changing the date and place to August 25, 1774 in New Bern, North Carolina. Rowan county residents were the very first in North Carolina to respond to the recent chain of events. On August 8, 1774 freeholders representing all parts of Rowan County met in Salisbury and unanimously adopted Resolutions by inhabitants of Rowan County concerning resistance to Parliamentary taxation and the Provincial Congress of North Carolina, also colloquially known as Rowan Resolves. While professing obedience and fidelity to the Crown of Great Britain, Rowan Resolves resisted taxation without representation, proclaiming it \\"subversive to the liberties of the colonies\\" and reducing the colonies to the state of slavery; asserted the cause of Sister Colony of the Massachusetts Bay and the Town of Boston as the common cause of all American colonies; decried cruelty and corruption of the Intolerable Acts; called to unity among all the colonies in their resistance to the infringement upon their rights and privileges; called for boycott of British goods; and decried African slave trade as injurious to the colonies among other resolutions. Among freeholders who signed Rowan Resolves were George Cathy and Samuel Young, both of whom owned land in the general vicinity of present day Mount Ulla. Samuel Young and Moses Winslow were elected to represent Rowan County at the First Provincial Congress of North Carolina in New Bern. The history of slavery in this part of the county is not well researched. There were fewer black residents in Western part of North Carolina than the east, but both slave and free black appear in the records from the 1750s. Abel Cowan of Wood Grove Plantation near Bear Poplar owned 36 slaves in 1840. Knox and Gillespie families owned land and have records of owning or hiring slaves in the vicinity of modern-day Mount Ulla. There were records that one of the founding fathers of Back Creek Presbyterian Church, John Barr, owned two slaves on his plantation. Throughout the summer of 1868 conservative political clubs started to spring up in Western Rowan and in Mount Ulla in particular to combat Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction Era. Demographics Population According to 2010 US Census Bureau Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics, there were 2,525 people residing in 28125 zip code area. Twenty-five and a half percent of residents are ages 0–19. Citizens over 65 years of age comprise 14.9 percent of the population. The median age of a Mount Ulla community resident was around 42 years. Male population was 51% vs 49% female. Close to 63% of households are husband and wife families. White residents make up almost 96% of the population, Black - around 2%, Hispanic/Latino - almost 2%. Eighty percent of residents have at least completed high school. Fifteen percent of residents have received bachelor degree or higher. Language Mount Ulla residents speak rural Piedmont North Carolina dialect of Southern American English. The Scots-Irish that settled the area in the middle of the 18th century influenced the local dialect. Settlement pattern in this part of Piedmont, isolated farmsteads rather than towns, explains microdialect differences that can be heard among many descendants of the Scots-Irish today. Evidence of Scots-Irish origin of the dialect can be seen in an iconic grammatical language form of the a-prefix with words ending in -ing (\\"he is a-hunting') where a- is pronounced as \\"uh\\"; lexicological form \\"over yonder\\". One feature of local dialect in pronunciation is a change of the unstressed final o sounds as in words ending in -o and -ow to -er that results in fellow becoming feller. Further reduction of words can be seen as well in potato sounding like (po)tater or mosquito like skeeter. Religion Mount Ulla residents are predominantly Protestant Christians. The following churches have served the community: * Back Creek Presbyterian Church (PCA), founded in 1805 * Centenary United Methodist Church, established in 1884 * Ebenezer United Methodist Church, established in 1853 * Knox Chapel United Methodist Church, erected in 1888 * Mount Tabor United Presbyterian Church, founded in 1867 * Mount Zion Baptist Church, Boyden Quarters * Oakland Presbyterian Church, founded in 1867, now closed * Sills Creek AME Zion Church, founded in 1872 * Shady Grove Baptist Church * Smith Chapel Apostolic Church * St. Luke's Evangelical Lutheran Church, founded in 1869 *Thyatira Presbyterian Church, founded in 1750 Governance Mount Ulla is governed at the county level and does not have any local government. Elections Mount Ulla Township is designated Mt.Ulla voting precinct 24 with a polling place at Mt.Ulla Station of West Rowan Fire Department; North Carolina Congressional district 13; North Carolina Senate district 34; North Carolina House of Representatives district 77. 2018 Government Representation As of February 9, 2019, the following legislators represent the residents of Mount Ulla in the United States and the state of North Carolina governments. North Carolina Senators: Richard Burr (R) since 2005, class 3 (next election in 2022) and Thom Tillis (R) since 2015, class 2 (next election in 2020). North Carolina Congressional district 13 representative: Ted Budd (R). North Carolina Senate district 34 representative: Vickie Sawyer (R) North Carolina House district 77 representative: Julia C. Howard (R) Schools Mount Ulla is served by Mount Ulla Elementary, West Rowan Middle, and West Rowan High Schools. All of the schools are under Rowan-Salisbury School System jurisdiction. Mount Ulla Elementary and West Rowan High School have Mount Ulla address and are located within community boundaries. West Rowan Middle School has a Salisbury address and is not part of the community. History During the early days of immigration into Rowan both German and Scotch-Irish settlers were zealous for education and religion. In their communities the school house and the church were usually one and the same structure. Thus prior to 1850 much of the educational upbringing of children was handled by religious institutions. Rev.Andrew Lockridge, the pastor of Back Creek Presbyterian Church, in addition to his ministerial work taught a classical school in the community. During this time he convinced members of the community of the need to have a denominational home college. Back Creek Church members subscribed and paid for the founding and support of Davidson College during 1835-1839. Public schools began to appear in early the 1850s after the county legislature passed the law on public education in 1843. Private schools continued operations because public schools were poorly financed and operated only four or five months a year. Back Creek Academy at Mount Ulla was in operation as early as 1868. German Lutherans started one of the first area subscription schools in 1872 soon as the congregation of St.Luke's Lutheran Church formed in 1869. A parochial school was built in 1880 and St. Luke’s provided a school for the community until 1897 when it closed due to public schools moving into the area. Between the years of 1881 and 1924 the public county schools in the area were the worst in the state. Many schools had only two rooms, often not fit for school use. Mount Ulla had a public school in 1918. In 1924 John H.Cook of the Greensboro Woman's College recommended improvements in public school buildings, increasing their size to not less than eight rooms. Mount Ulla was on the list of communities to improve its public Mount Ulla Elementary School was accredited in 1937. Mount Ulla High School was accredited in 1927. A segrated unaccredited Negro school operated at Bear Poplar. Public schools integrated in 1961 and by the mid-1960s Bear Poplar school for Blacks stopped its operation. Fire departments As the roads in the rural farmland of Mount Ulla improved and the density of population grew, the need for organized fire protection arose. In 1953 Mount Ulla and Bear Poplar saw the opening of their first volunteer fire department. In 1956 Centenary Volunteer Fire Department (VFD) opened to serve the community. In 2001 Mount Ulla-Bear Poplar Volunteer Fire Department merged with Centenary VFD to form class 5 West Rowan Volunteer Fire Department. It consists of four fire stations - Centenary, Bear Poplar, Mount Ulla, and Miranda - covering the area of 49 square miles of rural homes and farmland with approximately 3,000 people living in the district. West Rowan Fire Department is a volunteer non-profit entity governed by the Board of Directors. Like all Rowan fire department, it is funded through fire taxes. In the last decades the number of calls steadily increased, requiring more volunteers, effort, time, and money to keep volunteer departments in operation. In the late 1980s Rowan Emergency Medical Services (EMS) started Medical Responder Program that trains and certifies firefighter teams to respond to medical emergencies when EMS is called. At present as of 2018 over fifty percent of calls for West Road VFD are medical emergencies. Medical emergencies account for the rise in overall response rates. Transportation  Miller Air Park, a private airport In 1898 the North Carolina Midland Railroad extended Winston-Salem-Mocksville branch to Mooresville, where it connected to the Atlantic, Tennessee and Ohio Railroad. Mooresville junction created a through route directly connecting Winston Salem with Charlotte. The railroad branch operated as a secondary main line. Scheduled manifest trains transported three primary products---furniture, textile, and tobacco products. Passenger trains, Carolina and Asheville Special, operated between the two endpoints of Winston Salem and Charlotte which also provided connections to points beyond until the 1960s when automobile and airplane travel made passenger trains obsolete. Mount Ulla was a scheduled stop for passenger trains, while Bear Poplar and Mazeppa were flag stops. Steele's Feed and Seed (Bear Poplar) and Mount Ulla Flour Mill were commercial shippers along the rail line. In 1915 Southern Railway leased the railroad branch. Today Norfolk Southern operates what is called a NS \\"L\\" Line through Mount Ulla. Economy Historically Mount Ulla has been a farming community and has remained such till today. Some of the notable farms and farm stores in the area are * Back Creek Farm * Bear Poplar Farm, growing food as well as serving as solar energy farm. * Brown Farm, established in 1835 * Evans Family Farm * Gander Hill Farm * Grampian Farm * Green Hills Gelbvieh * Hodge Farm * Hoffner Brothers Dairy *Keeper Creek Farm * Kerr Mill Holsteins * Mary L Farm * McLaughlin Farmhouse * Moore Farm *New Moon Natural Heritage Farm * Patterson Farm Market & Tours *Rocking J Ranch * Tailwind Farm *Walnut Hollow Farms * Webster Family Farm, flower farm and llama retirement farm protected by The LandTrust for Central North Carolina. * West Rowan Farm, Home & Garden (formerly Steele Feed and Seed) Plans are underway to build a solar farm in Mount Ulla. Culture Architecture and Historic Communities Historic Communities Modern-day Mount Ulla encompasses many smaller historic communities within its boundaries. Their number is indicative of smaller scale local communities that evolved in rural Rowan County when transportation was not readily available. The communities that completely or partially fall into the boundaries of Mount Ulla are: *Bear Poplar * Centenary * Mazeppa * Millbridge * Miranda * Mount Ulla The Mill Bridge Scenic Byway designated by N.C.Department of Transportation goes through a significant part of Mount Ulla. Lazy 5 Ranch, a drive through zoo of domestic and exotic animals, is located in Mount Ulla. It has been in operation since 1993 and is a home for 750 animals from six continents. Historic Architecture Mount Ulla has a significant number of structures that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: *Back Creek Presbyterian Church and Cemetery; *Hall Family House *John Carlyle and Anita Sherrill House *Kerr Mill *Knox Chapel Methodist Church *Rankin-Sherrill House *Wood Grove, a historic plantation and ancestral seat of Cowan and Krider families Other historic properties include * Back Creek Church Manse (Watts-Sloop House) * Dr. George Alexander Brown House, built in 1912 by a local physician, who maintained an office with an operating room and a drug store behind the residence * Dr. Oni Pinkney Houston House, remains of the house built in the late 1860s on a tract of Barr family plantation, now Mary L Farm * Dr. Samuel Kerr House (Oakland) * George Henry Brown House, built in the 1860s and remains the seat of the Brown family * Hart's Post Office and Hart House, built in the 1880s * Hart-Coble House, built in 1900 * Lockridge-Goodman House, built in the 1830s by Rev.Andrew Y. Lockridge who is credited for naming Mount Ulla * St. Luke's Lutheran Church Conservation Citizens of Mount Ulla have been involved in preserving the historic and agricultural legacy of the community. Hoffner Brothers Dairy Farm, Webster family farms, and Historic Cowan-Wagoner farm that is the site of Wood Grove are under the protection of the Three Rivers Land Trust, formerly known as LandTrust for Central North Carolina. Tower controversy, 2005-2014 In 2005, Davidson County Broadcasting applied to place a radio tower in Mount Ulla. In response to this, citizens of Mount Ulla formed Mount Ulla Historic Preservation Society (MUHPS) in 2006 to protect rural landscape and farming legacy of the community. The Miller Air Park Association and MUHPS prevented the placement of a radio station tower on the grounds that it would be hazardous to local airplane traffic and mar the rural landscape of the community. This has become known as the tower controversy and lasted from 2005 till 2014. Dollar General opposition In March 2019, the citizens of Mount Ulla became aware that Dollar General wanted to place a store in the middle of the community at the intersection of NC 801 and Back Creek Church Road. This would require rezoning the land from rural agricultural to commercial, business, industrial in a community that is zoned over 99% rural agricultural. On Wednesday, April 10, 2019, Teramore Development, the company planning to build a Dollar General store, held a meeting at the West Rowan Volunteer Fire Department to answer questions. Approximately 150 citizens came to voice their strong unanimous opposition to Dollar General presence in the community. Almost a month later, on May 5, 2019, the Mount Ulla Historic Preservation Society received a legal document with information that the contract between Teramore Development and the landowner for the proposed Dollar General site was terminated. The landowner said that one of the reasons for voiding the contract was how friendly and courteous the people of Mount Ulla were to him despite the circumstances.

Barn quilt artists who create in the area are Elsie Bennett, Pam Bostian, and Susan Bostian. Elsie Bennett's barn quilt, \\"Roselind's Flower\\" in memory of Ms. Ronney Steele was a finalist in Our State Magazine in 2018. Currently she is working on “Biggest Community Barn Quilt in North Carolina”. The Mount Ulla Historic Preservation Society co-published a 2019 calendar \\"Barn Quilts of Rowan\\". On July 8, 2019, residents of Mount Ulla installed the largest community barn quilt in the United States on the wall of a Bear Poplar store, West Rowan Farm, Home & Garden.

While the term can be used with the same meaning as \\"human soul\\", human spirit is sometimes used to refer to the impersonal, universal or higher component of human nature in contrast to soul or psyche which can refer to the ego or lower element. The human spirit includes our intellect, emotions, fears, passions, and creativity. In the models of Daniel A. Helminiak and Bernard Lonergan, human spirit is considered to be the mental functions of awareness, insight, understanding, judgement and other reasoning powers. It is distinguished from the separate component of psyche which comprises the entities of emotion, images, memory and personality. John Teske views human spirit as a social construct representing the qualities of purpose and meaning which transcend the individual human. Distinction between the human spirit and soul According to historian Oswald Spengler, a distinction between Spirit and Soul has been made by the West and earlier civilizations which influenced its development. The human spirit can be seen as the heavenly component of human's non material makeup - the part that is impersonal or universal. Whereas souls are the personal element unique to each individual. As Spengler writes in The Decline of the West: Some Christians believe that the Bible identifies humanity's three basic elements: spirit, soul and body. They emphasise that the human spirit is the 'real person', the very core of a person's being, the essential seat of their existence. They believe that, when a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Saviour, it is their human spirit that is transformed as they become 'new creatures' in Jesus Christ. The soul which is the seat of the will, mind and emotions does not get converted but needs to be renewed on a daily basis through the recommended Christian disciplines such as prayer and reading the Bible. In Islam, Muslims are viewed as having their own spirits, but one that in a sense is one with God's spirit. For Spengler, the perception of unity this idea led to was important for the emergence of the \\"consensus\\" that maintained harmony in Islamic culture, especially during the Golden Age of Islam.

They seem to be all \\"flashing\\" (as opposed to \\"continuous-glow\\") fireflies. They are a diverse lineage, spreading throughout the warm parts of Eurasia into temperate Europe and East Asia and south to the Australian region.Stanger-Hall, Kathrin F.; Lloyd, James E. & Hillis, David M. (2007): Phylogeny of North American fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae): Implications for the evolution of light signals. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 45(1): 33-49. (HTML abstract) Several tropical species, notably of the genus Pteroptyx, are of local economic importance. Their displays will self- synchronize until the entire local firefly population flashes in the same rhythm, creating a stunning spectacle that is popular with tourists. The most well-known location to witness these displays is on the Selangor River at Kampong Kuantan, Malaysia. Two Japanese species of Luciola, collectively known as hotaru (蛍), are highly significant in Japanese culture and folklore. They are symbols of the hitodama (人魂 or 人玉), the souls of the newly dead. See also the explanations at the article on the movie Hotaru no Haka (\\"Grave of the Fireflies\\") for a discussion of the cultural significance of the hotaru. Systematics This subfamily is usually divided into two tribes, the monotypic Curtosini and the larger Luciolini. Occasionally, the Ototretinae are contained in this subfamily as a third tribe Ototetrini. The genus Pristolycus, usually placed in the Lampyrinae, appears to belong in this subfamily instead and represents a quite basal lineage.Ballantyne, Lesley A. & Lambkin, C.

Zootaxa 1733: 1–44. PDF abstract While Curtos certainly stands apart from the other genera, its precise relationships are far less resolvable than the placement as a distinct tribe presumes; it appears to share more autapomorphies with Atyphella and especially Pygoluciola - both were for some time included in Luciola - than with other genera, but whether this means an evolutionarily closer relationship (rendering the Curtosini invalid) remains to be tested. Photuroluciola, usually included in Luciola, might also warrant recognition as a distinct genus. From phylogenetic analyses of morphology, three possible clades (which could be considered tribes) can be inferred: * A basal group containing Bourgeoisia, Lampyroidea, and the \\"typical\\" Luciola which apparently includes Hotaria. Pristolycus and Curtos might belong here. * A robustly supported and distinct group containing Colophotia, Pteroptyx, Pyrophanes, and Luciola species from Australia. They might be distinguished by larvae with soft terga that lack paranota, but this might alternatively be a plesiomorphic trait also present in other Luciolinae. * A weakly supported group of Atyphella (formerly in Luciola), Pygoluciola and possibly Curtos, which each seems very distinct but of unclear relationships with the other genera and groups.

Festus explained that: “Sacred laws are laws which have the sanction that anyone who broke them becomes accursed to one of the gods, together with his family and property”.Festus, de Verborum Significatione Quae Supersunt Cum Pauli Epitome In some cases the law may have been applied to protect temples from being defiled.Coarelli, F. (1983) Foro Romano I: Periodo archaico, Rome, p. 178 It could also be applied to protect a person who was declared sacrosanct (inviolable). Those who harmed a sacrosanct person became sacer (accursed) through the declaration sacer esto! (\\"Let him be accursed\\"). The offender was considered as having harmed the gods or a god, as well as the sacrosanct person and therefore accursed to the gods or a god. This meant that the offender became forfeit to the god(s) and on his death he was surrendered to the god(s) in question.Ogilvie, R.M. (1995) A Commentary on Livy, Clarendon Press, Oxford, pp. 500-2 The implication was that anyone who killed him was considered as performing a sacred duty and enjoyed impunity.Altheim, F. (1940) Lex Sacrata, Amsterdam In the literature by Roman historians, the term sacrosanctity is usually found in relation to the Tribune of the Plebs, or plebeian tribune. History During the rebellion of the first plebeian secession in 494 BC, which marked the beginning of the Conflict of the Orders between patricians (the aristocrats) and plebeians (the commoners), the plebeian movement instituted and elected its leaders, who soon also came to act as the representatives of the plebs: the plebeian tribunes. It also instituted the assistants of these tribunes (the plebeian aediles) and its own assembly, the Plebeian Council (Concilium Plebis). These plebeian institutions were extra-legal in that they were not recognised by the senate and the Roman state, which were controlled by the patricians. The bones of contention in the Conflict of the Orders were the economic grievances of the poor, the protection of plebeians and, later, power-sharing with the patricians (who monopolised political power) with the rich plebeians. The patricians resisted the plebeian movement and its demands because the interests of the plebeians most often clashed with theirs and they saw this movement as a threat to their political and economic privileges. The first plebeian secession was spontaneous and was the result of the exasperation of the plebeians with the refusal of the senate to address their demands. They lost faith in the Roman state. After the rebellion the disaffected plebeians effectively created a “state within the state.”This phrase was used by Mommsen to describe the plebeian organisation; Romisches Staatsrecht, vol. III 3rd edition, Leipzig, 1887-8. Livy said that “Two states were created out of one; each faction had its own magistrates [officials]; its own laws.”Livy, ab Urbe Condita, 2.44.9. The plebeians turned the Aventine Hill into their stronghold and their own jurisdiction in contraposition to the Roman state. The Plebeian Council, under the leadership of the plebeian tribunes, who presided over its sessions, voted on and issued its own laws which applied to this hill and to the plebeians. The patricians did not recognise these plebeian resolutions as laws because they refused to recognise the plebeian movement. Moreover, formally, legislation was supposed to be proposed by the consuls (the two annually elected heads of the Republic) and put to the vote of the Comitia Centuriata, the Assembly of the Soldiers.Lintott, A. (1999). The Constitution of the Roman Republic. Oxford University Press, pp. 44-48 Given the extra- legal character of the plebeian institutions, the plebeians found a way to give power to the plebeian tribunes by using the lex sacrata and declaring the person of a plebeian tribune sacrosanct. The lex sacrata was a collective resolution sanctioned by a collective oath. It was found among other Italic people as a military arrangement whereby, at times of military emergency, the compulsorily levied soldiers swore to follow their commanders to the death.Altheim F. (1940) Lex Sacrata, Amsterdam; Livy mentions such arrangements in several passages The plebeians swore to obey the plebeian tribunes they elected and to defend them to the death. Those who harmed them became sacer. Given that the plebeian tribunes were not part of the Roman state and had no secular legal status, the threat to kill those who harmed them by the plebeians formed the base from which the powers of the plebeian tribunes were derived. The invocation of a religious law provided the justification and sacrosanctity conferred impunity. These tribunes provided protection from arbitrary coercion by public officials though auxilium (assistance) by personal intervention to stop the action. They also could use coercitio, the enforcement of their will by coercion through which they could impose fines, imprisonment or the death penalty on anyone who challenged them or abused them verbally or assaulted them. Later, as the Conflict of the Orders was resolved, the sacrosanct character of the plebeian tribunes or, as they also came to be known, Tribunes of the Plebs was accepted by the patricians and implemented into Roman law.

Stayley Hall was their residence Stayley Hall is referred to in the diaries of Sir Ralph Staley (Stavelegh) in the early 15th century. The hall was originally timber framed, but was stone-clad during the 17th century. It is situated on a knoll making defence of the building a relatively easy affair. The external walls and the roofing slabs are made from locally quarried gritstone. The inside of the building has been altered as parts of it were let as cottage tenements and the plaster has fallen off showing the original lattices of wicker work and clay daub. Part of the staircase still remained in 1871 although the floor was dilapidated even then. Sir Ralph Staley had no male heirs and after his death his daughter, Elizabeth Staley, married Sir Thomas Assheton, uniting the manors of Ashton and Staley. Elizabeth and Thomas had no sons. Margaret, the eldest of their two daughters married Sir William Booth of Dunham Massey The younger daughter Elizabeth was widowed and without children. She continued to live at Stayley Hall until her death in 1553. In her will she left her share of the lordships of Ashton and Staley to the Booths. The hall remained in the possession of the Booth family until the death of George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington on 2 August 1758. Upon his death, the Earldom of Warrington became extinct.

During the Irish War of Independence, he served as an IRA intelligence officer for Michael Collins' Squad. Early life Tobin was born in 1895 Cork, the eldest son of Mary Agnes (nee Butler) and David Tobin, a hardware clerk. Tobin had two younger siblings, Katherine and Nicholas Augustine Tobin, also born in Cork City. Tobin's family moved to John St. in Kilkenny and then to Dublin. Tobin went to school in Kilkenny and was an apprentice in a hardware shop at the time of the 1916 Rising. As a participant in the Easter Rising he fought in the Four Courts Garrison under Edward Daly. He was arrested and courtmartialed. He was sentenced to death and then had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment. He was a prisoner in Kilmainham, Mountjoy, Lewes, Dartmoor, Broadmoor and Pentonville prisons. He was released in June 1917. The intelligence war Early in 1919, Tobin had become Collins' chief executive in the Intelligence Directorate handling the many spies in Dublin Castle, including double agent David Neligan. Nancy O'Brien worked for Under- Secretary for Ireland James Macmahon, decoding messages sent from London. Each day between 2:30 and 3:30 she would pass any information acquired to either Tobin, Joe McGrath, or Desmond Fitzgerald. Tobin was involved in planning the assassinations of British soldiers, informants, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, the Dublin Metropolitan Police, and operatives of MI5. He constructed detailed profiles of everyone remotely connected to the British government, often using Who's Who, The Morning Post, and The Times - a newspaper that described him as \\"one of the most formidable of [the] Twelve Apostles\\". Collins' intelligence operations were based at 3 Crow Street, Dublin, where Tobin had the assistance of Tom Cullen and Frank Thornton. In October 1921, Tobin travelled with the Irish Treaty Delegation as part of Collins' personal staff. Henry Wilson Tim Pat Coogan and James Mackay have examined Tobin's involvement in the assassination of British Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson. Wilson's public tirades about Collins was evidence of mutual personal dislike between the two men. In May 1922 Collins told Tobin \\"We'll kill a member of that bunch\\" to the news of \\"bloody pogroms\\" in Belfast. Wilson had been intimately involved with the Ulster loyalist cause, including the Curragh Mutiny and the establishment of the Ulster Special Constabulary.p261, James Mackay, Michael Collins: A Life; Just before the shooting, Coogan places Tobin in London. He met courier Peig Ni Braonain at Euston Station collecting a document that had been sent from Dublin. Returning to Dublin before the incident, Tobin was jubilant when he told defence minister Richard Mulcahy about Wilson's death. Mulcahy was appalled and threatened to resign. Irish Free State Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, he was appointed Deputy Director of Intelligence in the new State and assigned to the Criminal Investigation Department based at Oriel House. However Collins would soon replace him with Joseph McGrath. Tobin was placed on the Army Council and was Director of Intelligence from September 1922 until his appointment as Senior Aide-de-Camp to the new Governor General, Tim Healy in November 1922. The position provided an apartment in Viceregal Lodge.The Times, Irish Mutiny. Officers Abscond With Arms, 10 March 1924 In October 1922, Tobin's brother Nicholas, a Free State captain, was accidentally shot dead by his own troops during the raid and capture of a bomb making factory at number 8 Gardiner's Place, Dublin.Irish Times, 20 October 1922 Tobin believed in the stepping stone doctrine which saw the Treaty as a stage towards full independence. With the outbreak of the Irish Civil War he remained loyal to Collins and took the Pro-Treaty side. He led in the fight against the Anti- Treaty IRA in the south. Disillusioned with the continuing hostilities and in the aftermath of the death of General Collins he formed an association called the IRA Organisation (IRAO) or \\"Old Irish Republican Army\\" to distinguish themselves from the anti-treaty insurgents.  Army Mutiny Richard Mulcahy, the new Irish defence minister, proposed to reduce the army from 55,000 to 18,000 men in the immediate post- Civil-War period.Irish Times March 10th, 1924 10 March 2012 Tobin knew his own position was to be affected and shared the perception that the Irish Army treated former British officers better than former IRA officers. On 7 March 1924 Tobin, together with Colonel Charles Dalton, sent an ultimatum to President W. T. Cosgrave demanding an end to the army demobilisation.Dáil Éireann - Volume 6–11 March 1924 The immediate response was an order for the arrest of the two men on a charge of mutiny.The Times, Index 10 March 1924 The cabinet, already wary of the Irish Army, ordered an inquiry and appointed Garda Commissioner Eoin O'Duffy to the army command. On 18 March, the mutineers assembled with hostile intent at a Dublin pub. An order was made to arrest the mutineers and the cabinet demanded the resignation of the army council. The generals resigned, affirming the subservience of the military to the civilian government of the new state.Richard Mulcahy, Oxford DNB Later career In later years, Tobin would rebuild relations with his Civil War foes and joined De Valera's Anti-Treaty Fianna Fáil Party. Tobin joined up with Joseph McGrath to form the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake in the 1930s. Many other former army comrades found work in this lottery. Tobin left the Sweep in 1938. After World War II, Tobin became Superintendent of the Oireachtas for the Irish Dáil. Personal life On 14 October 1929, Tobin married Mona Higgins, at the Church of the Holy Family, Aughrim St, in Dublin, and had two daughters, Máire and Anne Tobin. Following the death of Tobin's father, David, in 1956, Tobin's health declined, resulting in his death on 30 April 1963 in Dublin, aged 68 years. In popular culture Tobin was portrayed by actor Brendan Gleeson in Neil Jordan's biopic Michael Collins.

It publishes writing by people who share an activist spirit and a belief in choice and equality. Founded in 1970, the Press began by rescuing “lost” works by writers such as Zora Neale Hurston and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and established its publishing program with books by American writers of diverse racial and class backgrounds. Since then it has also been bringing works from around the world to North American readers. The Feminist Press is the longest surviving women’s publishing house in the world. The Press operates out of the City University of New York (CUNY).  Founding and history  By the end of the 1960s, both Florence Howe and her husband Paul Lauter had taught in the Freedom Schools in Mississippi, and Howe was already attempting to compile a mini-women’s studies curriculum for her writing students at Goucher College in Baltimore. As the 1970s approached, Howe was convinced that, just as she needed texts for teaching about women, so would other educators. Her initial appeal to a number of university and trade publishers to issue a series of critical feminist biographiesHowe, Florence. \\"To the Editors\\", The New York Review of Books. Retrieved January 2014. proved of no avail. Ultimately, the Baltimore Women’s Liberation, an active local group and publishers of a successful new journal, helped to raise money for the Press’s first publications. On November 17, 1970, the first meeting of the newly formed Press was held in Florence Howe's living room.\\"VFA Honors the Founder of The Feminist Press Florence Howe\\". Veteran Feminists of America. Retrieved January 2014. The first book to be published was Barbara Danish’s children's book The Dragon and the Doctor in 1971. Howe saw her dreams of producing feminist biographies come true with the publication of Elizabeth Barrett Browning at the end of 1971. In the Press’s founding years, Tillie Olsen changed its course dramatically by giving Howe a photocopy of the 1861 pages of The Atlantic Monthly containing Rebecca Harding Davis's anonymously published novella Life in the Iron Mills. In 1972, the Press issued this work by Rebecca Harding Davis as the first of its series of rediscovered feminist literary classics. Olsen’s second suggestion, Daughter of Earth by Agnes Smedley, and Elaine Hedges’s suggestion, The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, were published in 1973. Both have become staples of American literature and women’s studies curriculums since, with the 1990 Norton Anthology of American Literature including both Life in the Iron Mills and The Yellow Wallpaper. In the spring of 1971, Howe and her husband moved to New York, where she brought the burgeoning Press to her newly accepted professorship at Old Westbury. The president of the school allowed her to operate out of the corridor of a building originally intended as a garage for campus vehicles. The Press was met with excitement and support from students who worked in the small office in exchange for college work-study. Two New York City publishing professionals, Verne Moberg and Susan Lowes, contributed to the publication of three volumes of reprinted fiction released in 1972 and 1973, both of which Howe believes to exemplify the Press's enduring commitment to producing course-adoptable books to supplement curriculums dominated by male writers. The Press continues its commitment to recovering and compiling the important work of otherwise overlooked and unpublished female artists in collections such as In Her Own Image and the Women Writing Africa series. In 1972, the Feminist Press became a 501(c)3 organization with tax-exempt status. In the summer of 1985, the Feminist Press moved to the CUNY campus on East Ninety-Fourth Street following an invitation from the school. Allowed to maintain an independent staff and board of directors, the Press gratefully welcomed the resources and visibility made available by this partnership. In 2001 Jean Casella became the Executive Director of the Press. She was followed by Gloria Jacobs, former Ms. Magazine editor, and Jennifer Baumgardner, cofounder of Soapbox Inc. Jamia Wilson is the current Executive Director of the Feminist Press, appointed in 2017.  Today  Wilson is both the youngest director in the Press's forty-nine-year history and the first woman of color to head the organization. Under her leadership, the Press continues its commitment to publishing a broad range of voices. The Press has also recently endeavored to extend its reaches beyond merely publishing. In doing so, the Press has hosted a variety of events, conferences, and panels centering on key conversations in feminism. “I grew up reading Feminist Press books from my mother’s shelf, and they were instrumental in developing my voice as an activist and writer. It’s an honor to join this intergenerational team to enliven the Press’s intersectional vision of publishing unapologetic, accessible texts that inspire action, teach empathy, and build community,” Wilson explained upon her appointment as ED. The Feminist Press remains rooted in the symbiotic relationship between a publication and its readership. In this exchange, a book not only promotes ideas to its reader, but it also inspires new formulations that could ultimately shape future publications. The Feminist Press has remained current and relevant within the fast-changing world of modern politics and the rapid evolution of feminism. Recent bestsellers include debut short story collections Training School for Negro Girls by Camille Acker and Love War Stories by Ivelisse Rodriguez, both tracing the experiences of women and girls of color. Love War Stories was nominated for a PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 2019. In 2016, the Press started Amethyst Editions, a queer imprint curated by Michelle Tea that champions emerging queer writers who employ genre-bending narratives and experimental writing styles, and complicates the conversation around American LGBTQ+ experiences beyond a coming out narrative. Tea's collection Against Memoir won the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay in 2019. Brontez Purnell, whose novel Since I Laid My Burden Down was also published by the Amethyst Editions imprint, received a Whiting Award for Fiction in 2018. The Feminist Press has also demonstrated a commitment to publishing diverse voices in translation. Among their recent bestselling translated titles are Asja Bakic's Mars, translated by Jennifer Zoble; Cristina Rivera Garza's The Iliac Crest, translated by Sarah Booker; and Armonía Somer's The Naked Woman, translated by Kit Maude. Pretty Things, a novel by Virginie Despentes that was translated from the French by Emma Ramadan, was longlisted for the 2019 Best Translated Book Award. Trifonia Melibea Obono's La Bastarda, translated by Lawrence Schimel and the first novel by a woman from Equatorial Guinea to be published in English, was shortlisted for the 2019 Lambda Literary Awards in the Lesbian Fiction category. The Feminist Press also established the Louise Meriwether First Book Prize, a literary prize for debut women and nonbinary authors of color, in partnership with TAYO Literary Magazine. In 2017, YZ Chin became the first recipient of the Louise Meriwether First Book Prize for her short story collection Though I Get Home. The prize has since been awarded to Claudia D. Hernández in 2018 for Knitting the Fog and Melissa Valentine in 2019 for The Names of All the Flowers.  WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly  The Feminist Press also publishes WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly, an interdisciplinary peer-reviewed academic journal. The journal began as Women's Studies Newsletter in 1972, and in 1981 it was renamed Women's Studies Quarterly. Today it is a biannual release simply called WSQ. Covering a wide array of thematic subjects within emerging women's studies, the journal has published issues such as \\"Technologies,\\" \\"Citizenship,\\" and \\"Motherhood.\\" The subject of each issue is considered through various lenses, including psychoanalytic, legal, queer, and historical interpretations in addition to many others.  Selected titles    *Reprinted:  *Reprinted:            Series  The Feminist Press has launched multiple book series. Women Writing Africa was begun in 1994 with funding from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations. The four-volume series was completed in 2009.

In 1850 before Western North Carolina (WNC) Railroad was built, the post office and thus the town in the vicinity of present-day Cleveland was called Rowan Mills, getting its name from a large five-story flour milled owned by A.G.Ford. After the construction of WNC Railroad, the railroad station was named Third Creek. The post office and town kept their name Rowan Mills until 1876 when the town was incorporated and renamed into Third Creek. In 1884 township people, who were all Democrat except for three people, decided to rename the town to Cleveland, in honor of Grover Cleveland, the first Democratic President elected since the Civil War.

It was released on R.E.X. Records in 1989. In 2010, HM Magazine ranked it #33 on the Top 100 Christian metal albums of all-time list. Recording In high school, the band leader Kurt Bachman met Scott Laird, who was studying his first year as a music instructor. When Believer was recording the title track for Extraction from Mortality, the band asked Laird to compose an orchestral intro for the song. In 1989, Believer was signed to R.E.X. Records which published Extraction from Mortality. The album was mostly distributed to Christian bookstores but quickly gained popularity for Believer. The album was noted for its technicality and aggression, and especially the song ”Shadow of Death” is one of the all-time favorites among Believer fans. \\"Unite\\" starts with an intro that contains industrial music elements and bizarre sound samples. The last song, \\"Stress\\", is a humorous, laid-back tune that advises one to not to worry about things man can not do anything about. Extraction from Mortality gained notice among non-Christian metal fans, and Believer was signed to Roadrunner Records in 1990. However, R.E.X. Records would release Believer's later records to Christian market while Roadrunner's distribution was aimed at a broader audience. An unreleased demo song titled \\"The Chosen\\" appeared on the compilation albums East Coast Metal in 1988 and Classic Metal in 1990. A remixed version of \\"Vile Hypocrisy\\" was included on the compilation album Argh!!! in 1991. For years Extraction from Mortality was hard to find, and copies sold for high prices in internet auctions.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. July 14, 1904 – November 19, 1994) was an appellate attorney who argued many cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Griswold served as Solicitor General of the United States (1967–1973) under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. He also served as Dean of Harvard Law School for 21 years. Several times he was considered for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. During a career that spanned more than six decades, he served as member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and as President of the American Bar Foundation.  Early life  Griswold was born in East Cleveland, Ohio, to Hope (Erwin) and James Harlen Griswold. Griswold graduated from Oberlin College in 1925 with an A.B. in mathematics and an M.A. in political science. He attended Harvard Law School from 1925 to 1929, earning an LL.B. summa cum laude in 1928 and an S.J.D. in 1929. Griswold compiled The Bluebook, a uniform system of legal citation used by law professionals, in 1926 while a student at Harvard Law School. In 1929, Griswold was admitted to the Ohio bar and spent six weeks working as a partner in his father's Cleveland law firm of Griswold, Green, Palmer & Hadden. He subsequently joined the U.S. Office of the Solicitor General as a staff attorney and served as a special assistant to the attorney general from 1929 to 1934. There he worked under Solicitor General Charles Evans Hughes, Jr., son of the future Chief Justice of the United States, Charles Evans Hughes, Sr. He became an expert at arguing tax cases before the Supreme Court, and is considered one of the great scholars in tax law.  Academic career  Griswold joined the Harvard faculty in 1934, first as an associate legal professor, and then as a full professor from 1935 to 1946. Known for a very keen intellect, Griswold was made dean of Harvard Law School from 1946 and served in that capacity until 1967. One of the dominant figures in American legal education, he doubled the size of the faculty, bringing in such legal luminaries as Derek Bok (who succeeded him as Dean, and later became President of Harvard University), Kingman Brewster (later President of Yale University), and Alan Dershowitz. In 1946, just after Griswold was made Dean, Soia Mentschikoff was appointed Visiting Professor, the first woman faculty member in the history of Harvard Law School. On December 11, 1934, the Harvard Law Review published an article by Griswold titled \\"Government in Ignorance of the Law – A Plea for Better Publication of Executive Legislation.\\" The arguments Griswold made for orderly publication of the official actions of the Executive Branch were underlined when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan and forced the hand of the committee studying the issue for President Roosevelt. Congress passed legislation to create the Federal Register, and the President signed it into law (Pub. L. 74-220, July 26, 1935). As Dean, Griswold enlarged the school's curriculum to include such specialized topics as labor relations, family law, and copyright law. In addition, he expanded the school's physical plant, library holdings, and financial resources. Finally, he began the process of convincing the Harvard Corporation to allow the enrollment of the first female students in 1948, and oversaw it beginning in Autumn of 1950. The Law School was the third graduate school at Harvard to admit women after the Graduate School of Education and the Medical School. It did so twenty-seven years before Harvard College fully admitted women as undergraduates in 1977. At Harvard, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was scolded for taking up a man’s seat by Dean Griswold. In a 1992 Interview, he recalled that at the time, over one-third of the faculty were against the admission of women. In the 1950s, Griswold served as an expert witness for Thurgood Marshall, who was then the legal director of the NAACP, in several cases that the association brought to lay the foundation for the Supreme Court's desegregation order in Brown v. Board of Education. Earlier in the 1950s Griswold denounced Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in his book The Fifth Amendment Today, which examined the constitutional protection against self-incrimination. A 1960 profile of Mr. Griswold in The New York Times said that \\"when Senator Joseph R. McCarthy was in full cry against the use of the Fifth Amendment by witnesses accused of Communist ties, one of the most forceful voices in defense of the constitutional privilege against self- incrimination was raised by Dean Erwin Nathaniel Griswold of the Harvard Law School.\\" Griswold was a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission from 1961 to 1967 having been appointed by John F. Kennedy. On May 8, 1963, in the midst of police violence and massive arrests of schoolchildren in Birmingham, Alabama, Kennedy held a press conference in which the President answered a reporter's question about the matter of improving U.S. race relations, and a suggestion there was need for a Fireside Chat on Civil Rights, with the claim that the Federal Government had done all it legally could do about the issue. Griswold quickly responded publicly that this was untrue; \\"It seems clear to me that he hasn't even started to use the powers that are available to him.\\" An angry Kennedy privately fumed, “That son-of-a-bitch! Let him try.” On June 11, after another crisis—Governor George Wallace blocking the door to the University of Alabama—Kennedy finally gave his Report to the American People on Civil Rights.  Solicitor General  On the same day that Griswold retired as Dean and Langdell Professor of Law in 1967, President Johnson appointed him United States Solicitor General.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1967/10/2/a-great-law-dean-perwin- griswold/ Johnson was a Democrat and Griswold a moderate Republican, but the bipartisan appointment was widely praised. As Solicitor General, Griswold advocated in support of Great Society legislation, and he continued on in the position under President Nixon until 1973. Harriet S. Shapiro became the first woman attorney in the Solicitor General’s office when Griswold hired her in 1972. As Solicitor General, Griswold unsuccessfully argued against the publication of the Pentagon Papers by The New York Times, because such publication would cause a \\"grave and immediate danger to the security of the United States.\\" Years later, he reversed his position in an op-ed piece entitled \\"Secrets Not Worth Keeping\\" in The Washington Post, writing, \\"I have never seen any trace of a threat to the national security from the publication\\" of the Pentagon Papers. He suggested that government demands for secrecy be treated with some skepticism by the public.  Later years  In 1973, Griswold resigned as Solicitor General and joined the international law firm of Jones Day Reavis & Pogue in Washington, D.C. He continued to argue many cases before the Supreme Court up until his death in 1994. He also served as a mentor to many of the young lawyers in the firm. Harvard Law School's Griswold Hall, which houses faculty offices including that of the dean, was named for him in 1979. From 1983 to 1994, he served the U.S. government as a liaison between U.S. and Soviet lawyers in the Lawyers Alliance Nuclear Arms Control. Griswold was also active in the Supreme Court Historical Society, serving as Chairman of the Board of Trustees at the time of his death in 1994. Griswold also served as a trustee of his undergraduate alma mater, Oberlin College. In October 2014, the President of Oberlin, Marvin Krislov, in a detailed tribute to Griswold, announced the creation of the Erwin N. Griswold '25 Chair in Politics and Law. Griswold wrote several books including Spendthrift Trusts (1936), Cases on Federal Taxation (1940), Cases on Conflict Laws (1942), and arguably his most popular, The Fifth Amendment Today, Law and Lawyers in the United States (1992). Throughout his career he received numerous honorary degrees from many prestigious universities, including Columbia University, Northwestern University, Brown University, and the University of Sydney. Griswold served as president of the Association of American Law Schools from 1957 to 1958 and as President of the American Bar Foundation from 1971 to 1974. In 1978, the American Bar Association awarded Griswold the gold medal for his outstanding contributions and service to the legal community. In 1985, at a ceremony commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the United States Supreme Court Building, Griswold gave a speech in which he compared the work Ruth Bader Ginsburg had done for women's rights to that which Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall had done for the civil rights of racial minorities. Griswold was on President Jimmy Carter's selection committee for the District of Columbia Circuit which recommended Ginsburg to sit on the United States Court of Appeals there. It was this speech which was used by Martin Ginsburg and New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to first lobby President Bill Clinton for the nomination of then- Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the United States Supreme Court, and later the United States Senate to confirm Justice Ginsburg. Together with William H. Brown III and on behalf of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Griswold testified against the confirmation of Clarence Thomas based on then- Judge Thomas' then-lack of judicial experience and his frequent reference to the legal theory of natural law. Their testimony took place on September 17, 1991, some 24 days before Anita Hill was called to testify in the Thomas nomination hearings. Griswold's memoirs were published in 1992 under the title Ould Fields, New Corne: The Personal Memoirs of a Twentieth Century Lawyer. Erwin Griswold died on November 19, 1994, in Boston, at the age of 90. He was survived at the time of his death by his wife of 62 years, Harriet Allena Ford (died 1999), two children, as well as five grandchildren and one great- grandchild. In popular culture In the 2014 HBO Films production Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight, Peter McRobbie appears as Griswold who, as United States Solicitor General, was tasked with defending the United States Government against Muhammed Ali's litigation in Clay v. United States. Griswold is briefly portrayed in Steven Spielberg's 2017 film The Post by Kenneth Tigar. He is played by Sam Waterston in 2018's biographical legal drama On the Basis of Sex.

Delamu documents the people living in the Nujiang River Valley, along the Tea Horse Road, an ancient trade route between China's Yunnan province and Tibet. The film was jointly produced by companies in the People's Republic of China, and Japan. It had its American premier at the 2004 Tribeca Film Festival. The title \\"Delamu\\" refers to the Tibetan word for \\"peaceful angel\\", and the name of one of the mules owned by a villager in the film. Plot Stretching across Yunnan, Tibet, and into the Himalayas, the heart of Delamu is the \\"Tea Horse Road\\" (). One of the oldest caravan routes in Asia, the film documents one such caravan as it transfers raw material to a modern construction site. As Tian travels with the caravan, he interviews people who have lived along the road for decades, including a priest who was thought to have disappeared during the Cultural Revolution, a 104-year-old woman, and a mule driver who owns the titular Delamu. Reception Though quiet and a far cry from either the insulated Springtime in a Small Town or the epic The Blue Kite, Tian's Delamu has nevertheless garnered both praise and some criticism. On the one hand it has been well received by critics in Asia. The inaugural Chinese Film Directors Association Awards bestowed its honor for best director to Tian for Delamu. It has similarly been well received in the West. In its premier at Tribeca, Delamu's cinematography of the stunning landscape was praised by critics. On the other hand, many critics often cannot help but to compare the film to Tian's account of the Cultural Revolution, The Blue Kite, often negatively.

At the end of the campaign on 7 July, his corps was granted the honour of being the first major Coalition force to enter Paris. King Frederick William III of Prussia granted Zieten the title of Graf, or count, on 3 September 1817. At the age of 69, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall on 9 September 1839. Zieten died in Warmbrunn.

History Neighborhood-scale planning CPEX grew from the 1998 initiative called Plan Baton Rouge. Plan Baton Rouge began as a program to oversee and implement a master plan for redeveloping downtown Baton Rouge. The downtown plan demonstrated the benefits of applying smart growth principles and leveraging public investment to catalyze new private investment. In 2005, in partnership with a new Hope VI development, Plan Baton Rouge completed a neighborhood plan for Old South Baton Rouge, a historic but disinvested community located between downtown and Louisiana State University. The plan focuses on revitalizing existing housing and businesses and integrating mixed-income housing and multi-use development to the area. CPEX continues to oversee implementation of both efforts. Community/parish-scale planning While working on the downtown and Old South Baton Rouge community plans, Plan Baton Rouge turned its attention toward parish issues by applying for the opportunity to receive an in-kind audit of East Baton Rouge Parish’s plan and related ordinances. In 2004, the Smart Growth Leadership Institute and University of Southern California, funded by a grant from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), selected Baton Rouge as one of nine cities in the nation to receive this service. The audit examined the Parish comprehensive plan, the Horizon Plan, to assess if this vision document promotes Smart Growth principles. The audit further assessed whether the legal ordinances contained in the Unified Development Code enable the parish to accomplish its Horizon Plan vision. With the recommendations of the audit, Baton Rouge is underway with revisions to the current codes to include new standards for development and new tools for encouraging \\"Smart Growth\\". Regional planning After hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, CPEX began to play a larger role in planning efforts throughout the state of Louisiana. In January 2006, Plan Baton Rouge transitioned into the non-profit planning agency CPEX. CPEX coordinates the Louisiana Recovery Authority's statewide recovery planning process called Louisiana Speaks: Our Voice, Our Plan, Our Future. This initiative involved teams of consultants working at neighborhood, parish, and regional scales across South Louisiana. The long term recovery plan produced from this effort is the Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan. While working on the Louisiana Speaks regional vision,http://www.louisianaspeaks.org CPEX also received a grant from the EPA's Smart Growth division. Under this grant, CPEX has allocated funding, staff support and other resources to Tangipahoa Parish and West Feliciana Parish as they work to develop comprehensive plans that will address issues unique to Louisiana's rural communities.

There were two pits. Coal was transported by a tramway to a depot west of Outwood Road, in Radcliffe, and also by tramway through Ringley Wood to the nearby Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal.

Outwood Colliery exploited the coal seams of the Manchester Coalfield and was noted for its Trencherbone Coal. Due to an underground fire which caused the winding gear to collapse into its own shaft, the colliery was closed in 1931.  Regeneration The colliery site, which covers , was transferred from the ownership of British Coal Property to Bury Council in October 1997. The council intended to turn the site, consisting mostly of contaminated land covered with collapsed buildings, spoil heaps, and uncapped mineshafts - into open land suitable for public use as part of its Outwood Forest Park project.

Three men were arrested on 4 September 2007 while leaving a rented cottage in the Oberschledorn district of Medebach, Germany where they had stored 700 kg (1,500 lb) of a hydrogen peroxide-based mixture and 26 military-grade detonators,Der Spiegel: Teenager schmuggelte Zünder nach Deutschland, 6 October 2007 and were attempting to build car bombs. A supporter was arrested in Turkey. All four had attended an IJU-training camp in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2006. They were convicted in 2010 and given prison sentences of varying lengths; all have since been released. Perpetrators Two of the perpetrators were German converts to Islam from Christianity,Katrin Bennhold: Letter from Europe: Local terrorism suspects puzzle Germany, International Herald Tribune, 12 September 2007 and two were German-Turks. In 2006, all four attended a paramilitary training camp run by the Islamic Jihad Union in Waziristan. The perpetrators were primarily motivated by strong anti-Americanism fuelled by interaction with extremists inside Germany, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and their radicalization increased after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Fritz Gelowicz  Fritz Gelowicz (born 1979) was considered the leader of the plot. He was born in Munich and moved to Ulm with his parents and brother at the age of 5. He was raised in an upper middle class family where his father was a solar heating salesman and his mother was a nurse. His parents separated when he was 15, and Gelowicz remained with his father. He converted to Islam between the ages of 15–18 while attending the Multikulturhaus in Neu-Ulm, and used the name Abdullah. The Multikulturhaus, with its radical sermons, was at the time one of the main Salafist centers in Germany; it was closed in 2005. He enrolled to study engineering at Ulm University where he joined an extremist Islamist study circle, which regularly met at Café Istanbul. Members of the study group legitimized the killing of Jews, Christians and infidels. Gelowicz was also a member of extremist circles based at the Multikulturhaus in Neu-Ulm. Gelowicz lost interest in his engineering studies and took an 18-month break from the University. During the break took Arabic language courses in Egypt and Syria as well as religious courses in Saudi Arabia. He also took part in the hajj to Mecca. According to U.S. authorities, Gelowicz trained at camp belonging to the Islamic Jihad Union in tribal areas of Pakistan. He was married in January 2007, to a German-Turkish woman.  Others  *Daniel Schneider (born 1986), lived in Saarbrücken. He dropped out of the twelfth grade after only a few weeks. He converted to Islam at the age of 19, and spent time studying the Koran and Arabic in Egypt. Like G., S.'s parents were divorced when he was young and S. had many Turkish friends, who seem to have introduced him to Islam. S. also spent 9 months as a conscript in the German army and trained in munitions. He met G. at the Islamic Jihad Union training camp in Pakistan. *Adem Yilmaz (born 1979), was raised in Turkey. He came to Germany with his family in 1993. He has two younger sisters and a younger brother. His family lives in Germany's Hessian area. He holds both German and Turkish citizenships. He met G. and S. in January 2005, when all three were making a pilgrimage to Mecca. *Atilla Selek (born 1975) was a supporter of the group. He was born in Germany to Turkish parents and obtained German citizenship in 2005. S. and G. met at the Multi-Kultur-Haus in Neu-Ulm. As A.S. had hidden criminal proceedings against him for breaches against gun regulation from the passport authorities during his application, those authorities removed his citizenship in 2011 on the grounds that it had been fraudulently obtained. This rendered him stateless. Seven lesser figures were also being hunted. Only five are known by name. The other two have been identified by aliases. Four of the ten suspects (including Yilmaz) have been identified as Turkish. Investigation Frankfurt Airport The suspects had been under observation since October 2006, when the NSA had intercepted communications between them and IJU and alerted German authorities. At the end of 2006, Fritz Gelowicz was spotted suspiciously observing a US Army base in Hanau.Die Welt online: \\"Klarer Auftrag\\" für Attentate kam aus Pakistan, 7 September 2007 The suspects had rented a vacation house in the remote town of Oberschledorn, where they amassed 700 kg (1,500 lbs) of hydrogen peroxide, and military-grade detonators from Syria.Süddeutsche Zeitung: Spuren führen nach Syrien und Pakistan , 8 September 2007 A 20 July conversation between two suspects mentioned targeting \\"a disco filled with American sluts,\\" as well as Ramstein Air Base and Frankfurt Airport.Erik Kirschbaum: German suspects had deadline for attacks: report, Reuters, 8 September 2007 A phone call from northern Pakistan in late August is purported to have set a 15 September deadline for the group's attacks. The group was aware that they were being watched by police, one member even slashing an unmarked police car's tires while stopped at an intersection. A routine traffic stop by police not involved in the investigation led to the officers mentioning that the drivers were on a federal watchlist, a comment that the suspects overheard (as was recorded by covert listening devices installed by German authorities in their rented car). This led to an unscheduled raid on their cottage on 4 September 2007. The men were preparing to move the chemicals by van when they were arrested outside the home. There was a minor scuffle and one of the men shot a German police officer in the hand before being subdued.

For example, the Roman Catholic Pontifical Council for Social Communications declared in 2002 that \\"the virtual reality of cyberspace cannot substitute for real interpersonal community, the incarnational reality of the sacraments and the liturgy, or the immediate and direct proclamation of the gospel\\", while acknowledging that the internet can still \\"enrich the religious lives of users\\". History Internet-based Christian communities, better known as \\"online churches\\" or \\"internet churches\\", began gaining popularity in the early 2000s. Since then, they have prospered dramatically in response to institutional investment, the rise of more sophisticated social media and the emergence of free-access virtual worlds. As online communication became more popular and home computers became less expensive, computer-meditated communication expanded, causing religion to flourish on the Internet. In the beginning of the internet, many ministries began posting informational and sermon-like messages to visitors. Through the years this method of teaching has evolved in the form of video, audio podcasts and blogs. A 1996 study recommended that church organizations quickly establish their presence in cyberspace, or they would lose touch with many of their parishioners and risk losing the ability to advise them in an era of technological growth. They were essentially urged to establish an electronic presence before it was too late. Had they not made their presence known, the influence of the Church could have been lost to unofficial religious groups. Many of today's internet churches are descendants of brick-and-mortar churches, offering members an alternative to the traditional physical meetings within a church building.Nils Smith, \\"Faith groups should embrace — not fear — social media\\" San Antonio Express (Accessed August 16, 2010) Some, such as the Church of Fools, offer church experiences through entirely 3D virtual reality environments. Recent statistics have shown an increasing exodus of young people from churches, especially after they leave home and live on their own. In a 2007 study, Lifeway Research determined that 70% of young Protestant adults between 18–22 stop attending church regularly.BRETT MCCRACKEN, \\"The Perils of 'Wannabe Cool' Christianity\\" Wall Street Journal (Accessed August 13, 2010) Internet churches now exist all around the world; however, they are still criticized for their lack on “human connection”.Gordon MacDonald \\"Who Stole My Church?: What to Do When the Church You Love Tries to Enter the 21st Century\\" (Thomas Nelson Inc, 2008, , 9780785226017) Overview Internet church is a gathering of religious believers facilitated through the use of online video stream, audio stream and/or written messages whose primary purpose is to allow the meeting of a church body of parishioners using the internet. It includes different aspects of Christian community online, especially by those who view this phenomenon as a subset of emerging church, the developing expressions of the faith in relation to culture change. A cyberchurch is a ministry that exists primarily as a private website, an interactive space on a public website or social networking site. An internet church describes an institution that teaches and practices its religious beliefs entirely or primarily through online methods. Though there are hundreds of internet churches available online, the term \\"internet church\\" is generally reserved for churches that have a majority of its members meet, connect or congregate by way or use of the internet; where religious services are conducted through Internet technology. The internet churches differ/contrasts from the traditional church through the physical media that links pastors, teachers and believers. Many churches in the United States have their own internet church campus, and many of them have members numbering in the hundreds. Internet church campuses are the same thing as a traditional church campus, except online. An online churchgoer can attend a Bible study, donate, attend live services, and watch past services, attend conferences, and more. Members keep in contact with pastors and ministers and collaborate with other believers through web communication tools provided. In some cases members communicate by phone with ministers.Jonathan Wynne-Jones, \\"Church minister to tweet Holy Communion to the faithful\\" Telegraph (Accessed August 16, 2010) As Internet usage continues to thrive, Christians are using websites, blogs, social networking sites, media services, chatrooms, discussion boards, and other electronic means to provide social connection, education, and enrichment of their faith. Online church can also offer convenience to those who are too isolated or unable to attend an in-person church service. Online churches The word cyberchurch was used by web-developer Tim Bednar's paper \\"We Know More Than Our Pastors\\" which detailed the blogging movement's influence on the experience of faith.Tim Bednar, \\"We Know More Than Our Pastors: Why Bloggers Are the Vanguard of the Participatory Church\\" PDF (Accessed September 5, 2007) Religious pollster and author George Barna used the term in his book Revolution to describe \\"the range of spiritual experiences delivered through the Internet\\".George Barna, \\"Revolution\\" (Tyndale House, 2005, ) Barna sees Cyberchurch as one of the future \\"macro-expressions\\" (large scale forms) of church in the future; one that will soon account for one-third of American spirituality, together with other \\"revolutionary\\" forms of church. Social networking sites Christians, like many Internet users, are increasingly using social networking sites like Facebook. These sites incorporate much of the technology of blogging but forge more concrete connections between users, allowing them to \\"message\\" each other within the system, connect officially as \\"friends\\", rate and rank each other, etc. These connections may or may not materialize in the real world, but many people now consider on-line relationships a significant part of their lives, increasing the potential influence of a Christian presence in these environments. Criticism of Christian use of these sites has grown, however, due to prevalence of questionable content and issues of safety.John Kuhn, \\"Should Myspace be Yourspace? \\" Breakaway http://www.breakawaymag.com (Accessed September 5, 2007) As a result, several Christian alternatives for social networking have been developed.see Ditty Talk , Your Christian Space , Xianz, MyPraize, Faith Freaks, Christ Union On the other hand, some advocate a missional stance, using social networking sites and networking components of other Internet mediums like blogging, chat, and instant messaging to proselytize new converts and spread the Gospel.Andrew Careaga, \\"Embracing the cyberchurch\\" Next-Wave http://www.next-wave.org (Accessed September 5, 2007); Kevin D. Hendricks, \\"How Your Church Can Use MySpace \\" Church Marketing Sucks http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com (Accessed September 5, 2007); and Rev. Arne H. Fjeldstad, D. Min, \\"Communicating the Gospel on the Internet\\" Communicating Christ on the Internet http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1541/ (Accessed September 5, 2007) There has been some speculation and experimentation with the idea of starting churches within such \\"virtual environments\\". LifeChurch.tv is at the forefront of developing a platform to support the Online \\"Church Online\\" Campus offering their platform to other churches. For instance, a quick google search will reveal their platform is being utilized at East Lake Church in Chula Vista, CA The Ridge Community Church in Milwaukee, WI and Seacoast Church in Charleston, South Carolina. True, LifeChurch does not limit themselves and has also used other platforms to plant a cyberchurch within the Facebook community using an \\"Internet Campus\\" technology.Bobby Gruenewald, \\"Facebook Church \\" Swerve http://swerve.lifechurch.tv (Accessed September 5, 2007) Likewise, churches are beginning to appear in the Second Life virtual world where people can attend as avatars and worship together.Theodore Wright, \\"CyberChurch in Second Life\\" Dokimos.org http://www.dokimos.org (Accessed September 5, 2007) Many of these churches retain elements that can be found in traditional churchgoing, such as sermons. However, they also attempt to adapt to the unique social norms of digital media; users attending these churches are often referred to by their online usernames and there are sometimes chat sessions before, after, and even during services. One specific internet church is the Internet Chapel started in 2014 to provide full but condensed services to those with cognitive impairments, ALS, cancer or other infirmities, and to their careproviders. Located at https://www.facebook.com/InternetChapel, the services are interfaith and ecumenically oriented, and can be read in about 20 minutes - thus allowing greater access to the congregation. With a reach of over 20,000 users since 2014, Internet Chapel is one of the longest serving internet churches. With an oversight by the Interfaith Ecumenical Church (IEC), the Internet Chapel is unique to provide services to a specific cohort of individuals who otherwise would not be able to attend a traditional internet church.  On-line multimedia  Podcasting, streaming audio and video, media downloads, and self-broadcasting websites have made it possible to share the sights and sounds of belief. While religious recordings of different types have certainly existed before, it is the Internet's ability to make these files public for millions of users that has led to the growth and influence of this component of cyberchurch.Andrew Jones, \\"Linking to Cyberchurch \\" Relevant Magazine (Accessed September 5, 2007) Now there are millions of audio sermons, conference and seminar recordings, home videos, documentaries, faith-themed films and more accessible on the World Wide Web. Tech-savvy bloggers can use multimedia to create audioblogs and videoblogs that present experiences, opinions, dialogs, stories, and teachings, creating a more live feel to the blogging experience. Many prominent thinkers, authors, and leaders have blogs that present a podcast or streaming audio of speeches, lectures, or sermons. Video sharing sites like YouTube and Google Video allow anyone with a web camera to post video alongside professional religious movie producers and make it available to millions of users. This allows believers to share ideas about faith in new and creative ways. One example is a church in Orange County, California, where you can share prayers via a web forum before even having met another person. Most of these sites allow people to embed video hosted remotely onto their blog or website, powering video-based communication across the Internet. Christian-specific sites have also recently sprung up to provide faith-based video sharing services. In more recent years, internet church has taken yet another step forward with the creation of applications. In 2018, celebrity pastor Judah Smith created what is essentially church via an app. This app included forums and the ability to pray for others.  Impact of internet church  The communication revolution and the rise of online church has effected the perceptions of the Church, as well as had an impact on their structures and modes of functioning. The constant availability of images and ideas, and their rapid transmission across the world, have profound consequences, both positive and negative. This can effect perception and transmission of values, world views, ideologies, and religious beliefs. One problem in particular is the digital divide. The digital divide creates two groups, the rich and the poor, on the basis of access, or lack of access, to new information and communication technology. Another concern is the idea that the wide range of choices available on the Internet may encourage a \\"consumer approach\\" to matters of faith. Data suggests that some visitors to religious websites pick and choose elements of customized religions to suit their personal tastes, which is recognized as a problem in the Church. There is also the concern that many churches believe the Internet can not replace in-person worship among a community. Critics believe that virtual worship separates followers from spiritual essentials found in brick-and-mortar Christian churches.  Other religions  All major and most minor Christian denominations are presented through online churches. However, most Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu traditions are as well. In each case, unofficial expressions of these religions as well as individuals wanting to communicate their personal religious and spiritual beliefs have appeared on the medium. The trend has become even more prominent as individuals can now create their own sites much easier than in the past.

Early years and formation Born in the Moolki town of Mangalore in the erstwhile South Canara district of British India, to a Catholic family cultivating intellectual interest, Jerome was soon at home in several local languages. He did his secondary schooling at St. Aloysius College (Mangalore) and college studies in St. Joseph's College (Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India). Completing finally the English Literature course at the University of Madras (Chennai) he first taught a year at St Joseph's College, Trichy, before deciding to enter the Society of Jesus (29 May 1921). He then went through the usual Jesuit training, doing his theological studies with the French Jesuits in Belgium at the end of which he was ordained priest on 30 August 1931 (Enghien, Belgium). He hailed from the Mangalorean Catholic community. Educationist in Tamil Nadu Back in India in 1933, he was appointed professor in his alma mater, the St Joseph’s College of Trichy of which he became within a few years, rector and president. An able administrator, Jerome was also a convincing orator. He soon attracted the attention of Sir C. Rajagopalachari (known as Rajaji), the then president of the Indian National Congress. Transferred in 1942 to the Loyola College of Chennai (formerly Madras), to be its rector and later its Principal, D’Souza soon became involved in the legal establishment of the University of Madras (Chennai). When the time came to form an assembly that would draw a constitution for the country—the independence of India was near—D’Souza’s name was proposed by Rajagopalachari to the Madras legislative assembly. He was elected to represent them at the constituent assembly of Delhi. Member of the Indian Constituent Assembly At the assembly (1946 to 1950), along with the Protestant leader H.C. Mukherjee, D’Souza ensured the rights of the minorities (especially of worship and education) were fully protected by the proposed text and the right to practice and propagate one’s religion were included in the constitution as fundamental rights of all citizens of India. Statesman and diplomat In Delhi he soon gained the trust and admiration of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India who often consulted him in educational matters and used his oratorical skill. At the instance of Nehru he was also involved in delicate diplomatic negotiations: * He negotiated with the Vatican the termination of the Portuguese Padroado system that was giving to Portugal an undue say in the appointment of bishops in India. * He was involved in the negotiations with the French government leading ultimately to a peaceful transfer of the French colonial settlements (Chandannagar, Pondicherry, etc.) to the new Independent India. * On four occasions D’Souza was member of the Indian delegation to the UNO’s yearly general session. * His command of French, Spanish, Italian and German languages, besides English opened him many doors and he was often invited to give talks and lectures on Indian culture, history and politics, in various parts of the world. Indian Social Institute At the request of the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, D’Souza founded in Pune (India) the Indian Social Institute (now in New-Delhi, 10, Institutional Area, Lodhi Road New Delhi), and started publishing a journal Social Action that has nowadays a large circulation in social and academic circles. That was in 1951. He became its first Director (1951–1956). Later, in 1957, D’Souza was made the Assistant and adviser of the Superior General of the Jesuits (Jean-Baptiste Janssens) for Indian and Asian affairs. He returned to India in 1968 and spent his last years writing articles and books, giving lectures and courses. Jerome D’Souza was one of the best known Jesuits of his times. Still many gratefully visit his tomb at Christ the King Church, in Loyola College, Chennai campus. Recognition D'Souza on a 1997 stamp of India In 1997, the Indian government issued a stamp to commemorate his birth centenary.

He has taught composition at the Birmingham Conservatoire since 2000, and since 2005 he has been the Head of Composition there. He is also the co-founder of the instrumental ensemble Noszferatu. Influence During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cutler, like many of his generation, including Americans composers Michael Gordon and David Lang, and British composer Steve Martland, was influenced by the minimalist music of Louis Andriessen. Like Andriessen, Cutler rejected the atonal inheritance of Arnold Schoenberg in favour of the more rhythmically driving music of Igor Stravinsky. In these early works, Cutler showed influences ranging from Minimalism and Andriessen to 1980s avant-garde modernism and even the rhythmic aspects of the New Complexity movement. This is seen in such works as Epitaph for Nebula (1989) and Blast! (1992), where atonality and complicated driving rhythms preside. Works During the 1990s, as Cutler's mature style developed, the complicated rhythms were gradually replaced with simpler, but still motoric, jazz inspired rhythms whilst the atonal element lost ground to allusions to Eastern-European modality and jazz. This is seen in one of his most popular works, Sal's Sax (1996), written for the De Ereprijs Ensemble. In more recent years, Cutler has developed a more lyrical side along with his influences from postminimalism, which led to works such as Awakenings (1998) and Sikorski (2005). In 2008, Cutler won the Chamber Music Category in the BBC Composer Awards with his piece, 'Folk Music'. In 2010, Cutler was one of twenty composers commissioned to write a piece for the London 2012 Olympics. Selected works *Epitaph for Nebula (1989), for mixed ensemble *Blast!

The similar term \\"big break\\" indicates the occurrence for the performer and not the role itself. Such a moment in an actor's career may often occur some time after they begin acting, as their roles become more substantial. A breakthrough role is often a significant increase in importance in the actor's part in the film, such as moving up from a minor character to one of the main cast or a \\"high impact\\" role in a film which has mainstream success and results in the actor's widespread recognition and popularity. A breakthrough performance has also been defined as one which \\"attracts the attention of film critics, or receives rave reviews and is subsequently nominated for many major film awards\\". Most notable performers throughout the film and television industry can pinpoint the role which marked the beginning of their commercial success. For example, the Dollars trilogy was the breakthrough role of Clint Eastwood, while Sean Connery's came with the James Bond film Dr. No, despite both actors having appeared in several films prior to this. Lord Rohan in The Man in Grey has been cited as James Mason's breakthrough performance. The television film adaptation of Gideon's Trumpet has been referenced as Lane Smith's breakthrough role, despite lacking a theatrical release. Similarly, the BBC series Pennies from Heaven has been highlighted as the breakthrough of Bob Hoskins. Brandon Lee's starring role in The Crow has been cited as his breakout, though it was also his final film as he died when a prop gun malfunctioned on the set of the film. Awards Hollywood Life, the Teen Choice Awards, and several others give awards for best \\"Movie Breakout\\" for both an actress and actor.

Furthermore, Jo and Bhagi are ragged in the college before being again rescued by Sanju. Both begin to like Sanju and even decide to propose their love to him without their knowledge of the other. However, it is Jo who proposes first to Sanju, who rejects her. Careful after seeing her friend's love rejected, Bhagi, with the help of Sreenu (Sunil), begins wooing Sanju. Bhagi keeps wooing Sanju in different ways under Sreenu's supervision. Sreenu keeps advising Bhagi with new ideas, so that she impresses Sanju. With his idea, Bhagi vacates the previous tenants in Sanjus' house and gets into that house to woo Sanju. She keeps trying in many ways to impress him, which evokes comedy. Bhagi keeps meeting Sanju, tries to know more about him. After many comical situations coming their way, love blossoms between the two, but unfortunately at a party where Jo is also one of the attendees, he spills all the beans about Bhagi and Sanju is infurated and breaks their relationship. But later that party night in conversation with Bhagi, drunken Sanju begins to showcase that he isn't a correct fit to her, yet the unending love of Bhagi towards Sanju, makes him fall for her and both again get into a relationship marking it with a smooch. Meanwhile, Damodar Reddy (Mukesh Rishi), a powerful land grabber who takes care of all the settlements while still in jail, is out on parole. He is in search of Sanju for spoiling his land deals in the past and thrashing his son, who was one of the goons who chased Bhagi. He makes an attempt on Sanju's life but in vain. However, Sanju's friend Abhi (Ali) is taken hostage during the attack. Sanju rescues Abhi but is enraged when his friends stop him from assaulting the kidnapper by questioning his authority to take law into his hands and bringing them troubles.

Created by Chris Claremont and Sal Buscema, she first appeared in Ms. Marvel 11 (1977). Publication history Fictional character biography Hecate is among the Titans who ruled the ancient world that Zeus spares when he deposes them and conquers Olympus, and becomes Olympus' resident Goddess of Magic. She is the first deity to give magic to mortals, in defiance of Zeus who had forbidden the gods from meddling with humans. Zeus later exiles her from Olympus, wiping her memories and stripping her of her powers.Herc #4 Hecate appears on Earth, claiming to be an extra-dimensional explorer, mistaken for Hecate on a visit to the planet some millennia prior. At one point she fights Ms. Marvel.Ms. Marvel #11-13 At some point, she loses more of her memories and becomes an inmate of the Raft. During the Fear Itself storyline, Hecate is among the Raft inmates who escape after Juggernaut in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone levels it. She assists Basilisk, Griffin, and Man-Bull in a bank robbery until Hercules arrives and recognizes her. Hecate shortly regains her memories, recovers her godly abilities, and decides to take over Brooklyn,Herc #3 reshaping the borough to resemble a monster-infested Ancient Greece.Herc #5 Hercules kills her ally Kyknos and she flees as Brooklyn returns to its normal state.Herc #6 Some time later, the Scarlet Witch seeks out Hecate after sensing a disturbance in witchcraft. She finds her operating a café on a Greek island and asks for her help. Hecate explains that she is content to remain uninvolved with the world of witchcraft, but mentions that there is a magical disturbance on the island, which could support Wanda's theory that magic is broken. She asks Wanda to defeat a Minotaur that has been murdering islanders, and the heroine discovers that the Emerald Warlock, a century-old mage, had forcibly transformed Man-Bull to do his bidding.Scarlet Witch #2 Powers and abilities During her exile, Hecate was solely capable of shapeshifting, projecting energy bolts, and bringing images from others' minds to life. When her memories returned, Hecate regained her Olympian characteristics, which includes superhuman strength (lifting 25 tons), durability, speed, and endurance.Herc #6 She is also immortal and unaging, immune to all human ailments and diseases. As the Olympian goddess of magic, Hecate is an extremely powerful sorceress and has been invoked by mortal magic users in the casting of spells. She can release powerful energy blasts, read other's thoughts, shape-shift, and alter the form of other people and objects. Her skill in magic is so great that when she warped reality around Brooklyn and its inhabitants, she did so without depending on external sources for increased magical power.Herc #6 She also has some influence over dogs and her presence alone causes all canines in a certain radius around her to become vicious.

It is also referred to by the English backronym \\"Vertical Ascent in Meters\\". The term, which was coined by Italian physician and cycling coach Michele Ferrari, is the speed of elevation gain, usually stated in units of metres per hour. Background VAM is a parameter used in cycling as a measure of fitness and speed; it is useful for relatively objective comparisons of performances and estimating a rider's power output per kilogram of body mass, which is one of the most important qualities of a cyclist who competes in stage races and other mountainous events. Dr. Michele Ferrari also stated that VAM values exponentially rise up with every gradient increase. For example, a 1180 VAM of a 64 kg rider on a 5% gradient is equivalent to a VAM of 1400 m/h on a 10 % or a VAM of 1675 m/h on a 13% gradient. Ambient conditions (e.g. friction, air resistance) have less effect on steeper slopes (absorb less power) since speeds are lower on steeper slopes The acronym VAM is not truly expanded in English, where many think the V stands in some way for vertical, and the M represents metres, for instance \\"Vertical Ascent Metres/Hour.\\" Ferrari says, > I called this parameter Average Ascent Speed (‘VAM’ in its Italian > abbreviation from Velocità Ascensionale Media). A direct translation of \\"velocità ascensionale media\\" is \\"mean (average) ascent velocity\\" leading to an expansion of the acronym in English as Velocity, Ascent, Mean. Definition VAM is calculated the following way: :VAM = (metres ascended x 60) / Minutes it took to ascend A standard unit term with the same meaning is Vm/h, vertical metres per hour; the two are used interchangeably. The relationship between VAM and relative power output is expressed as follows: :Relative power (Watts/kg) = VAM (metres/hour) / (Gradient factor x 100) This gradient factor ranges between 2.6 for a gradient of 6% and 3.1 for a gradient of 11%. To work out the gradient factor take 2 + (% grade/10) Examples Examples: > 1800+ Vm/h: Chris Froome. > 1650-1800 Vm/h: Top 10 / Tour de France GC or mountain stage winner. > 1450-1650 Vm/h: Top 20 / Tour de France GC; top 20 on tough mountain stage. > 1300-1450 Vm/h: Finishing Tour de France mountain stages in peloton > 1100-1300 Vm/h: The Autobus Crew > > References External links *Cycling Power Lab - VAM and Relative Power > Calculator Category:Cycling Category:Sports records and statistics > Category:Velocity ","title":"VAM (bicycling)"},{"id":"13111170","text":"Hellfire, in comics, may refer to: *Hellfire, a member of the Elementals *Hellfire (J.

History The Irish Repertory Theatre was founded by Ciarán O'Reilly and Charlotte Moore, which opened its doors in September 1988,http://www.nyc- arts.org/organizations/1963/irish-repertory-theatre with Sean O'Casey's The Plough and the Stars. The mission of the theatre was and remains: > to bring works by Irish and Irish American masters and contemporary > playwrights to American audiences, to provide a context for understanding > the contemporary Irish American experience, and to encourage the development > of new works focusing on the Irish and Irish American experience, as well as > a range of other cultures. In 1995, they made their permanent home in Chelsea on three completely renovated floors of a former warehouse, allowing for both a Main Stage theatre and a smaller studio space, the W. Scott McLucas Studio. The Irish Repertory Theatre is currently the only year-round theatre company in New York City devoted to bringing Irish and Irish American works to the stage. The theater has been recognized with a 2007 Jujamcyn Award, a special Drama Desk Award for \\"Excellence in Presenting Distinguished Irish drama,\\" and the Lucille Lortel Award for \\"Outstanding Body of Work.\\" Its productions draw more than 35,000 audience members annually. In 2014, The Irish Repertory Theatre started a renovation of their home in Chelsea. For the 2014-15 season, Irish Rep's performances were held at the DR2 Theater near Union Square. https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/renovation-plan-sends-irish- reps-season-to-a-temporary-home/ During the holiday seasons of 2016 and 2017, the American Irish Historical Society headquarters on Fifth Avenue was home to the Irish Repertory Theatre's production of The Dead, 1904. The show was an adaptation of James Joyce's The Dead, adapted by novelist Jean Hanff Korelitz and her husband, Irish poet, Paul Muldoon. For The Dead, 1904, the building had 57 guests at a time, who for part of the performance joined the cast for a holiday feast drawn from the original novella.\\"Irish Rep Brings James Joyce’s “The Dead” to Life\\", Hilton Als, The New Yorker, December 4, 2017 In 2017, the company received an Obie Grant from the Obie Awards presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Village Voice.Obie Awards, 2017 Winner.

Scholars have acknowledged his great influence on later Byzantine saints such as Maximos the Confessor, John Climacus, Symeon the New Theologian, and in general the Hesychast movement of the 14th century. He has also had great influence in the West via the work, \\"On the Contemplative Life\\" (De vita contemplativa) of Julian Pomerius (†498). His feast day is commemorated on March 29.  Life  Diadochos was born c. 400 and died sometime before 486. He became bishop of Photiki, a small town in the province of Old Epira, in the northwestern part of present-day Greece. In 451, he took part in the Council of Chalcedon as Bishop of Photiki. He was most likely part of a group of Epiran notables who were captured during a Vandal raid between 467 and 474. The group was later released in North Africa, somewhere around Carthage, from whence all vanished. His exact date and place of death are thus unknown, although it is assumed he died before 486. Writings Diadochos' writing and ascetic practice were greatly influenced by Evagrius the Solitary (also known as Evagrius Ponticus) and Saint Macarius of Egypt (the Great), incorporating their ideas of hesychia (Greek ἡσυχία, \\"stillness, rest, quiet\\"), sensible spiritual experience, and the fierceness of the fight against the demons. The Hundred Chapters In all his work, Diadochos appears as a true champion of the doctrine of Chalcedon. In fact, his best-known work, On Spiritual Knowledge and Discrimination (known as the \\"Hundred Chapters\\" or \\"Hundred Texts\\"), was written for his monks in reaction to strange doctrines coming from the heretical Messalian sect in Mesopotamia (also known as Euchites). Some authors have misunderstood the role of Saint Macarius in Mesopotamia and concluded that Diadochos wrote this main work against him. This, however, is not the case, as Macarius' role was merely to salvage from within the Messalian heresy those who were there by chance or just misled by the ambiguous discourses of the unorthodox doctrine. In the 100 Chapters, Diadochos shows himself as a bishop worried about the orthodoxy of his flock and as a clear actor in the spiritual fights of his time. Also, Chapters 13 and 91 of his work show readers a real Christian man of prayer, united to God, discovering the \\"life in Christ\\" and wanting to share its goodness with his readers. Sometimes, this work has been referred to as the Gnostic Chapters; however, this can be misleading, as \\"Gnostic\\" in this case refers to theoria (the knowledge of God), relating to its Biblical usage, and not to the early Christian sects of Gnosticism, which are considered heretical by Orthodox Christians. Quote from Chapters 11 & 12: > Spiritual discourse always keeps the soul free from self-esteem, for it > gives every part of the soul a sense of light, so that it no longer needs > the praise of men. In the same way, such discourse keeps the mind free from > fantasy, infusing it completely with the Love of God. Discourse deriving > from the wisdom of this world, on the other hand, always provokes self- > esteem; because it is incapable of granting us the experience of spiritual > perception, it inspires its practitioners with a longing for praise, it > being nothing but the fabrication of conceited men. It follows, therefore, > that we can know with certainty when we are in the proper state to speak > about God if during the hours when we do not speak we maintain a fervent > remembrance of God in untroubled silence. > Whoever loves himself cannot love God; but if, because of 'the overflowing > richness' of God's love, a man does not love himself, then he truly loves > God (Ephes. 2,7). Such a man never seeks his own glory, but seeks the glory > of God. The man who loves himself seeks his own glory, whereas he who loves > God loves the glory of his Creator. It is characteristic of the soul which > consciously senses the Love of God always to seek God's glory in every > Commandment it performs and to be happy in its low estate. For glory befits > God because of His majesty, while lowliness befits man because it unites us > with God. If we realize this, rejoicing in the glory of the Lord, we too, > like Saint John the Baptist, will begin to say unceasingly, 'He must > increase, but we must decrease.'

After attending Westtown School, an orthodox Quaker school in Chester County, Pennsylvania, Shinn worked for several years as a conveyancer in Philadelphia. In 1859 he took his first step toward a career in art by enrolling in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to study drawing and painting. He remained at the Academy until 1863 (presumably declining to serve in the Union army because of his religious beliefs). The following year, Shinn moved to New York City and worked as a staff writer for the weekly publication Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. In April 1866, after having returned to Philadelphia as a result of his parents' deaths the summer before, Shinn, accompanied by his sculptor friend Howard Roberts, traveled to France with the goal of continuing his studies in drawing and painting at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. When he arrived in Paris later that spring, the school had suspended its enrollment of foreign students. He and Roberts connected with Robert Wylie, a former curator at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts living in Paris, who convinced the two of them to join him that summer in Pont-Aven, a village on the Breton coast that would later become a destination for Paul Gauguin and other Post-Impressionists. Despite expressing doubts about his abilities as a painter in a letter to his sister, Shinn resumed his efforts to gain admittance to the École des Beaux-Arts upon his return to Paris that fall and was finally successful, thanks, according to Shinn, to the persistent cajoling of government officials by Thomas Eakins, another young Philadelphia painter who overlapped with Shinn at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Shinn studied at the Ecole for a little over one year in the atelier of Jean-Léon Gérôme, a well-regarded painter of classical and Oriental scenes. Shinn returned to Philadelphia in spring of 1868.  As art critic  Shinn's doubts about his painting abilities never left him during his time in France. By the end of his studies at the Ecole, he had resolved that his would not be the life of a painter, thanks in large part, it seems, to his poor eyesight. He wrote to his sister in 1867, \\"Art I should like, and I have a vocation for it; but I think my near-sightedness, color-blindness and failing vision are pretty strong hints from nature that that career is not intended for me...\\"Earl Shinn to Anna Shinn Shipley, July 3, 1867. Richard Tapper Cadbury Collection, Friends Historical Library, Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Already in summer of 1866, while he was in Pont-Aven, Shinn looked again to writing for newspapers and magazines. He wrote regular pieces about his experiences there for the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin and had two similar pieces published by the fledgling magazine The Nation. In 1869, in the United States again, Shinn wrote a series of articles about his experiences at the École des Beaux-Arts for The Nation, cementing his relationship with the magazine's founding editor, E.L. Godkin. By this time he was living in New York again, where he would principally reside until his death. Shinn spent several months in Philadelphia in 1872 to write a series of ten articles for Lippincott's Magazine on private art collections of wealthy Philadelphians, the start of an increasingly all-consuming interest of his in private art collections. After returning to New York, he continued to contribute art criticism to The Nation and took the helm as art editor of the magazine from 1874 to 1879. From 1879 to 1884, Shinn contributed semi-regularly to the magazine The Art Amateur. He usually wrote anonymously or included his initials at the end of his articles. Shinn saw as the principal aim of art the instruction of the public and the elevation of public taste and often championed in his writing the public art institutions that were being established in the years following the American Civil War, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C. During the 1870s and 1880s, Shinn wrote a number of books on art (under the pseudonym \\"Edward Strahan\\"), including a catalogue of the art gallery at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and a retrospective of the work of his former instructor Jean-Léon Gérôme. His most famous works are the two multi-volume publications he wrote on the private art collections of wealthy Americans: The Art Treasures of America (published as a serial between 1879 and 1882) and Mr. Vanderbilt's House and Collection (published, again as a serial, between 1883 and 1884), in which he reviewed the art collection at William Henry Vanderbilt's New York mansion. Perhaps more than any other contemporary work, these two books shed light on the tastes and collecting habits of American art collectors in the Gilded Age. Shinn was also a member of the Tile Club, a group of New York artists and writers whose membership included Winslow Homer, William Merritt Chase, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. He wrote the first two chapters of A Book of the Tile Club before his death in New York in 1886.

In particular, the project examined the relationship between the Stones and surrounding monuments and features, including the River Avon, Durrington Walls, the Cursus, the Avenue, Woodhenge, burial mounds, and nearby standing stones. The project involved a substantial amount of fieldwork and ran from 2003 to 2009. It found that Stonehenge was built 500 years earlier than previously thought. The monument is believed to have been built to unify the peoples of Britain. It also found a previously unknown stone circle, Bluestonehenge.  Background  The project was directed by Mike Parker Pearson (Sheffield University), Julian Thomas (Manchester University), Colin Richards (Manchester University), Kate Welham (Bournemouth University), Joshua Pollard (University of Southampton), and Chris Tilley (University College London). The main aims of the project were to test the hypotheses of earlier studies that Stonehenge was a monument dedicated to the dead, whilst Woodhenge and Durrington Walls, two miles away, were monuments to the living and more recently deceased.  Previous excavations  The area immediately inside Stonehenge Bowl has been excavated several times throughout history, but to the east around Durrington Walls, there have only been two major studies conducted within recent times. The first was between 1926 and 1929 when Maud Cunnington excavated around Woodhenge, discovering several Neolithic and Bronze Age features to the south. Later, when the nearby A345 was improved and routed through Durrington Walls in 1967, two timber circles were discovered within the henge. Also discovered were quantities of animal bones and associated Neolithic pottery and tools.  Fieldwork   2003 surveys  2003 fieldwork involved sampling and geophysical surveys of the land around Durrington Walls in preparation for future study. This work helped identify two previously unrecognised entranceways to the henge, to the north and south.  2004 excavations  2004 marked the start of annual excavations in the Stonehenge landscape. Trenches were dug on the bank of the River Avon next to Durrington Walls, and at the eastern entrance to the henge. On this occasion various finds suggesting Neolithic occupation were found around the area.  2005 excavations  More fieldwork was carried out in the summer of 2005. Excavations were made around the land east of Durrington Walls near the river, and north west outside the west gate. A large amount of digging was done on the eastern banks of the henge, and inside the walls to expose the southernmost timber circle discovered in 1967. A great deal of work was also carried out 2 miles east, around a fallen sarsen stone known locally as the Bulford Stone. Channel 4's archaeological television programme Time Team attended and built a temporary reconstruction of the timber circle in the nearby village of Upavon.  2006  Over 20 researchers and 170 students and volunteers were involved in excavations around Durrington Walls and investigations into the Stonehenge landscape. Among other things, new dating suggested that the sarsen phase of Stonehenge was contemporary with Durrington Walls at around 2640–2480 BC.  2007 excavations  In late summer of 2007, four weeks of fieldwork was carried out by several hundred students and volunteers. Excavations were carried out at the western end of the Cursus; around the southern, western and eastern gates of Durrington Walls; at the site of Cunnington's digs immediately south of Woodhenge; and around another nearby fallen sarsen stone, known locally as the Cuckoo Stone. Geophysical surveys were also carried out across much of the surrounding area and around Stonehenge Bowl. Residencies for six artists and two graduate art student placements were arranged by Artists in Archaeology to record the processes of uncovering and interpreting this location.  2008 excavations  In the late summer of 2008, a further four weeks of excavations were carried out. The year's excavation focused largely upon the Avenue, largely re-excavating work by Richard Atkinson. More work was carried out upon the eastern end of the Stonehenge Cursus, Long Barrow 42 at the eastern terminal of the Cursus, the field to the west of Stonehenge, and a re-excavation of one of the Aubrey Holes within the Stonehenge bowl. The excavation was covered by Time Team but was also covered by Nova and National Geographic. Residencies for six visual artists were arranged by Artists in Archaeology, to explore connections between archaeological processes and artistic practices. In 2008, and again in 2009, the team excavated the remains of a henge beside the river, about south- east of Stonehenge. The discovery attracted media coverage and the name \\"Bluehenge\\" or \\"Bluestonehenge\\".  Stonehenge as a cemetery  Stonehenge is effectively Britain's largest third millennium BC cemetery, containing 52 cremation burials and many other fragments of both burnt and unburnt bone. Many of the cremation deposits contained more than one individual, so that an estimate of the number of people buried here during that period may be between 150 and 240. In 2007 the Stonehenge Riverside Project and the Beaker People Project jointly embarked upon a radiocarbon dating programme of the surviving skeletal remains to establish when Stonehenge was used as a burial space. As a result of this, it is argued that the site began as a cremation cemetery in the early third millennium BC. Conclusion The research concluded that Stonehenge was built to unify the people of Stone Age Britain. The results were published in a 2012 book Stonehenge, Exploring the Greatest Stone Age Mystery by Mike Parker Pearson.

It can also be known as a belly mask, pregnancy belly cast, a pregnant plaster cast, or prenatal cast. Belly casts are most often made toward the end of the third trimester of pregnancy, though a series of casts may also be made during the pregnancy. They are made by preparing the skin with a coating of Vaseline or a similar lubricant and adding strips of wet plaster gauze over the abdomen to make the cast. Some women also cast their breasts, arms, hands and thighs into a full torso sculpture. The plaster sets in about 20–30 minutes but some fast-setting strips set in five minutes. Once set, the cast is gently removed by the mother using a wriggling motion. It takes one or two days for the cast to dry completely. Gesso can be painted onto the mask after drying to stop it absorbing moisture from the air. Gesso also works as a surface primer for painting and preserving it. The cast can be decorated with any number of finishes or designs including the baby's hand and foot prints, or left in its natural state. Most popular decorations include painting and decoupage, while some belly casts are mosaicked.

He chaired the special academic commission for the Rustaveli studies since 1963 and became the founder and an editor-in-chief of The Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia in 1967. His poems are viewed as classical works of Georgian literature. His poetry was mostly patriotic based on Georgian cultural and religious values, but normally loyal to Soviet ideology. He welcomed Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika and supported the Soviet-era dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia when he came to power and led Georgia to the declaration of independence in 1991.

The documentary spans a nearly 20-year period, beginning before the First Intifada, to demonstrate how the nation's politics affect their neighborly relations. The film won Best Editing at the Haifa International Film Festival. Summary \\"They say a good neighbor is better than a distant brother,\\" Abu Bassem says, \\"If Ariel Sharon was a good neighbor, I'd be happy to have him as a neighbor.\\" With a matter-of-fact air and straightforward filming, Shalom Abu Bassem evaluates the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on an intimate, human scale, where a simple hello means a great deal. Abu and Danny both want peace for the sake of their children and make efforts to prove to the camera that they're reasonable, nonprejudicial men. But their noble intentions are tested over time, as waves of violence pass over the city, leaving blood stains on the cobble stone streets that lead to their homes. Haladiya Street, where Abu and Danny both live, was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood until 1936, when riots broke out, killing countless innocent Jews and driving the rest of them out of their homes. Over time, Jews began to return, and before the First Intifada the neighborhood served as an example of relatively peaceful coexistence. But in the late 1980s, when violence broke out throughout Israel, the tension mounted in the neighborhood, and since then peace has been too short lived for the residents to fully relax and regain trust in one another. Full of stubborn will, Abu and Danny both believe Haladiya Street is their rightful home. \\"It's a disgrace for an Arab to sell his house,\\" Abu asserts, \\"It's like selling his faith ... like selling his child.\\" Equally as passionate, Danny explains that it's been a lifelong dream to live in the holy city. It's because they're unwilling to budge that they're forced to live as neighbors. But living in one of the most dangerous areas in the world has consequences. During the First Intifada, Danny left his home to buy bananas for his son. When he entered the market he felt uneasy, sensing something awful was going to happen. Before he had time to think, in broad daylight, a young Arab man pushed him to the ground and stabbed him in the back. With the help of emergency medical assistance, he survived. And although he still plays with the little Arab children on his street and says \\"shalom\\" to Abu, Abu sense a new, brooding distrust in Danny. The documentary reveals how a fear of the unknown can lead to grand misconceptions. For years, the Arabs living on Haladiya Street are convinced that the yeshiva at the end of the block is a place of evil plotting. But when the filmmaker happens to gain entrance into the secret locked doors, he finds that instead of sinister planning the students are busing themselves playing on keyboards, dancing and praying. While it's clear that peace in Israel won't come about easily, the documentary suggests that the steps towards a harmonious coexistence between the Jews and Arabs are simple. In fact, they're as simple as a few kind words. \\"We hate whoever hates us. We respect those who respect us,\\" Abu explains. And respect is felt not only in grand political speeches and abstract negotiations, but also through simple courtesies and routine manners. \\"I need someone to say hello to me,\\" Abu confides. Production Reception Shalom Abu Bassem shares the story of two neighbors who serve as a microcosm of the Israeli experience. The film was praised for presenting the conflict in Israel on a human level—instead of addressing it with talking heads and politicians in a sterile room. It was seen as an emotional and provocative documentary that allows people on both sides of the debate to look with compassion on their opposition and see the conflict from the opposite perspective. It's said that the documentary's lack of resolve allows for realism. While the film received mostly praise, one critic complained that the filmmaker's subtle editing decisions created a bias that followed in Michael Moore's tradition of documentaries with an agenda. Awards and Festivals Shalom Abu Bassem won Best Editing at the Haifa International Film Festival in 2004.

Congress established the MAFFS program after the 1970 Laguna Fire overwhelmed the existing aviation firefighting resources. The USFS was directed to develop a program in cooperation with the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to produce the equipment, training and operational procedures to integrate military air tankers into the national response system. The Engineered Systems Division of FMC Corporation (Santa Clara, CA) was contracted to design, build and test the modular tank system that would enable a standard C-130 to be quickly converted into a tanker. Initial flight tests with a prototype two-tank installation began in July 1971.Francillon 1993, pp. 73–74. Subsequent systems were fabricated by Aero Union of Chico, California. The MAFFS consists of a series of five pressurized fire retardant tanks with a total capacity of and associated equipment which is palletized and carried in the aircraft's cargo bay. In addition to the retardant tanks, each module contains a pressure tank where compressed air is stored at 82.7 bar (1200 psi). The control module includes the master control panel, the loadmaster's seat, and discharge valves. An air compressor module provides air pressure for charging the system; it stays at the airtanker base during air operations and is used to recharge the system between runs. Each unit weighs about . It can be installed in any C-130-E or -H equipped with the USAF 463L cargo-handling system. Air tankers are categorized by their retardant capacity, and although the MAFFS capacity is just under , a MAFFS C-130 is considered a Type 1 air tanker, which is the largest class.Air tanker listing by type, from Associated Airtanker Pilots website Retardant exits through two tubes which extend out the plane's aft cargo bay doors. The system can disperse all 10,220 L (2,700 gal) in five seconds over a fire, producing a fire line that is wide and a quarter mile (400 m) long. It can then be reloaded in eight minutes. Maffs Corp. is a combination of two leading aftermarket support companies, United Aeronautical Corporation and Blue Aerospace. As an owner of some applicable intellectual property, tooling, and assets related to the design and manufacturing of retardant delivery systems including MAFFS I and II and RADS II, Maffs Corp assists with the service and support of existing systems as well as the design and construction of new aerial tanking and effluent delivery systems.http://www.maffs.com MAFFS II Aero Union, under contract to the USFS, has developed an improved version of the system, known as the MAFFS II. The new system has a capacity of up to , replacing the five retardant tanks with one large tank, and has two on-board air compressors. The original MAFFS has to be pressurized by a compressor on the ground as a part of the loading process. The ability to pressurize the system in the air cuts turn-around time significantly.MAFFS 2 information from USFS The new system discharges the retardant through a special plug in the paratroop drop door on the side of the aircraft, rather than requiring the cargo ramp door to be opened; this allows the aircraft to remain pressurized during the drop sequence.Aero Union press release, July 27, 2007 Far more significantly, the cargo ramp and door can remain closed, cutting drag considerably, and thereby allowing a greater performance margin than available with MAFFS I. Aero Union delivered the first production unit to the USFS in July 2007, and was flight tested during August. MAFFS II was used for the first time on a fire in July 2008, when a crew from the 302d Airlift Wing launched from McClellan Tanker Base in California on an operational test using a C-130H. Operations MAFFS I drop, Black Crater, Oregon, July 2006 View of a MAFFS drop from the C-130's rear cargo door MAFFS equipment is stationed at eight locations around the United States. They are considered a \\"24-hour resource\\", meaning that when activated, it is expected that it will take 24 hours for the aircraft to arrive on scene, as the C-130s have to be pulled from their regular military duties and fitted with the MAFFS equipment. When needed, regional foresters can request a MAFFS activation after they have ascertained that all available commercial air tankers are assigned to on-going incidents or committed to an initial attack.MAFFS policy and responsibilities The National Interagency Coordination Center at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), Boise, Idaho, can activate the MAFFS when all other contract airtankers are committed to incidents or initial attack or are otherwise unable to meet requests for air operations. The request for MAFFS activation is approved by the national MAFFS liaison officer, who is the Forest Service director at NIFC. This request is then forwarded to the joint director of military support at the Pentagon. Governors of states where National Guard MAFFS units are stationed may activate MAFFS for missions within their state boundaries when covered by a memorandum of understanding with the military authority and the Forest Service. During the 1994 fire season, one of the worst during that decade, the four airlift wings equipped with MAFFS flew nearly 2,000 missions and dropped of retardant. In 2004, after all the large civilian tankers in the U.S. had been grounded due to safety concerns, MAFFS- equipped C-130s were pre-positioned in western states in anticipation of wildfires.\\"Firefighting aircraft deploy to Arizona\\", USAF press release, 2004-05-25 Besides use on U.S. fires, MAFFS has been deployed to Mexico, Europe, Africa and Indonesia. International deployment is initiated by a foreign government's request through the U.S. State Department. The military is reimbursed for the cost of operating MAFFS flights by the agency having jurisdiction over the fire.California Department of Forestry MAFFS information MAFFS is in use in the Colombian Air Force, Brazilian Air Force, Royal Moroccan Air Force and the Royal Thai Air Force C-130s. It was also formerly used in the Portuguese Air Force C-130s. Training MAFFS crews are trained every year with USFS aviation operations personnel. The training is coordinated with the Air Force Reserve's 302d Airlift Wing at Colorado's Peterson Air Force Base, the Air National Guard's 153d Airlift Wing from Cheyenne, Wyoming, the 146th Airlift Wing from Port Hueneme, California, and the 152nd Airlift Wing from Reno, Nevada. In January 2010, a mobile training team from the 302d Airlift Wing deployed to Thailand to train members of the 601 Transport Squadron at Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base in the use of MAFFS.

Plot The central character, Jean-Christophe Krafft, is a German musician of Belgian extraction, a composer of genius whose life is depicted from cradle to grave. He undergoes great hardships and spiritual struggles, balancing his pride in his own talents with the necessity of earning a living and taking care of those around him. Tormented by injustices against his friends, forced to flee on several occasions as a result of his brushes with authority and his own conscience, he finally finds peace in a remote corner of Switzerland before returning in triumph to Paris a decade later. Criticism Although Rolland first conceived the work in Rome in the spring of 1890, he began in earnest in 1903 after publishing a biography of Beethoven. A letter of 13 September 1902 reveals his plans: :My novel is the story of a life, from birth to death. My hero is a great German musician who is forced by circumstances to leave when he is 16-18 years old, living outside of Germany in Paris, Switzerland, etc. The setting is today's Europe [...] To spell it out, the hero is Beethoven in the modern world. But in his preface to Dans la maison, published in 1909, Rolland denied that he was writing a novel in the traditional sense, but a \\"musical novel\\" in which emotions, not classical action, dictated the course of events. \\"When you see a man, do you ask yourself whether he is a novel or a poem? [...] Jean-Christophe has always seemed to me to flow like a river; I have said as much from the first pages.\\" This coined the term roman-fleuve (river-novel), which has since been applied to other novel sequences in the same style. Many individual tomes swerve from the story of Krafft to focus on the other characters. Rolland was an admirer of Leo Tolstoy, and, as in War and Peace, a very large proportion of the work is devoted to the author's thoughts on various subjects: music, art, literature, feminism, militarism, national character, and social changes in the Third Republic, largely attributed to Krafft, although Rolland denied that he shared many traits with his fictional composer. The didactic aspects of Jean-Christophe have been criticised by many readers. In his heavy use of matter-of-fact detail, Rolland followed the methods of naturalist predecessors with whom he otherwise had little in common.

It is often used for scanning of intermodal freight shipping containers. In the US it is spearheaded by the Department of Homeland Security and its Container Security Initiative (CSI) trying to achieve one hundred percent cargo scanning by 2012\\"100% Cargo Scanning Passes Congress\\" article in \\"FedEx Trade Networks\\" (Aug. 02, 72007) as required by the US Congress and recommended by the 9/11 Commission. In the US the main purpose of scanning is to detect special nuclear materials (SNMs), with the added bonus of detecting other types of suspicious cargo. In other countries the emphasis is on manifest verification, tariff collection and the identification of contraband.U.S. Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce – SAIC'S VACIS(R) Cargo, Vehicle and Contraband Inspection Systems to Be Installed in Azerbaijan In February 2009, approximately 80% of US incoming containers were scanned. To bring that number to 100% researchers are evaluating numerous technologies, described in the following sections.http://containproject.com/ CONTAIN – Container Security Advanced Information Networking Radiography Gamma- ray radiography Gamma-ray image of a shipping container showing two stowaways hidden inside Gamma-ray image of a truck showing goods inside a shipping container A truck entering a gamma-ray radiography system Gamma-ray radiography systems capable of scanning trucks usually use cobalt-60 or caesium-137 as a radioactive source and a vertical tower of gamma detectors. This gamma camera is able to produce one column of an image. The horizontal dimension of the image is produced by moving either the truck or the scanning hardware. The cobalt-60 units use gamma photons with a mean energy 1.25 MeV, which can penetrate up to 15–18 cm of steel. The systems provide good quality images which can be used for identifying cargo and comparing it with the manifest, in an attempt to detect anomalies. It can also identify high-density regions too thick to penetrate, which would be the most likely to hide nuclear threats. X-ray radiography X-ray radiography is similar to gamma-ray radiography but instead of using a radioactive source, it uses a high-energy bremsstrahlung spectrum with energy in the 5–10 MeV range created by a linear particle accelerator (LINAC). Such X-ray systems can penetrate up to 30–40 cm of steel in vehicles moving with velocities up to 13 km/h. They provide higher penetration but also cost more to buy and operate. They are more suitable for the detection of special nuclear materials than gamma-ray systems. They also deliver about 1000 times higher dose of radiation to potential stowaways. Dual-energy X-ray radiography Dual-energy X-ray radiography Backscatter X-ray radiography Backscatter X-ray radiography Neutron activation systems Examples of neutron activation systems include: pulsed fast neutron analysis (PFNA), fast neutron analysis (FNA), and thermal neutron analysis (TNA). All three systems are based on neutron interactions with the inspected items and examining the resultant gamma rays to determine the elements being radiated. TNA uses thermal neutron capture to generate the gamma rays. FNA and PFNA use fast neutron scattering to generate the gamma rays. Additionally, PFNA uses a pulsed collimated neutron beam. With this, PFNA generates a three-dimensional elemental image of the inspected item. Passive radiation detectors Muon tomography Cosmic radiation image identifying muon production mechanisms in Earth's atmosphere Muon tomography is a technique that uses cosmic ray muons to generate three-dimensional images of volumes using information contained in the Coulomb scattering of the muons. Since muons are much more deeply penetrating than X-rays, muon tomography can be used to image through much thicker material than x-ray based tomography such as CT scanning. The muon flux at the Earth's surface is such that a single muon passes through a volume the size of a human hand per second. Muon imaging was originally proposed and demonstrated by Alvarez.\\"Secrets of the pyramids\\" The method was re-discovered and improved upon by a research team at Los Alamos National Laboratory,\\"Muon radiography\\" by Brian Fishbine from Los Alamos National Laboratory\\"Muons for Peace\\" by Mark Wolverton in Scientific American muon tomography is completely passive, exploiting naturally occurring cosmic radiation. This makes the technology ideal for high throughput scanning of volume material where operators are present, such as at a marine cargo terminal. In these cases, truck drivers and customs personnel do not have to leave the vehicle or exit an exclusion zone during scanning, expediting cargo throughput. Multi-mode passive detection systems (MMPDS), based upon muon tomography, are currently in use by Decision Sciences International Corporation at Freeport, Bahamas,\\"Dr. Stanton D. Sloane of Decision Sciences looks at how passive detection systems can play their part in protecting the global supply chain\\" by Cargo Security International and the Atomic Weapons Establishment in the United Kingdom.\\"Decision Sciences Awarded Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) Contract for Nuclear Detection System.\\" An MMPDS system has also been contracted by Toshiba to determine the location and the condition of the nuclear fuel in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.\\"Cosmic Rays to pinpoint Fukushima cores\\" by World Nuclear News Gamma radiation detectors Radiological materials emit gamma photons, which gamma radiation detectors, also called radiation portal monitors (RPM), are good at detecting. Systems currently used in US ports (and steel mills) use several (usually 4) large PVT panels as scintillators and can be used on vehicles moving up to 16 km/h. They provide very little information on energy of detected photons, and as a result, they were criticized for their inability to distinguish gammas originating from nuclear sources from gammas originating from a large variety of benign cargo types that naturally emit radioactivity, including bananas, cat litter, granite, porcelain, stoneware, etc. Those naturally occurring radioactive materials, called NORMs account for 99% of nuisance alarms. Some radiation, like in the case of large loads of bananas is due to potassium and its rarely occurring (0.0117%) radioactive isotope potassium-40, other is due to radium or uranium that occur naturally in earth and rock, and cargo types made out of them, like cat litter or porcelain. Radiation originating from earth is also a major contributor to background radiation. Another limitation of gamma radiation detectors is that gamma photons can be easily suppressed by high-density shields made from lead or steel, preventing detection of nuclear sources. Those types of shields do not stop fission neutrons produced by plutonium sources, however. As a result, radiation detectors usually combine gamma and neutron detectors, making shielding only effective for certain uranium sources. Neutron radiation detectors Fissile materials emit neutrons. Some nuclear materials, such as the weapons usable plutonium-239, emit large quantities of neutrons, making neutron detection a useful tool to search for such contraband. Radiation Portal Monitors often use Helium-3 based detectors to search for neutron signatures. However, a global supply shortage of He-3 has led to the search for other technologies for neutron detection.

It has gone on record supporting campaigns which aim to end rough sleeping in the UK. Its own campaigns include the following:  Super- strength drinks  A call for super strength drinks to be taxed more heavily. Thames Reach is lobbying Government for tax changes as part of a campaign to reduce the availability of these drinks which it claims have caused devastation among marginalised and homeless people. It is also lobbying the UK drinks industry to stick to their corporate responsibility policies and to consider removing the products from sale.  Begging and drugs  It has also campaigned on the issue of begging. It believes that, contrary to popular perception, most people who beg are not sleeping rough, and are using the money they receive to fuel a drug or alcohol addiction. It believes that these people are in need of support but that giving money to them exacerbates their problems and that the cash often ends up in the hands of drug dealers. It achieved a great deal of publicity for its message with a poster which went up across London showing a body made up of coins alongside the message that 'Your kindness could kill'. The poster received criticism from some quarters but was seen by others as debunking some of the myths about begging and homelessness in the UK.  Young olds  The charity launched a campaign to highlight the problems faced by the 'young olds'– vulnerable, middle aged, former rough sleepers who have debilitating health problems more commonly associated with pensioners. Thames Reach coined the term 'young olds' to describe individuals, who may be suffering from Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome aged between forty and their mid fifties who are typically suffering from heart disease and liver disease, brain damage, poor mobility, loss of memory and incontinence. The problems faced by 'young olds' are caused predominantly by heavy drinking – often linked with the consumption of super strength lagers and ciders – and by years spent sleeping rough on the streets. Many engage in challenging behaviour, some have problems with hard drugs and some have mental health issues. It now aims to influence local authorities such that they fund specialist, long-term accommodation based upon people's needs rather than their age. Research undertaken by Thames Reach indicates that the phenomenon is a growing one and currently affects hundreds of vulnerable people across London.

Overview The album was produced by The Who's guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, who was also responsible for the band's initial formation.Sleeve notes on 1996 CD reissue of Speedy Keen solo album Y'Know Wot I Mean? (Island / Edsel EDCD 462) Townshend helped the group to obtain a recording contract with Track Records, a company formed by Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, who were managers of The Who. Townshend also played bass on the album, credited under the pseudonym \\"Bijou Drains\\", although the later CD releases do not credit him.Sleeve notes on 1991 CD reissue of Hollywood Dream (PolyGram / Polydor 833 794-2) Track Records licensed the recordings to Atlantic Records for initial release in the U.S. The group's first single, \\"Something in the Air\\", was a UK number 1 hit and is the song for which Thunderclap Newman are best known. The single also reached #37 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. The album was recorded after the initial U.K. success of the first single. The original 1970 release opened with \\"Hollywood #1\\", with the title track, an instrumental by young guitarist Jimmy McCulloch, appearing toward the end of Side 2. The album then culminated in a reprise of the opener, \\"Hollywood #2\\" (featuring a miscellany of instruments including soprano saxophones, glockenspiel, sleigh bells, a Japanese battle cymbal and a Chinese temple block), and finally \\"Something in the Air\\". In 1973 the album was reissued in the U.S. with different cover art by MCA Records. For its CD release in 1991, \\"Something in the Air\\" was moved to the start of the record. This version also added the single versions of \\"Something In The Air\\" (the single version's mix differed from the album version), \\"Accidents\\" and \\"The Reason\\", and the three non-album B-sides as bonus tracks. \\"Something in the Air\\" makes a brief appearance in the 1969 film The Magic Christian starring Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr. It also appears on the accompanying soundtrack LP. The song also appears in the movie The Strawberry Statement and the movie's soundtrack album.

(2010) SGDs are important for people who have limited means of interacting verbally, as they allow individuals to become active participants in communication interactions. They are particularly helpful for patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but recently have been used for children with predicted speech deficiencies.Blischak et al (2003) There are several input and display methods for users of varying abilities to make use of SGDs. Some SGDs have multiple pages of symbols to accommodate a large number of utterances, and thus only a portion of the symbols available are visible at any one time, with the communicator navigating the various pages. Speech-generating devices can produce electronic voice output by using digitized recordings of natural speech or through speech synthesis—which may carry less emotional information but can permit the user to speak novel messages.Glennen & Decoste pp. 88–90 The content, organization, and updating of the vocabulary on an SGD is influenced by a number of factors, such at the user's needs and the contexts that the device will be used in. The development of techniques to improve the available vocabulary and rate of speech production is an active research area. Vocabulary items should be of high interest to the user, be frequently applicable, have a range of meanings, and be pragmatic in functionality. There are multiple methods of accessing messages on devices: directly or indirectly, or using specialized access devices—although the specific access method will depend on the skills and abilities of the user. SGD output is typically much slower than speech, although rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output, resulting in enhanced efficiency of communication. The first known SGD was prototyped in the mid-1970s, and rapid progress in hardware and software development has meant that SGD capabilities can now be integrated into devices like smartphones. Notable users of SGDs include Stephen Hawking, Roger Ebert, Tony Proudfoot, and Pete Frates (founder of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge). Speech-generating systems may be dedicated devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated devices such as computers running additional software to allow them to function as AAC devices.Glennen, pp. 62–63.Jans & Clark (1998), pp. 37–38. History The patient-operated selector mechanism (POSM or POSSUM), was developed in the early 1960s SGDs have their roots in early electronic communication aids. The first such aid was a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the patient-operated selector mechanism (POSSUM) prototyped by Reg Maling in the United Kingdom in 1960.Vanderheide (2002)Zangari (1994) POSSUM scanned through a set of symbols on an illuminated display. Researchers at Delft University in the Netherlands created the lightspot operated typewriter (LOT) in 1970, which made use of small movements of the head to point a small spot of light at a matrix of characters, each equipped with a photoelectric cell. Although it was commercially unsuccessful, the LOT was well received by its users.Stassen et al., p. 127 In 1966, Barry Romich, a freshman engineering student at Case Western Reserve University, and Ed Prentke, an engineer at Highland View Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio formed a partnership, creating the Prentke Romich Company.PRC History In 1969, the company produced its first communication device, a typing system based on a discarded Teletype machine. During the 1970s and early 1980s, several other companies began to emerge that have since become prominent manufacturers of SGDs. Toby Churchill founded Toby Churchill Ltd in 1973, after losing his speech following encephalitis.Toby Churchill (About Us) In the US, Dynavox (then known as Sentient Systems Technology) grew out of a student project at Carnegie-Mellon University, created in 1982 to help a young woman with cerebral palsy to communicate.Dynavox (Company History) Beginning in the 1980s, improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, and a reduction in their size and price. Alternative methods of access such as Target Scanning (also known as eye pointing) calibrate the movement of a user's eyes to direct an SGD to produce the desired speech phase. Scanning, in which alternatives are presented to the user sequentially, became available on communication devices.Hourcade (2004). Speech output possibilities included both digitized and synthesized speech. Rapid progress in hardware and software development continued, including projects funded by the European Community. The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of communication boards. High-tech devices have continued to become smaller and lighter, while increasing accessibility and capability; communication devices can be accessed using eye-tracking systems, perform as a computer for word- processing and Internet use, and as an environmental control device for independent access to other equipment such as TV, radio and telephones.Robitaille, pp. 151–153. Stephen Hawking came to be associated with the unique voice of his particular synthesis equipment. Hawking was unable to speak due to a combination of severe disabilities caused by ALS, and an emergency tracheotomy.Stephen Hawking and ALS In the past 20 or so years SGD have gained popularity amongst young children with speech deficiencies, such as autism, Down syndrome, and predicted brain damage due to surgery. Starting in the early 2000s, specialists saw the benefit of using SGDs not only for adults but for children, as well. Neuro-linguists found that SGDs were just as effective in helping children who were at risk for temporary language deficits after undergoing brain surgery as it is for patients with ALS. In particular, digitized SGDs have been used as communication aids for pediatric patients during the recovery process. Access methods There are many methods of accessing messages on devices: directly, indirectly, and with specialized access devices. Direct access methods involve physical contact with the system, by using a keyboard or a touch screen. Users accessing SGDs indirectly and through specialized devices must manipulate an object in order to access the system, such as maneuvering a joystick, head mouse, optical head pointer, light pointer, infrared pointer, or switch access scanner. The specific access method will depend on the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used,Mathy (2000) whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection.Glennen & Decoste pp 62–63 Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.Beukelman & Mirenda, pp. 97–101 Message construction Dasher rate enhancement program Augmentative and alternative communication is typically much slower than speech,University of Washington (2009) with users generally producing 8–10 words per minute.Higginbotham et al (2007) Rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output to around 12–15 words per minute, and as a result enhance the efficiency of communication. In any given SGD there may be a large number of vocal expressions that facilitate efficient and effective communication, including greetings, expressing desires, and asking questions.Beukelman & Mirenda Some SGDs have multiple pages of symbols to accommodate a large number of vocal expressions, and thus only a portion of the symbols available are visible at any one time, with the communicator navigating the various pages.Hochstein et al (2004) Speech-generating devices generally display a set of selections either using a dynamically changing screen, or a fixed display. There are two main options for increasing the rate of communication for an SGD: encoding and prediction. Encoding permits a user to produce a word, sentence or phrase using only one or two activations of their SGD. Iconic encoding strategies such as Semantic compaction combine sequences of icons (picture symbols) to produce words or phrases.Venkatagiri (1995) In numeric, alpha-numeric, and letter encoding (also known as Abbreviation-Expansion), words and sentences are coded as sequences of letters and numbers. For example, typing \\"HH\\" or \\"G1\\" (for Greeting 1) may retrieve \\"Hello, how are you?\\". Prediction is a rate enhancement strategy in which the SGD attempts to reduce the number of keystrokes used by predicting the word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the entire word. Word prediction software may determine the choices to be offered based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices of the user, or grammatical suitability.Augmentative Communication, Incorporated However, users have been shown to produce more words per minute (using a scanning interface) with a static keyboard layout than with a predictive grid layout, suggesting that the cognitive overhead of reviewing a new arrangement cancels out the benefits of the predictive layout when using a scanning interface.Johansen et al (2003) Another approach to rate-enhancement is Dasher,Ward et al (2000) which uses language models and arithmetic coding to present alternative letter targets on the screen with size relative to their likelihood given the history.Roark et al (2010)MacKey (2003), p 119 The rate of words produced can depend greatly on the conceptual level of the system: the TALK system, which allows users to choose between large numbers of sentence-level utterances, demonstrated output rates in excess of 60 wpm.Todman (2000) Fixed and dynamic display devices Fixed display devices A speech-generation device with a fixed display Fixed display devices refer to those in which the symbols and items are \\"fixed\\" in a particular format; some sources refer to these as \\"static\\" displays.Hochstein et al (2003) Such display devices have a simpler learning curve than some other devices. Fixed display devices replicate the typical arrangement of low- tech AAC devices (low-tech is defined as those devices that do not need batteries, electricity or electronics), like communication boards. They share some of disadvantages; for example they are typically restricted to a limited number of symbols and hence messages.Beukelman & Mirenda p. 84-85 It is important to note that with technological advances made in the twenty-first century, fixed-display SGDs are not commonly used anymore. Dynamic display devices Dynamic displays devices are usually also touchscreen devices. They typically generate electronically produced visual symbols that, when pressed, change the set of selections that is displayed. The user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages. A speech-generating device with dynamic display, capable of outputting both synthesized and digitized speech The \\"home\\" page of a dynamic display device may show symbols related to many different contexts or conversational topics. Pressing any one of these symbols may open a different screen with messages related to that topic. For example, when watching a volleyball game, a user may press the \\"sport\\" symbol to open a page with messages relating to sport, then press the symbol showing a scoreboard to utter the phrase \\"What's the score?\\". Advantages of dynamic display devices include the availability of a much larger vocabulary, and the ability to see the sentence under construction A further advantage of dynamic display devices is that the underlying operating system is capable of providing options for multiple communication channels, including cell phone, text messaging and e-mail.Dynavox at www.speechbubble.org.uk Work by Linköping University has shown that such email writing practices allowed children who were SGD users to develop new social skills and increase their social participation.Sundqvist & Rönnberg (2010) Talking Keyboards Keyboard used to create speech over a telephone using a Text to Speech converter.Low cost systems can also include a keyboard and audio speaker combination without a dynamic display or visual screen. This type of keyboard sends typed text direct to an audio speaker. It can permit any phrase to be spoken without the need for a visual screen that is not always required. One simple benefit is that a talking keyboard, when used with a standard telephone or speakerphone can enable a voice impaired individual have 2 way conversation over a telephone. Output The output of a SGD may be digitized and/or synthesized: digitized systems play directly recorded words or phrases while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can carry less emotional information but permits the user to speak novel messages by typing new words.Schlosser, Blischak & Koul (2003) Today, individuals use a combination of recorded messages and text-to-speech techniques on their SGDs.Beukelman & Mirenda p. 105-106 However, some devices are limited to only one type of output. Digitized speech Simple switch- operated speech-generating device Words, phrases or entire messages can be digitised and stored onto the device for playback to be activated by the user. This process is formally known as Voice Banking.Beukelman & Mirenda, p. 105. Advantages of recorded speech include that it (a) provides natural prosody and speech naturalness for the listener (e.g., person of the same age and gender as the AAC user can be selected to record the messages), and (b) it provides for additional sounds that may be important for the user such as laughing or whistling. Moreover, Digitized SGDs is that they provide a degree of normalcy both for the patient and for their families when they lose their ability to speak on their own. A major disadvantage of using only recorded speech is that users are unable to produce novel messages; they are limited to the messages pre-recorded into the device. Depending on the device, there may be a limit to the length of the recordings.Radomski et al (2007) Synthesized speech SGDs that use synthesized speech apply the phonetic rules of the language to translate the user's message into voice output (speech synthesis). Users have the freedom to create novel words and messages and are not limited to those that have been pre-recorded on their device by others. Smartphones and computers have increased the use of synthesized speech devices through the creation of apps that allow the user to select from a list of phrases or messages to be spoken in the voice and language that the user has chosen. Apps such as SpeakIt! or Assistive Express for iPhone provide a cheap way to use a speech-generating device without having to visit a doctor's office or learn to use specialized machinery. Synthesized SGDs may allow multiple methods of message creation that can be used individually or in combination: messages can be created from letters, words, phrases, sentences, pictures, or symbols. With synthesized speech there is virtually unlimited storage capacity for messages with few demands on memory space. Synthesized speech engines are available in many languages, and the engine's parameters, such as speech rate, pitch range, gender, stress patterns, pauses, and pronunciation exceptions can be manipulated by the user.  Programming  Keyboard text-to-speech generating device Selection set and vocabulary The selection set of a SGD is the set of all messages, symbols and codes that are available to a person using that device.Beukelman & Mirenda p. 83 The content, organisation, and updating of this selection set are areas of active research and are influenced by a number of factors, including the user's ability, interests and age.Beukelman & Mirenda, Chapter 2 The selection set for an AAC system may include words that the user does not know yet – they are included for the user to \\"grow into\\". The content installed on any given SGD may include a large number of preset pages provided by the manufacturer, with a number of additional pages produced by the user or the user's care team depending on the user's needs and the contexts that the device will be used in. Initial content selection Researchers Beukelman and Mirenda list a number of possible sources (such as family members, friends, teachers, and care staff) for the selection of initial content for a SGD. A range of sources is required because, in general, one individual would not have the knowledge and experience to generate all the vocal expressions needed in any given environment. For example, parents and therapists might not think to add slang terms, such as \\"innit\\".@article{wickenden2011whose, title={Whose Voice is That?: Issues of Identity, Voice and Representation Arising in an Ethnographic Study of the Lives of Disabled Teenagers who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)}, author={Wickenden, M.}, journal={Disability Studies Quarterly}, volume={31}, number={4}, year={2011} } Previous work has analyzed both vocabulary use of typically developing speakers and word use of AAC users to generate content for new AAC devices. Such processes work well for generating a core set of utterances or vocal expressions but are less effective in situations where a particular vocabulary is needed (for example, terms related directly to a user's interest in horse riding). The term \\"fringe vocabulary\\" refers to vocabulary that is specific or unique to the individual's personal interests or needs. A typical technique to develop fringe vocabulary for a device is to conduct interviews with multiple \\"informants\\": siblings, parents, teachers, co-workers and other involved persons. Other researchers, such as Musselwhite and St. Louis suggest that initial vocabulary items should be of high interest to the user, be frequently applicable, have a range of meanings and be pragmatic in functionality.Musselwhite & Louis These criteria have been widely used in the AAC field as an ecological check of SGD content. Automatic content maintenance AAC user with custom-built device Beukelman and Mirenda emphasize that vocabulary selection also involves ongoing vocabulary maintenance; however, a difficulty in AAC is that users or their carers must program in any new utterances manually (e.g. names of new friends or personal stories) and there are no existing commercial solutions for automatically adding content. A number of research approaches have attempted to overcome this difficulty, these range from \\"inferred input\\", such as generating content based on a log of conversation with a user's friends and family,Ashraf et al. (2002) to data mined from the Internet to find language materials, such as the Webcrawler Project.Luo et al (2007) Moreover, by making use of Lifelogging based approaches, a device's content can be changed based on events that occur to a user during their day.Reddington & Tintarev (2011)Black et al (2010) By accessing more of a user's data, more high-quality messages can be generated at a risk of exposing sensitive user data. For example, by making use of global positioning systems, a device's content can be changed based on geographical location.Dominowska et alPatel & Radhakrishnan Ethical concerns Many recently developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and some argue that the device user should be involved in the decision to monitor use in this way.Beukelman & Mirenda, p. 30Blackstone et al. (2002) Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs.Rackensperger et al. (2005) As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user's life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.Reddington & Coles-Kemp (2011)  Challenges  Programming of Dynamic Speech Generating devices is usually done by augmentative communication specialists. Specialists are required to cater to the needs of the patients because the patients usually choose what kinds of words/ phrases they want. For example, patients use different phrases based on their age, disability, interests, etc. Therefore, content organization is extremely time-consuming. Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered by health insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing. Dr. John Costello of Boston Children's Hospital has been the driving force soliciting donations to keep these program running and well-staffed both within his hospital and in hospitals across the country.

Prosperous Bay Plain is an area on the eastern coast of Saint Helena, a British island territory in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is the site of the new Saint Helena Airport, and is notable for its high invertebrate biodiversity. Geography Prosperous Bay Plain forms part of the eastern arid area of Saint Helena, and covers about 2.25 km2, comprising one of the largest areas of relatively level ground on the island. It was formed 8.5 million years ago by lava flows from Saint Helena's Southwest Volcano. The surface of the plain is covered by rocks, grit and dust, with what little soil there is containing high concentrations of mineral salts. Within the plain there is a 60 hectare (0.6 km2) depression known as the Central Basin, with a level dusty base. This forms a miniature mature desert ecosystem.Ashmole, Philip; & Ashmole, Myrtle. (2004). The invertebrates of Prosperous Bay Plain, St Helena. Commissioned by the St Helena Government and financed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It falls within the district of Longwood. Vegetation The climate of the plain is arid and plants are few, scattered and low-growing. Dusty areas and gullies are dominated by the native samphire Suaeda fruticosa. In rocky areas the more dominant plant is the introduced Hottentot fig (Carpobrotus edulis). On dry slopes, including those of the Central Basin, there are various chenopods, including the introduced saltbush Atriplex semibaccata. The plain holds a number of important populations of the island's endemic flora. The slopes of Dry Gut hosted the largest remaining group of barn fern (Ceterach haughtonii). Dry Gut was also home to the most abundant remaining population of the endemic boneseed, (Osteospermum sancta-helenae). Annual flushes of endemic babies'-toes (Hydrodea cryptantha), goosefoot (Chenopodium helenense) and neglected sedge (Bulbostylis neglecta) occur across the plain. There are a few scattered scrubwoods (Commidendrum rugosum), teaplants (Frankenia portulacifolia) and salad plant (Hypertelis acida), threatened endemics which may have grown more plentifully in the area in the past, before the introduction of exotic herbivores.Lambdon, Phil. (2012). Flowering plants and ferns of St Helena. Pisces Publications, Newbury UK. Much of the eastern end of Dry Gut has now been filled in to provide a base for the airport runway. Fauna Birds Before the discovery of Saint Helena in 1502, the plain was home to seabird breeding colonies. These disappeared after settlement of the island from predation by humans and feral cats. The only endemic land-bird still present is the critically endangered wirebird, of which the plain makes up 10% of its remaining habitat. Invertebrates Prosperous Bay Plain is a biodiversity hotspot, home to an extraordinary concentration of endemic invertebrates, the area being the main evolutionary centre on the island for animals adapted to arid habitats. Some 35-40 species and six genera recorded in this limited area occur nowhere else in the world. The Saint Helena giant earwig used to inhabit the plain, and may still, although there have been no live records of it since 1967. The Saint Helena giant beetle may also be extinct. The mollusc Nesopupa turtoni in the whorl snail family Vertiginidae, previously known only as a fossil and long presumed to be extinct, was discovered alive in a 2003 surveyAshmole, Philip; & Ashmole, Myrtle.

Conservation Invertebrate habitats on the plain have been affected by many factors, including the systematic removal of loose and portable rocks for construction purposes, the formation of vehicle tracks, and the building of structures such as forts. The main threat to the invertebrate communities is the Saint Helena Airport, now completed, which, together with access roads, involved destruction of part of the plain, including part of the Central Basin.

It also collaborated with the particular Churches and with national episcopal conferences in the conservation of this patrimony, and was charged with promoting an ever greater awareness in the Church about these riches.See the Profile of the Commission as it still appeared on the Vatican website as at 2 January 2014 Description Pursuant to the reorganisation of the Roman Curia carried out by Pope John Paul II by his Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus of 1988, there was erected within the Congregation for the Clergy a Pontifical Commission for Preserving the Patrimony of Art and History. By the Apostolic Letter given Motu Proprio Inde a pontificatus (25 March 1993), Pope John Paul II renamed it the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church and established it as an autonomous body independent of the Congregation for the Clergy, with its own President who was to be a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture so as to ensure a proper coordination of the activities of the two bodies.See the relevant page of the Vatican website, accessed 2 January 2014 By his Apostolic Letter given Motu Proprio Pulchritudinis fidei (30 July 2012), Pope Benedict XVI recognised the convergence of the role and functions of these two bodies and suppressed the Commission, transferring its former objectives, faculties and activities to the Pontifical Council for Culture.See the relevant page of the website of the Pontifical Council for Culture, accessed 2 January 2014 Presidents of the Pontifical Commission *Antonio Innocenti (8 Oct 1988 - 1 Jul 1991) *Francesco Marchisano (4 May 1993 - 13 Oct 2003) *Mauro Piacenza (13 Oct 2003 - 7 May 2007) *Gianfranco Ravasi (3 Sep 2007 - 30 June 2012) See also *Pontifical Commission References External links *Commission official website Category:History of the Roman Curia ","title":"Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church"},{"id":"13111808","text":"Edward Faitoute Condict Young (January 25, 1835 - December 6, 1908) or E.F.C.

His son Walter Nars founded Nars Ab in 1943. Oy Nars Ab Having originally made their fortune with timber and forestry products, the Nars family became pioneers in Finnish plastics manufacturing. In 1948, they were first in Finland to manufacture calendered PVC foils, and soon expanded the product range into plastic hose, profiles and floor coverings at their rapidly expanding manufacturing facilities in Jakobstad. After having been hit by an acute economic crisis in the early 1960s, Oy Nars Ab was taken over by the Kansallis-Osake-Pankki bank, and subsequently sold to a competitor Wiik & Höglund, who were also active in plastics manufacturing.

The Strato-Lab program lifted the first Americans into the upper reaches of the stratosphere since World War II. Project Strato-Lab developed out of the Navy's unmanned balloon program, Project Skyhook. The program was established in 1954 and administrated by Commander Malcolm Ross (United States Navy). Malcolm Ross and others developed the program to accomplish research required for the manned rocket program to follow. This program provided biomedical data that was used for subsequent efforts in space. Malcolm Ross launched five numbered flights (Strato-Lab 1 through Strato-Lab 5) as well as other unnumbered flights. Strato-Lab was developed to allow humans to make observations and perform experiments in the upper reaches of the stratosphere using balloons constructed of a thin polyethylene plastic film. These balloons were developed during the earlier Projects Helios and Skyhook by Jean Piccard and Otto C. Winzen. Their purpose was to reduce the weight of the balloons to a fraction of previous rubber balloons. The Strato Lab program used both open and pressurized gondolas built by Winzen Research Inc and the balloon program in the Mechanical Division of General Mills, Inc. Strato-Lab built on the earlier programs with goals to obtain fundamental data in the fields of astronomy, astro and atmospheric physics, and human physiology at high altitudes. The Strato-Lab flights made a number of contributions to the manned space flight program. One set of experiments demonstrated that protons from solar flare activity posed a serious risk to humans working in space. This contributed to developing methods of predicting and monitoring solar flare activity. Strato- Lab also contributed to early astronomical observations above the bulk of the Earth's atmosphere. Secondarily to the scientific objectives of the program, Strato-Lab set a number of records for scientific endeavor and general aeronautics. The Strato-Lab flights culminated in a record-setting flight on May 4, 1961, by Commander Malcolm Ross and Lieutenant Commander Victor Prather (USN) to test the Navy's Mark IV full-pressure suit. The Mark IV suit overcame problems of weight, bulk, ventilation, air and water tightness, mobility, temperature control, and survival capabilities so well that NASA selected a modified version for use by the Project Mercury astronauts. The May 4 flight was the most severe test of the suits conducted. The flight set an altitude record of 113,740 feet (34.67 km), lasted 9 hours 54 minutes, and covered a horizontal distance of . The research goals of the flight were successful, but Victor Prather drowned during the helicopter recovery from the Gulf of Mexico. For the record ascent, President John F. Kennedy presented the balloonists (Victor Prather, posthumously to his wife) the 1961 Harmon Trophy for Aeronauts. For one day the balloonists held the record for the highest altitude reached by an American. The Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had orbited the Earth almost a month earlier, on April 12, 1961; and the next day, on May 5, Alan Shepard flew a sub-orbital trajectory on the Mercury Redstone rocket.

Named in honor of Wakulla County, FL.  World War II service  Following trials in Long Island Sound and shakedown out of Norfolk, Virginia, Wakulla got underway on 23 March 1945 for the Netherlands West Indies. She loaded a full cargo of diesel oil and high-octane gasoline at Aruba and shaped course westward.  Pacific Ocean operations  She passed through the Panama Canal from 5 April to 7 April, arrived at San Diego, California, on the 22d, and got underway for the Hawaiian Islands on the 30th. Assigned to Service Squadron (ServRon) 8 soon after her 11 May arrival at Pearl Harbor, Wakulla subsequently made one voyage to Canton Island in the Phoenix group and two to Johnston Island—each time with full cargoes of high- octane gasoline. During one of her cruises to Johnston, she interrupted unloading operations to put to sea and tow LST-765 into port after a damaged screw and an inoperable rudder had left the tank landing ship adrift. Wakulla served as yard oiler at Pearl Harbor through VJ-day.

He was a Calvert County Commissioner from 1970 to 1982, and served on the Maryland Senate between 1983 and 1994. Fowler is best known for his advocacy for the cleanup of the Patuxent River, the largest river to be found entirely within the State of Maryland. Prior to being elected to public office, Fowler was an avid fisherman who would wade into the Patuxent River and make note of the clarity of the water. After noticing the clarity of the water slowly diminishing, Fowler chose to run for Calvert County Commissioner in 1970 and make the health of the Patuxent River a key issue. After serving over a decade as county commissioner, Fowler was elected to the Maryland Senate, where he remained in until his retirement from public office in the mid 1990s. Fowler, as an early-1970s Calvert County Commissioner, led the way in a lawsuit filed by downriver Charles, Calvert and St. Mary's counties against upriver counties. The lawsuit forced the state, the upriver counties, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enact pollution control measures. The 1985 total of 200,000 tons of sediment reaching the Chesapeake Bay annually was reduced to 130,000 by 2004. The Patuxent River is a rarity among Chesapeake watersheds in that most of its harmful phosphorus and nitrogen nutrient overloads come from its ever- increasing areas of urban runoff, and less from its other two largest contributors, point sources (industrial, sewage, etc.) and the declining agricultural areas. Each June at Jefferson Patterson Park & Museum, Fowler holds a \\"wade-in\\" into the Patuxent River at Jefferson Patterson Park & Museum, where he and others will walk into the waters of the Patuxent River until their feet are no longer visible. The event was previously held at Broomes Island, but was institutionalized at JPPM in 2010. Fowler does the annual tradition in order to bring awareness to the water clarity levels of the Patuxent River. In recent years, the \\"wade-in\\" has become a noteworthy public event, with numerous public officials joining Fowler in the walk, including Maryland Governors Martin O'Malley and Robert Ehrlich, Democratic Party congressional majority leader Steny Hoyer and U.S Senator Barbara Mikulski. The \\"wade-in\\" has been an annual tradition since 1988. In 1994, Fowler was named as the candidate for Maryland lieutenant governor under State Senator American Joe Miedusiewski during the 1994 Democratic primary gubernatorial election. (However, the party's nomination and eventually the governor's seat would go to Parris Glendening that year.) In 1997, U.S. EPA Administrator Carol Browner declared \\"Bernie Fowler Day\\" in recognition of Fowler's lifelong efforts to clean up the Patuxent River. In 1998, a laboratory building at Chesapeake Biological Laboratory in Solomons, Maryland was dedicated in Bernie Fowler's honor. Fowler currently lives in the community of Dares Beach, Maryland near Prince Frederick, Maryland.

His first book, Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication, traces out broad historical, philosophical, religious, cultural, legal, and technological contexts for the study of communication. His second book Courting the Abyss: Free Speech and the Liberal Tradition updates the philosophy of free expression with a history of liberal thought since Paul of Tarsus. His most recent book The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of Elemental Media radically rethinks how media are environments and environments are also media. He has held fellowships with the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Foundation, and the Leverhulme Trust. Peters grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts, pursued studies at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and graduated with a B.A. in English from the University of Utah, where he also earned his M.A. in Speech Communication. He received a Ph.D. in Communication Theory and Research from Stanford University in 1986 before accepting a faculty appointment at the University of Iowa. After teaching there for thirty years, he accepted a position at Yale University in 2017.  \\"Dialogue and dissemination\\"  In chapter one of Speaking Into the Air, Peters (1999) compares two forms of communication: dialogue and dissemination. Even though dialogue tends to be viewed as the better means of communications, Peters believes that it can be cruel and destructive. Dissemination is fair because, unlike dialogue, it does not force listeners to understand and reciprocate to the speaker. The lack of interaction provided by dissemination leaves the audience free to interpret meanings themselves. Peters explains that communication can be achieved even if it is one way.

History Solomon Jones, 1802-1899 From 1840 to 1848, the self- taught mountain road builder Solomon Jones (1802-1899) cut a toll road from Caesars Head, South Carolina, to Cedar Mountain, North Carolina. Because Jones had no formal training, local legend claimed he had blazed the trail with a hatchet while following the lead of a sow.Carl Cox, Solomon Jones: The Roadbuilder (Easley, SC: privately published, 1963), 17-18, 34. The unpaved Jones Gap Road (largely abandoned by 1910) was the only direct route between Greenville County and Transylvania County, North Carolina, until in the 1930s an alternate route was chosen for the Geer Highway (U.

In the early 1950s, Henry Ware, who had in his youth traveled through the Gap in a wagon, encouraged his cousin, businessman E. Ervin Dargan to buy 2,000 acres of Jones Gap land from the Saluda Land and Lumber Company. In 1976, fearing the destructive potential of real estate development and the increase of motorized vehicles traveling the old road, the men both sold and donated their land to the state for use as a park.Greenville News, January 30, 1977, 1E, 3E.

He currently serves as an academy coach at Inter Miami CF. Career Argentina From 1998 to 2006, Morales played for four different clubs in the Argentine Primera División, including two stints each with Lanús and Arsenal de Sarandí. He spent most of that time with Avellaneda- based Arsenal, playing in 146 matches and scoring 15 goals for the club. He spent his last season in Argentina with Instituto before moving to Spain. Spain Morales spent 2006-07 with UD Vecindario of the Spanish Second Division LIGA BBVA. In one lone season with the club, he scored five goals in 23 matches (20 starts). United States In August 2007, Morales moved to the United States to play for Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer. Morales was acquired by Real Salt Lake at the same time as fellow Argentines Matias Mantilla and Fabián Espíndola. Morales made an immediate impact for RSL—he tallied an assist 40 seconds into his MLS debut (August 29 vs. the Kansas City Wizards) - the fastest first assist in MLS history. His first career goal for RSL came September 19 against the Los Angeles Galaxy. He finished the season with one goal and two assists in seven matches (five starts). In his second season with RSL (2008), Morales emerged as a star player and team leader. He started 29 of Real Salt Lake's 30 contests, totaling 6 goals (tied with Robbie Findley for second-highest on the team, just behind Yura Movsisyan). Morales tallied 15 assists, shattering the club record of 11 set by Jeff Cunningham in 2006. It was the second-highest total in the MLS that season, behind only league MVP Guillermo Barros Schelotto of the Columbus Crew. His outstanding play guided RSL to the club's first-ever appearance in the MLS Cup Playoffs, where Morales figured in all three of the team's postseason goals, scoring one and assisting on two as RSL advanced to the Western Conference Final. During the offseason, Morales signed a contract extension to keep him in Salt Lake until 2012. In 2009, he continued as one of RSL's top players, although his numbers declined somewhat. His play has been solid enough to earn him a selection in the 2009 MLS All-Star Game. Already a fan favorite, Morales scored a spectacular goal in the team's 1-0 exhibition victory over Club América on July 11. Morales started off the 2010 MLS season with a bang, tallying two goals and an assist against the San Jose Earthquakes. On May 7, 2011, in a game against Chivas USA, Morales suffered a fracture-dislocation in his left ankle after a challenge from Marcos Mondaini. He was out for over four months, returning to play on September 28, 2011. Morales announced that he would leave Real Salt Lake on November 3, 2016, having tallied more assists than any player in club history.Player Registry, Real Salt Lake. Accessed September 19, 2015. He signed as a free agent with FC Dallas on December 27, 2016. On April 12, 2018, Morales officially announced his retirement from playing professional football.https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/04/12/longtime-real-salt-lake- playmaker-javier-morales-announces-retirement Coaching Upon retirement, Morales became coach of the FC Dallas Under-13 academy team, guiding the team to an international championship at the Copa Rayados Internacional tournament in Mexico.

Life and career Toye was born into a musical family. His father was the conductor and composer Geoffrey Toye, and his mother was Dorothy Fleitman.Stone, David. \\"Geoffrey Toye\\". Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (2001) As a child, he spent time in America and was once rescued from a cruise ship torpedoed en route to Britain during the Second World War. He studied classical music in America and spent time living with Navajo Native Americans before attending drama school in London. Toye began his career in the theatre, spending ten years in jobs ranging from Shakespearean roles to building stage scenery. He married Sheila Ward, a scenic designer, in the early 1960s while still a struggling actor. After working in touring theatre, he applied for a job with STV (then known as Scottish Television) in 1964. His first role on television was as a presenter on Today Is Tuesday before becoming the main anchor on the station's main early evening flagship news programme, Scotland Today, in September 1972. His almost nightly appearances on STV in the 70s turned Toye into a well-known figure in central Scotland, and he regularly appeared off screen, opening shows or making presentations for charities and other worthwhile causes. A revamping of Scotland Today in 1984 brought his news presenting to an end, although he remained with STV for a brief spell presenting a weekly consumer programme, What's Your Problem? before being sacked during the summer of 1986, as part of an overhaul of the current affairs at STV. In 1986 Toye appeared in court for drunk driving, for the second time in three years, and was warned that if he appeared again he would be sent to prison. He moved to South Molton in Devon in 1990 to start a new life, but failed to relaunch his career and spent the next few years battling against alcoholism combined with depression and financial worries. Death Toye was found shot dead at his Devon flat on 28 April 1992. A shotgun lay next to his body. He was 56 years of age. His funeral was held at South Molton Parish Church in Devon on 15 May 1992, and he was later cremated. His wish was that his ashes should be scattered on the River Clyde. At an inquest held on 29 May 1992, the coroner recorded a verdict of suicide. Shortly after his death the Scottish Daily Record ran the headline \\"John Toye may have fired the trigger but STV loaded the gun\\", a quote that was attributed to his one time co-presenter on Scotland Today, Bob Cuddihy. Cuddihy maintained that Toye never recovered from being axed as the presenter of Scotland Today and was treated very poorly by STV. When once asked how he'd like to be remembered, Toye replied \\"just as a nice guy who tried to do a good job\\". John Toye's ashes are interred in Rosneath cemetery, close to his former home at Clynder on the Gare Loch. A headstone marks the spot, titled 'John Toye Actor'.

Background Wilko Johnson organised a charity event on 18 February, 1978, at The Roundhouse in London, to raise money for the preservation of William Wordsworth manuscripts. Motörhead & Chiswick Records labelmates The Count Bishops, plus Wilko Johnson, were on the bill, but for contractual reasons Motörhead needed to perform under the name Iron Fist and the Hordes from Hell, part of which would later be used for the name of a studio album, Iron Fist.

Alan Burridge The Rolling Stones Mobile recording studio had been hired to record the 'Bishops live for an upcoming LP, and Motörhead manager at the time Tony Secunda asked if they could record his band also. Following issues with Secunda shortly after this gig, the band changed managers back to Doug Smith, though Secunda had been given a copy of the concert after the show. Secunda left England and returned to the USA not long after this, but the master tape had been kept by Chiswick. As money was always an issue with the band in these days, Smith remembered the tapes and a deal was done to release the recordings (partly) in 1983. As Ted Carroll states in the liner notes: Lemmy is heard at the end of the concert to say \\"read plenty of Wordsworth\\" and as a result the album got its title because of this.

F. M. was a late 14th century Scottish Franciscan friar, papal penitentiary, bishop and theologian. Of unknown, or at least unclear origin, he embarked on a religious career in his early years, entering the Franciscan Order, studying in England and at the University of Paris. He preached and lectured on the Immaculate Conception, and rose to seniority under the patronage of the Avignon Papacy and King Robert II of Scotland, becoming Bishop of Galloway and the only Franciscan to hold a Scottish bishopric. Thereafter he was a staunch advocate of Avignon Pope Clement VII against the English-backed Urban VI, for whom he engaged in partisan preaching and writing, famously challenging any English bishop to settle the issue by single combat. Early years The Collège de Sorbonne, Paris, in a 17th-century engraving, probably where Thomas was based for many years of his life. There is not enough evidence to detail Rossy's early life and career. His name indicates a family origin from Rossie, but many locations have this name, including Rossie in Gowrie, Rossie in Angus and Rossie in Strathearn. On 3 October 1371, following a request from King Charles V of France and Robert II of Scotland, he received papal permission to take the Bachelor of Theology degree at the University of Paris; this is his first appearance in contemporary records.Summerson, \\"Rossy, Thomas\\"; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 471. This Papal Bull provides information about his earlier life. He was Scottish, had entered the Order of the Friars Minor (Franciscans), he had studied the Seven Liberal Arts and Theology at various locations — including the University of Paris — and had preached in Paris.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 21. It is likely that Thomas had returned to his home country to preach and teach, a custom in the Franciscan Order.I.e. to return to one's homeland and preach; McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 21; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 471. In his later writings he claimed to have studied in Paris and to have lived among the English for seven years, obtaining a good \\"understanding of their character\\".McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 21, n. 3. Pre-episcopal career Thomas was at the Papal court in Avignon in 1371 acting as proctor for Patrick de Leuchars, Bishop of Brechin, making a payment to the papal chamber. Having obtained his Theology degree, Thomas lectured on the conception of the immaculate Virgin at Paris in 1373 as a Bachelor of Sentences (baccatarius Sententiarum);McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 21; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 471; for details of baccatarius Sententiarum, see Weisheipl, \\"The Johannine Commentary\\", pp. 185–6. he had previously been appointed by the Chancellor of the university to deliver the summer lectures on the Sentences.Bryce, Scottish Grey Friars, vol. i, pp. 29–30, & n. 1 on p. 30. By 1375 Thomas, now vicar general of the Franciscan Order for Scotland, was running out of money.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", pp. 21–2; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 472 This put the completion of his studies in jeopardy. For this reason, Pope Gregory XI wrote to Walter de Wardlaw, Bishop of Glasgow, authorising Walter (a renowned scholar himself) and other doctors to grant Thomas, if they \\"found him fit\\", a Licentiate and a Doctorate in Theology. Such a grant would enable Thomas to teach legally, allowing him to lessen the burden of his financial problems. Thomas was at Avignon again in 1375, but had returned to Scotland between March 1378 and April 1379 when he received a gift of £10 from the King of the Scots.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 471 By 22 June 1379, Thomas was once again at the papal court at Avignon. While present, the recently elected anti-Pope, Clement VII, appointed him papal penitentiary \\"for the English and Irish languages\\".Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 471; the source for this is Archivio Segreto Vaticano, Roma, Coll. 457, folio 74 v; Summerson, \\"Rossy, Thomas\\" & McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 22, had put this appointment in the previous year. Becoming Bishop of Galloway Historical map of the Western Schism, a split in the Catholic Church (1378–1417): red is support for Avignon, blue for Rome. Caution: this map is highly inaccurate in some regions and borders, see its talk page. Avignon Pope Clement VII, the Pope supported by France and Scotland from his election in 1378 until his death in 1394. On 15 July 1379, Clement VII conditionally provided Thomas de Rossy to the Bishopric of Galloway with mandate for consecration should Ingram de Ketenis wish to resign his right to the see.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 364; McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 22; Summerson, \\"Rossy, Thomas\\"; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 472; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131. On the same day Thomas and another Scot, Hugh de Dalmahon, were sent to Scotland with 50 florins and with documentary evidence regarding the events leading to the Western Schism, events which allegedly nullified the election of Pope Urban VI.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 22; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 472. The Galloway bishopric was vacant because of the death of Adam de Lanark, a death which had occurred during the vacancy of papal see.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 130–1. Oswald, the prior of Glenluce Abbey, had been elected by the canons of Whithorn to succeed Adam, an election which Urban VI, sometime after 18 April 1378, supported. This election was not supported by the Scottish-backed anti-Pope Clement VII.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 364, n. 1; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131. Clement instead appointed Ingram de Ketenis, Archdeacon of Dunkeld; however, Ingram was unwilling to take up the bishopric, and raised objections to his own appointment.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 22; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131. Ingram's refusal allowed Rossy to take up the bishopric. He was consecrated by 16 July 1380.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131. Oswald launched an appeal to Clement, but a letter to Thomas dated 29 October 1381, confirmed this had been rejected.Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 70. A further letter was sent, as follows: > To the bishops of St Andrews and Dunkeld. Mandate to enquire into the claim > advanced by Oswald, claustral prior of Glenluys, O. Cist., Galloway diocese, > to be the true bishop of Galloway in virtue of his election by the chapter > of Galloway and subsequent provision made by Urban VI. They are to impose > silence on him and to put Thomas de Rossy, provided to the bishopric by > Clement VII and duly consecrated, into peaceful possession. The cancellation of Oswald's appointment does not appear to have silenced Oswald, who appears active in England, a kingdom which supported Urban VII. Pro-Clementine Thomas As bishop of Galloway Thomas remained a close and highly active supporter of Clement. He preached the cause of Clement before Robert II at Dundee on 2 February 1380.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 472. A military attack by Clementine Scotland on Urbanist England was planned. John Wyclif related that a commission was granted to a Scottish bishop to lead a \\"crusade\\" on behalf of Clement into England; this bishop was almost certainly Thomas de Rossy.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", pp. 28–9; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 472–3. Thomas preached sermons in the English marches attempting to win supporters for the cause, and authored a tractate attacking the Urbanist cause along with English support for it.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 23; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 473. Although no \\"crusade\\" ever took place, around 1384 Thomas sent a letter to the bishops of England.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 473. The letter invited Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, or any other English bishop, to come to a debate with him; if they preferred, he wrote, they could settle the matter for both countries through single combat. Henry le Despenser was probably addressed because he was known for his love of fighting, and had led a short expedition into France during the summer of 1383.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 28. Despite his keenness to fight another bishop, Thomas de Rossy had apparently refused the offer of combat given by an English priest because of the latter's lower status. Bishop of Galloway Remains of the Priory Nave at Whithorn, the seat (cathedra) for the bishopric of Galloway. Thomas was the first and only Franciscan to become bishop of a Scottish diocese.Bryce, Scottish Grey Friars, vol. i, p. 31, & n. 6; Summerson, \\"Rossy, Thomas\\". Records of the day- to-day activities of Thomas as Bishop of Galloway, however, are thin. One charter survives, dated 16 July 1381, confirming a grant of the church of Buittle to Sweetheart Abbey.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 364; Summerson, \\"Rossy, Thomas\\"; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 472. The charter was issued at Kirkchrist in Twynholm parish, and was confirmed by the (Avignon) Pope on 18 October when Rossy himself was present at the papal court. On 31 December, he presented to Pope Clement VII a roll of petitions — a series of requests — all of which were granted.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 365; Summerson, \\"Rossy, Thomas\\"; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 472. After the death of King Robert II in 1390, Bishop Thomas along with other prelates of the Scottish kingdom, attended the coronation of the new king. At Scone, on 16 August 1390, two days after the coronation of Robert III of Scotland, Bishop Thomas gave a sermon; according to Wyntoun: > The Byschape off Galloway thare, Thomas, > (A theolog solempne he was), > Made a sermownd rycht plesand, > And to the matere accordand.Laing (ed.), Orygynale Cronykil, vol. iii, p. > 55. Death and succession Bishop Thomas was at Avignon again in the mid-1390s, as attested by record of a series of mundane transactions conducted by him there. On 10 September 1395, he was granted an indult to administer his bishopric in absentia, via a deputy; he is not known to have returned to Scotland. His name appeared in the sources for the last time on 6 September 1397. The exact date he died is a mystery, but it was not until 28 May 1406, that a successor, Elisaeus Adougan, was appointed to the see, meaning that Rossy's death could have occurred anywhere between these dates.Summerson, \\"Rossy, Thomas\\"; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 473; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131. As a friar and a bishop, Thomas could not father legitimate offspring and no partners or bastards are known. His own family background is likewise unknown, though he had a nephew for whom he obtained several papal favours.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 472, 473. Theology and writings Thomas de Rossy was a theologian and known as such, though his extant writings are dominated by political invective. He authored two extant tractates and probably at least two others not extant.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 23. His Quaestio de Conceptione Virginis Immaculatae was a reiteration of some of the arguments for the Immaculate Conception made by Duns Scotus. It was also a refutation of the scholars who had written against it, including Bernard of Clairvaux, Giles of Rome, Bonaventure O. F. M., Richard Middleton, Facinus de Ast, Robert Cowton O. F. M., Alexander of Hales and Gregory of Rimini.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", pp. 23–5. Thomas' focus on the Immaculate Conception stemmed from his days in Paris, where he preached in its favour; it has even been suggested that Thomas was the Friar Minor particularly noted in Paris for his \\"cavalier treatment of St Bernard\\".McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 24. Rossy's second work, the Tractatus Episcopi Candidae Casae de Regno Scotiae in Facto Schismatis contra Anglicos suos Vicinos was a defense of Clement VII and an attack on the legitimacy of \\"Bartolomeo of Bari\\" (i.e. Urban VI). It contains a long, detailed account of the events preceding the Schism, an account partially derived from a work of Cardinal Peter Flandrin. In justifying the pontificate of Clement, the Tractatus made extensive use of prophecy, especially prophecies attributed to Saint John of Bridlington.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", pp. 26–9. The Tractatus Episcopi is the work, mentioned above, to which his letter to the bishops of England was appended.McEwan, \\"'A Theolog Solempne\\", p. 28; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 473. In the Tractatus he accused the English of supporting Urban solely through hatred of the French.

Following the 2007 election, she was appointed the Opposition Critic for Health, Education, the Status of Women, and Communities, Cultural Affairs and Labour. On September 4, 2007 she was appointed the interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island, She was the fifth woman to serve as leader/interim leader of a PEI political party (after Leone Bagnall, Pat Mella, Catherine Callbeck and Sharon Labchuk). On May 26, 2010, Olive Crane resigned as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island and announced her intentions to seek the permanent leadership. On October 2, 2010, she won the leadership of the PEI Progressive Conservative Party on the second ballot, defeating her main opponent Jamie Ballem. Crane led the party in the 2011 election, receiving 40 per cent of the vote and winning five seats. She was also re-elected in her Morell-Mermaid riding. On December 5, 2012, Crane announced her resignation as leader of the party effective January 31, 2013. On October 4, 2013 (over eight months after her resignation as PC party leader) Olive Crane was kicked out of the PEI PC Caucus by interim leader, Steven Myers. In an impromptu press conference, Myer's stated \\"Unfortunately promises were made that were broken yesterday. Olive contradicted a promise that she made to our caucus when she went in the media this morning… if you take it in terms of a hockey coach, you need to know that everybody that's going on the ice is doing the same job.\\" Myer's was referring to an interview Crane made with the Guardian on Thursday, October 3, 2013 on the subject of former Opposition Leader Hal Perry crossing the aisle to the Liberal Party where she believes Perry's defection was the result of a group of party insiders who tried to oust her as leader last year, resulting in a year of internal struggles that have aired publicly and embarrassingly for the party. Myers says Crane's interview with The Guardian Thursday broke a promise that was made during a caucus meeting earlier in the day that no MLAs would speak with media following a brief news conference held to offer reaction to Perry's departure. \\"We had agreed as a caucus about how we would deal with Hal's defection,\\" Myers said. \\"To have somebody go off on their own and do a private interview… we can’t have stuff like that as a party that is trying to rebuild.\\" Myers said this has been an ongoing concern with Crane and felt this was the last straw. Following the announcement, Crane sat as an Independent MLA. Crane did not reoffer as a candidate in the 2015 election. In July 2015, Crane was hired by the Liberal government as a labour market specialist in the Department of Workforce and Advanced Learning.

High Sunderland Hall was a manor house, built c. 1600 just outside Halifax, West Yorkshire and demolished in 1951 after falling into dereliction. The house is perhaps best known for having supposedly provided Emily Brontë with her description of Wuthering Heights, the house in her eponymous novel.IngentaConnect Article about Everard Flintoff's book, The Geography of Wuthering Heights The building stood just a few miles from Law Hill House, Southowram, where she spent some time as a school mistress. Background High Sunderland Hall. Painting by Duncan Campbell, 1911. It has long been held that High Sunderland Hall was Emily Brontë’s main model for the external features of Wuthering Heights while Top Withens was the actual location for the house. In 1904 William Sharp in his book “Literary Geography” said. :“The Withens is on the hill-top above Haworth, and is supposed to represent the situation of Wuthering Heights. The house itself, as detailed in Emily Bronte's famous romance, is a composite picture ; the interior having been suggested by Ponden Hall, near Haworth, and the exterior by High Sunderland, Law Hill, near Halifax. This, at least, is the opinion of those best acquainted with the topography of the subject\\"Sharp, William 1904 “Literary Geography”, Pall Mall Publications, London, p. 106. Online reference http://www31.us.archive.org/stream/literarygeograph00shar#page/106/mode/2up The drawing on the right was made in 1818 shortly before Emily saw it and this house would have appeared very similar to the building that she viewed. Later photos show the house in some disrepair. The painting on the left of High Sunderland Hall was created in 1911 by Duncan Campbell. The building was noted for its elaborate and grotesque carvings and Brontë's description of Heathcliff's wild moorland home has unmistakable echoes of the old house. In Chapter I, Brontë writes: The photos below show the resemblance of High Sunderland to Emily’s above description. Photo 1 is the front gate of the house and shows “a quantity of grotesque carving”. Photo 3 is the principal door and depicts even more of these grotesque figures. There are also griffins on the building – Photo 2 shows two eagle like griffins above the arch at the top of the structure.

It is designed to provide an increase in performance over the .375 H&H; cartridge, yet to be chambered in a standard length action rifle. The cartridge was designed in partnership, by Hornady and Ruger. In 2007, it was released commercially and chambered in the Ruger Hawkeye African and the Ruger Hawkeye Alaskan rifles. Design & Specifications Like the .376 Steyr that originates from the 9.3×64mm Brenneke and the .375 Dakota proprietary cartridge that originates from the .404 Jeffery, the .375 Ruger was designed to compete with the .375 H&H; Magnum, yet have the advantage of having a rimless, beltless case and can function through a standard-length bolt action rifle due to a shorter overall length. The .375 Ruger uses a unique cartridge case designed by Hornady and Ruger. The case is of a rimless design having the base and rim diameter of which is the same diameter of the belt on belted magnum cases based on the .300 H&H; Magnum and .375 H&H; Magnum. This allows the cartridge to have a greater case capacity than a belted magnum case given cases of equal length. As Ruger intended the cartridge to be chambered in standard length bolt-action rifles the case length was kept to which is only longer than the .270 Winchester case. The maximum overall length of the cartridge is which is similar to the maximum overall length to standard length cartridges such as the .338 Winchester Magnum or the .30-06 Springfield. Unlike Remington Ultra Magnum cartridges, the Ruger Magnums can be chambered in standard length bolt- action rifles. This allowed Ruger to chamber the cartridge without extensively redesigning their M77 rifle to adopt them to the new Ruger cartridge. While the .375 H&H; Magnum is longer than the .375 Ruger, the latter cartridge has a greater case capacity than the Holland & Holland cartridge. This is due to the .375 H&H; Magnum having a long tapered body while the .375 Ruger follows modern cartridge designs in that it has very little taper and a sharper shoulder. The case capacity of the .375 Ruger is 99 gr. of water (6.42 cm3) while the .375 H&H; Magnum has a case capacity of 95 gr. of water (6.16 cm3), an increase of 4%. :.375 Ruger SAAMI cartridge dimensions - all dimensions in inches (mm) Cartridge standards for the .375 Ruger were issued by SAAMI in June 2007. SAAMI recommends a 6 groove barrel having a bore Ø of and a groove Ø of with a groove width of . The recommended rate of twist is one revolution in . Recommended maximum pressure for the cartridge is .  Performance  Currently Hornady and Double Tap manufacture ammunition for the .375 Ruger cartridge. The Hornady superformance ammunition drives a SP-RP bullet at and the DGS and DGX bullets at . The Double Tap achieves and with a 270 grain Barnes TSX from a 23\\" barrel Ruger 77 African. The .375 Ruger's slightly greater case capacity, and the \\"short fat\\" cartridge efficiency lead to increases in the neighborhood of 150 fps over the H&H; cartridge. Their capabilities remain essentially comparable. Since 2015 O.F. Mossberg & Sons produced bolt-action rifles of the ″Patriot″ series chambered in .375 Ruger with different stock options. The .375 Ruger as parent case 300 Precision Rifle Cartridge The .375 Ruger cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the 300 Precision Rifle Cartridge (300 PRC), which is essentially a necked-down version of the .375 Ruger. The American ammunition manufacturer Hornady got the 300 Precision Rifle Cartridge SAAMI-standardized in 2018.SAAMI Drawing 300 Precision Rifle Cartridge (300 PRC) In 2019 it got C.I.P.-standardized as the 300 PRC.C.I.P. TDCC (Tables of Dimensions of Cartridges and Chambers) 300 PRC The 300 Precision Rifle Cartridge cartridge case capacity is 6.2 ml (95.5 grains) H2O. The .375 Ruger cartridge case was used by Hornady as the basis for a new extra long range cartridge since it had the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with a neck and barrel throat optimized for loading relatively long and heavy .308 diameter very-low-drag bullets without the need to seat the bullets deeply recessed into the case result in adequate muzzle velocities from magnum sized bolt action rifles. Rifles chambered for the 300 Precision Rifle Cartridge must be capable of handling overall length cartridges. .300 Ruger Compact Magnum The .300 Ruger Compact Magnum or .300 RCM was designed in 2007 and uses a case designed by Hornady and Ruger based on the .375 Ruger cartridge. The case is of a rimless design having the base and rim diameter of which is the same diameter of the belt on belted magnum cases based on the .300 H&H; Magnum and .375 H&H; Magnum. This allows the cartridge to have a greater case capacity than a belted magnum case given cases of equal length. As Ruger intended the cartridge to be chambered in short length bolt-action rifles the case length was shortened to which is similar to the .308 Winchester case. Unlike Winchester Short Magnum cartridges, the Ruger Compact Magnums share the same diameter from case head to body. This allowed Ruger to chamber the cartridge without extensively redesigning their Ruger M77 rifle to adopt them to the new Ruger cartridge. .338 Ruger Compact Magnum The .338 Ruger Compact Magnum or .338 RCM is a rimless, short-length rifle cartridge based on the .375 Ruger case. It was designed by Ruger and Hornady and released in 2008 and chambered in various Ruger rifles. The goal was to create a shorter cartridge than the big .338 magnums that would fit in a more compact rifle with nearly the same performance. Similar to the design ideas for the WSM cartridge family, but somewhat narrower which will frequently allow one more cartridge in the rifle magazine than the WSM equivalent. This round is designed for hunting medium to large sized North American game. .416 Ruger The .416 Ruger is a beltless, rimless, bottlenecked cartridge designed as a joint venture by Hornady and Ruger in 2008. The cartridge is based on the .375 Ruger case which was necked up to accept a bullet. It was designed as a dangerous game cartridge particularly for use in Alaska and Africa.

Overview Stob a' Choire Odhair reaches a height of and is classed as a Munro and a Marilyn is an unpretentious mountain that is overshadowed by its near neighbour Stob Ghabhar, one of the finest mountains in the southern highlands. It stands in the Black Mount deer forest, an area that derives its name from the dark peat hags of the moorland that surround the mountain. Stob a' Choire Odhair along with Stob Ghabhar are well seen from the A82 road as it crosses the western end of Rannoch Moor and they are often climbed together and make a natural days walk. The hills name translates from the Gaelic as \\"Peak of the dun-coloured corrie\\". Geography Stob a' Choire Odhair's summit stands at the meeting of three ridges. Its western ridge links to the Munro of Stob Ghabhar which lies three kilometres away via a col with a height of 668 metres. The north eastern ridge drops very steeply to the moorland of the Black mount and Rannoch Moor. The south eastern ridge links to the mountains subsidiary peak of Beinn Toaig (834 metres) via a col with a height of 802 metres. Beinn Toaig also has a long NE ridge which runs parallel to the one of Stob a' Choire Odhair. There are two corries either side of the 802 metre col, to the north is Coire Odhair while to the south of the col is Coire Toaig which has a very good stalkers track up it which leads directly to the main summit. Historic roads The lower eastern slopes of Stob a' Choire Odhair carries two old roads which were important historical links to the north of Scotland. An old military road built by Major William Caulfeild was constructed in the early 1750s as part of the pacification of the Highlands after the 1745 Jacobite rising. Slightly further east is the line of an ancient drovers' road used to herd cattle to market, this road was improved by Thomas Telford in 1803 and carried the main road down Glen Coe to Fort William until 1933 when the present road was built further east. Telford's road now carries the route of the West Highland Way. Ascents Stob a' Choire Odhair is usually climbed in conjunction with the adjacent Munro of Stob Ghabhar, the starting point for this walk is Victoria Bridge at the western end of Loch Tulla at grid reference . The direct route from here utilises the very good zig zag stalkers path up Coire Toaig directly to the summit. The ascent of the mountain can also be included in the Clachlet Traverse, a high level route from the Inveroran Hotel near Bridge of Orchy to the Kings House Hotel in Glen Coe. Despite having less height than its neighbour Stob Ghabhar it is the better viewpoint offering an extensive prospect across Rannoch Moor and the Bridge of Orchy Munros.

The site is west of Brampton in Cambridgeshire. It is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. Management Brampton Wood has experienced a period of plantation forestry. Scots pine, Corsican pine and Norway spruce dominate about one fifth of the woodland. These plantations were introduced in the 1950s by the Forestry Commission, shortly after they took over the management of the wood on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. The plantations were planted in rows for ease of exploitation. When the MoD sold the wood in 1992 a public appeal enabled the Wildlife Trust to buy it, since then the woods and rides have been managed for wildlife conservation.Brampton Wood Leaflet The Wildlife Trust, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Peterborough Coppicing is used to encourage growth and indefinite succession young stems. This provides ideal conditions for many woodland flowers as well as birds and invertebrates. The many muntjac deer in Brampton Wood can graze the young shoots and prevent regeneration unless controls are put in place. The exceeded carrying capacity of deer means security fencing surrounding the coppiced trees must be installed to ensure that the new growth is not eaten. Coppiced stumps may be covered in brushwood to deter deer from eating new growth. The medieval practice of pollarding could be introduced. Wildlife Flora Approximately 280 species of fern, conifer, flowering plant and tree have been recorded in Brampton Wood. These include species such as dog's mercury, bluebell, primrose and violets. Also notable to the woodland are the ‘major oaks’ which stand at the entrance to the main ride. Brampton Wood hosts three examples of wild service tree. The berries of this tree — known as 'chequers' were once widely used to flavour beer in Great Britain (before hops). A limited edition beer 'Chequered Past' was produced by The Son of Sid Brewery in 2010. Fauna Brampton Wood has thriving colonies of black hairstreaks, one of Britain’s rarest butterflies. The butterfly survives due to careful management of the rides. This involves trimming the scrub at times in the year when the population can cope. Brown argus, white admiral and purple hairstreak can also be spotted at Brampton Wood. Also currently thriving in Brampton Wood is the hazel dormouse population. The species was reintroduced in 1992 and live in low densities across the wood. They thrive on hazel, bramble and a variety of flowers.

On the 25th, she departed for temporary duty at the Naval Training Station at Miami and operated out of there on training duties into the fall of 1945. A three-day port visit to Havana, Cuba, from 31 July to 3 August, punctuated her duty in Florida's coastal waters.

The first, constructed of wood, was reportedly built in 1124; the second one, made of bricks, around 1270; and finally the third one, sometime in the late 14th or early 15th century. At that time, it was located almost two kilometers from the sea (according to many sources, 1800 meters). Furthermore, north of Trzęsacz there was another village, which had completely been taken over by water. Originally, the church was Roman Catholic, but in the early 16th century, after the Reformation, it became Protestant. According to some chronicles, it was the third Christian temple in Pomerania. Abrasion Over time, the process of abrasion (more generally known as erosion) caused the land surrounding the church to recede at the expense of the Baltic Sea. Year by year, water would come closer; in 1750 the sea was as close as 58 meters, in 1771 parts of the cemetery were swallowed, and 1820 the distance shrank to 13 meters. Finally, on August 2, 1874, the last service took place in the temple. Afterwards, all furnishings were transported to the cathedral in Kamień Pomorski, with the exception of the triptych, which is now kept in a church in Rewal. By 1885 the temple stood over a chasm and, with permission of the Prussian government, it was deprived of the roof and left abandoned. On the night of April 8–9, 1901 the most vulnerable, northern wall of the church collapsed. During the following years, part by part, most of the construction was swallowed by the sea, which mercilessly moves south, taking away the land. The last drop took place on February 1, 1994, when part of the southern wall collapsed. According to scientists, since the turn of the 19th century the sea has taken around 40 centimeters of land a year. Over time, local governments - both Prussian and (after 1945) Polish - tried to save the temple with fascine and concrete blocks, but all attempts were unsuccessful. Currently, intensive works are taking place to save the ruin, as this is the only one of its kind in Europe. One of the projects stated that the last remains of the wall should be moved southwards, further away from the sea, but the risk of complete collapse of the ruin was too high.

Of Medieval origin, it was rebuilt following the Great Fire of London in 1666, but demolished in 1781 to make way for an extension of the neighbouring Bank of England. History The earliest reference to the church is in 1282.Deacon, J, \\"The Story of St Christopher-le-Stocks\\", in The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, 52 76-78: London, Bank of England, 1982 2C(272819) The origin of the name is disputed: Freshfield (1876) maintained that it referred to the City Stocks, which at one time stood close to the church, but Huelin (1996) believed it to be a reference to the nearby Stock Exchange. Endowments were bequeathed in 1427 and 1506. Church history The church was severely damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666, although the outer walls and tower survived. It was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in 1671 using much of the surviving material, and was the first of his churches to be completed Amery 1988 at a cost of £2,098 12s 7d.Reynolds 1922 Edward Hatton, in his New View of London (1708) wrote of the restored church that \\"all the old part which the fire left, is of the Gothick Order; but the pillars within, are of the Tuscan. And the walls are of old stone, finished or rendered over\\". As it stood at the beginning of the 18th century, the church was 72 feet long, 52 feet wide, and 40 feet high. The tower was about 80 feet tall; the steeple only housed one bell, the older peal having been destroyed in the Great Fire.Dibdin 1862, p. 10 Inside, the restored church had a wooden ceiling, divided into rectangular panels, and there was a seraph carved on the keystone of each arch. The church was wainscoted with oak to a height of about eight feet. During the 18th century, the Bank of England gradually bought up adjoining properties, extending its site into the parish. In 1781 it came to an agreement with the rector of St Christopher's, and its patron, the Bishop of London, allowing it to demolish the church itself. This was not only motivated by a desire to build on the land, but also by a fear that rioters might use the church as a platform to attack the bank, a concern sparked by the Gordon Riots of 1780. The parish was united with that of St Margaret Lothbury in 1781, and the church pulled down the next year.Hallows,A.(Ed) “City of London Parish Registers Guide 4” - M0023878CL( Papers relating to the unification of the Church of England Parishes of St. Margaret Lothbury and St Christopher Le Stocks,1782): London, Guildhall Library Research, 1974 By 1800, due to the expansion of the bank, there were only 19 houses in the parish (with 133 inhabitants), down from 92 houses in 1732. The churchyard was also requisitioned in 1798, and now lies underneath the bank’s Garden Court.Burial site of the Bank’s first Governor Some parish records still exist. A parish boundary mark (marking the boundary with that of St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange) can be seen on the front wall of the Bank of England. A similar mark is visible on the Princes Street elevation of the bank, marking the boundary with St Margaret Lothbury. 250px The upper panels of the pulpit dating from Wren’s 1671 rebuilding survive at St Nicholas's Church, Canewdon in Essex, and are a fine specimen of carving of the Grinling Gibbons style.Pevsner, p.109. Re-interment of human remains The remains of those interred in the church and churchyard of St Christopher's were removed during development of the Bank of England in 1867 to Nunhead Cemetery in South East London. When the bank underwent wholesale redevelopment in the 1930s, further relocations of interred remains were made to Nunhead in 1933. Among those buried at the church was the scientist and polymath Thomas Harriot, the first person to map the moon's surface using a telescope. Parish clerks In common with all City of London parishes, St Christopher le Stocks still has a serving parish clerk; currently Stephen Plumb. St Christopher's clerk, is appointed by the rector and parochial church council of St Margaret, Lothbury. There are eight parish clerks serving at St Margaret, Lothbury, reflecting the eight united parishes.

Dates The exact dates of Wulfsige's bishopric and of his demise are uncertain. The editors of The Handbook of British Chronology have placed his date of accession between 879 and 889 and his death between 890 and 896 with a terminal end date of 900.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 222 This date is confirmed by the fact that Asser, Wulfsige's successor, was signing charters as bishop of Sherborne in 900. However, it has recently been suggested that Wulfsige of Sherborne might have been the same Wulfsige who succeeded Heahstan as bishop of London around 900, making 900 the approximate year of Wulfsige's transfer rather than his death. Educational reform under Alfred the Great Wulfsige was a contemporary of King Alfred the Great, who had undertaken an effort of educational reform in his realm, personally translating into English what he considered the works “most necessary for all men to know.” When Alfred translated the Pastorale of Pope Gregory the Great, he sent a copy to each of his bishops, including Wulfsige, and added a prefatory letter explaining his educational aims and requesting the bishops to educate young men so that they could read these great works, originally composed in Latin. The copy sent to Wulfsige, which includes his name in the preface, survives as MS Ii.2.4 at Cambridge University Library. It is one of only five which are extant today and was the original from which copies were made in the eleventh century. When Werferth, bishop of Worcester, translated Gregory's Dialogues into English, Alfred sent an exemplar to Wulfsige, who composed a poem that was included as a preface to the work. In this preface, Wulfsige asked his readers to pray for him and for King Alfred, whom he referred to as the \\"greatest treasure-giver of all time.\\" Citations References * External links * Category:Bishops of Sherborne (ancient) Category:9th-century bishops ","title":"Wulfsige of Sherborne"},{"id":"13112798","text":"Lauria is a genus of land snails in the family Lauriidae.

The journal publishes articles on all topics of natural sciences with a specific focus on ecology and conservation biology in Quebec. The journal also acts as the official publication of the society. The journal is the oldest scientific publication in French in North America and one of the oldest scientific journals still in publication in Canada. Foundation by Provancher The Naturaliste Canadien was launched in 1868 by Léon Abel Provancher, an important figure in Quebec's scientific history. It was aimed to be an organ for the diffusion of scientific findings and popularization: For all his life, Provancher would remain the owner and editor of the journal, as well as its main contributor, although a number of other prominent naturalists of the time also published in it: Dominique-Napoléon Saint-Cyr, Charles-Eusèbe Dionne (who also for a time edited a concurrent journal), François-Xavier Bélanger, Joseph-Alexandre Crevier, James MacPherson Le Moine and Jean-Baptiste Meilleur amongst others. Their combined contribution amount to less than a hundred pages; Provancher providing the vast majority of the journal's content, over 6,000 pages' worth.Desmeules, p. 15. While many articles treated scientific topics, Provancher also wrote essays on related topics such as public education, the establishment of museums, and a botanical garden project in Quebec City. Soon after it was launched, having reached 500 subscription (a rather high rate when 50% of the population couldn't sign their name), it received a government grant to help with publication. During this whole period, Provancher maintained an overall anti-evolutionist (particularly anti-Lamarckian) stance; for example, he published several virulent attack on evolution from François-Xavier Burque. However, the naturalist still got into disagreements with the more extreme elements of Quebec ultramontanes over some theological points. A polemist at heart, he had a particularly violent dispute with journalist Jules-Paul Tardivel, in which he was defended by Burque, and his University and Archdiocese.Chartrand et al., pp. 172–179. In another instance, he called Lamarckism a theory \\"serving the self-pride of materialist French politicians, Bert, Hugo [probably referring to both Victor Hugo and his sons], Ferry, Goblet, and Clémenceau.\\"Quoted in Chartrand et al., p. 178. He also launched a crusade in the journal's pages against another journal, the Journal des Campagnes, an agricultural magazine published by the teachers at Collège de Sainte-Anne-de- la-Pocatière over a perceived slight. This dispute degenerated to the point of involving MLAs, ministers, and finally the Archbishop of Quebec, who chastised both journal editors.Perron, p. 7. Despite a number of interruptions, the monthly publication was relatively steady until 1879, when a series of ministers successively canceled and reestablished the grant Provancher depended on to publish his journal. After Provancher refused to retract an article criticizing Premier Honoré Mercier in 1890, the grant was definitively canceled and publication stopped with the May 1891 issue. At the time, Provancher was already sick, but kept hope of restarting publication, tasking his self-styled disciple Victor-Alphonse Huard with it. Huard's continuation Despite Provancher's hopes that Charles Boucher de Boucherville's government would be more open, Huard could not secure any grant until 1919, and published the journal himself with very little interruption from 1894 until his death in 1929. Under Huard, it became a more accessible journal devoted to vulgarization, and frequently included reports on curiosities and travel notes. Although neither as virulent nor uncompromising as his predecessor, he was always willing to publish attacks on evolutionary ideas.Desmeules, pp. 15–16; Chartrand et al., p. 195. While entomology had a noticeable priority, like it did under Provancher, the journal, under the impetus of its many contributors, published on a much wider variety of topics including ichthyology, geology, anatomy and microbiology. Also published were articles of regional interests (e.g. \\"Salmon in Lac Saint-Jean\\", \\"Grape harvest in Chicoutimi\\", \\"The caterpillars of Saguenay\\"), reports on national and regional expositions, and various posthumous papers of Provancher that Huard discovered in the papers he recovered. Huard also published extracts of his books and his multi-part biography of Provancher. Before his death he bequeathed, as early as 1925, the journal to Laval University with the two conditions that the title not change, and it not be merged with another publication. Laval and modern incarnations The University took over the journal and its publication (which was also for a time the official publication of the newly founded Linnean Society of Quebec) from 1930 onward, making it the official publications of the department of biology. The format and editorial policies—only original material—were revised, attracting criticism from both its original public and the scientific community as the editorial committee attempted to satisfy both. As early as 1931 it was one of the most circulated French-Canadian publications, its 600 copies going to individuals and institutions in 18 countries, but changes in leadership and editorial problems left the journal wobbly until the 60s. With the subtitle \\"revue d'écology et de systématique\\" (\\"journal of ecology and systematics\\"), a clearer policy and a proper peer review system, the magazine acquired an unprecedented circulation, and was published in French with abstracts in both English and French. It remained a monthly until 1942, when it became a bimonthly, then became a quarterly publication in 1976. By 1991 dwindling numbers of submissions, increasing difficulties with respecting deadlines—several of the later issues were published with a year of delay—, new governmental policies for grants and other factors such as the increasing specialization of publications made discontinuation the obvious outcome. Issue 1 of volume 118 was the last of this run. In 1994 a new departmental journal, Écoscience was launched, edited by mostly the same team that had edited the previous journal. The University announced it would be willing to give out the Naturaliste if its original goals were to be perpetuated. The Société Léon- Provancher d'Histoire Naturelle du Canada and the university came to an agreement where the society would take over publication, the magazine replacing the Society's previous Euskarien. Although the combined volumes have a single collation, Provancher, Huard's and Laval's runs are often treated as first, second and third series respectively, with Huard's and Laval's series having collations of their own. This additional collation was abandoned at Laval in 1942. The journal now publishes papers and observations on ecology and conservation biology in Quebec, as well as the Society's own news, notably about Basque history in the province—the Society owns and manages the Île aux Basques archeological site and bird sanctuary. It is a semiannual publication and as of 2007 was indexed by Repères, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, and The Zoological Record. The journal has an unusual policy on reprinting: much like the Creative Commons attribution license, articles may be reprinted in all or part as long as the source is mentioned.

Its exact location is the subject of debate. Origin The date that the Templars first took possession of the fortress is unknown, but it is known that the fortress was previously occupied by the de la Roche family. Legend states that in 1188, Saladin placed the castle under siege because Jean Gale, a knight against whom he sought revenge, was there. Years prior, Gale had been excommunicated from the Christian community for murder and had found refuge with Saladin in Muslim territory. Saladin charged Gale with the education of his nephew, but wanting to regain his standing among the Christians, Gale turned over Saladin's nephew to the Templars, driving Saladin to vengeance. Saladin may have taken Roche- Guillaume, but news from Palestine that King Guy de Lusignan had led knights into Tripoli as forebearers of the Third Crusade brought an early end to his siege of the castle. In 1203, the king of Lesser Armenia took the castle, but it was reclaimed by the Templars in 1237, around the same time as they launched a campaign to recapture the castle of Trapessac, located about 15 kilometers away. Roche-Guillaume was reconquered by the Muslims in 1298-99 when the sultan of Egypt sent an army to invade northern Syria. The castle of Servantikar was also seized in the campaign. In 1298 or 1299, the military orders--the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller--and their leaders, including Jacques de Molay, Otton de Grandson and the Great Master of the Hospitallers, briefly campaigned in Armenia, in order to fight off an invasion by the Mamluks.Demurger, p.142-143Hayton of Corycus mentions \\"Otton de Grandson and the Masters of the Temple and of the Hospitallers as well as their convents, who were at that time [1298 or 1299] in these regions [Cilician Armenia]\\", quoted in Demurger, p.116Newman, p. 231, that says that De Molay had an \\"ill-fated expedition to Armenia around 1299, in which the last Templar holding in that kingdom was lost.\\" However, they were not successful, and soon, the fortress of Roche-Guillaume, the last Templar stronghold in Antioch, was lost to the Muslims. Characteristics The fortress occupies a strategic location on a rocky precipice above the plain of Karasu Çayı. The castle also controlled the road that led to Antioch and the plain below. Today, little remains of Roche-Guillaume but ruins. These, however, show that the constructors of the fortress used the rock upon which the castle was built as a cut foundation. The castle's remains suggest that the structure may be Byzantine in origin, or at the very least it was maintained at some length by the Byzantines. The best-preserved portion of the fortress is the chapel, which was common in fortresses of military orders. The presence and current state of the chapel further suggests Byzantine custodianship.

Life and work  Born into a Protestant countryman family, he studied history and Germanic philology (Germanistik) in Munich. From 1906 he was active as literary adviser and translator at the C.H. Beck publishing house. In 1913-1914 he was in Florence, Italy. He rose to early fame as the editor of several anthologies of German poetry of a ‘spiritual’ kind, including Der deutsche Psalter and two volumes of Die Ernte aus acht Jahrhunderten deutscher Lyrik, and for his retelling of the Tristan and Isolde and Parzifal stories, all of which sold in tens of thousands before 1914. In World War I Vesper took part from 1915 to 1918, first as an infantryman, and towards the end of the war as scientific or intelligence assistant in the military staff. After a two-year period as manager of the cultural section of the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung from 1918 to 1920, Vesper was employed from 1923 until 1943 as editor of the periodical Die schöne Literatur (Beautiful Literature) (later under the title Die Neue Literatur (The New Literature)), which became the leading Nazi literature magazine. At the same time he published his own novels, stories and poems. His works predominantly dealt with German history, and above all with protogermanic times. In these he displayed a decidedly nationalistic perception, which together with his glorification and exalting of the love of the native soil, of motherhood and war, made it inevitable that he would become a representative of Nazi ideology. His best-known work Das harte Geschlecht, about the Christian conversion of Iceland, appeared in 1931 and in May 1933 was praised in the Völkischer Beobachter as a 'thoroughly bloodthirsty Northland novel.'Ernst Klee, Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945, S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007. , p. 630. In 1931 Vesper, whom Thomas Mann said publicly had become already one of the worst of the nationalist buffoons,Thomas Mann, Letter to Hermann Hesse of 16.2.1936, in: Hermann Hesse/Thomas Mann: Correspondence (Frankfurt am Main 1968), p.64-65. joined the Nazi Party. After the exclusion of the disapproved authors from the Poetry department of the Academy of Prussian Arts (like Thomas Mann, Leonhard Frank, Alfred Döblin and others), in around 1933 Vesper installed among others Hans Friedrich Blunck, Hans Carossa and Hans Grimm in the Poets Academy. In the public book-burning in May 1933 in Dresden, Vesper gave the ceremonial speech. He was also one of the 88 authors who in October 1933 signed the Vow of the Loyal Followers (Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft) for Adolf Hitler published in the Vossische Zeitung and Frankfurter Zeitung. Already, at the beginning of the thirties, Vesper was becoming known as an author of the Bertelsmann editions. In his literary Journal Die Neue Literatur Vesper carried out a kind of private censorship or revisionism, in that he regularly embarked upon defamatory campaigns against authors and publishers who did not agree with his personal views. When he also did not hold back from attacking the State Directives in regard to writing, he lost the advantage of his situation, so that in 1936 he withdrew from his duties to the estate of his wife Rose (Rimpau) Vesper at Triangel bei Gifhorn. Here he occupied himself as a farmer, but continued to issue his literary newsletters until the year 1943. After the war Vesper was an editor in the Bertelsmann-Verlag and was active in right-wing circles through readings and Writers' Congresses for Hans Grimm in Lippoldsberg, and also in his own place of occupation. There he died on 14 March 1962. Will Vesper's son, the author Bernward Vesper (1938-1971), also became well-known when his autobiographic novel Die Reise (Journey, or, Trip) was posthumously published in 1977. As a student of German studies and sociology, he had been the partner of Gudrun Ensslin, who later became founder of the Red Army Faction. Die Reise is considered an important document of the spirit of the German student movement and the German society of the 1960s.

It remains popular as a simulation engine for online leagues. Editions The first edition was Front Page Sports: Baseball '94 for DOS. This was followed by the release of Front Page Sports: Baseball Pro '96 released on 30 June 1996. Front Page Sports: Baseball Pro '98 was released on 31 May 1997. Gameplay In batter/pitcher mode, the view is 2D. When the ball is in play the game switches to 3D mode. Team colors can be adjusted, but there are no logos on player uniforms. Each team holds 50 players: 25 players on active roster, 15 in AAA, and 10 in low minors. Reception 94 A reviewer for Next Generation gave Front Page Sports Baseball '94 four out of five stars, lauding it for the ability to control every aspect of the game in order to recreate any baseball game in history. He added that \\"Injuries, recovery time, weather conditions, and both amateur and free-agent draft options create an amazingly realistic approach to the management of baseball, while the multiple camera angles, joystick and mouse controls, and crisp VGA graphics keep the arcade aspect of play fresh and exciting.\\" 96 Computer Game Reviews Tasos Kaiafas called the game \\"not much of a step up from the last\\". 98 Stephen Poole of GameSpot gave Front Page Sports: Baseball Pro '98 an 8 out of 10, commenting that \\"But just as with Sierra's Football Pro games, arcade-style play is not this game's strong point. The graphics, at least from the batter-pitcher perspective, are certainly decent - until you notice there's no option for a pitcher-batter perspective, and that, with the exception of skin tone, all the players are generic in the way they look, the way they step up to the plate, and the way they swing. On the up side, you do have a nice variety of managerial options available in the hands-on mode, as well as extensive control over pitching (type, location, speed) and batting (type of swing and area to look for the pitch). The game looks and feels a lot like real baseball - the animations are dead-on without looking canned and the ball physics seem to be about right.\\" PB.INI file The pb.ini file is a standard windows configuration file. Each section affects game play. Some physical factors cannot be altered in a ridiculous way however. For example, there is a section to alter pitch breaks, but you cannot create a \\"bugs bunny\\" change up or an unrealistic curveball. But the file can be tweaked it so that a pitcher could throw 200 mph or cause a batter to hit the ball 1000 feet. Turf resistance and bounce can be altered; as well as the effect that altitude and temperature has on gameplay. How a pitcher would pitch was based on the count, and game situation. All of the player related factors in the pb.ini file use the player's ratings or a percentage of them based on the corresponding entry in the pb.ini file. Most factors have a base number, then a percentage of the player's rating was added to this base. Here is how bat speed is calculated. > swingspeedbase=70 swingspeedPHpct=30 This means that the bat speed for a player with a 0 PH rating would be 70 mph, a player with a 99 PH would have a 99.7 mph swing (99/30). This method also applies to pitch identification, run speed, catch chance, and so on. This file gives the game ultimate control. However it was not until recent years that some of the file's effect on the game was clearly understood. Some entries are still not understood completely. Most were learned through trial and error.

The surplus above the price of the first- class stamp is collected by the United States Postal Service (USPS) and allocated to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense (DoD) for breast cancer research. If a person used this stamp exclusively, and mailed one letter per day for a year, the resulting donation would amount to US $40. Originally created in 1997, Congress has reauthorized the Breast Cancer Research Stamp several times. The original sponsors for the bill were United States Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Alfonse D’Amato (R-NY), and Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), and United States Representatives Vic Fazio (D-CA) and Susan Molinari (R-NY). Breast cancer surgeon, Ernie Bodai, breast cancer survivor and advocate, Betsy Mullen, and breast cancer advocate David Goodman who lost his first wife to breast cancer, spearheaded the grassroots advocacy efforts in partnership with Senator Feinstein and her colleagues that led to the creation and issuance of this historic stamp designed to save lives. The hugely successful Breast Cancer Research Stamp is an example of conscientious consumption in cause marketing, in which a person substitutes buying and consuming along with a tiny donation, for making a more significant donation. History and description In 1996, the United States Postal Service Breast Cancer Awareness Stamp (the pink ribbon stamp at the then-current first class rate of 32 cents) was issued and did not sell well. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp was the idea of Ernie Bodai, MD, a breast surgeon. In 1997 he approached the United States Postal Service about pricing a stamp a few pennies over the regular price with the extra pennies to be used for breast cancer research. He was turned away. The following year Dr. Bodai sent out correspondence to 200 breast cancer organizations looking for support. Shelly Blechman, Vice President of Women's Information Network Against Breast Cancer (WIN ABC), was the only one to respond and a partnership begin. Dr. Bodai, along with breast cancer survivor and advocate (founder/CEO of WIN ABC) Elizabeth (\\"Betsy\\") Mullen and David Goodman who lost his first wife to breast cancer, in close collaboration with United States Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congressman Vic Fazio and their colleagues in Congress to spearhead the national grassroots advocacy efforts that led to the creation and issuance of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. Interview and article in the Permanente Journal Dr. Bodai is a Kaiser Permanente surgeon who performs lumpectomies and mastectomies on women with breast cancer. Betsy Mullen is a breast cancer survivor and advocate, the Founder of WIN Against Breast Cancer and the Breast Buddy Breast Care Program. Dr. Bodai, Betsy Mullen and David Goodman spent their money and time lobbying for Congress' approval of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. Dr. Bodai later began a nonprofit organization, Cure Breast Cancer Inc., to raise money to bring attention to the BCR Stamp and the breast cancer cause. In 1995, in the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations, Treasury, Postal Subcommittee New York Congressman Michael Forbes attached language to the annual spending bill mandating a Breast Cancer Research Stamp be created by the United States Postal Service (USPS). Proceeds above the cost of the semipostal (fundraising) stamp were to be dedicated to breast cancer research. In 1998, United States Senators Dianne Feinstein, Alfonse D'Amato, and Lauch Faircloth and Congressman Vic Fazio sponsored legislation in the United States Congress to create a stamp where a portion of the proceeds of sale would go toward breast cancer research, creating the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. The legislation mandated that 70% of funds raised would go to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and 30% would go to the Breast Cancer Research Program of the Department of Defense (DOD). and http://cdmrp.army.mil/pubs/pips/bcstamppip.pdf Art director Ethel Kessler, of Bethesda, Maryland, herself a breast cancer survivor, was asked by the USPS to design the new stamp. Kessler contacted illustrator Whitney Sherman of Baltimore to create the artwork for the stamp. Directing the project, with feedback from a postal design advisory board, Kessler discussed themes with Sherman that the stamp should depict, such as strength and courage, and to show an ethnically-vague woman. It was Sherman who came up with the solution of using Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt, protector of women, to symbolize the fight against breast cancer. The female hunter is depicted reaching for an arrow, to symbolize that she protects women from harm and to mimic the position women take during a breast exam. Sherman's illustration is a black line drawing of the female figure on a vibrant, abstract color field, done in pastel, which gives the stamp its optimistic or uplifting feel. Typographically, Kessler featured the phrases, \\"Fund the Fight\\" and \\"Find a Cure\\" outlining where the right breast should be. On July 29, 1998, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp was issued at a White House event hosted by the First Lady Hillary Clinton with Postmaster General William Henderson, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congressman Vic Fazio and Betsy Mullen. The stamp originally cost 40 cents; a regular first-class stamp cost 34 cents at that time. 70 percent of funds raised are donated to the National Cancer Institute and 30 percent to the Breast Cancer Research Program of the Department of Defense. As of May 2006, US$35.2 million had been donated to the NCI and the Department of Defense had collected US$15.1 million. United States Senators Dianne Feinstein, Alfonse D'Amato and New York Congressman Vic Fazio who championed the Breast Cancer Research Stamp in Congress, calls the reauthorization of the BCR Stamp \\"good news in the fight against breast cancer.\\" Originally set for a limited run, its release was extended numerous times by acts of the U.S. Congress with the most recent reauthorization legislation going through December 31, 2015. Since the Breast Cancer Research Stamp first went on sale on July 29, 1998 through November 2011, the United States Postal Service has sold more than 924 million stamps, raising approximately $72 million for breast cancer research at the NIH and DoD. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp currently costs 55 cents and is deemed valid as a 44-cent first-class stamp. The additional 11 cents charged for each semipostal (fundraising) stamp is directed to research programs at the National Institutes of Health, which receives 70 percent of the net proceeds, and the Department of Defense breast cancer research programs, which receive the remaining 30 percent of the net proceeds. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp is offered through the United States Postal Service as an alternative to a first- class postage stamp. Purchasing the stamp is a convenient and voluntary way to contribute to the fight against breast cancer. Congress passed \\"The Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act of 1997\\" and the BCR Stamp was first issued on July 29, 1998, becoming the country’s first fundraising stamp. In 2014 the stamp was reissued with that year's date below the \\"USA\\", rather than \\"1998\\" to the side, as shown above. Thus there are two varieties of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp, separately listed in the Scott catalogue as \\"B1\\" and \\"B5\\". Like some other stamps during the 2012-16 period, the Postal Service issued the 2014 stamp twice, both with and, less commonly, without a die cut. This made the latter an imperforated variety. Programs supported The funds generated by the Breast Cancer research Stamp have gone to researchers making significant advances in breast cancer research and have been used to fund research grants to support new, innovative programs. According to the National Institutes of Health, some of the programs the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has funded with proceeds from the stamp include the following:http://obf.cancer.gov/contribute/cr-stamp.htm * Insight Awards to Stamp-Out Breast Cancer (2000–2002): Funded high-risk exploration by scientists employed outside the federal government who conduct research at their own institutions. The grants were awarded for a two-year period. NCI awarded 43 grants through this initiative for a total of $9.5 million. * Exceptional Opportunities in Breast Cancer Research (2003–2006): Funded well- established research that would not have been funded otherwise. The grants were awarded for a period of four years. NCI awarded 10 grants for a total estimate of $11.6 million. * Clinical Trial to Determine Risk of Breast Cancer Recurrence (2005): This clinical trial is designed to select lymph node- negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancers for chemotherapy treatment according to their risk of recurrence as measured by a test called OncotypeDx. One-time contract award in the amount of $4.5 million. * Breast Cancer Pre- Malignancy Program (2006): A comprehensive program in breast cancer pre- malignancy research that includes the areas of prevention, etiology, biology, diagnosis, and molecular epidemiology. A total of $8.1 million will be awarded for the following projects: \\"Molecular Epidemiology and Biology of Mammographic Density\\", \\"Evaluate Different Decision-Making Approaches Used by Women Recruited for Participation in Chemoprevention Trials\\", \\"Early Detection of Breast Cancer — Evaluation Strategies to Improve the Accuracy of Mammography Interpretation with the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium Research Resources\\", \\"Biology of Breast Pre-Malignancy\\", \\"Isolation, Propagation, Characterization and Imaging\\", and \\"MRI-Guided Therapy with Target SPIO Carbon Nanostructure\\". One of the Congressional research programs managed by the USAMRMC Office of Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) is the Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP). As a result of the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act, the DOD BCRP is one of two designated recipients of revenues from sales of the US Postal Service's Breast Cancer Stamp. The Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act (Public Law 105-41) resulted from the work of advocates for breast cancer research. This legislation led to the United States Postal Service's issuance of a new first-class stamp, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp, that can be purchased on a voluntary basis by the public. Timeline Since the Breast Cancer Research Stamp was first offered for sale in 1998 the DOD BCRP has received 30% from the sales of the US Postal Service's first class Breast Cancer Research Stamp (Public Law 105-41, Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act [H.R. 1585]), totalling $16,387,657.27. *In July 2000, the \\"Semipostal Authorization Act\\" amended the \\"Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act\\" legislation by extending the sale of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for two (2) years through the summer of 2002. *The \\"Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act of 2001\\" (S. 1256 and H.R. 2725), enacted as part of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 2002 (Public Law 207-67), extended the sale of the \\"Semipostal Authorization Act\\" for breast cancer research to December 31, 2003. *Public Law 108-199 extended the Breast Cancer Research Stamp authorization through 2005. *In 2005, Congress extended the sale of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp to December 31, 2011. *In 2011, Congress extended the sale of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp to December 31, 2015. The four-year extension of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act passed in the Senate on a unanimous vote on Dec. 5, 2011, and passed in the House on Dec. 14, 2011 by a vote of 417-1. Program accomplishments and outcomes As Breast Cancer Research Stamp revenues become available to the CDMRP, the funds are applied to Idea Awards under negotiation at the time. In FY07, the stamp funds began funding Synergistic Idea Awards also. The DOD has fully funded 34 BCRP Idea Awards, partially funded 2 other Idea Awards as well as fully funded one Synergistic Idea Award and partially funded 2 others. The BCRP Idea Awards are intended to encourage innovative approaches to breast cancer research and are a backbone of the BCRP's portfolio of awards. Many of the research projects supported by Breast Cancer Research Stamp funds are studying the changes in breast cells that result in the development of breast cancer from normal breast cells, focusing on understanding how and why breast cancer cells continue to grow and divide. Understanding these changes offers the opportunity to develop new drugs to prevent or treat breast cancer. Metastasis is the spread of tumors to distant sites. Several of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Awards are seeking to develop new drugs to prevent cancer progression and metastasis. Risk is another approach to the study of breast cancer. Researchers supported by Breast Cancer Research Stamp funds assess risk by examining individuals or groups of people (populations) who are at risk of developing the disease. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp funds also support two projects using nanotechnology. The ultimate goal of both projects is to use nanoparticles for the early detection of breast cancer. Sales Loganville, a small town in Georgia, started a campaign to increase sales of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp called \\"Contract to Cure Cancer\\". This campaign succeeded in making the Loganville post office the number one seller per capita of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp.

It also provides businesses and governments with sustainable development programmes, environmental and social impact measurement and project development. The company was founded in 1997 with a focus on projects that cut carbon and fund social development. ClimateCare is a certified B Corporation and a founding member of the B Corporation movement in the UK. The company has offices in the UK, India, and Kenya. History ClimateCare was founded in 1997 to encourage organisations and individuals to take voluntary action on climate change. In 2001, ClimateCare was contracted by The Co- operative Bank to replant part of the rainforest in the Kibale National Park as part of the bank's effort to create a carbon neutral mortgage product. In 2007, ClimateCare worked with The Travel Foundation to establish the World Care Fund, the largest emission reduction programme in the travel industry. On 24 August 2007, ClimateCare announced that it had delivered its first million tonnes of greenhouse gas emission reductions. Climate Care was sold to J.P.Morgan in 2008 and became part of its Environmental Markets business. It was taken private through a Management Buy Out in 2011 and began operating under a 'profit for purpose' business model. In 2012, ClimateCare worked with the Kenyan government to develop a 10-year National Climate Change plan. In 2014, ClimateCare was awarded the Queen's Awards for Enterprise for its contribution to addressing climate change. In April 2016, the company announced it has funded over 20.6 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emission reductions worldwide and improved the lives of 16.5 million people. In 2018 ClimateCare was ranked as the number one B Corporation in the UK. Operations ClimateCare designs and delivers projects that deliver against multiple Sustainable Development Goals and measures both environmental and social outcomes from these projects. It uses a market approach to sustainable development, kick starting markets for live enhancing goods and services. The company developed a Revolving Fund model which it is using to create a new market for clean burning ethanol cookers in Kenya, helping the community to leapfrog traditional development pathways. ClimateCare also works with corporations by measuring their carbon, natural capital and social impacts, and has worked with organisations such as Jaguar Land Rover and Aviva. ClimateCare projects ClimateCare funds many projects around the world mainly in developing countries with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting sustainable development in these countries. Projects are submitted to various independent standards to ensure accuracy, additionality and verification that emissions reductions are achieved. Standards for carbon offsetting include the Gold Standard, developed by charities such as WWF, and the Voluntary Carbon Standard developed by The Climate Group. Cookstove projects: In 2009, ClimateCare partnered with Impact Carbon and registered the first voluntary Gold Standard cookstove project. This project creates a market for fuel-efficient stoves in households and institutions throughout Uganda. These stoves use less charcoal than traditional cooking methods, cutting carbon emissions and reducing indoor air pollution, making them much less damaging to the health of the cooks and their families. As of June 2016, the partnership had sold more than 835,000 stoves, while creating over 700 jobs and cutting 824,977 tonnes of carbon emissions. In November 2014, the company partnered with Safi International to distribute ethanol cookstoves in Kenya. Through a mixture of micro-financing, government subsidies and carbon finance, ClimateCare was able create a revolving market for the stoves that allowed the initial capital to be reused. ClimateCare has also used a revolving fund model on the Pamoja Life project that helps provide cookstoves, solar lighting and other low-carbon products to very poor people in east Africa. LifeStraw Carbon for Water: In 2012, ClimateCare partnered with health company Vestergaard Frandsen to develop this project that uses carbon finance to fund provision of safe water to 4 million people in Western Kenya. The project was the first in the world to link carbon credits with water provision at scale and has won awards including the Carbon Finance Transaction of the Year award 2012. AquaClara project: In 2014, the Non-profit organisation Aqua Clara International, partnered with ClimateCare to establish a water purification project in Kenya, manufacturing and distributing household water filters that replace the need to boil water. The resulting emissions reductions are measured, independently verified and sold to businesses that want to reduce their unavoidable carbon footprint by supporting projects that improve people's lives as well as the environment. The project is funded through the sale of carbon credits and, as a result, an estimated 18,750 families will have safe water by May 2017.

Its first principal was Mrs Gwenllian Davies, a graduate of Cardiff University, who was a gifted teacher and an excellent administrator. The school began in Mr. and Mrs. Davies' house and comprised just one room for a Kindergarten. By 1931 there were 32 pupils on the roll whose ages ranged from 5 to 10. A photograph of the 1937 Sports Day shows children wearing the brown and gold blazers which are still part of the uniform for pupils today. The field was owned by the Schove family. In 1935, Mr and Mrs Davies sold the freehold premises known as St David's, as well as the scholastic fixtures and fittings annexed to the property, to Mr Derek Schove, at a cost of £900. During the Second World War the number of pupils declined but the school opened its doors to students from the ages of 3 to 33. Mr Schove was a qualified meteorologist and he enlisted in the Royal Air Force so the school was carried on in his absence by Miss Jupp and Mrs Ramsden. After the War the numbers of pupils attending St David's quickly grew and by 1949 the older pupils had moved into Justin Hall. This hall had been destroyed by a bomb during the War and had been rebuilt to provide classrooms on the street level and a hall down below. In the early 1950s the House system was introduced to St. David's. A pupil became either a Beck or a Wick, depending on whether the family lived in Beckenham or West Wickham. This did not make it easy for pupils who lived in surrounding areas such as Croydon, so in 1978 the present House classifications of David, Justin, and Oak were initiated. Pupil numbers by the 1950s had risen to about 130 and an extension was built at Justin Hall. In 1958, Schove was awarded his PhD. School numbers continued to grow. In 1968 the Little School opened on its new site in St David's Close. The Golden Jubilee of the school was celebrated in 1976 and in 1983 the school was granted Accreditation by the Independent Schools Joint Council. Schove died in 1986 shortly before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Mrs Vera Schove took over as Principal and a Head Teacher was appointed. Mrs Schove was later joined as Principal by her eldest daughter, Mrs Ann Wagstaff, who still works at the school as a member of the Senior Management Team and as the Computing teacher. In July 1996 celebrations, including a dinner dance, were organised for the Platinum Jubilee of the school. The whole school had an outing to Legoland, UK. The school was owned by the Schove family until September 2015, when it became part of the Wishford Schools group. This is a small family group of Independent Schools Association (ISA) schools which encourages each school to retain its own ethos but strongly supports the continuing development of the curriculum and facilities.

This initiative included the creation and promotion of the Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan, first published in May 2007. The plan represents 18 months of work facilitated by some of the top planners in Louisiana and the United States, built upon and validated by the voices of 27,000 Louisianans. The plan combined the efforts of local, state and federal partners along with many experts, stakeholders and citizens into a comprehensive approach in order to guide recovery and growth in the state of Louisiana over the next 50 years. The Regional Plan includes more than 100 action items, supporting three broad goals: Recover Sustainably, Grow Smarter, and Think Regionally. History Louisiana Speaks,the a long-term planning initiative behind the Regional Plan,was funded by private donations to the LRA Support Foundation, created by the Baton Rouge Area Foundation. The Center for Planning Excellence (CPEX), a non-profit planning organization, managed the creation of the plan in cooperation with the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA). The Process The Louisiana Speaks process included: # Planning for individual homeowners and businesses through the development of a Pattern Book for residential and commercial architecture, and development of a guide to planning, the Toolkit, which is led by Urban Design Associates; # Planning for neighborhoods through local design charrettes, which were led by Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company; # Parish-level planning supported by Long-Term Community Recovery Teams, which were coordinated through the LRA and the US Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); # And long term 25-50 year regional plan for South Louisiana led by Calthorpe Associates.

Biography Merrill was born in Utica, New York, in 1804, and moved with his family to Sackett's Harbor in 1819. In 1834 he was appointed sutler and postmaster of Fort Winnebago, in the Wisconsin Territory, and served as a superintendent of the Bank of Wisconsin, which was established in 1835. He arrived in Wisconsin at Green Bay in the spring of 1834. There he met and became acquainted with several notable early Wisconsin settlers, including future territorial governor James Duane Doty, future congressional delegate Morgan Lewis Martin, entrepreneur Daniel Whitney, and pioneer Ebenezer Childs. Ultimately, he established a supply route for shipping his goods to Fort Winnebago up the Fox River from Green Bay. After arriving at Fort Winnebago, Merrill remained in the area for the rest of his life. Merrill witnessed the effects of the Winnebago Treaty of 1837, signed November 1, 1837, in which members of the Ho-Chunk (or Winnebago) nation were defrauded into handing over their lands by 1845. He helped conduct the 1840 United States Census within the Wisconsin Territory, and was clerk of court in Portage County in 1842. In 1848, Merrill was elected as a Whig to a two-year term in the first and second sessions of the Wisconsin State Senate, defeating Democrat and future Governor James T. Lewis. Merrill was one of only three Whigs in the Senate in the first session. He represented the 2nd senatorial district, which, at the time, comprised a large tract of north and central Wisconsin, stretching from the northern border of Dane County up to the northern border of the state. In 1857, Merrill witnessed a mob attempting to lynch John Baptiste DuBay after he shot and killed William S. Reynolds in Portage. Merrill later wrote his account of the events. Merrill died in 1874. He was a member of the Episcopal Church in Portage. His house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

History/Recent History The school was originally opened in January 1934 as Potter Street Senior Council School with an age range from 11 to 14. The original headmaster was Mr. A. T. Smith, who had previously headed a school in Ruislip.http://www.ruisliponline.com/schools/potterstreetschool.htm In 2012, the school was selected as the site of a brand new aviation college in association with British Airways and Brunel University. Demolition work of the old buildings began in September 2013 and the new complex, named 'Heathrow Aviation Engineering University Technical College' (Heathrow Aviation Engineering UTC), was officially opened in May 2015. In 2014, it was confirmed that Northwood School had received the go ahead of a £28 million project to re-build the entire school with modern, state of the art facilities, with scheduled completion of the new complex expected in September 2016. Federation with Queensmead Since September 2009, Northwood has been federated with Queensmead School, located in South Ruislip. Graeme Atkins became the new principal and in the last couple of years the school has improved massively with 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 all culminating with the best GCSE results in the school's history. The school has now become among the best in the London Borough of Hillingdon, and among the 100 most improved schools in Britain. In February 2012, the school upgraded to Academy status but it is believed the school will remain known as Northwood School, the name it adopted in the late 1970s. A-Level results have also continued to rise for Post-16 students since the federation in 2009, with substantial emphasis on progression to higher education. Although a smaller school compared with several other local secondary schools, it has been praised for its environment in which every student is made to feel safe noted in the 2011 Ofsted report. A notable case of work from students of the school is a public arts project on display at the local Northwood Hills Underground station. which coincided in the completion of a £2 million project to redecorate the local bridge. A plaque commemorating the completion of this project was opened by Mayor of London, and soon-to-be local MP, Boris Johnson.https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/my-god-this-boris- johnson-8229680 2013 marked the fifth successive year where the school broke its record for GCSE attainment with 97% of students achieving five A*'s to C grades, and 73% achieved this with passes in the core subjects. 2014 was also a record breaking year for the school. Principal Graeme Atkins departed the school in the summer of 2014 after five years at the helm to become Headteacher at Queen Elizabeth High School, Hexham. Mark Anderson became Principal from April 2015. Notable former pupils The Olympic boxer Audley Harrison and Big Brother contestant Nikki Grahame are all alumni of the school.

Belonging primarily to the Shakta school of Hinduism, it is dedicated to the goddess Sahasrakshi (lit., \\"she who has a infinite eyes\\", a form of Lalita Tripurasundari or Parvati), and her consort Kameshwara (a form of Shiva). Overview Devipuram's primary focus is the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple, a unique three-story structure built in the shape of a Sri Meru Yantra; i.e., three-dimensional projection of the sacred Hindu diagram known as Sri Chakra, which is central to Srividya upasana (an ancient and intricate form of Tantric Shakta worship). Measuring square at its base and rising high, the temple has become an increasingly popular pilgrimage destination over the past decade. Two other shrines, the Kamakhya Peetham and Sivalayam, are located on hills adjacent to the main temple. The sanctum sanctorum of the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple is reached by circumambulating inward and upward, past more than 100 life-sized murthis of various shaktis or yoginis (deities expressing essential aspects of the Devi) who are, in Srividya cosmology, said to inhabit and energize the Sri Chakra. Their exact locations are \\"mapped\\" in an elaborate ritual called the Navavarana Puja (\\"Worship of the Nine Enclosures\\"), which was in turn condensed into a mantric composition called the Sri Devi Khadgamala Stotram (\\"Hymn to the Auspicious Goddess's Garland of Swords\\"), forming the basis of the temple's layout. This temple is unconventional in its practice of allowing devotees to perform puja to the Devi themselves, without regard to caste, creed or gender.Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswati (Guruji). This may be an emulation of the Kamakhya temple complex in Assam, which has the same open policy for worship. The fact that many of the temple's murthis are portrayed as \\"sky-clad,\\" or nude, has also, over the years, gained Devipuram considerable attention. History Dr. N. Prahalada Sastry (Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswati), founder of Devipuram, in 2007. Construction of the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple in Devipuram began in 1985, and its completion and consecration (kumbha-abhishekam) took place in 1994. In accordance with Hindu tradition, the temple was re-consecrated for its twelfth anniversary in February 2007. The founder of Devipuram is Dr. N. Prahalada Sastry (1934-2015), a former university professor and nuclear physicist who left a successful 23-year career with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai to begin work on the Devipuram temple in 1983. Now a noted spiritual guru, better known as Sri Amritananda Natha Saraswati (and generally addressed as \\"Guruji\\"), Sastry reports that his creation of Devipuram was based on several visions of the Divine Mother, which specified both the design and mission of the temple complex. Each of the many murthis within the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple was individually sculpted to Sastry's specifications, physically manifesting his meditative visions of these deities. According to Devipuram's official history: \\"In 1983, during Devi Yajna, Guruji was approached by the brothers of the Putrevu family with a request to build a temple for the Divine Mother. In addition to the of land that they had donated, Guruji bought the adjoining and it was registered as land for the Devi temple.\\"Devipuram History The history continues: > \\"Having acquired the land, Guruji was looking for divine guidance, a sign of > approval to commence construction of the temple. In the vicinity of the > donated land, there was a small hillock where Guruji would often spend time > in meditation. On the slopes of the hillock, he noticed a formation [i.e., a > cleft rock forming a natural yoni] very similar to that of the Kamakhya > Peetam in Assam. One day while in meditation he experienced himself lying on > the peetam [holy site], while four others performed a homa, with flames > emanating from his body. And during purnahuthi [the final round of ritual > offerings], he felt a heavy object being placed on his heart. Awakening from > his meditative state, Guruji was prompted to dig that site. Unearthed from > that very spot, he found a Sri Chakra Maha Meru made of panchaloha. It was > later discovered that a huge yajna had been performed in that area more than > 250 years earlier.\\" Soon afterward, \\"Guruji had visions of the Devi as a 16-year-old girl. With her blessings, he built the Kamakhya Peetam on the hillock and a Siva temple on the peak in 1984. Construction of the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple in Devipuram was started in 1985.\\" A recent Devipuram publication reflected, \\"Even a fleeting glance at what has been accomplished around what used to be a no- man's land is enough to astound anyone.\\" Devipuram Kumbha-Abhishekam Souvenir Magazine Mission & Activities A Sri Meru Yantra produced by Devipuram, based on the original unearthed by Dr. N. Prahalada Sastry at the site of the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple. In addition to providing regular religious services and other spiritual functions, Devipuram produces and distributes spiritual aids (most specifically related to Srividya upasana), such as high-precision Meru yantras,Devipuram Merus animated presentations, audio/video aids and other educational materials for spiritual aspirants. Devipuram has also become a hub for spiritual and rural empowerment workshops and seminars. For this purpose, Sastry founded the Sri Vidya Trust, a not-for-profit, non- governmental organization headquartered at Devipuram. Through the trust, Sastry – along with other staff and volunteers at Devipuram – has undertaken a number of developmental initiatives focused on non-formal education, empowerment of women and low-cost housing for the rural poor. A cooperative thrift society, sponsored by the trust and called Jagruti, offers micro- financing services to local villagers. Low-cost, fire-retardant, geodesic dome-houses for pilgrims and other visitors have been erected at Devipuram, using appropriate technologies to demonstrate the viability of such designs in rural India. Devipuram has also conducted many rural empowerment programs in the surrounding countryside, relating to health, hygiene, family planning, literacy, energy generation and energy conservation. Future plans In furtherance of Sastry's vision, Devipuram has ambitious plans to become a \\"global resource for goddess worship.\\" In 2005, news reports noted that a spiritual retreat would be developed at Devipuram.\\"Devipuram to get a spiritual resort,\\" The Hindu, 13 July 2005. In 2010, as part of that development, the Sri Villa guest house was completed, featuring rooms of many sizes, a large cafeteria, an event hall accommodating 200 plus several smaller halls, and air-conditioned suites for families.\\"SriVilla is a comfortable, hygienic, and a safe holiday home,\\" , 4 October 2010. In 2013, at age 78, Sastry announced that, upon his departure or passing, \\"Devi's padukas [symbolic of the goddess] will be in charge of Devipuram, not any human being. There will be no more peethadhipatis [human spiritual leaders] here; only administrators of the Sri Vidya Trust to look after all matters concerning Devipuram.\\"Website announcement, Devipuram, 14 March 2013. Social Significance Devipuram has remarkable high female involvement. The participation of women in Devipuram is largely due to the weakening of India’s caste and kin communities, which is a result of rapid urbanization. This social shift leads, for some individuals, to a loss of dharma and an introduction of anomie in its place. Devipuram relieves anomie by creating a community which empowers women to thrive within self-determined social roles. Explaining his female-focused worship, Guruji said, \\"In western religions, like Islam or Christianity, the god is a father. However, Hinduism has both a mom and a dad. First comes the mom [in power and authority], then the dad, and then beneath him is the Guru… In the literature and in spirit Hinduism is mother oriented, but in life experiences, it is more commonly father oriented.\\" Guruji felt he had been instructed by the goddess to lead a spiritual revolution by returning Hindu worship to focusing on and learning from the goddess. This belief, spread by adherents of Devipuram, that the mother goddess is the preeminent deity within Hindu dogma inspires many women to realize their own autonomy. Through learning about and worshiping Devi, women understand that they can create homes that are mother oriented and that they can be respected as leaders within their social unit. Women find themselves empowered by the new identity Devipuram provides, an identity which they need in their rapidly changing world. Indians traditionally define themselves by caste and kin. For generations, these identifiers determined a person’s marriage, residence, religion, and diet. This normative social system, argued anthropologists Rudolph and Rudolph, was disrupted when modern technologies like the railroad and telegraph were introduced by British colonials and effectively \\"[destroyed] village isolation\\" (1967, p. 22). In 1901, only 11.4% of India’s population lived in urban centers (Singh, 1978). By 2001, just one hundred years later, 28.5% of the population was living in an urban setting. Today, over 32% of India’s population lives in cities (2015, Central Intelligence Agency). Rapid urbanization in India strained, altered, and in some cases destroyed the social systems of individuals, especially as it broke apart multi-generational households. This breakdown of social solidarity resulted for some individuals in anomie. The sociologist Emile Durkheim theorized that there are two types of social solidarity: mechanical, in which people are united through their uniformity of purpose and activity, and organic, in which unity is formed through social interdependence. The term anomie is derived from a Greek word meaning \\"without law\\". Anomie comes into play when society, and the individuals within it, are in a state of transition from mechanical to organic solidarity, generally in response to a large scale social change like urbanization. During this transition, people find themselves lacking social laws to follow. They no longer know to what group or entity they should look to for their social norms. This displacement causes anomie. Indian women are especially subject to anomie. Within the multi- generational household women know what their dharma is and how to fulfill it. Dharma is a Hindu term that means duty, or the role a person must fill in life to progress spiritually. A traditional Hindu woman's dharma is to marry and to raise children, preferably sons, within the framework of a multi-generational household. They lose this sure social role, however, when transplanted into a nuclear home. The majority of active participants in Devipuram are urban women with children school-age and above, and with a high economic status that keeps them out of the workforce. While many women who move to an urban setting must go to work to help provide for their family, and thus have resolved or are resolving anomie by engaging in organic solidarity, the women of Devipuram have not entered into that world and so are trapped in the anomie that was created when they left mechanical solidarity behind. Most women who live in urban India are raised to function within the multi-generational household, with its own community of women inherent to it. The social norms, roles, and laws that these women are taught while growing up are designed to facilitate their success in this specific environment. However, when removed from this social structure upon entering into an urban, nuclear setting, the woman is abruptly left without a community and social laws. She does not know her own role in this new system. No longer attached to the higher aims of their kinship group, she finds herself in a state of lawlessness without any tools provided to resolve her anomie. Devipuram promises women a new social group, with its own laws and greater-than-self purpose to which they can attach themselves. Thus, it promises them relief from anomie. The ultimate symbol worshipped in Devipuram is the Sri Chakra, a yantra which represents the palace of the goddess Devi. The goddess resides in the central chamber of the palace, but many other gods and goddesses also reside in this yantra. Thus, even more than providing a home for Devi and an idol through which Hindus can worship her, this yantra teaches that while there are many aspects of the divine, the gods are ultimately all one entity. Devi is a whole entity, comprising every god and living within every deity. Through their study of the Sri Chakra, devotees learn that they and their peers are, like the gods, all one. They learn that Devi lives in them as well as in everyone around them. A common saying among devotees is \\"I am Devi, you are Devi\\", and this belief is central to maintaining the new social system Guruji instigated by way of Devipuram. The Sri Chakra is worshiped through the Navavarana ritual. This puja is always done among a large group. Both the set-up and performance of the ritual demand substantial time and effort, so that the Navavarana naturally creates a shared experience for members present. The Navavarana is both a symbol of community and an experience of community-building in its own right. By the unity it both represents and demands through its practice, it inherently promotes inclusion of others, female leadership and ownership of activity, and an element of teaching and serving one another. Durkheim argued that anomie is found within an individual’s transition from mechanical to organic solidarity, and is escaped when this transition is successfully completed. The women who adhere to Devipuram, however, have found a new escape from anomie through individualistic empowerment, by which women grab hold of the social roles they desire to fill. Guruji altered the religious traditions already in place within Hinduism in order to follow the instructions given him by the Goddess, and in so doing he created a system within which women could become agents to act for themselves. The women of Devipuram are no longer defined by their roles of wife, mother, and daughter-in-law that weigh on them so heavily within a mechanical system, nor are they adopting the role of cogs in a machine that defines so much of organic society. Instead, they have discovered a group that allows them an alternative way to live, gives them opportunities to be leaders in private and in public, and tells them that they have worth as women, independent of the worth of their husbands. In empowering women, Devipuram has allowed Indian women to create new social identities for themselves, even while the majority of the country still marches to a patriarchal drum. As these women worship Devi, and learn of her, they learn a life-altering truth: \\"I am Devi, you are Devi, we are Devi.\\" References External links * Devipuram: Official Site * vi1: Devipuram & Sri Vidya Trust Category:Neighbourhoods in Visakhapatnam Category:Hindu temples in Visakhapatnam district Category:Devi temples in Andhra Pradesh Category:1994 establishments in India Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1994 Category:20th-century Hindu temples ","title":"Devipuram"},{"id":"13113331","text":"Franciscus Bernardus Jacobus Kuiper (July 7, 1907 – November 14, 2003) was a distinguished scholar in Indology, and \\"one of the last great Indologists of the past century ...

Early life and education El Kafrawy was born in Kafr Saad on 22 November 1930. In 1955, El Kafrawy graduated from the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, with a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering.Alexandria University Official website, (in Arabic). Career El Kafrawy started his career by working for the Ministry of Irrigation. It was in 1958 when he was commissioned to become an engineer in the first stage of the High Dam construction project. He spent almost seven years in this national giant project during which he had the chance to work under the direct supervision of the then prominent Minister of the High dam Sadki Soliman (later a prime minister). Based upon his performance during that period, from 1958 to 1964, El Kafrawy was promoted to become a senior engineer. Moreover, he was recognized in 1964 by both the Egyptian and Soviet Union. He was awarded the Order of Merit (First Class) of the Egyptian Government as well as the Order of the Red Flag for Labor of the Soviet Government. From 1964 to 1967, El Kafrawy moved to supervise the installation of the first high-voltage transmission line, 500 K.V. from Aswan City to Souhag City, including its substations. In 1967, he was promoted to become an Executive Director and Member in the Board of Directors, the Electro- mechanical Company “Kahromica”, Ministry of Electricity. In 1974, following 1973 War, he was selected to become a Vice-Chairman and Chairman of the Executive Organization for Reconstruction, Suez Canal Zone. From 1974 to 1976, he worked in the reconstruction of the Canal Zone. Accordingly, he received the 1975 Order of Merit (First Class) of the Egyptian Government for the second time. Between November 1976 to May 1977, El Kafrawy was appointed a Governor for Damiatta Governorate, his hometown.Damietta Governorate Official website, (in Arabic). Despite the short period, he was able to bring about a major change in the quality of the public services in the Governorate. Thus, he gained a strong confidence from both the local community and the Egyptian Cabinet. He was invited to join the Democratic Party and to stand for the House of Parliament election. He became MP for Damiatta Governorate and continued to do so for about 17 years, until 1993. In May 1977, he became a Deputy Minister for Reconstruction in the Cabinet until October 1977 when President Anwar Sadat appointed him to become a Minister of Housing & Reconstruction within his cabinet. El Kafrawy’s initiatives as a minister encouraged the Egyptian presidency to support his attendance in the consecutive 5 cabinets until October 1993. Over 16 years in the office, El Kafrawy had been assigned many responsibilities such as the development of public utilities, new communities, and land reclamation. His tireless efforts in tackling these responsibilities gained local and international admiration. In 1980, the Egyptian Government awarded him the Order of Republic (First Class) for the third time. Three years later, the French government awarded him the French Order of Merit (First Class). Finally, the United Nations Center for Human Settlements announced him the winner of 1992 Habitat Prize for his collective achievements in housing and new communities. In 1993, he decided to resign at the “high point” of his career. Some analysts attributed his resignation to his increasingly uncomfortable position of supporting the policies of the Cabinet which were denounced by many Egyptians at that time. The analysts also said that he was so exhausted to pursue his main goals. In 1994, following his resignation, President Hosni Mubarak awarded him the Order of Honor “The Nile Wishah”, the highest Egyptian order.

It runs for about in the state. Route description I-44 approached by US 71 (now part of I-49) just south of Joplin I-44 enters Missouri in Newton County at the eastern terminus of the Will Rogers Turnpike, south of the Kansas state line. The first interchange in Missouri is the eastern terminus of both U.S. Highway 166 (US 166) and US 400\\\\. This highway next goes through southern Joplin and then begins to run concurrently with I-49/US 71 at exit 11 just after entering Jasper County. The freeway turns to a more easterly heading (the old route of US 166), and then I-49/US 71 splits off to the north at exit 18. I-44 next enters Lawrence County. Near Mount Vernon, the highway curves to the northeast. The section of highway to Halltown is a completely new highway, not supplanting any previous highways. At Halltown, the road curves back to due east, beginning to follow the general pathway of old US 66, which it does all the way to downtown St. Louis. I-44 then goes around the western and northern sides of Springfield, serving as the western terminus of the James River Freeway, as well as crossing both Route 13 and US 65\\\\. The Interstate Highway continues northeast, bypassing Lebanon. In Pulaski County, I-44 enters the Mark Twain National Forest, and then leaves it to provide access to Waynesville, St. Robert, and Fort Leonard Wood, before re-entering the national forest. The freeway leaves the forest in Phelps County west of Rolla. I-44 then goes through Rolla, where it meets US 63\\\\. It continues its northeast course, passing near St. James, Cuba, Bourbon, Sullivan, and Saint Clair. At this point, it roughly parallels the Meramec River. I-44 west in Springfield I-44 next goes north of Pacific before moving into St. Louis County. I-44 then bisects Eureka before serving as the southern boundary of Route 66 State Park (the former site of Times Beach, known for its dioxin contamination and its eventual demolition and Superfund cleanup). I-44 then runs across unincorporated land before entering Fenton and meeting an interchange with I-270 in Sunset Hills. I-44 then goes through Crestwood, Kirkwood, Oakland, Webster Groves, and Shrewsbury before entering the City of St. Louis. I-44 runs on a due east course through St. Louis until it meets I-55 south of downtown. The two highways run concurrently for about until I-55 turns east at an interchange with I-64 to cross the Mississippi River on the Poplar Street Bridge. I-44 then continues north through Downtown St. Louis on the former route of I-70 to its junction with that highway at the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge (however, drivers wishing to access eastbound I-70 must cross the Poplar Street Bridge via I-55 and I-64). History I-44 follows the general route of, and completely replaced, historic US 66 from Halltown (exit 58, the junction with a cut-off section of US 66 since renumbered as Route 96) to downtown St. Louis. From rural Joplin at exit 15 to Mount Vernon at exit 49, it largely follows a decommissioned section of US 166\\\\. The eastern terminus of I-44 was changed when the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge opened in February 2014, rerouting I-70 over the river along a more northern alignment. I-44 now takes the old I-70 alignment through the below-grade section of roadway in St. Louis, making the new eastern terminus a merging interchange with I-70 near Cass Avenue. The eastbound lanes of I-44 join the westbound lanes of I-70, and the westbound lanes of I-44 branch off the eastbound lanes of I-70.

It is located north of San Francisco, California and due east of the Pacific Ocean. Lower Weott is situated at an elevation of along the Avenue of the Giants and in the flood plain of the South Fork of the Eel River. The population was 288 at the 2010 census. Note that Weott is not related to Camp Weeott, a fishing village established about 1925 and destroyed in the 1955 flood which was located northwest of Weott, near Ferndale, California. History The town of Weott is believed to be named after a sub-grouping of the Wishosk people who lived at the delta of the Eel River northwest of current-day Weott. The Wishosk word for that area and the people who lived there was wíyat.Campbell, Lyle. (1997). American Indian languages: The historical linguistics of Native America. New York: Oxford University Press, page 152. Wiyot is now the general name for this group. The town of Weott is beyond the bounds of the areas known to have been utilized or inhabited by the Wiyot. In 1849, when whites arrived looking for new supply routes to the Trinity gold mines, the Sinkyone peoples were living in the area. The Wiyot were further north and currently occupy the Table Bluff Reservation outside Loleta.Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From The United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Federal Register, February 16, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 32) [Pages 9249-9255] 60 Fed. Reg. 9249 (Feb. 16 1995) Indian Agent Redick McKee's 1851 expedition brought a rush of homestead filings. Native groups militated against this. The resulting conflicts led to the establishment of organized vigilante committees such as the Volunteer Company of Dragoons and continued through at least the 1870s. Before 1925, Weott had been known informally as Helm's Mill or Helm's Camp. Helm's Camp set up where redwood ties were being made for the railroad being constructed along the Eel River. It was later known as McKee's Mill (named for Ernest McKee, who operated a shingle mill just east of lower Weott, but was lost in the flood of 1964. When it put in a request to the United States Postal Service for a post office in that year, however, the residents had to decide on a definitive name. At least one source records that the residents were required to do this because there was already a town named McKee in California, but this appears to not be true. Another source says that a naming contest led to the name Weott,We Call This Home: Oral Histories of Southern Humboldt 1900 - 1964.

Flooding :See also Christmas Week flood of 1955 and Christmas flood of 1964 Though Weott had been hit by a flood in 1930, its recent history is shaped by two major floods. In 1955 December, lower Weott was partially destroyed when the South Fork of the Eel River overflowed its banks. The town largely re-built, but in 1964 December, a Pineapple Express, a rare phenomenon in which a warm mass of moist Pacific air, a flow of cold air from an Alaskan high, a low pressure trough off the coast and a strong westerly air flow with gusts up to 80 km/h (22 m/s), created the greatest flood in the recorded history of California's North Coast. The storm was so intense that it destroyed 26 U.S. Geological Survey stream gauges. As a result, much of the flood data comes from qualitative reports and post-flood estimates. Other northern California rivers, such as the Russian, Eel, Klamath and Rogue Rivers, also rose to unprecedented heights. Rainfall totals as high as were recorded for the 9-day period of the storm and for the 24-hour period between 1964 December 21 and 22. The South Fork of the Eel River is estimated to have peaked at nearly at a station south of Weott, nearly greater than the 1955 flood. Tens of small towns were inundated. One of the worst hit was Weott. Due to the 1955 and 1964 floods, nearly all residents now live in the hills above the flood plain, mostly at elevations of - . The greater area of Weott encompasses the Bull Creek, Dyerville, South Fork, Camp Grant and Burlington areas. Weott's local services are run by the Weott Community Service District, which controls the town's sewage treatment facility and water supply. The town's water originally came from a property east of Weott. It now comes from a spring west of town, across the Eel River. The California State Parks has tried to provide Weott with alternatives to the spring, which is on State Parks land, including constructing a well on the Weott side of the river in 2003. This well had too much sediment, though, and was not usable. The WCSD has surveyed lands in the surrounding watershed but has yet to find an alternative water source. In summer, early morning and late evening fog typically protect the area from temperature extremes. Though daytime highs occasionally reach into the high s, they are more typically below . Due to its proximity to the ocean and its position in the shadow of high Grasshopper Peak, the area has an intense rainy season lasting from November through May. Locals report typical annual accumulations of , though the range is to . Due to its moist climate, the town is surrounded on most sides by redwoods. Though most of the redwoods are second growth, the adjacent Humboldt Redwoods State Park has nearly of old growth and includes Rockefeller Forest, the largest contiguous stand of old growth redwoods still in existence. Weott is located close to Giant Tree, a tall redwood, and the Dyerville Giant, a tall redwood that toppled in 1991.Founder's Grove & The Dyerville Giant, Humboldt County Convention & Visitors Bureau, Eureka, California, 2012, accessed 26 February 2013 Due to a lack of water storage capacity, Weott sometimes suffers from water rationing in the summers. Demographics The 2010 United States Census reported that Weott had a population of 288, 100% of whom lived in households. The population density was 144.2 people/km. The racial makeup of Weott was 87.5% White, 4.5% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 1.0% from other races, and 6.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.9%. There were no African Americans or Pacific Islanders recorded. There were 134 households, out of which 26.9% had children under the age of 18, 38.1% were opposite-sex married couples living together, 10.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 9.7% had a male householder with no wife present. There were 11.2% unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 1.5% same-sex married couples or partnerships. 35.1% of households were made up of a sole occupant, 6.7% had a sole occupant 65 or older. The average household size was 2.15. 58.2% of households housed families; the average family size was 2.67. The population age distribution was spread out relatively evenly: under 18 years, 18.8%, from 18 to 24, 6.9%, from 25 - 44, 23.3%, from 45 - 64, 38.2% and 65 and older 12.8%. The median age was 45.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.5 males. There were 143 housing units at an average density of 71.6/km, of which 134 were occupied, of which 65.7% were owner-occupied and 34.3% were renter-occupied. The homeowner vacancy rate was 1.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 4.2%. 70.5% of the population lived in owner-occupied housing units and 29.5% lived in rental housing units. Economy In 1987, long-time resident Velma Childs listed the pre-1955-flood businesses in Weott. These included a candy store, ice cream store, two gasoline stations, a laundromat, a bar, two cafes, three restaurants, two car-garages, a Ford agency, a church, a movie theatre, two grocery stores, a dress shop, a telephone office (to connect callers via party line), a print shop, a chainsaw shop, a sporting goods store, a beauty shop and an apple orchard along a 400 meter stretch of the Avenue of the Giants. She also listed thirteen homes in lower Weott. The 1955 flood destroyed or damaged beyond repair the theatre, two motels, a grocery, a service station, the bar and a restaurant. The other businesses repaired their buildings. After the 1964 flood, only one house was rebuilt on the old site. Residents and some businesses moved uphill far enough to be above any possible flood waters, the majority did not return. The 1964 flood was famously described by Governor Edmund Brown as a \\"thousand year flood,\\" though in fact it has been rated a 290-year flood.Natural Resources and Hazards, Chapter 14, Humboldt County General Plan Update, Humboldt County, California, undated, accessed 26 February 2013 An tall flood marker shows how high the waters rose at their peak 1964 December 24.The Eel River Floods of 1955 and 1964, California Department of Parks and Recreation, 2013, accessed July 25, 2013 The former economic base for Weott residents—primary and secondary lumber industries—has largely disappeared. Some locals commute to jobs in nearby communities or work with government entities such as the school district or Humboldt-Redwoods State Park. Retirees also make up an important part of the community. Arts and culture Events Since 1972, the Avenue of the Giants Marathon has taken place on the first Sunday in May, starting north of Weott at the Dyerville Bridge. It has included a 10 km race since 1993 and a 21.1 km race since 2002. The Humboldt Redwoods Marathon has taken place on the second Sunday of October since 1976. It now also includes 5 km and 21.1 km races. The race has served as the Pacific Association of the United States Track and Field Association championship for several years. There is a large spaghetti feed at Weott's Milligan Hall for the runners before the races. Since 1951, Weott has also been host to the Southern Humboldt Garden Club Flower Show. It is currently held at the Agnes J. Johnson Elementary School on the fourth Sunday in May. Local gardeners enter prized roses and other flowers from their gardens for a chance to win ribbons and prizes. The show also includes plant sales, food and other crafts. There are various seasonal activities at the Humboldt-Redwood State Park headquarters, including guided nature walks and Christmas tree lightings. Government The Town of Weott has a Special Service District (Weott Community Services District) to provide Water and Sewer within its borders. In the state legislature, Weott is in , and .

The school draws from several communities in the area. The Cal Fire station was torn down in 2010 and rebuilt. There is one community center, Milligan Hall, named after a long-time resident. This building was the town’s schoolhouse from 1923–1954 and later a Legion Hall. At least once the surrounding land was used as a Cal Fire tent camp, presumably for firefighting. At one time, the town had two churches, Faith Chapel Assembly of God and the non-denominational Weott Christian Church. The Weott Christian Church, which was established in 1954, has had its non-profit status suspended until it comes into compliance with the California Franchise Tax Board or the Office of the Secretary of State. The Faith Chapel is still functioning. Weott Center, located at the off-ramp of Highway 101, was for many years home to the Sequoia Hotel, a restaurant, a Union 76 gasoline station and a company that made redwood curios. None of these businesses has survived. south of Weott is Burlington Campground, which also hosts the Humboldt Redwoods State Park visitor center. This is one of several campgrounds in the Humboldt Redwoods State Park, but is the only campground open year-round. The closest commercial services to Weott are in Myers Flat, south. The closest major shopping facilities are in Garberville ( south) and Fortuna ( north). Until 2010, Weott had access only to dial-up internet service. In 2010, high speed internet access became available in the town. Transportation Two roads access to Weott, State Highway 254 (the Avenue of the Giants ) and U.S. Highway 101, both of which are oriented north to south. Weott can be reached from the Avenue of the Giants, but has not had a significant presence on it since the 1964 flood. Highway 101, which was built in 1962, goes through the upper portion of the town and has a dedicated off- ramp and on-ramp for both directions. Though both roads lead through Humboldt Redwoods State Park, the Avenue of the Giants is a scenic route popular with RV, motorcycle, and bicycle tourers. During the summer months there are several accessible swimming holes along the Avenue near Weott. There is a temporary summer pedestrian bridge put in at Burlington campground and another north at Women's Federation Grove. Weott is surrounded by old homesteads that are now part of the State Park. Many of these homesteads still have remnants of orchards and some have remnants of the old structures.

Originally called Myers from the Grant Myers Ranch, \\"Flat\\" was added to the name to distinguish the place from Meyers in El Dorado County. The Myers Flat post office opened in 1949. Myers Flat is located along the California State Route 254, also known as Avenue of the Giants. The US Post Office's ZIP Code is 95554. The community is inside area code 707. History Myers Flat was founded by the Myers family in the mid-19th century. The Myerses were some of the first homesteaders in the area, growing apples, pears, sweet potatoes, and corn. The town initially served as a coach stop for travelers on their way to San Francisco. The Morrison-Jackson mill was started and was active for a long time until the mid 80s when the mill closed down. The old mill site and most of its land are now a part of Riverbend Cellars and much of the land is covered in grape vineyards. Much of the town was destroyed in the Christmas flood of 1964. Because of its shallow elevation and proximity to the Eel River, the town still has problems with flooding. The town lies below the 100-year flood line. Much of the town is trailers and cabins and some people have homes built to withstand flood waters. Demographics The 2010 United States Census reported that Myers Flat had a population of 146.

Medical Certificates are not needed for Glider, Balloon, Recreational or Sport Pilot certifications.TITLE 14--Aeronautics and Space CHAPTER I--FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION SUBCHAPTER D--AIRMEN PART 61--CERTIFICATION: PILOTS, FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS, AND GROUND INSTRUCTORS Each certificate must be issued by a doctor approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to a person of stable physical and mental health. Types The three kinds are: *Third Class Medical Certificate: necessary to exercise the privileges of a Private pilot license or certificate, or any lower pilot certification level except for the FAA's Sport pilot certificate (which only requires the same medical clearance required to drive a car, as evidenced by a valid driver license). In the United States, a third-class medical expires after 60 calendar months for someone under the age of forty years (as of the date of examination), or 24 calendar months for someone over forty. *Second Class Medical Certificate: necessary to exercise the privileges of a Commercial pilot license or certificate. In the United States, it expires after 12 calendar months regardless of the pilot's age. *First Class Medical Certificate: necessary to exercise the privileges of an airline transport pilot license or certificate. In the United States, it expires after 12 calendar months for a pilot under 40, 6 months for pilots over 40. Medical certificates higher than the minimum requirement for a pilot license level still allow the holder to exercise the privileges at that level, even after the initial class of medical certification has expired. For instance, a pilot holding a valid first-class medical certificate may operate a plane with the privilege level of a private or commercial pilot. These privileges may be exercised until the date that a medical certificate of the minimum required class would expire; 9 months after issuance of a first-class medical, a pilot over 40 could still use the certificate to operate as a commercial or private/recreational pilot, and could still operate as a private or recreational pilot up to 2 years after issuance. Flight physicals Military and civilian pilots must pass routine periodic medical examinations known informally as \\"flight physicals\\" in order to retain the medical clearance or certification that qualifies them to fly. Military pilots go to a flight surgeon, an armed forces physician qualified to perform such medical evaluations. With the exception of glider pilots, balloon pilots, and sport- pilots, civilian pilots in the United States and most other nations must obtain a flight physical from a civilian physician known as an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME). Aviation Medical Examiners (AME's) are physicians designated and trained by the FAA to screen individuals for fitness to perform aviation duties. Pilot medical assessment by way of the flight physical is an important public health function. Flying has the potential for serious consequences if not done properly and carefully. Just as it would be unwise to fly in an aircraft that is not airworthy, it is unsafe to fly as, or with, a pilot who is medically compromised. Annual inspections are performed on all aircraft to assure that they meet minimum safety standards. Routine medical exams accomplish the same goal for pilots. When an aircraft successfully completes an annual inspection, the inspector endorses in the logbooks to signify the aircraft is airworthy. Similarly, when a pilot successfully passes the flight physical, the physician endorses the Airmen Medical Certificate which the pilot then carries when performing flight duties. This is may be used as evidence that the pilot has met the medical standards for aircraft operation.  Types of flight physicals  Federal Aviation Regulations in the U.S. require pilots and air traffic controllers to have periodic flight physicals in order to perform their aviation related duties. Authority for these laws comes from the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) parts 61 and 67. Federal regulations describe three classes of medical certificates: Class 3 medical certificates are for private pilot duties only. They have the least restrictive medical requirements and the certificates are good for 5 years for applicants under age 40 and 2 years for those 40 and over. Class 2 medical certificates are for commercial, non-airline duties as well as private pilot duties. This certificate would be required of crop dusters, charter pilots, corporate pilots, and anyone else who flies commercially. The certificate is good for 1 year for commercial activities and 2 or 5 years for private pilot use based on age. Class 1 medical certificates are required for airline transport pilots who fly scheduled airliners. These are the most complex examinations and include electrocardiograms (EKGs). EKGs are required at the first Class 1 medical after the applicant turns 35 and then the first medical after age 40 and yearly thereafter. Class 1 certificates are good for airliner duties for 1 year for applicants under age 40 and 6 months for those 40 and over. Like the Class 2 certificate, however, these remain good for a full year for other commercial activities and 2 or 5 years for private pilot duties. Detailed medical requirements for each class of pilot exam are described in Code of Federal Regulations Part 67. A newer pilot classification in the United States does not require a formal flight physical. A pilot can fly a light-sport aircraft if they hold a Sport-pilot certificate or a recreational pilot certificate and have a U.S. driver' license from any state. Pilots with neither a driver's license nor an Airmen Medical Certificate can still fly, but aviation duties are restricted to non-commercial activities in a glider or a balloon. The pilot must self-endorse and certify that he/she has no known medical deficiencies which would render them incapable of piloting an aircraft. Sport-pilot medical requirements are described in detail in CFR 61.303.  Denial of medical certification  Depending upon which Class certificate a pilot wants or needs, it is possible that either the Aviation Medical Examiner or the FAA may deny a pilot's medical certificate. This may be due to recent surgery, medication is taken, non-aviation-related offenses (such as drunk driving citations), or any other medical condition. Pilots may appeal denials up to and including formal appeals to the National Transportation Safety Board. The process of making an appeal includes meticulous documentation of a pilot's medical condition, therapies involved in treatment, and may be accompanied by psychological evaluations and/or other data. While any pilot may successfully make and receive approval via appeals, there are several professional organizations that exist to aid pilots in appealing the denial of a medical certificate. These include but are not limited to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (www.AOPA.org), The Experimental Aircraft Association (www.EAA.org) and Pilot Medical Solutions (www.Leftseat.com).

Italy has a variety of climate systems. The inland northern areas of Italy (for example Turin, Milan, and Bologna) have a relatively cool, mid-latitude version of the Humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), while the coastal areas of Liguria and the peninsula south of Florence generally fit the Mediterranean climate profile (Köppen climate classification Csa). Between the north and south there can be a considerable difference in temperature, above all during the winter: in some winter days it can be and snowing in Milan, while it is in Rome and in Palermo. Temperature differences are less extreme in the summer. The east coast of the Italian peninsula is not as wet as the west coast, but is usually colder in the winter. The east coast north of Pescara is occasionally affected by the cold bora winds in winter and spring, but the wind is less strong here than around Trieste. During these frosty spells from E–NE cities like Rimini, Ancona, Pescara and the entire eastern hillside of the Apennines can be affected by true \\"blizzards\\". The town of Fabriano, located just around in elevation, can often see of fresh snow fall in 24 hours during these episodes. On the coast from Ravenna to Venice and Trieste, snow falls more rarely: during cold spells from the east, the cold can be harsh but with bright skies. During the snowfalls that affect Northern Italy, the Adriatic coast can see a milder Sirocco wind which makes snow turn to rain. The mild effects of this wind often disappear just a few kilometres inside the plain, and sometimes the coast from Venice to Grado sees snow while it is raining in Trieste, the Po River mouths and Ravenna. Rarely, the city of Trieste may see snow blizzards with north-eastern winds. In the colder winters, the Venice Lagoon may freeze, and in the coldest ones even enough to walk on the ice sheet. Tuscan landscape in Val d'Orcia during summer. Summer is usually more stable, although the northern regions often have thunderstorms in the afternoon/night hours and some grey and rainy days. So, while south of Florence the summer is typically dry and sunny, in the north it tends to be more humid and cloudy. Spring and autumn weather can be very changeable, with sunny and warm weeks (sometimes with summer-like temperatures) suddenly broken off by cold spells or followed by rainy and cloudy weeks.  Precipitation  Lake Garda in autumn. Po valley is frequent during the winter time. In the north, precipitation is more evenly distributed during the year, although the summer is usually slightly wetter. Between November and March the Po valley is often covered by fog, especially in the central zone (Pavia, Piacenza, Cremona and Mantua), while the number of days with lows below is usually from 60 to 90 a year, with peaks of 100–110 days in the mainly rural zones. Snow is quite common between early December and early March in cities like Turin, Milan and Bologna, but sometimes it appears in late November or late March and even April. In the winter of 2005–2006, Milan received around or of fresh snow, Como around or , Brescia or , Trento or , Vicenza around or , Bologna around or , and Piacenza around or . Often, the largest snowfalls happen in February, sometime in January or March. In the Alps, snow falls more in autumn and spring over , because winter is usually marked by cold and dry periods; while the Apennines see many more snow falls during winter, but they are warmer and less wet in the other seasons. Both the mountain chains can see up to or of snow in a year at . On the highest peaks of the Alps, snow may fall even during mid summer, and glaciers are present.  Temperatures  Summer temperatures are often similar north to south. July temperatures are north of river Po, like in Milan or Venice, and south of river Po can reach like in Bologna, with fewer thunderstorms; on the coasts of Central and Southern Italy, and in the near plains, mean temperatures goes from 23 °C to . Generally, the hottest month is August in the south and July in the north; during these months the thermometer can reach in the south and in the north; Sometimes the country can be split as during winter, with rain and during the day in the north, and in the south; but, having a hot and dry summer does not mean that Southern Italy will not see rain from June to August. The coldest month is January: the Po valley's mean temperature is between , Venice , Trieste , Florence , Rome , Naples , and Cagliari . Winter morning lows can occasionally reach in the Alps, in the Po valley, in Florence, in Rome, in Naples and in Palermo. In cities like Rome and Milan, strong heat islands can exist, so that inside the urban area, winters can be milder and summers more sultry. On some winter mornings it can be just in Milan's Piazza del Duomo while in the metropolitan outskirts, in Turin can be just in the city centre and in the metropolitan outskirts. Climates found in Italy (Köppen climate classification) Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) It is found in all the coastal areas, excluding the north-eastern area, which fits a Humid subtropical climate. The winter average vary from , in the northern areas, to in the southern islands. During the summer, averages near in the north (Liguria), and sometimes reaching in the south. Precipitations mostly during the winter. Snowfalls are rare and usually very light in the north, and almost never happen in the south. Summers are dry and hot. Main cities: Cagliari, Palermo, Naples, Rome, Genoa, Pescara. Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) This climate is found inland and at medium and high elevations in southern Italy, around . It is similar to the usual Mediterranean climate: the summers are dry and the winters wetter, but the temperatures are lower in both seasons – around in the winter, and between in the summer. Snowfalls are more common. Main cities and towns: Potenza, Prizzi. Humid subtropical climate (Cfa) A relatively \\"continental\\" and \\"four-season\\" version of the humid subtropical Cfa climate can be found in the Po and Adige valleys in the North, and sometime in low inland Central and Southern Italy. It is marked by hot and wet summers, while winters are moderately cold. The precipitation is higher and there is no dry season. Average temperatures are around 1 °C to 3 °C in January, and more than 22 °C in July and August. Main cities: Milan, Venice, Verona, Turin, Bologna. Transition between Cfa and Csa climates Some parts of Italy have a climate which cannot be precisely defined as either Cfa or Csa, presenting elements from both (e.g. summers are not wet enough for Cfa, nor so dry as in Csa; while winters are colder than similar Italian cities of Csa climate, but at the same time milder than in Cfa places). This indeed allows cultivations not seen in the Padana Plain, like olive trees, while keeping those characteristics which are not typical of Mediterranean climates (like more frequent appearances of frost or snow during winters or more frequent summer thunderstorms). This can be found both in some lake and hill resorts of Northern Italy (usually with wetter summers) and in some area like inner Tuscany (usually with drier summers). Florence is a good example of this transition climate: Oceanic climate (Cfb) It can be found in altitude in the Apennines and in the alpine foothills. Summers are between Main cities and towns: Aosta, Campobasso, L'Aquila, Cuneo, Sondrio, Amatrice – mild. Belluno, Breno, Feltre – severe. Humid continental climate (Dfb) This climate is found in the Alps, around in the western side, or around in the eastern side. It is marked by low winter averages (between ) and mild summers, with temperatures averaging from . Snow is usual from early November until March or early April. Main towns: Brusson, Gressoney-Saint-Jean, Aprica, Vermiglio, Mazzin, Santo Stefano di Cadore, Asiago, Claut, Resia. Subartic climate (Dfc) In the alpine valley around . The winters are very cold, averages between , and summers are cool, usually around . Main towns and villages in this area: Livigno, Chamois, Misurina, Predoi, Rhêmes-Notre-Dame. Tundra climate (ET) Above the tree line in the Alps. All the months with average below . Villages with this climate: Cervinia, Sestriere, Trepalle. Extremes The record low temperature is in the Alps, and near sea level (recorded on January 12, 1985 at San Pietro Capofiume, hamlet of Molinella, in the Province of Bologna). In the south, cities like Catania, Foggia, Lecce and Alghero have experienced highs of in some hot summers. The village of Musi, with an annual average precipitation of 3313 mm (130.4 inches) is the wettest place in Italy. The maximum rainfall in 24 hours was recorded in Genoa Bolzaneto on 10 September 1970 with a value of 948.4 mm (37.3 inches). However, there are many daily rainfall records around Italy exceeding 500 mm (19.7 in). The maximum snow depth was recorded in March 1951 at the meteorological station of Lago D'Avino with a value of 1125 cm (443 inches). In the snowiest years, the snowfall can exceed 20 meters (65.6 feet) in some places in high altitudes. During the winter of 1950–51 the village of Falcade in the Dolomites received 11.5 m (38.3 feet) of snowfall, setting the record for an Inhabited place. The maximum snowfall in 24 hours (181 cm, 71.3 inches) was recorded in the village of Roccacaramanico (Majella massif) in January 1951. The lowest temperature record for an inhabited place is −34 °C (−29.2 °F) in 1967 in Livigno, while there are two candidates for the highest temperature: recorded in Foggia in Apulia on 25 June 2007, and recorded in Catenanuova in Sicily on 10 August 1999. The latter is not official, and generally considered dubious. The official highest temperature in Europe was recorded in Athens on 10 July 1977, at .

Through his uncle, a priest of the London District, he obtained admission to the College of St. Omer. In 1793, the French Revolution and the United Kingdom's declaration of war on France ended the Saint Omer college. The English faculty and students were imprisoned at Dourlens. In 1795, Gregory Stapleton, President of the College, obtained from the directory an order for the release of the sixty-four students. They were conveyed to England in an American vessel, and landed at Dover on 2 March 1795. Brady, William Maziere. Annals of the Catholic Hierarchy in England and Scotland, J. M. Stark, 1883, p. 219 Walsh continued his studies at Old Hall Green. Stapleton was appointed vicar apostolic of the Midland district on 29 May 1800, and took up residence at Longbirch, near Wolverhampton. He brought Walsh, then a deacon, to serve as secretary. Walsh was ordained priest on 19 September 1801, and continued under Stapleton's successor, Bishop John Milner, as chaplain and missioner at Longbirch until October, 1804, when he was sent to Sedgley Park School as chaplain. In 1808 he went to St Mary's College, Oscott as vice-president and later he served as president from 1818 to 1826. At the age of 46, he was made Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District (of England) by Pope Leo XII, with the title of bishop of Cambysopylis, assisting Bishop John Milner. He succeeded to the Vicariate on the death of Bishop Milner in 1826. Walsh is most remembered for his commissioning of two cathedrals, the Cathedral of Saint Chad, Birmingham and Nottingham Cathedral, and his association with the distinguished architect Augustus Welby Pugin. The Midland District was renamed the Central District on 3 July 1840, but lost jurisdiction of the counties of Cambridgeshire (with the Isle of Ely), Huntingdonshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, and Rutland to the newly formed the Apostolic Vicariate of the Eastern District. In 1848, he was named, despite his reluctance, Vicar Apostolic of the London District, with the intention of him being the first Archbishop of Westminster when the hierarchy was to be restored in 1850 but he was too old and infirm at 71 to take any active part in its affairs, and so left its administration in the hands of his coadjutor, Bishop Nicholas Wiseman. Walsh died in Golden Square, Soho, London on 18 February 1849. He is buried in the crypt chapel of St Peter, in the Metropolitan Cathedral of St Chad. A large Gothic-revival memorial to him with a recumbent effigy, designed by Pugin and carved by George Myers, was erected in the North aisle of the Cathedral in 1851, after being exhibited in the Mediaeval Court of the Great Exhibition in The Crystal Palace, Hyde Park, London. Bishop Walsh Catholic School in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham is named after him.

It was initially headquartered at Lansing. Many of its units had previously been part of the 32nd Infantry Division. It was converted to the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) structure in March 1963. The Division's 2nd Brigade was assigned to the Selected Reserve Force, a higher-readiness component of the ARNG, in 1965. Virtually the entire division was involved in responding to the 12th Street riot in Detroit in July–August 1967. The 1968 reductions of the Army National Guard, initiated by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara who felt that fifteen divisions were too many, reduced the division to the 46th Brigade (formed from the 2nd Brigade at Wyoming, Michigan), which was allocated to the 38th Infantry Division on 1 February 1968. The brigade was eliminated during Army restructuring in 2004.

The origin of the name Alton is disputed. Some say Alton was a corruption of its founder's name, Alta Oliver. Another source indicates the community was named in 1862 for the founder's hometown of Alton, Illinois. The Eel River and Eureka Railroad was built in 1884 to provide Humboldt Bay shipping access to lumber mills and farms of the lower Eel River. In 1885, Pacific Lumber Company built a rail connection from their Scotia lumber mill to the Eel River and Eureka Railroad at Alton. Alta Oliver laid out the town at the junction of the two railroads in 1887. The California Midland Railroad was formed in 1902 to extend rail service from Alton up the Van Duzen River to Carlotta.

Flange bolting with hydraulic torque wrench. Four narrow-clearance hydraulic torque wrenches on a flange. A hydraulic torque wrench is a power tool designed to exert torque on a fastener to achieve proper tightening or loosening of a connection through the use of hydraulics. A torque wrench is applied to the nut either directly or in conjunction with an impact socket. Hydraulic torque wrenches apply a predetermined, controlled amount of torque to a properly lubricated fastener. The hydraulic torque wrench was invented by George A. Sturdevant in Houston, Texas. The concept of a hydraulic powered torque wrench was first introduced on the market sometime in the early 1960s in a primitive form, and several key advances have been developed by manufacturers since that time which provided major advancements in the technology and usability of the tools far beyond the original concept tool. File:George Sturdevant.jpg|George Sturdevant 1983 Today's tools offer benefits such as lighter weights, smaller nose radius dimensions for fitting into tight spaces, use of exotic alloys, actuation triggers on the tool itself, multi-position reaction members, 360° × 360° hose swivels, and the ability to run multiple tools simultaneously from a single power pack. There are two types of hydraulic torque wrenches: square drive and low profile. Depending on the application, one or the other will be the best tool to use. The main characteristics of a hydraulic torque wrench which set it apart from other powered wrenches of similar function are that (1) it must generate torque using only hydraulic means (2) it must be self ratcheting, and (3) it must include an accurate method of determining the amount of torque applied. In 1985, the Bolt Council: Research Council on Structural Connections, a.k.a. RCSC, specification permitted the use of the calibrated wrench method of installation, but with a clearer statement of the requirements of the method and its limitations. In the calibrated wrench method the wrench is calibrated or adjusted to shut off when the desired torque is reached. In practice, several bolts of the lot to be installed are tightened in a calibrating device that directly reads the tension in the bolt. The wrench is adjusted to shut off at bolt tensions that are a minimum of 5% greater than the required preload. Some manufacturers utilize a holding pawl design to keep the wrench locked in position prior to each power stroke, others use varying designs, which as in all industries have debatable faults or claimed advantages. Hydraulic torque wrenches typically offer accuracy of ±3% and have a high degree of repeatability making them well suited to applications where large bolts are involved and a high degree of accuracy is required. A hydraulic torque wrench is significantly quieter, lighter weight and more accurate than pneumatic impact wrenches capable of similar torque output, making it an appealing alternative for many users to the very loud and cumbersome impact wrenches or torque multipliers which were formerly the only viable option for working with very large nuts and bolts until the hydraulic torque wrench was introduced. The Hydraulic Torque wrench was invented in 1968 by George A. Sturdevant. Bolt tensioners are an alternative to hydraulic torque wrenches, but not as commonly used. Reaction arm free torque wrenches Bolting made safer and easier with reaction washer. The most dangerous part of a hydraulic torque wrench is the reaction member, often called reaction arm. When torque is applied to the bolt or nut, the reaction member abuts against a stationary object to stop the wrench from turning around the fastener. This reaction force is tremendous and accidents (for example pinched fingers) have happened more than once. Since 2014 it is possible to torque tighten bolts without the use of a reaction arm, and thus without pinch points. This is a great break-through in the industry. Reaction arm free torqueing is possible due to the usage of a reaction washer. The knurled side of the washer hold on to the construction/flange and the bolt or nut turn over a smooth and through-hardened surface. The reaction washer will become a stationary object underneath the nut, eliminating the use of reaction arms.

Fernbridge ZIP Code is 95540 and the community is inside area code 707. The United States Geological Survey maintains a webcam overlooking Fernbridge, and a river gage of water level at the bridge. Early history The area was first named Singley Station in 1885 after George Singley who ran a ferry across the Eel River from 1876 to 1880. As soon as the station was built, a stage ran on a regular schedule to connect to the train. By 1891, the ferry was pulled by a steam winch and a seasonal pontoon bridge was added in the summer. The town name was changed to Fernbridge from Singley's Station about two years after the Fernbridge was built across the Eel in 1910-1911. The first post office at Fernbridge opened in 1924. In 1934, when California numbered and marked California State Route 1, the route began in Las Cruces, California and ended at Fernbridge, although by 1984, admitting the route was not feasible south of Ferndale, this section of Route 1 was renumbered to State Highway 211.

It is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the Clemson Tigers football team of Clemson University and the NC State Wolfpack football team of North Carolina State University. History The rivalry game has been known as the Textile Bowl since 1981. The two universities are founding members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and both have competed in the ACC's Atlantic Division since the conference initiated divisional play. The rivalry's name is derived from the fact that Clemson and North Carolina State have two of the largest university-level textile schools in the world, and from the textile industry's historic importance in the economic development of their respective states of South Carolina and North Carolina. The rivalry is usually considered good-natured due to how similar the two universities are in terms of mission, academics, and fans. The rivalry has been played annually since 1971. In the days and weeks leading up to the game each year, both universities host special programs and events promoting each other's textile programs. In recent years, students from Clemson go on visits of the North Carolina State campus in Raleigh, NC and vice versa. Even though the rivalry has lost some luster at the national level, compared to NC State's local rivalries with the North Carolina Tar Heels and the Duke Blue Devils and Clemson's rivalries with the South Carolina Gamecocks, the Georgia Bulldogs, and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the Florida State Seminoles it still holds a lot of significance for alumni and for the communities surrounding the colleges.

It connects Interstate 5 (Golden State Freeway) with State Route 14 (Antelope Valley Freeway). It is officially named in the memory of Los Angeles Police officer Clarence Wayne Dean, who was killed when the interchange collapsed during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The 5-14 Split, as the interchange is commonly referred to as by locals, is the northernmost of five freeway interchanges on Interstate 5 within a 10-mile stretch. From south to north, the freeways that interchange with Interstate 5 include: California State Highway 170 in Sun Valley, California State Highway 118 in Mission Hills, Interstate 405 also in Mission Hills, Interstate 210, in Sylmar, and ultimately the 14 Freeway. The interchange is extremely large, and consists of numerous flyover ramps and two tunnels. Portions of Interstate 5 in the pass reach up to 21 lanes wide. The complex structure combines a directional T-interchange with a collector–distributor bypass. The bypass, signed as truck lanes, allows traffic to and from State Route 14 to avoid the congested pass summit. These truck lanes extend south to the Interstate 210 interchange, and have direct ramps to and from the 210 Freeway. The bypass is the original four-lane freeway, built as U.S. Route 99. Incidents 1971 collapse Aerial view of the collapsed freeway ramps in 1971. A total collapse of the southbound Interstate 5 to northbound State Route 14 overpass occurred as a result of the February 9, 1971 Sylmar earthquake. This collapse resulted in the additional collapse of the intersecting southbound State Route 14 to southbound I-5 overpass (as this connector bridge was directly beneath the 5/14 overpass). Both bridges fell directly onto the southbound I-5 truck bypass. There was damage to all structures involved, varying from minor cracking and splaying, to the loss of complete sections of bridges. The interchange was rebuilt in 1973, with additional steel rebar reinforcement. 1994 collapse Remains of the CA 14 ramp following its collapse in 1994. The January 17, 1994, Northridge earthquake caused the southbound State Route 14 to northbound I-5 connector to collapse and a bridge crossing San Fernando Road farther north along I-5 to partially fail. It also caused the southbound 14 to southbound I-5 overpass to collapse directly onto the main I-5 freeway and the southbound I-5 truck bypass, nearly exactly as had happened in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. The collapse also closed the Metrolink's Antelope Valley Line, which began operation to Lancaster soon after. The collapse of the southbound 14 ramp caused the death of Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle officer Clarence Wayne Dean, who, while reporting to work, fell from a partially collapsed bridge when he was unable to stop in time. The interchange was later dedicated the Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial Interchange in his honor. In the weeks and months that followed, traffic was rerouted to San Fernando Road through the pass as reconstruction efforts began. The interchange was partially reopened on July 8, and completed in 1995 with additional reinforcing on the overpass support columns. 2007 tunnel fire Around 11 p.m. PDT on October 12, 2007, two trucks collided in the northernmost of two two-lane tunnels that take the southbound truck bypass roadway under the eight mainlanes of I-5 where it travels adjacent to the northbound truck bypass lanes. The tunnel is a 550 ft (167 m) long reinforced concrete box girder, built in 1975. It was last inspected in April 2007, and no problems were found. Thirty commercial vehicles and one passenger vehicle were involved in the traffic collision. A resulting fire soon spread from vehicle to vehicle, eventually encompassing the entire tunnel with flames shooting nearly 100 feet (30 m) outside the tunnel and burning at around .. Three people died - including a 38-year-old male truck driver and his 6-year- old male passenger - and ten people were injured, none critically.LA Times As a result of the accident and ensuing fire, all lanes of I-5 between Calgrove Boulevard and State Route 14 were closed. In addition, the southbound onramps between State Route 126 and Calgrove Boulevard were closed along with the northbound approaches from State Route 14 and Interstate 210. Firefighters finished removing debris from the tunnel at 7 a.m. on October 14. Inspectors found heavy damage to the tunnel walls under the north portal. They also found a lot of spalling and exposed rebar, both of which can cause a loss of vertical support. However, the tunnel roof (or bridge) was found to be sound. Caltrans worked through the weekend of October 13 and 14 to clear out and install five shoring supports inside the tunnel. At 4:20 p.m. on October 14, Caltrans opened up the two northbound truck bypass lanes to all traffic. On Monday, October 15, the southbound mainline lanes of I-5 were reopened at 1:00 am. The northbound mainlane lanes were reopened two hours later. The speed limit on the southbound lanes was lowered to 55 mph (90 km/h) to help with the flow due to heavier congestion than normal. Emergency funding for the repairs was authorized for the damaged tunnel. Contractor C. C. Myers was placed on site with materials and workers to perform any needed repairs. During the repairs the southbound I-5 truck lanes remained closed, while southbound trucks through the interchange were diverted onto the auto lanes. The southbound I-5 truck lanes were reopened on Thursday, November 15, 2007. Security Paving of Oxnard performed the remaining repairs and made safety improvements to the tunnel which included the following: *New pavement for the tunnel walls and the roadway. *Improved tunnel lighting for both sides of the tunnel. This lighting is set to adjust depending on the weather conditions outside the tunnel. In addition, the speed limit on the tunnel was lowered back to 45 mph (70 km/h). Projects View from Sylmar of the southern portion of the interchange. HOV Direct Connector Project In 2013, Caltrans completed an elevated HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) direct connector ramp, linking the recently completed I-5 HOV lanes to the existing CA-14 HOV lanes. This direct connector allows motorists a freeway-to-freeway transfer without exiting the carpool lane. I-5 HOV/Truck Lane Project Caltrans is currently carrying out environmental review of the I-5 HOV/Truck Lanes Project. This project will widen I-5 from the Newhall Pass Interchange north to Parker Road with new HOV lanes and truck lanes. The new HOV and truck lanes would connect with the existing HOV and truck lanes of the Newhall Pass Interchange. This project will cost approximately $2.8 billion. In popular culture The interchange appears briefly in the 2015 disaster film San Andreas, where it collapses yet again during a 9.1 earthquake. The setting for the Doobie Brothers' 1973 album The Captain and Me features the interchange after it collapsed from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. The interchange features in the P.O.D. music video for Alive.

It was provided by the Army National Guard. The division was created on 10 June 1946 as a National Guard infantry division from the efforts of Minnesota's Adjutant General Ellard Walsh. The division was built from scratch with veteran transfers and new recruits, mostly from Minnesota and North Dakota, under the command of Major General Norman Hendrickson. General Hendrickson was the Chief-of-Staff for the 34th Division in the North African and Italian campaigns in 1943 and the IX Corps in occupied Japan. Units of the division were allotted to the Minnesota National Guard, and North Dakota National Guard. The division never saw combat throughout its history, although it was federalized and sent to Camp Rucker, Alabama from 1951 to 1954 during the Korean War. During the Korean War the division was used as a replacement division, and its men and units transferred to Regular Army units. It returned to state control, and its home state, in 1953. The unit returned to Minnesota, with active army personnel from Camp Rucker taking a convoy from Fort Benning, Georgia in 1954. The division's North Dakota elements were transferred out in 1959 during a service-wide reconfiguration to the Pentomic structure. Infantry regiments were dropped and replaced by battle groups bearing the regimental number (1st Battle Group, 135th Infantry, for example) as well as numerous other redesignations and reconfigurations.Military Historical Society of Minnesota, The 47th \\"Viking\\" Infantry Division: Minnesota’s Cold War Division It became an entirely Minnesotan division. The division was again reorganized in 1963, this time according to the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) structure. Battle group designations were dropped and substituted by battalions assigned flexibly to brigades. Several other significant redesignations and changes were also made. The most sweeping reorganization occurred in February 1968. Principal among them was the extension of the division into Iowa and Illinois as a result of Pentagon-mandated cutbacks of the Guard in those states. Iowa's 67th Brigade was disbanded, redesignated as the 34th Infantry Brigade, and assigned to the Viking Division. In Illinois, units of the disbanded 33rd Infantry Division were reorganized into the 66th Infantry Brigade and made part of the 47th Division. In December 1965, the division became one of three National Guard divisions earmarked for the Selected Reserve Force, capable of more rapid deployment. This status was removed on 1 February 1968. The division was deactivated in 1991. Immediately afterward, the division's former units were reactivated as the 34th Infantry Division. Effectively, the division was renamed, but for official lineage purposes, the Department of the Army does not recognize any continuity. The 47th Infantry Division remained on the rolls longer than any other National Guard division that did not see combat (45 years of service). The only Army division that did not see combat to have remained on the rolls longer is the Army Reserve's 108th Infantry Division, elements of which have seen action now in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Born in London, Newton published his first caricature at thirteen. His work included caricatures expressing the English prejudice of the Scots as lean and hungry opportunists. He worked for radical publisher William Holland, producing anti-slavery works among his output, as well as \\"rude assaults\\" against Napoleon and the Royal Family. Newton minded Holland's shop when Holland was imprisoned for sedition during 1793–94. His watercolour (now in the British Museum) of fashionably dressed Londoners looking at prints in Holland's shop in Oxford Street, London, gives a depiction of an 18th-century print shop, and images of many of Holland's actual prints can be recognized on the walls. In 1794, Holland published an edition of Laurence Sterne's A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy with twelve plates by Newton. Newton produced nearly 300 single sheet prints of which the British Museum's collection includes more than half. M. D.

It is a remake of the 2003 South Korean horror film A Tale of Two Sisters, which is in turn one of several film adaptations of the Korean folk tale Janghwa Hongryeon jeon. The film received mixed reviews. Plot Anna has been in a psychiatric institution for ten months, following her suicide attempt after her terminally ill mother died in a boathouse fire. Now, she is being discharged and has no memory of the actual fire, though she is frequently plagued by recurring nightmares from that night. She is picked up by her father, Steven, a writer who has dedicated his latest book to Anna and her sister Alex. At home, Anna reunites with Alex, with whom she is close. The sisters stand against Steven's girlfriend Rachel, who had been their mother's live-in nurse. Alex criticizes Steven for sleeping with Rachel while the girls' mother was still alive and sick in bed. Anna describes to Alex how scenes from her dreams have started happening while she is awake. The sisters become convinced that the hallucinations are messages from their mother, telling them that she was murdered by Rachel so Rachel could be with their father. Anna catches up with her old boyfriend Matt, who tells her that he saw what happened the night of her mother's death. The two secretly plan to meet that night, but he fails to show up and she returns home. In her room, she has a ghastly hallucination of him and the next morning, his dead body is pulled out of the water, his back broken just the way Anna saw it in her vision. The police state he fell and drowned. After the sisters are unable to find a record of Rachel with the State Nursing Association, they conclude she is actually Mildred Kemp, a nanny who killed three children she was paid to care for because she was obsessed with their widowed father. They try to warn Steven, but he ignores their concerns. The girls try to gather evidence against Rachel to show the police but Rachel catches them and sedates Alex. Anna escapes and goes to the local police station, but they do not believe her and call Rachel to take her home. As Rachel puts Anna in bed, Anna sees Alex in the doorway with a knife before passing out. When she wakes up, she finds that Alex has killed Rachel and thrown her body in the dumpster. When their father arrives home, Anna explains that Rachel tried to murder them but Alex saved them by killing her. Confused and in panic, Steven tells Anna that Alex died in the fire along with their mother. Anna looks down to find that she is holding the bloody knife rather than her sister's hand. Anna finally remembers what happened on the night of the fire: after catching her father and Rachel having sex, Anna became enraged, filled a watering can from a gasoline tank in the boathouse and carried it toward the house, intending to burn it with her father and Rachel inside. However, she didn't fully close the tap and it spilled a trail of gasoline that ignited when a candle fell over. Her mother was killed in the resulting explosion, as was Alex. It is revealed that Anna has symptoms of both severe schizophrenia and dissociative identity disorder. Flashbacks reveal that Anna had been hallucinating Alex since she left the institution: this is why no one else had ever responded to Alex's presence; only Anna's. She remembers killing Matt (who did show up at their planned meeting) by letting him fall off the cliff because he saw what Anna had done. She also remembers killing Rachel, who was actually a nice woman; Anna had imagined her being horrible. The next morning, as the police arrest Anna for murder, they question Steven, who reveals that Rachel changed her last name years ago to escape an abusive ex-boyfriend. At the mental institution, Anna is welcomed back by the patient across from her, whose name plate says \\"Mildred Kemp\\".

Parkes and Laurie MacDonald produced the hit horror film The Ring, a remake of the Japanese film Ring. They subsequently produced the film's successful sequel The Ring Two in 2005. Since first starting this new cycle of Asian horror film adaptations, Parkes and MacDonald searched for a project they felt was as ingeniously conceived and executed as The Ring, and finally found it when producer Roy Lee brought the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters to their attention. When A Tale of Two Sisters played in US theaters, directors Tom and Charlie Guard had acquired the English language remake rights. The Guard Brothers had previously directed commercials and short films, and wanted to expand into feature films. In June 2006, DreamWorks announced that a deal had been set up for the US version of A Tale of Two Sisters. The new film was a presentation of DreamWorks and Cold Spring Pictures (Disturbia), and was produced by Parkes, MacDonald and Lee. The screenplay was written by Craig Rosenberg (After the Sunset, Lost), Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard (The Great Raid).Scifi Japan(December 26, 2007). Two Brothers remake Two Sisters. Scifijapan.com.

The film was released in North American theaters on January 30, 2009. Shooting location Although the film is set in Maine, it was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia. Most of the film was shot at one location, a waterfront property on British Columbia's Bowen Island, a short ferry ride west from mainland Vancouver. Producer Walter F. Parkes said, of the shooting location: It is reported that a two-story boathouse in the film was built on the property overlooking the water just for several scenes.

There are two types of ribophorines: ribophorin I and II. These act in the proteic complex oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) as two different subunits of the named complex. Ribophorin I and II are only present in eukaryote cells. Ribophorin is a subunit of oligosaccharide transferase in the RER Both types of ribophorins develop a key role in the binding of ribosomes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum as well as in the co-translational processes that depend on this interaction. The content of ribophorin of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is equal to the stoichiometric number of ribosomal units. Therefore, this suggests the great importance, abundance and good preservation of these proteins in the reticulum. Consequently, defects in the genes that encode these proteins may cause congenital disorders and devastating consequences; ribophorin I and II are encoded by the genes RPN1 and RPN2 respectively. The ribophorins are soluble in non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100. Structure There two types of ribophorin: ribophorin I and ribophorin II; because of that, each one its own characteristics, despite the fact that both ribophorins have some common characteristics. This way, ribophorin I has a different structure in comparison to ribophorin II. Ribophorin I This subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) is formed by 1821 pairs of bases, which is about 607 aminoacids. Its molecular weight is 68550,8 daltons. When anchored to the membrane, 75% of its aminoacids are at the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum or in it. Its signal sequence, eliminated when the protein has matured, is formed by 23 aminoacids and has a negative charge, which is very unusual. The rest of the aminoacids of the mature protein (584 AA) are distributed in this way: from AA 1 to 415 they are located at the lumen of the ER, from 416 to 434 are anchored at the membrane of the organelle, and the others in the cytoplasm. Ribophorin II The other subunit of the OST is formed by 1896 pairs of bases, which is equivalent to 632 aminoacids. Its molecular weight is about 69283’4 daltons. In ribophorin II, the 90% of the aminoacids are located at the membrane or at the lumen of the reticle. As the ribophorin I, it also shows a signal sequence, but this one is formed by 22 AA, with negative charge too. The distribution of the rest is the following one: from AA 1 to 516 are at the lumen, from 517 to 539 at the membrane (as an anchorage) and the last 70 at the cytoplasm. In this case the asparagine which is glycosylated is the number 84 AA. The ribophorin II is completely resistant to a great variety of protease. Location Ribophorins are only found in mammal cells, where they are positioned in the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. They interact with the ribosome during protein translocation into the ER. Both ribophorin I and II possess a type I membrane topology with the bulk of their polypeptide chains directed towards the ER-lumen and they are part of the mammalian protein complex OST; this complex effects the cotranslational N-glycosylation of newly synthesized polypeptides, and is composed by four RER specific membrane proteins, which are the ribophorins (I and II), the OST48 and the Dadl. In order to form the OST complex, there are specific interactions between the proteins; because of that, the lumen domains of ribophorin I and II interact with the lumen domain of OST48. Nevertheless, there is not a direct interaction between both ribophorins. As they are transmembrane proteins, ribophorins cross the ER membrane and, so that, the protein has a cytoplasmic, a transmembrane and a lumen domain. In the case of the ribophorin II, the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains are the ones that have the retention function on the ER; but on the other hand, the lumen domain is the one with the retention function for ribophorin I. Ribophorin I resides in the ER membrane with a single spanning sequence from amino acids 416 to 434, having a cytoplasmic C terminus of 150 amino acids and a luminal N-terminal domain consisting of 415 residues. Ribophotin II is disposed on a similar way in the ER membrane, but now the membrane-spanning domain is located at residues 517-539 and asparagine residues 544 and 547 would be disposed at the cytoplasm leaving only Asn84 as the putative site for oligosaccharide addition; the cytoplasmic domain will have a maximum length of 70 residues. Ribophorins possess signal sequences that localize them preferentially to the ER membrane. Function Ribophorins I and II, transmembrane glycoprotein of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, intervene in the union of the ribosomes (they fix the large subunit, 60S, of the ribosome) to the RE membrane, and they play an important role in the co- translational translocation process which depends on this union, as the com insertion of the nascent polypeptide to the membrane or their transference to the lumen of the cistern; this is the translocation of proteins generated by polyribosomes. Ribophorin I usually interacts with those proteins that have a wrong folding; otherwise, this protein does not interact with native state proteins. This suggests that ribophorin I may work as a chaperone that recognizes the proteins with a wrong folding. Moreover, this ribophorin can regulate the delivery of precursor proteins to the oligosaccharyltransferase (main enzyme of the N-glycosylation for proteins), through the capture of substrates and taking them to the catalytic center. So that, ribophorin I can keep those possible substrates in the proximity of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme; this way, the efficiency of the N-glycosylation reaction will improve during their biogenesis in the ER. But ribophorin I only changes drastically the N-glycosylation of determined substrates, as it is apparently dispensable in the same process with other substrates. When ribophorin is not essential, these precursors have shortcut to the catalytic center of the oligosaccharyltransferase or their presence depends on the rest of the non- catalytic subunits in the complex. It shows the specificity of ribophorin I for determined substrates; so that, this protein will regulate selectively the delivery of substrates to the catalytic center of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. Although ribophorin II is still a protein quite unknown, it has been discovered that this ribophorin is part of an N-oligosaccharyltransferase complex that links high mannose oligosaccharides to asparagine residues found in the Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif of nascent polypeptide chains. Moreover, this protein takes part in the identification of retention signals of other proteins. There is not much information about ribophorin II because this subunit of the complex hasn’t been as investigated as ribophorin I. Synthesis of the ribophorins Protein synthesis of ribophorins is carried out in the cytoplasm. Ribophorin I is encoded by the RPN1 gene, whereas ribophorin II is encoded by the RPN2 gene. Moreover, each gene encodes a signal sequence to indicate the ribophorin cellular localization. In humans, the sequence is formed by 23 amino acids in ribophorin I; and 22 amino acids in ribophorin II. In the chromosome, the genes are found in a specific locus. In humans, RPN1 is located at 3q21.3 (in chromosome 3) and RPN2 is found at the locus 20q12-q13.1 (in chromosome 20). In total, ribophorin I and II are composed by 607 and 632 amino acids, respectively.

The McCormick family eventually moved to Big Spring, Texas, where her father became chief engineer at Cosden Petroleum. She studied art and music at Texas Western College in El Paso and rediscovered bullfighting in the neighboring Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez. She quit college and debuted as a bullfighter on September 9, 1951 in Juárez. She joined the Matador's Union soon after and began bullfighting as a professional Matadora in January 1952, the first American to do so. Throughout her decade-long career, she fought in 300 corridas throughout Mexico and Venezuela. Six times bulls gored her, once so seriously in September 1954 in Ciudad Acuña that a priest administered last rites. She never advanced from the apprentice rank of novillera as no male matador would sponsor her to do so. In 1962, she fought her last bull in San Antonio, Texas.

The film debunks the accepted notion that the Dutch were 'good' during the war, exposing how Dutch police and civil servants helped the Nazis implement massive deportations, which resulted in the death of 78 percent of the Jews in the Netherlands. In truth the above death rate of Jews from Holland masks the much greater tragedy. There were approximately 140,O00 Jews in Holland at the time of the Nazi invasion in May 1940. They included about 25,000 Jews who escaped mostly from Germany and Austria and some from other countries. When the deportations began in 1942 the Nazis did not deport Jews in mixed marriages. About 25,000 Jews were exempt from deportation or went into hiding, half of whom who were hiding were caught or betrayed. Of the 107,000 Jews from Holland actually deported to the concentration camps only about 5000 survived, about 4%. So the actual death rate of arrested, deported and murdered Jews from Holland was closer to 96%. (My family was among the 4% who survived. My twin sister and I are arguably the last surviving twins from camp Bergen-Belsen and possibly the only Jewish twins who survived the Nazi camps and are still alive in 2020 The documentary was made by Emmy Award winning director Willy Lindwer. Summary Anne Frank is perhaps the most familiar symbol of the Holocaust in the Netherlands, remembered for the diary in which she recorded her thoughts, feelings and reflections during her family's two years in hiding. But Anne's memory is most important as a symbol of the senseless destruction of Dutch Jewry, and the deeply rooted antisemitism in Dutch society that allowed for, and even encouraged, the murder of more than 100,000 Jews. Goodbye Holland tells the story of Dutch antisemitism and collaboration with the Nazis — which resulted in the highest percentage of Jewish fatalities in all of Western Europe — through the lens of one man's personal quest to put together the pieces of his family's history. \\"What happened was not just the result of German evil. The Dutch were not willing to save Jews because they perceived the Jew as 'other',\\" says Jacques Wallage, Jewish son of Holocaust survivors who is now the current mayor of Groningen, once home to a vibrant Jewish community. Classic Christian antisemitism was all-pervasive among the devoutly religious Dutch population, and in the wake of economic recession anti-Jewish sentiment reached an all- time high in prewar Netherlands. Many became willing collaborators, betraying Jews who were in hiding, like the Frank family, and actively participating in the destruction of the Jews of the Netherlands. The Dutch were \\"fully at the disposal of the Nazis, and in some cases, the Germans didn't have to do anything, because the Dutch willingly carried out the deportations,\\" the mayor explains. Others merely \\"looked the other way, so they didn't have to see anything.\\" Production Willy Lindwer, a native of Amsterdam, is the son of Holocaust survivors. He graduated from the Netherlands Film Academy in Amsterdam in 1971. He founded the production company AVA Productions in 1985, which has been dedicated to producing international documentaries that are distributed worldwide that often focus on the Holocaust or Jewish themes. In Goodbye Holland, Willy Lindwer investigates the story of his parents' survival in hiding, and of the betrayal of an aunt and uncle who were hidden in a Dutch home nearby. In the process, Lindwer meets with Dutch Holocaust survivors, and children of survivors like himself. In addition, he speaks with former members of the Dutch police force that operated under Nazi occupation. What emerges is a terrifying tale of collaboration between ordinary Dutch citizens and the Nazi regime that led to the annihilation of nearly an entire population.

Soloists are Meng-Chieh Hsieh and Yu-Hsin Chang. (Zhongshan Hall, Taipei, Taiwan. September 2007) Tyzen Hsiao (; 1 January 1938 – 24 February 2015) was a Taiwanese composer of the neo-Romantic school. Many of his vocal works set poems written in Taiwanese Hokkien, the mother tongue of the majority of the island's residents. His compositions stand as a musical manifestation of the Taiwanese literature movement that revitalized the island's literary and performing arts in the 1970s and 1980s. Hsiao's career in music included additional success as a pianist and conductor. Music Tyzen Hsiao's rich tonal style earned him an international reputation as \\"Taiwan's Rachmaninoff\\". His compositions include works for solo instruments and chamber ensembles, many works for solo voice, and large-scale pieces for orchestras and choirs with soloists. Hsiao's most widely performed large-scale pieces include: *Formosa Symphony, opus 49 (1987) *Violin Concerto in D, opus 50 (1988) *Cello Concerto in C, opus 52 (1990) *Piano Concerto in C minor, opus 53 (1992) *1947 Overture for soprano, chorus and orchestra (1993) *Ode to Yu-Shan (Jade Mountain) (1999) *Ilha Formosa: Requiem for Formosa's Martyrs (2001) Yu-Shan (1999) Hsiao's art songs have become standard repertory in Taiwan. \\"Taiwan the Formosa\\" or \\"Taiwan the Green\\" has achieved status as the Taiwan's unofficial national anthem. The song appears as well in the 1947 Overture. Other well-known art songs include \\"The Fairest Flower\\", \\"Eternal Hometown\\", a Taiwanese-language setting of Psalm 23, and \\"I Love Taiwan.\\" He has also won acclaim for his folk song settings, such as \\"Brother Andon Goes to Market\\" and \\"The Grasshopper and the Rooster.\\" Many of Hsiao's songs also exist in orchestral song versions. Hsiao's chamber music includes works for piano four hands, string quartets, piano quintets. The art songs formed the basis of serenades for solo violin and piano as well as other chamber combinations. Hsiao's music for solo piano was less well known in Taiwan until performances by Lina Yeh and others began to bring this repertoire into prominence around the turn of the millennium. Works for solo piano include suites, multi-movement \\"poetic echoes,\\" études, toccatas, and instrumental settings of art songs and hymns. Hsiao remarked in his comments for the recording Memories of Home: \\"For me it is more than a musical instrument. Introduced to me by my Japanese-educated mother, it has become my guide, my companion for life, my most beloved instrument.\\" Hsiao credited Rachmaninov, Bartók and Frédéric Chopin as important influences on his style, along with Presbyterian hymnody and, above all, Taiwanese folk music. Hsiao's fusion of Taiwanese and international music traditions has influenced a number of Taiwanese composers. Enthusiasm for his music runs particularly strong at institutions where Hsiao has served in the past as a teacher, such as the National Taiwan Normal University, the Tainan University of Technology and the National Kaohsiung Normal University. Hsiao's compositions have been the subject of graduate research at the National Sun Yat-sen University in his hometown of Kaohsiung, the Florida State University in Tallahassee (USA), and other institutions. Life and career Early years Tyzen Hsiao was born in Hōzan Town (modern-day Fongshan District) in Taiwan's southern port city of Takao (Kaohsiung) on 1 January 1938. His father, a dentist, served as an elder in the Presbyterian church. His mother, a church pianist, began teaching him piano at an early age. As a teen at the he studied with Kao Ya-mei, a singer, and Kao Chin-hwa (), a pianist trained in Japan. From 1959 to 1963 Hsiao majored in music at the National Taiwan Normal University (then named the Taiwan Provincial Normal Institute), taking a leave of absence midway through his studies to serve as music instructor and administrator for Pai-Sha Junior High School in Penghu. His teachers included two pianists, Kao Tsu-Mei and Li Fu-Mei (), and Paris-trained composer . Upon graduation Hsiao served as __ and Kaohsiung before moving to Japan in 1965 for two years of study at Musashino Academia Musicae. His teachers in Japan included Fujimoto Hideo (; composition) and Nakane Nobue (; piano). Hsiao married Gao Jen-ci upon his return to Taiwan in 1967. Schools where he served on the faculty during this period include the Wenzao Women's Institute of Foreign Language (Wenzao Ursuline University of Languages), Kaohsiung Women's Normal College (National Kaohsiung Normal University), the Tainan Junior College of Home Economics (Tainan University of Technology) and the Tainan Theological College and Seminary. He was appointed professor at the National Taiwan Normal University in 1973. The first \\"Hsiao Tyzen Night\\" featuring performances of his music took place in 1975 at Zhongshan Hall in the Ximen District of Taipei. During this time Hsiao continued studies with Miss Isabel Taylor, a Canadian missionary, and Robert Scholz, an Austrian pianist and composer. Compositions dating from this period include the opera Jesus Christ (1971) on a libretto by his father and the Fantasy Waltz for Two Pianos, opus 38 (1973). Life in America In 1977 difficult personal circumstances arising from the failure of his wife's business obliged Hsiao, now the father of four children, to relocate to the United States. It was to be an eighteen- year stay. Initially Hsiao, depressed and homesick, composed nothing. His musical activity during his first year in America, spent in Atlanta, was limited entirely to the occasional playing of piano in a gift shop for his own entertainment. One day an elderly woman in the shop took time to listen. \\"Young man,\\" she said. \\"You are so talented. Why are you here?\\" Her question re-awakened the composer's creative passion. The following year Hsiao moved to Los Angeles where he began fruitful collaborations with friends and colleagues in California's Taiwanese community. Compositions flowed from his pen. Art songs included The Vagabond (1978) on his own Taiwanese text, \\"March of Democracy\\" (1980), and \\"What a Beautiful Taiwan\\" (1984). Chamber music included the Highlander's Suite for piano quintet. Hsiao's creative activity carried political consequences, though, when the Kuomintang government, displeased with \\"March of Democracy,\\" suppressed performance of Hsiao's music in Taiwan and forbade his re-entry. From 1985 to 1987 Hsiao earned a master's in composition at the California State University, Los Angeles. His teachers included Byong Kon Kim (composition) and Milton Stern (piano). Creative activity increased in subsequent years. 1987 saw: composition of the Symphony Opus 49 \\"Formosa\\" and the art song \\"Never Disregard Taiwan\\" on a text by Yang- Min Lin; the release of a recording, Psalms of the Taiwanese: Tyzen Hsiao's Compositions by the North American Taiwanese Professors Association. In 1988 Hsiao composed the Violin Concerto in D, opus 50. Violinist Ingrid Chun (formerly Ingrid Kuo) was the first to promote this piece in concerts throughout the US with pianist Melody Kuo. 1988 was also the year Hsiao composed the anthem \\"Taiwan the Formosa\\" setting a text by Rev. Er-Yu Cheng. More compositions followed: the Cello Concerto in C, opus 52 (1990); The Prelude for Pipe Organ (1990); and the song \\"Mother's Hair\\" (1990). The Prelude for Pipe Organ won the California Music Teachers Association Composition Competition in 1991. The Taiwanese American Foundation named Hsiao a Humanity Award Laureate in 1989. The Wild Lily student movement of 1990 marked the beginning of rapid progress toward democracy in Taiwan. In 1992 Taiwan's government lifted its ban on Hsiao's return. That same year Hsiao completed the Piano Concerto in C minor, opus 53 and the songs \\"The Fairest Flower\\" and \\"Eternal Homeland.\\" Lin Cho-Liang and the San Diego Symphony Orchestra (USA) gave the premier of his Violin Concerto, while Carol Ou and the Taipei County Cultural Center Orchestra gave the Cello Concerto its premier in Taiwan. In 1993 Hsiao suffered a heart attack while composing the 1947 Overture. He recovered and completed the work. In 1994 Jonathan Tang and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (Canada) gave the premier of the Piano Concerto. Return to Taiwan Hsiao returned to Taiwan in 1995 as part of a wave of Taiwanese living abroad who moved back in response to democratic reforms. His new residence in Tamsui faced the sea and offered work space and inspiration. Compositions after this return included: Nocturne for Violin and Piano, Fantasia for Flute and Piano, and Toccata for solo piano (1995); Formosa Trio for piano trio and Dragon Boat Festival for solo piano (1996); Angel from Formosa and Ode to Yu-Shan (Jade Mountain) for choir with piano or orchestra (1999); the cantata \\"The Prodigal Son\\" (2000). This period was a time of growing recognition of his achievements as a composer at home and abroad. The American premier of the Cello Concerto took place in 1995 with a performance by Felix Fan and the San Diego Symphony. The premier of 1947 Overture took place the same year with a performance by the Oakland Youth Orchestra featuring soprano Huang Mei-Hsing and Taiwanese-American choir. 1997 saw the formation of the Tyzen Hsiao Music Association in Taiwan. The same year saw Russian premiers of Formosa Symphony (Russian Federal Symphony), The Angel of Formosa and Violin Concerto (Moscow Symphony). Ode to Yu-Shan (Jade Mountain) was performed as part of the 2000 Presidential Inauguration in Taipei. The Russian premier of the Cello Concerto and 1947 Overture took place in 2000 in a program that included the Violin Concerto. 2001 marked the premier of Ilha Formosa: Requiem for Formosa's Martyrs (poetry by Min-Yung Lee) in Taipei. The American premiere took place soon after in Lincoln Center, New York. Retirement In 2002 Hsiao suffered a stroke while composing the Love River Symphony. He moved back to Los Angeles to better enable his recovery and suspended most of his composition activities. The Love River Symphony remains unfinished. Hsiao's music continues to be performed and recognized. The Japanese premiere of \\"Ilha Formosa!\\" took place in 2004. In 2007 Formosa Dreaming, a concert of works for orchestra and voices by Hsiao and Fan-Long Ko, toured the United States after a sendoff concert in Taipei's Zhongshan Hall, the historic venue that the served as the site of the first \\"Tyzen Hsiao Night\\" in 1975. The concert features the NTNU Symphony orchestra, the Formosa Festival Choir, and four vocal soloists from Taiwan conducted by Apo Hsu. Hsiao was awarded Taiwan's National Art Prize (2004), the Wu Sam-lien Musical Contribution Award (2005), the Kaohsiung City Prize for the Arts (2006) and the National Cultural Award (2009). Death Hsiao died of lung cancer in Los Angeles, California on 24 February 2015 at the age of 77.

He was a pupil of George Bickham, but after having engraved a few plates, chiefly landscapes of no great merit, he relinquished the practice of the art, and devoted the remainder of his life to teaching drawing, first in London and afterwards in Brighton, Sussex.

He also served as an employee of the U.S. State Department for over twenty-five years and as a talk host on an AM radio station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Easby was the great-grandson of General George Meade, victor of the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg against Robert E. Lee, and a descendant of seven signers of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Easby's mother was a descendant of Nicholas Waln, who came to Philadelphia in 1682 aboard the ship Welcome with William Penn, and was later given the section of the city now known as Frankford. Early life and family background Easby was born on June 3, 1918 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father was Major May Stevenson Easby, a banker in Philadelphia and World War I hero. Easby's mother was Henrietta Meade Large Easby, described as \\"prim and reserved, a Victorian lady of few words\\".The Baleroy Mansion He also had a younger brother Steven who died at a very young age in 1931 from some type of childhood disease. The family \\"traces its roots to Easby Abbey in 12th Century Yorkshire, England; that crossed over to America in 1683 aboard the Welcome with William Penn, and that counts among its descendants three – \\"at least three that I know of,\\" says Easby – signers of the Declaration of Independence.\\" General George Meade, victor of the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War, was Easby's great-grandfather through Meade's daughter. \\"My mother's mother was General (George G.) Meade's daughter,\\" said Easby. Education and careers Easby graduated from Chestnut Hill Academy in June 1936, after reaching the age of 18. To celebrate all of this, on July 9, 1936, his parents purchased for him a brand new convertible Packard Super Eight luxury automobile from the nearest Packard dealership (Goldner Brothers) on Germantown Avenue. By the fall of the same year, he began studying illustration at the University of the Arts in Center City, Philadelphia. After the start of World War II in 1939, Easby was drafted into the United States Army and was assigned to patrol (by air) the Atlantic Coast. At the end of World War II Easby continued work as an artist and became a recognized cartoonist. He then got involved in acting and producing low-budget Hollywood films. Later, he worked as a radio talk host and as a U.S. State Department employee for over twenty-five years. He served on the Commission of Fine Arts and often met with highly important figures. In the meantime, Easby became a major art and antique collector, who inherited more than 100,000 antiques and personal items, many of which had been in his family for centuries. His collection includes items belonging to General George Meade, a chair and other high valued items belonging to Napoleon of France as well as jewelry belonging to Joséphine de Beauharnais. It also includes the very utensils that were used by the founding fathers of the United States during the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. Many pieces from his collection have been loaned to the White House, U.S. State Department for its diplomatic reception rooms, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Some of his pieces are also housed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Easby's furniture items were often traded at auctions such as Christie's and Sotheby's in the above one million dollar range each. Among many of the antique watches and clocks left to Easby, one was made for the 18th-century Queen Marie Antoinette of France. Easby was also a collector of antique cars. He owned the 1954 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith that was previously owned by Prince Aly Khan (husband of the famous American actress Rita Hayworth and father of Aga Khan IV), his first vehicle (the Packard) and a few others. Following the January 1969 death of his father Easby has been living by himself in the family's Baleroy Mansion, which is located in the historically affluent Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It has been given a title as the \\"Most Haunted Home in America\\", due to its infestation of spirits, ghosts, jinns, demons, angels or other supernatural beings that came to the 32-room mansion with the large collection of antiques. In 1990 Easby told The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"The neighbors worry that it might become a Disney World with buses and tourists, but heavens, I've assured them that it won't.\\" Death Easby died on December 11, 2005, at a hospice (Keystone Hospice) in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. He was 87 years old at the time of his death and had no living siblings or children. The cause of his death was reported as \\"multiple organ failure\\". According to a 2008 Philadelphia court record: Easby was buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. He was known as an extremely kind and generous person.

McFarland, 2013, p.248. Production Alexander H. Cohen, who had produced Dietrich's successful Broadway runs of her one-woman show in 1967 and 1968, suggested a television version of her show. Dietrich would receive a fee of $250,000 for her participation in the project. It was said at the time that this was the highest one-shot fee ever paid to a performer to appear on television.Robertst, Paul G. Style Icons Vol 4 Sirens. Fashion Industry Broadcast, 2015 p.39. After two airings (one in the UK and one in the US), the copyright on the show would revert to Dietrich. Dietrich—wary of television as a medium—insisted that the show be filmed in a legitimate theatre in Europe, to best capture her act and audience reaction thereto. The New London Theatre in London was chosen as location for filming, although the theatre would still be under construction at the time of filming. (The theatre would only officially open the following year.) Lighting designer Joe Davis was brought in to recreate Dietrich's stage lighting and designer Rouben Ter-Arutunian designed a set featuring scrims and incorporating a Dietrich sketch by René Bouche. Dietrich's costumes were by Jean Louis, and Stan Freeman conducted the orchestra, using orchestrations of the Dietrich repertoire by Burt Bacharach. Taping took place on November 23 and November 24, 1972. Dietrich gave two complete shows to non-paying, invitee-only audiences. Shots of Dietrich interacting with the audience were also taped at the end of the second concert. She also shot retakes of \\"Lili Marlene\\" and \\"Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)\\" (the latter both in English and German) sans audience against a black velour backdrop to facilitate a post-production split-screen montage of her singing beside old black and white stills from the 1930s and 1940s. The best selections from the various tapings would be combined to form the final, one-hour-long special. Repertoire A set-list of twenty songs was devised for the taping, including foreign-language selections in French and German, which would facilitate variant edits for differing European markets: * \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\" * \\"You're the Cream in My Coffee\\" * \\"My Blue Heaven\\" * \\"See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have\\" * \\"The Laziest Gal in Town\\" * \\"When the World Was Young\\" * \\"Johnny\\" * \\"Go 'Way From My Window\\" * \\"I Wish You Love\\" * \\"White Grass\\" * \\"Boomerang Baby\\" * \\"La Vie en Rose\\" * \\"Allein in Einer Grossen Stadt\\" * \\"Lola\\" * \\"Das Lied ist Aus\\" * \\"Marie Marie\\" * \\"Lili Marlene\\" * \\"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\\" * \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\" * \\"Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)\\" Broadcast Dietrich performing in the TV special An Evening with Marlene Dietrich. Originally titled I Wish You Love, the show premiered in the UK on the BBC on January 1, 1973, and in the U.S. on January 13, 1973, on CBS Television (sponsored by Kraft Foods). The original UK runtime was 54 minutes, but the show was trimmed down to 50 minutes to meet US network demands. To promote the show, Dietrich had a photo sitting with Milton Greene, which produced a famous portrait of her, appearing to wear nothing but her famous swansdown coat. CBS organised a press conference with Dietrich at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and an exclusive interview with Rex Reed to publicize the US network showing. At the conference and in her interview with Reed, Dietrich - to the surprise of her producers and the network - slammed the show, claiming it wasn't on par with her live shows, that rehearsal time was severely limited and that the show was technically inept. Despite her statements, the show garnered good (if not spectacular) ratings and generally positive reviews from the press. As a result of her interviews, she was sued by producer Alexander H. Cohen - successfully in the UK, but unsuccessfully in the US. After its initial US and UK broadcasts, varying edits of the show were broadcast around the world, including Australia, Germany, France, Spain and South Africa. Home video For its home video release in the 1980s, the show was retitled An Evening with Marlene Dietrich (its current title).Gemünden, Gerd and Desjardins, Mary R. Dietrich Icon.. Duke University Press, 2009, p.352. A DVD version released by EMI in 2003 included five previously unreleased songs. The Dietrich estate sued EMI-Toshiba for including these unlicensed selections without their permission. Previously unseen alternate takes of \\"Lola\\" and \\"You're the Cream in My Coffee\\" were included as bonus features on the Kino DVD release of The Blue Angel. This material comes from the Marlene Dietrich Collection Berlin, which holds all unissued material related to the television special as part of its collection.

Waupaca was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 2072) on 23 November 1944, at Bayonne, New Jersey, by the East Coast Shipyard, Inc.; launched on 4 January 1945; sponsored by Miss Muriel A. Porter; and commissioned at Marine Basin, Brooklyn, New York, on 9 February 1945, Lt. William G. Brown, USNR, in command. World War II service Waupaca got underway on 7 March for Norfolk, Virginia. After conducting shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, the tanker proceeded to the Netherlands West Indies. She arrived at Aruba on 16 April and completed loading a cargo of diesel oil and aviation gasoline the following day. Underway on the 17th, she transited the Panama Canal on the 22d, en route to southern California. Pacific Ocean operations After discharging her cargo upon arrival at San Diego, California, she underwent repairs in dry dock before she proceeded to Los Angeles, California. Soon after her arrival there, she loaded a cargo of diesel and lubricating oil, got underway for Hawaii on 22 May, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 June. Assigned to Service Squadron 8 upon arrival, Waupaca got underway for the Marshalls on 26 June. She arrived at Eniwetok Atoll on 8 July and reported for duty with Service Division (ServDiv) 102. Based at Eniwetok, the tanker fueled many types of ships—mainly amphibious craft, PC's, and minecraft—from 8 July through the end of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean. Sighting a floating mine After the surrender of Japan, ServDiv 102 received orders to Tokyo Bay to fuel smaller units of the occupation forces. With a full cargo of diesel and lubricating oils, Waupaca got underway on 7 September, as part of Task Unit (TU) 30.9.21, and proceeded for Tokyo Bay. En route, lookouts sighted a floating, drifting, horn-type mine and notified the Officer in Tactical Command (OTC) of TU 30.9.21, who dispatched a patrol craft to investigate -- PC-825 soon sank the navigational hazard with gunfire. End-of-war activity Waupaca anchored off Yokosuka, Japan, on the 21st, and shifted alongside the damaged Japanese battleship Nagato on the 30th to serve as a fueling station. The tanker remained in the Tokyo Bay area into the winter and returned to San Francisco, California, on 18 January 1946. Post-war decommissioning Decommissioned on 26 March, Waupaca was struck from the Navy List on 1 May, and she was delivered to the Maritime Commission on 1 July 1946. Purchased by the Standard-Vacuum Oil Co., of New York City, New York, on 14 November 1946https://pmars.marad.dot.gov/NewCards/5112_9419AF.jpg and renamed Mei Shan, the tanker sailed under the Stars and Stripes until acquired by the Canadian- based firm of Oriental Trade and Transport Co., Ltd., in 1948. Successively renamed Stanvac 312 and Stanvac Mei Foo, she served under the British flag until 1954, when the Philippine subsidiary of Standard-Vacuum Oil Co., based at Manila, purchased the ship and renamed her Stanvac Visayas II. In 1963, she was acquired by Mobil Oil, Philippines, Inc., and renamed Mobil Visayas; and, in 1970, she was sold and again renamed, this time Lapu-Lapu Carrier, by Del Mar Carriers, Inc., under which name she served, under Philippine registry.

However, neither their environment or the hospital technicians can keep down the indomitable spirit of these children. Nor can anything stop their quest to one day run truly free, unbound by the medical shackles that bind them.  Plot  Tom and Lola are a young boy and girl who are victims of a rare disease which means that they are prevented from any contact with the outside world. They are kept inside plastic bubbles in a Paris hospital. In this aseptic and strictly controlled microcosm run by doctors especially chosen for the task, the children are left with almost no external stimuli, other than an old black and white TV set tuned to educational films about subjects such as whale song, trains, and a show called The Adventures of Tikira in Alaska. Tom's mother is in constant attendance, but her increasingly desperate attempts to beguile him have alienated her almost totally from them, and apart from Hélène, a member of the medical team who has been their nearest thing to a parent, Tom and Lola's only close attachment is to each other. Eventually, the two children discover that by using the gauntlets that form part of their plastic pods, they are able to reach out and grasp each other's hands. One night, Tom discovers that if he pulls Lola's arms hard enough and she pulls his, they can draw their bubbles close enough for him to reach the external emergency deflate controls on her bubble. After he has activated these, Lola escapes her bubble and releases Tom from his. Over the next few nights, the children regularly escape their plastic prisons and eventually meet Robert, a boy in another ward of the hospital. He is initially frightened by the two strange children. He thinks Tom and Lola are Martians, possibly due to their nakedness and baldness which is required for hygienic living within the bubbles. However, they quickly make friends, and he shows them other areas of the hospital, including the hydrotherapy pool, where he has a seizure after his medication drip line pulls out. The pair save him, and get him back to his room. During another visit, Robert tells Tom and Lola that he is originally from Izoard, a small skiing village in the French Alps and shows them plans for escaping the hospital in order to return home. Tom and Lola agree this is a good idea and all three plan to escape the next night. However, when they arrive at his room the following night, Robert has already left and (they later discover) has come to grief while climbing over the hospital wall. Undeterred, Tom and Lola decide to escape anyway, having secured the address of Hélène. Escaping the hospital, the two find their way across the Seine to a railway shunting yard in search of the train to Izoard, and climb aboard a passenger carriage where they fall asleep. They are discovered and taken to Hélène's home by a railway worker, having found on them a card with the address. When Tom and Lola arrive at her house, her children are at home, alone as usual, as their mother spends more time with Tom and Lola at her work than with her own kids. A mutual regard and understanding develops between them, and together they contrive to set up a home situation more like the environment at the hospital, in the hope of regaining Hélène's attention. These hopes are dashed when she arrives home: her priority clearly remains the wellbeing of the escapees, and when her oldest son overhears her promise to the runaways that she will shelter them, he is disillusioned and calls the authorities. The inevitable consequence in these circumstances is that the children will die, and the movie does not pull back from that, but treats the prospect in an allegorical, \\"magical realist\\" way. As the medical staff had planned in any case to separate the children without regard for their attachment - something they discovered only in the process of escaping - their pronostic had always been bleak.  Production  The film is an unusual science fiction parable from French cinema auteur Bertrand Arthuys that recreates a libertarian perspective for children where false morality has no place. Arthuys has successfully avoided the mire of existentialist melodrama common with children's characters in situations of illness, and in doing so he manages a difficult task: to captivate the audience so that the movie is more like a carefree adventure. Arthuys does not spare his characters' natural exposure on camera ... the nudity of the two children for roughly half the duration of the film could have led to oblivion for this movie. But it is all intrinsically subservient to his strong desire to get his message across. Neither do their tender physical expressions of mutual affection ever transgress, in degree or nature, what would reasonably be considered age- appropriate . Lola and Tom do engage in gritty and sharply witty dialogue with the scientific team each morning, but this is largely to relieve the daily tedium. Another striking motif is the repeated reference to an idealised heaven conceived by the two with the code phrase 'Iceberg-Alaska-Tikira', a whispered mantra as a sign of celebration or connection, accompanied with expressive signing gestures. This is later supplemented or supplanted by \\"Izoard!\\" as an aspirational symbol. Their interaction with the adult world, populated by imbeciles who occasionally play ridiculous roles to entertain the pair from outside the bubbles, is clearly disproportionate, as if the children were a few light years ahead of the 'common sense' practised within the French hospital. With the moralistic and sometimes hysterical persecution of artistic licence observed since the late 1980s, this film gained only a narrow VHS distribution, with regard to the fiercely competitive category of collector's items. A great example of avant-garde cinema, victimised by the approach. The aesthetics of scenarios in the laboratory and the excessive use of white, is similar to THX 1138 by George Lucas, a kind of paradigm in the science fiction of the 1970s. This neatly evokes and reinforces the chosen environments on which the two children fixate, whose snowy and frozen purity presumably promises a freedom from the bacterial threats which enforce their captivity in civilisation.

It was a turretless, tracked armoured fighting vehicle designed by the Yekaterinburg-based Uralmash design bureau (UZTM) between autumn 1944 and spring 1945. It used the chassis of the T-44 medium tank and was intended to replace the SU-100 which itself had only entered service with the Red Army in late 1944. Two prototypes of the Uralmash-1 with different armament were built in early 1945, one with the 100 mm D-10 tank gun, the other with the 122 mm D-25S tank gun. While mass production was initially recommended, the end of the war with Germany in May 1945 eventually caused the project to be cancelled due to lack of necessity. If the Uralmash-1 had entered service, the 100 mm variant would have been designated SU-101 (СУ-101) while the 122 mm variant would have been designated SU-102 (СУ-102), in accordance with Soviet military nomenclature, where the \\"SU\\"-label stood for Samokhodnaya Ustanovka, or self-propelled gun. Development history Work on the SU-101 and SU-102 at the Uralmash design bureau had basically started parallel to the creation of the SU-100, in summer 1944. While the latter, based on the chassis of the T-34 medium tank, proved satisfactorily in combat, its basic layout with crew compartment in the front and engine in the back was considered a flaw. The lowly mounted gun protruded far from the vehicle's front, which resulted in cumbersome maneuverability in urban or forested areas and could cause problems in undulating terrain, where the vehicle could potentially ram its own muzzle into the ground if not driven carefully. Additionally, the SU-100 was very front heavy, which resulted in excessive stress on the forward road wheels, risking mechanical failure. Should the need for upgrading the vehicle with a bigger and heavier gun arise, all these problems were expected to be massively exacerbated. To address these deficiencies, UZTM designer N.V. Kurin had developed a number of preliminary designs of new self-propelled guns, using the chassis of different contemporary Soviet tanks, both with crew compartment in the front and in the back. In October 1944 the bureau offered five projects to the technical review board of the Commissariat of Heavy Industry for further examination: *SU-122P, a regular SU-100 equipped with the 122 mm D-25S gun. *ESU-100, a regular SU-100 with an electric transmission. *SU-100-M-1, armed with the 100 mm D-10S gun, based on the chassis of the T-34 tank, with a rear fighting compartment. *SU-100-M-2, armed with the 100 mm D-10S gun, based on the chassis of the T-44 tank, with a rear fighting compartment. *SU-122-44, armed with the 122 mm D-25-44S gun, based on the chassis of the T-44 tank, with a forward fighting compartment. The technical review board recognized the SU-100-M-2 and the SU-122-44, both based on the new T-44 medium tank, as the most promising ones, and by order of directive № 625 to the tank industry, dated October 26, 1944 to the plant of UZTM, ordered the finalization of the design, distribution of the technical drawings and preparation of one prototype each. While the SU-100-M-2 proved to be compact and light enough for a medium tank chassis as well sufficiently armoured, the SU-122-44 soon emerged as too big and too heavy. Thus, on March 7, 1945, by the commissariat's order № 107, all work on the SU-122-44 was terminated, whereas the SU-100-M-2 was redesignated as Uralmash-1 and the production of a first prototype by May 1, 1945 was ordered. The designation Uralmash-1 had already been used for a different self- propelled gun design in August 1943, but that design had not been approved by the commissariat and was frozen at that time. In March and April 1945, two prototypes were built, one equipped with the 100 mm D-10 tank gun (to be designated SU-101 when inducted into actual service), the other with the 122 mm D-25S tank gun (to be named SU-102). Additionally, a third, empty, hull was made for armour tests under life fire circumstances. While the war with Germany had already ended in May 1945, the prototypes were for the time being further tested by the UZTM design bureau during summer and autumn 1945. Several problems emerged, among them was the heating up of the vehicle's interior due to insufficient engine cooling. This was especially severe in the case of the driver, who was seated next to the engine and whose working station heated up to unbearable temperatures in summer. Another problem emerging was the very crammed and uncomfortable crew compartment. Finally, the SU-102 prototype faced structural problems, being not entirely suitable for absorbing the recoil of the powerful 122 mm gun. Yet these issues were deemed solvable and the vehicles were recommended for mass production after application of several modifications to address the prototypes' problems. Eventually, however, the end of World War II finally led to the conclusion that the vehicles had by now become unnecessary, and in the end, the production of the SU-101 and SU-102 was terminated before it began. The SU-101 prototype survived and is now preserved in the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow, where it is displayed as an indoor exhibit. Design characteristics The Uralmash-1 was a turretless casemate vehicle with a flat engine compartment in the front and a boxy elevated crew compartment in the rear, mounted on a suspension taken directly from the T-44 medium tank. The main gun protruded from the crew compartment and arched over the vehicle's engine. Thus, even a long-barreled gun only slightly increased the overall vehicle length, improving maneuverability and eliminating one of the SU-100's major deficits. This layout was referred to as of the Ferdinand sort (\\"по типу Фердинанда\\") in internal Soviet documents, referencing the German heavy tank destroyer Ferdinand faced by Soviet forces at that time, which was built in a similar fashion. The layout also spread the vehicles weight more evenly among the road wheels, addressing the mechanical issues faced by the front heavy SU-100. The crew of 4 consisted of vehicle commander, gunner, loader and driver. While the driver was seated in the front left side of the vehicle next to the engine, the rest of the crew was placed in the crew compartment around the main gun in the rear. Access to the vehicle was provided by a door in the rear of the vehicle. This additionally increased crew survivability, as in the case of an emergency evacuation the crew could exit the vehicle without exposing themselves to enemy fire as much as an evacuation through the roof hatches would require. The Uralmash-1's hull was made from plates of rolled homogeneous armour, welded together in a sloped fashion to give it improved protection. The frontal plates had a thickness of 90 mm, the sides 75 mm and the rear 40 mm. During firing tests with the empty hull, the vehicle's protection proved to be superior to the much heavier ISU-152 tank destroyer as well as the IS-2 heavy tank. The SU-101 prototype with the 100 mm D-10S gun came with a combat loadout of 35 rounds. While the horizontal gun traverse at 22.5° and the vertical elevation at 18° were entirely sufficient, the engine compartment limited the gun depression at a very meagre −2°, almost eliminating the vehicle's ability to go hull-down. The bigger 122 mm D-25S gun of the SU-102 prototype, with 28 rounds of ammunition, was even more limited in its gun traverse, not being able to depress the gun further than 0.24° with an elevation of 18.5° and horizontal traverse of 19°. The very limited gun depression is one of the fundamental drawbacks of a rear-mounted gun layout. The Uralmash-1's vehicle commander was additionally provided with a 12.7 mm DShK machine gun mounted in his roof hatch for use as an anti-aircraft weapon. The DShK ammunition loadout was 450 rounds. The Russian designation \\"SU\\", meaning Samokhodnaya Ustanovka or self-propelled gun, is a rather diffuse term that was equally applied to vehicles which in combat fulfilled the roles of dedicated tank destroyers, infantry-supporting assault guns, and even indirect-fire artillery, i.e. self-propelled howitzers. The SU-101/SU-102 as a replacement for the SU-100, which was mainly used as tank destroyer, was potentially intended to fulfill the latter's role. The 100 mm D-10S of the SU-101 was a dedicated tank gun with capable kinetic energy armour-piercing rounds. The 122 mm D-25S of the SU-102 against that had originally been developed as an artillery howitzer to be used with high explosive rounds. However, in the course of the war, the gun had also proved to be a very effective anti-tank weapon, capable of knocking out even heavy German tanks, and armour-piercing kinetic energy ammunition had been developed to augment this battlefield role. As such the gun was already in use with the heavier ISU-122 tank destroyer.

In 1969 it was suburbanised to Schalksmühle. Geography Hülscheid is located to the east-northeast of Schalksmühle, to the northwest of Lüdenscheid and to the south of Hagen. It is in the Sauerland. History The oldest written documents on the municipality date back to 1350, when the farmers of Hülscheid formed a free dukedom. The largest extent of the Freigrafschaft Hülscheid was in 1478, when it contained not only the Kirchspiel Hülscheid, but also the northwestern part of the Kirchspiel Lüdenscheid. Coat of arms The coat of arms shows three leaves of European Holly (Ilex aquifolium), a red-and-white chequered pattern in the middle and a small golden field at the bottom. This was designed by Otto Hupp based on an idea of Fritz Thomée, former Landrat of the district Altena and was granted on January 16, 1935. It is however not in official use any more as Hülscheid is now politically a part of Schalksmühle and the Hülscheid coat of arms has been integrated into the Schalksmühle coat of arms. Church The Church There is a one-nave hall type church in Hülscheid with a small drawn-in quadratic choir and a quadratic tower. An inscription on the south is dated 1784 and says : \\"Auxiliante do ecclesia heacce ex fundo renovata ete perfecta / est sub cura th. h. Pöpinghaus Hülsche densium / reformator um fidelis abe architectis corn. hend. et caps. wilh. iac. ulenberg fratribus\\" To the south of the tower one can find two baroque gravestones.

Elected for four consecutive two-year terms as mayor of Kauai beginning in 1974, he was the first Filipino American mayor of any United States municipality. He was widely respected in Kauai and throughout Hawaii for his belief in community service, and was known as \\"Mala\\" by friends and constituents. Early life Eduardo Malapit was born in Kauai on April 6, 1933. He was raised in the town of Hanapepe. Malapit's father and mother, Eusebio and Leonila Malapit, owned the Hanapepe Pool Hall during the 1960s. He often worked as a shoeshiner in front of his parents' business. Malapit attended Waimea High School in Kauai, where he played football. Malapit obtained a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Hawaii. He went on to receive a jurisprudence degree from the University of Notre Dame Law School in 1962. He worked as a public prosecutor after graduation. Political career Eduardo Malapit's first public office was as a councilman on the Kauai County Council for eight years. Malapit was elected as Mayor of Kauai in 1974, becoming the first mayor of Filipino American descent in the United States. Malapit served as mayor for four consecutive two-year terms (total of 8 years) from 1974 until 1982. According to news reports, Malapit kept a pair of firefighting boots hidden behind a curtain in his office while mayor in order to respond quickly to emergencies. Malapit oversaw a development boom, as well as difficult periods, while mayor of Kauai. Malapit is often credited with improving and updating Kauai's infrastructure during his tenure as mayor. Under his authority, Kauai's public parks were renovated. Brand new community centers, police stations, fire stations, sewage treatment plants, and garbage transfer stations were built on the island. However, Malapit's term as mayor also coincided with the Nukoli'i development, which caused an island-wide controversy. Malapit's own mayoral office was heavily damaged by a pipe bomb. It is believed that Malapit was targeted because of the Nukoli'i development. The perpetrators of the bombing were never captured and are still at large. Malapit left the mayor's office in 1982. His next post as a public official was the chairman of the Hawaii state Board of Labor and Industrial Relations. Malapit held that post from 1983 to 1987. Malapit served as the governor's representative for the County of Kauai from 1987 to 1990. He also worked as a part-time magistrate. Community service Malapit was known in Kauai for his leadership in community service. He held the positions of president and legal adviser for the Kauai Pop Warner football league. He also served as president of the West Kauai Jaycees. Malapit also worked with a number of other sports related organizations including the Koloa Youth Baseball Organization. Additionally, Malapit served as president of the Koloa school PTA and the Koloa Lions Club. He worked as the director of the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, a statewide position. A practicing Roman Catholic, Malapit was appointed to the Kauai Catholic Vicariate board which advises the Bishop on issues facing local Kauai Catholic schools. Malapit was also active on the Kauai Filipino Community Council. Death Eduardo Malapit died on Monday, August 27, 2007 at Wilcox Memorial Hospital in Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii. He was 74 years old. Malapit was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, to whom he had been married for 45 years, and four sons, Kevin, Lon, Kent and Lyle. U.S. Representative Mazie Hirono (D-HI) commented on Malapit's life, \\"He was my friend and supporter. He was a colorful and humble man who had a great sense of loyalty and friendship. I will certainly miss Mala.\\" Malapit had supported Hirono during her successful run for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in 1994.

She was the name ship of the Caledon sub-class of the C class. She survived both world wars to be scrapped in 1948. Design and description The Caledon sub-class was a slightly larger and improved version of the preceding Centaur sub-class with a more powerful armament. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a deep draught of . Displacement was at normal and at deep load.Friedman 2010, p. 387 Caledon was powered by two Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, which produced a total of . The turbines used steam generated by six Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of about . She carried tons of fuel oil. The ship had a crew of about 400 officers and other ranks; this increased to 437 when serving as a flagship.Gardiner & Gray, p. 60 The main armament of the Caledon-class ships consisted of five BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline. One gun was forward of the bridge, two were fore and aft of the two funnels and the last two were in the stern, with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun. The two QF 20-cwt anti-aircraft guns were positioned abreast of the fore funnel. The torpedo armament of the Caledons was four times more powerful than that of the Centaurs, with eight torpedo tubes in four twin mounts, two on each broadside. Caledon was converted at the end of 1943 to an anti-aircraft cruiser, replacing the entire former armament with three QF Mk XVI twin and two Bofors Mk IV \\"Hazemeyer\\" twin mounts. By 1944 this was supplemented by six Bofors 40 mm Mk III and one Oerlikon Mk III single mounts. The ship's tonnage increased to at full load, including 200 tonnes of lead ballast. Construction and career She was laid down by Cammell Laird on 17 March 1916, launched on 25 November 1916 and commissioned into the Navy on 6 March 1917. Caledon, commanded by Commodore Walter Cowan, saw action in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, where the ship was the leader of the First Light Cruiser Squadron. During the battle, British light cruisers, including Caledon, supported by the First Battlecruiser Squadron, attempted to cut off and destroy a force of German minesweepers escorted by light cruisers. The engagement developed into a chase with the German ships retreating behind smoke screens. The pursuit broke off when the British cruisers came under fire from the German battleships and , which were deployed as a distant covering force for the German minesweeping operation. Caledon was hit by a single shell from one of the German battleships which failed to explode, and did no damage.Bennett 2002, pp. 59, 228. Throughout the battle, five men of Caledons crew were killed, with one man, John Henry Carless being awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for remaining at his gun after receiving a fatal wound. Caledon survived the First World War. Caledon took part in the British naval intervention in the Baltic in 1919, serving as Rear Admiral Cowan's flagship for a force of two cruisers (Caledon and and five destroyers that sailed for the Baltic in January 1919.Bennett 2002, pp. 52–53, 70–73. Caledon shelled Soviet forces at Ventspils during February, helping Latvians to retake the town, before being returning to the United Kingdom later that month, with British naval forces in the Baltic being relieved every six weeks.Bennett 2002, pp. 73–76. Caledon returned to the Baltic, again as Cowan's flagship, in April 1919, but was relieved by in May.Bennett 2002, pp. 87–88, 109. Caledon returned again in July.Bennett 2002, pp. 43–44. The ship spent the early part of the Second World War with the Home Fleet, where she escorted convoys and was involved in the pursuit of the German battleships and after the sinking of . She was reassigned to the Eastern Fleet between August 1940 and September 1942. Caledon then rejoined the Home Fleet. Upon her arrival in the UK, she underwent conversion into an anti-aircraft cruiser at Chatham Dockyard between 14 September 1942 and 7 December 1943, replacing the entire armament with modern AA weaponry. Obsolete by the end of the war, she was disarmed in April 1945, and subsequently sold for scrap on 22 January 1948.

In other words, core charge is an expression of the attractive force experienced by the valence electrons to the core of an atom which takes into account the shielding effect of core electrons. Core charge can be calculated by taking the number of protons in the nucleus minus the number of core electrons, also called inner shell electrons, and is always a positive value in neutral atoms. Core charge is a convenient way of explaining trends in the periodic table. Since the core charge increases as you move across a row of the periodic table, the outer-shell electrons are pulled more and more strongly towards the nucleus and the atomic radius decreases. This can be used to explain a number of periodic trends such as atomic radius, first ionization energy (IE), electronegativity, and oxidizing. Core charge can also be calculated as 'atomic number' minus 'all electrons except those in the outer shell'. For example, chlorine (element 17), with electron configuration 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p5, has 17 protons and 10 inner shell electrons (2 in the first shell, and 8 in the second) so: :Core charge = 17 − 10 = +7 A core charge is the net charge of a nucleus, considering the completed shells of electrons to act as a 'shield.' As a core charge increases, the valence electrons are more strongly attracted to the nucleus, and the atomic radius decreases across the period.
