Early and family life Born in Washington, D.C.to Clifton A. Woodrum Jr. and his wife the former Margaret Troy Lanier, Woodrum lost his lawyer father on Christmas, 1959, but nonetheless graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1961. Continuing the family tradition, he received his law degree from University of Virginia Law School in 1964. His great-grandfather was Roanoke's first elected Commonwealth's attorney. His grandfather Clifton A. Woodrum served in the United States House of Representatives. Chip Woodrum married Emily Clyde Abbitt (daughter of Meredith Webb Abbitt and Catherine Clyde Moore) on August 10, 1963 in Newport News, Virginia. Career As had three previous generations of his family, Woodrum practiced law in Roanoke, Virginia. He was also active in various bar associations, the Roanoke Chamber of Commerce and the United Way. Woodrum also served on the board of directors of the Legal Aid Society of Roanoke from 1967 until 1976 and had also served as the organization's vice-president. His political career began in the Roanoke City Young Democrat Club in 1960, as the city bucked Massive Resistance advocated by the Byrd Organization. First elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1979, Woodrum served (part-time) from 1980 until 2003.Votersmart.org-Clifton Alexander Woodrum He served on the State Crime Commission beginning in 1982 and became its chair. He also served on the State Water Commission beginning in 1981. In the General Assembly, Delegate Woodrum served on the Courts of Justice committee and the Appropriations and Corporations, Banking and Insurance committees, among others. He modernized Virginia's Freedom of Information Act in the 1990s, and also helped construct programs to rehabilitate offenders, as well as to enable low income Virginians to attend college.Roanoke bar memorial resolution available at http://www.roanokebar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Woodrum- Clifton-A.-III.pdf Woodrum initially served alongside fellow Democrat Vic Thomas. In 1979 they handily defeated Republicans Elizabeth T. Bowles and Mary Brooks, and in 1981 they significantly defeated Independent Zaman K. McManaway.http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/candidates/search/name:woodrum His district, which comprised parts of the City of Roanoke as well as the County of Roanoke, was initially numbered the 7th Virginia district, but briefly became the 6th district in 1982 (comprising only the City of Roanoke). Further redistricting required by a judicial decision mandating single member districts again combined parts of the city and county, and renumbered it as the 16th district from 1983 until 2001. He often faced no opponent when re- elected, but soundly defeated Republican Newell R. Falkinburg in 1995 and Independent A.R. Sadjadi in 1999. After the Republican party took control of the House of Delegates in 2000, he lost his seat on the Appropriations committee and was redistricted into the same district as his ally, former majority leader Richard Cranwell (who retired, so Woodrum faced no challenger in the primary nor general election). During his last term, until Woodrum declined to seek re-election, the district was numbered the 11th.http://dela.state.va.us/dela/Membios.nsf/HSearch/?SearchView&Query;=woodrum&SearchMax;=&SearchOrder;=4 After winning a primary contest against B.M.

There is some mystery surrounding the group, their makeup and their members. Their music has been described as adventurous, mysterious and intriguing. They cite Grace Jones, Elvis Presley and David Bowie as their main musical influences. The group's front man ‚ÄòLiam Willoughby‚Äô cited the reasons for this ambiguousness as responding to the over availability of information explaining that \\"There‚Äôs no generic bio saying ‚Äòwe grew up here ‚Äò or ‚Äòwe went to that school there‚Äô, its purely art. Like us or hate us, people's opinions of us are based on the music and that's the way it should be!\\" Lee‚ÄôMon first appeared on triple J ‚Äôs Home & Hosed program In October of 2011, with a song called ‚ÄòOne Man in the Woods.‚Äô, which received national recognition. The song had been described as \\"fluid & sophisticated\\" but it was most notable for its unique sound, being described as \\"a really interesting song mixing a lot of different instruments together.\\" in 2012 Lee‚ÄôMon received an honourable mention in the international \\"Unsigned Only\\" songwriting competition alongside Melbourne's Skipping Girl Vinegar & Ballarat's Hunting Grounds, they were also a semi-finalist in the International Songwriting Competition. In that same year Lee‚ÄôMon began working on their first record with prominent Melbourne based producer Paul ‚ÄòWoody‚Äô Annison (Children Collide, Hunting Grounds). By mid-2012 Lee‚ÄôMon had released their first single ‚ÄòAlbury‚Äô through Melbourne indie Label ‚Äòredcatsounds‚Äô (The Living End, Hunting Grounds, Young Revelry & Daniel Lee Kendall.) and MGM Distribution. The song described as \\"Moody\\" was accompanied by a rather sinister video which received wide attention and featured in several film festivals around the world including the ITSA Film Festival in California, the BBC Music Video Festival in the UK, the Blue Mountains Film Festival in Sydney and in 2013 was a finalist in the music video category of the International Songwriting Competition. In November 2013 ‚ÄòAlbury‚Äô ran 3rd in the Australian Independent Music Awards, Video category. It was also broadcast on National Television in Australia including the ABC TV program Rage. The video did not feature any of the band members which further increased the mystery surrounding the group. The song received national and international airplay, but the single was most noted for Liam's strong Australian accent which divided many opinions. In March 2013 Lee'Mon released the second single \\"Genetics\\". The song was described as \\"great songwriting and extremely catchy\\". It was also described as \\"something different to what is being thrown up by most musicians at the moment\\". Genetics received airplay from various Radio Stations and was debuted nationally in Australia by Richard Kingsmill on triple J in March 2013. The accompanying video clip for \\"Genetics\\" was premiered by Groupie Magazine. and made its national television debut in Australia on the ABC's Rage program. In May 2013, Lee‚ÄôMon released the 3rd official single \\"Albert Adam & Eve\\" a song inspired by Albert II, the first monkey in Space. The song was described as \\"something cool with layers of spacey, harmony-heavy pop showing off Lee'Mon's knack for quirky and inventive songwriting.\\" and \\"The lyrics are off the wall, but they‚Äôre anchored beautifully by strings and bells and a dirtied-up Rhodes piano.

Biography The band is from Saint-Joseph, a village from Dominica. The lead singer Jefferson \\"Jeff\\" Joseph and keyboard player McDonald \\"Markie\\" Prosper along with the other members were former students of the Dominica Grammar School and St Mary's Academy, hence the name Gramacks. The band rose to fame in the early seventies and eighties with hits like ‚ÄúMis Debaz‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSoukouyant‚Äù. Gramacks and Exile One were influential figures in the promotion of cadence-lypso in the 1970s. They were an inspiration for the French Antilles band Kassav and the emergence of zouk in the 1980s. The full-horn section kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson, and Gramacks (led by Jeff Joseph) introduced the newly arrived synthesizers to their music that other young cadence or compas bands from Haiti (mini-jazz) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s. Gramacks rose to prominence in the 1970s to the early 1980s with a Super Bowl performance. They headlined the first World Creole Music Festival in Dominica in 1997. Creative differences and financial mismanagement caused the band to break up with members pursuing individual solo projects. Jeff Joseph later formed Volt Face and Gramacks New Generation. Jefferson \\"Jeff Joe\\" Joseph Jeff Joseph \\"Jeff Joe\\" of Saint Joseph, Dominica was the leader and founder of Dominica's cadence musical group \\"Gramacks\\". His musical career with Gramacks began in the early 1970s in Guadeloupe. The late Joseph will be remembered for his energetic performances of songs such as ‚ÄòSoucouyant‚Äô, ‚ÄòSoleil Trop Chaud‚Äô, and ‚ÄòWoy Mi Debas‚Äô. Many of his recordings were done in the Debs Studio in Martinique. Joseph is known for adding various Caribbean styles to his musical identity such as reggae, calypso and mostly cadence or compas music. Joseph was lead member Gramacks New Generation and a founding member of the Antillean group Volt Face along with Georges Decimus; one of the founders of Kassav in the 1980s. Joseph was one of Dominica‚Äôs goodwill ambassadors and he played a part in the promotion and marketing of the World Creole Music Festival. At the 13th World Creole Music Festival in Dominica, compas musician \\"Sweet Mickey\\" (who would serve as Haiti's president between 2011 and 2016) gave tribute and recognition to Joseph on a Dominica source video interview for his influence on his music. At the 15th Annual WCMF, he was honored by Dominica's bouyon music band \\"Triple Kay International\\" during their performance for his influence on the band.

His herbarium collections number more than 13,500 specimens, each with three to four duplicates on average. Huber worked closely with Julian A. Steyermark, one of his early mentors. Early life and education Born in Germany, Huber grew up and studied in Merano, Italy, and graduated from the State University of Rome in the fields of Botany and Ecology (1971). While in Rome in 1966 he was given an offer to travel to Venezuela for a year to carry out field work in the newly created Estaci√≥n Biol√≥gica de los Llanos in Calabozo (Gu√°rico state). Here he met Prof. Volkmar Vareschi and Dr. Julian Steyermark and they became his main mentors, influential in his decision to focus on the field of botany. He then studied for a PhD in botany at the State University of Innsbruck (Austria) during which he undertook fieldwork in Venezuela, in the cloud forests at Rancho Grande in Aragua State. Research Huber's fields of scientific interest include the flora and phytogeography of the neotropics and the vegetation of Venezuela's non-forest biomes but he has also taken part in systematic research in the Humiriaceae family with Jos√© Cuatrecasas. Between 1972 and 1982 Huber took part in, organised and led over 80 multidisciplinary expeditions in Venezuela and Brazil. From its beginning in 1977 he has maintained an intimate link with the Ministry of Environment of Venezuela (MARNR) and has been leader of two of their research projects to study the tepui ecosystem. He has always concentrated on non-forest ecosystems (shrublands, herbaceous ecosystems and rock pioneers) and the species he has collected reflect this interest; he has amassed a collection of over 13,500 specimens with an average of three to four duplicates each. Huber is involved in conservation in the realm of protected area designation, in both their scientific justification and physical delimitation; his work has resulted in the designation of the largest neotropical biosphere reserve (Alto Orinoco- Casiquiare 1991), also the Canaima World Heritage Site and the Tepuis Natural Monument. From 1986-2003 he completed many cartographic projects, creating several maps of the vegetation of southern Venezuela and Guayana and two for the whole of South America. One important project for Huber is the data-basing of concepts and definitions to aid the classification of vegetation in tropical and subtropical America. Since 2004 he has worked for the UNESCO sponsored project 'CoroLab Humboldt', creating the database 'Fitored' with over 10,000 titles on phytogeography and plant ecology. Between 1999 and 2001 Huber worked as a professor of botany and phytogeography at the Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in Caracas, tutoring several theses; he has always tried to transmit his knowledge into the scientific community and in 1990 established a peer reviewed monographic series Scientia Guaian√¶, to stimulate young scientists working between the Amazon and Orinoco rivers. He himself has created over 120 publications. In 2002 he was appointed scientific coordinator of the International Workshop on Biological Priority Setting for Conservation of the Guiana Shield (Conservation International and IUCN). From 2005 Huber has been scientific advisor to the president of the Fundaci√≥n Instituto Bot√°nico de Venezuela, in Caracas.

Background The establishment of military bases abroad enables a country to project power, e.g. to conduct expeditionary warfare, and thereby influence events abroad. Depending on their size and infrastructure, they can be used as staging areas or for logistical, communications and intelligence support. Many conflicts throughout modern history have resulted in overseas military bases being established in large numbers by world powers and the existence of bases abroad has served countries having them in achieving political and military goals. The British Empire and other colonial powers established overseas military bases in many of their colonies during the First and Second World Wars, where useful, and actively sought rights to facilities where needed for strategic reasons. At one time, establishing coaling stations for naval ships was important. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union established military bases where they could within their respective spheres of influence, and actively sought influence where needed. More recently, the War on Terror has resulted in overseas military bases being established in the Middle East. Whilst the overall number of overseas military bases has fallen since 1945, the United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Russia and France still possess or utilize a substantial number. Smaller numbers of overseas military bases are operated by India, Iran, Italy, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. The United States is the largest operator of military bases abroad, with 38 \\"named bases\\"What are here termed \\"named bases\\" are the bases listed in section X: \\"Personnel Data from DMDC\\", i.e. excluding that table's rows labelled \\"Other\\", in the 2015 DoD Base Structure Report. having active duty, national guard, reserve or civilian personnel as of September 30, 2014. Its largest, in terms of personnel, was Ramstein AB in Germany, with almost 9,200 personnel.The 2015 U.S. Base Structure Report gives 587 overseas sites, but sites are merely real property at a distinct geographical location, and multiple sites may belong to one installation (page DoD-3). For example, the Garmisch, Germany \\"named base\\" with its 72 personnel has eight distinct sites large enough to be listed in the Army's Individual Service Inventory list: Artillery Kaserne, Breitenau Skeet Range, Garmisch Family Housing, Garmish Golf Course, General Abrams Hotel And Disp, Hausberg Ski Area, Oberammergau NATO School, and Sheridan Barracks (listed in Army-15 to Army-17). These range in size from Ramstein AB with 9,188 active, guard/reserve, and civilian personnel down to Worms, which has just one civilian.

Under legislation authorizing the conclusion of treaties of peace the Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920 was issued to create the Office,P.C. 755 (April 14, 1920) under the authority of the Secretary of State as sold custodian. The Office acted as one of the \\"clearing offices\\" authorized under Article 296 of the Treaty of Versailles for the collection and payment of enemy debts, and Article 297 authorized Canada to keep and liquidate any German property in Canada. Investigations and recommendations respecting claims for reparations were undertaken by the separately appointed Royal Commission on Reparations, chaired by Errol McDougall. =1939-1985= With the outbreak of the Second World War, the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939 expanded the scope of the Office. From 1942 the role of the Custodian was expanded to include the administration of property seized from Japanese Canadians. In the postwar period, the Custodian had the responsibility for resolving Canadian War Claims, and the resolution of outstanding wartime property issues. This latter process was complicated by the implications of the large scale nationalization of property in Eastern Europe by the Communist regimes established in the post war period under Soviet auspices. The WWII regulations were continued on a temporary basis following the end of hostilities, and were continued in 1947 by the Trading with the Enemy (Transitional Powers) Act. The Act ceased to have effect at the end of September 1992, and was consequently repealed in 1996. The Office ceased operations in 1985. Its files were transferred to Library and Archives Canada, but there is evidence that some have been destroyed without assessing their historical value. The Office never produced annual reports outlining its activities.

Introduced in the 1950s, it ran through to Geneva (Cornavin station) until 1969, when it was cut back to Zurich. The train was named on the basis that Bavaria is the Latin equivalent to the German word Bayern, the official name of the federal state of Bavaria, of which Munich is the capital. It was operated by the Deutsche Bundesbahn / Deutsche Bahn (DB) and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS). The route also included a single stop in Austria, at Bregenz. The section between Lindau, Germany, and St. Margrethen, Switzerland, is located mostly in Austria, but Swiss locomotives hauled the train over this section, most of which is part of the Vorarlberg line of Austrian Federal Railways. Originally and for several years, the Bavaria was a two-class Schnellzug (D), running Munich ‚Äì Zurich ‚Äì Bern ‚Äì Geneva.

The game is a fantasy adventure in which the player controls a champion who must battle evil forces to conquer four kingdoms, uniting the four kings' crowns and presenting them to the Watcher in order to restore the world to peace. Gameplay The Atari ST version of Battle Master (captured from the Steem emulator) Battle Master is a squad-based action-adventure game viewed from a top-down isometric perspective. After choosing a race - human, elf, dwarf or orc - and a Dungeons & Dragons-style class - warrior, merchant, archer or mage - the player is presented with a map, from which destinations are chosen. At each destination the player may choose to parley - giving an opportunity to purchase useful items from the destination, rather than having to find them - or may enter the destination. At this point the player enters the area and must defeat a minimum of 75% of the hostile forces present in order to proceed. Combat is either close-quarters m√™l√©e, using such weapons as swords and clubs, or ranged, using arrows or magic. In addition to the main player character it is possible to recruit up to four followers, who may be given rudimentary formations (row, column, wedge), positions (front, rear) and basic commands (rally). Defeating enemies and proceeding on from an area is the only way to unlock further destinations on the map. Difficulty increases as the player progresses to new areas; to cope with this players may either find or buy (using looted gold) improved equipment such as armour and weaponry. Story Following an age of conflict between the races of men, elves, dwarves and orcs that destroyed towns and cities and left the land decimated and impoverished, the mysterious Watcher came and settled in the Tower. The Watcher withdrew the power of magic, leaving remnants of magic only in artifacts created before his arrival, and cast a spell of apathy on the four kings. Then he spoke a prophecy: \\"Where there is chaos there will be order; where discord, harmony will flourish. From the south will come a hero to conquer the land and unite the crowns. Where there were fragments, there will be a whole. then will a new age begin.\\" Reception Critical reception of Battle Master was mixed, with scores ranging from 58% (Zzap!64) to 83% (Amiga Format) for the Atari ST and Amiga formats of the game. Whilst Amiga Format praised its graphics, \\"clever design\\" and \\"instant and lasting appeal\\", Zzap!64 criticised it for having \\"too little depth\\" and \\"too little tactical meat\\", and although ST Format also criticised the graphics it considered its action to be \\"heart-racing\\" and its strategy \\"innovative\\".

In June 2015, MegaBots challenged Suidobashi Heavy Industry to its first robot duel confronting Kuratas versus their Mark II.A Team of Americans Is Building a Giant Robot to Challenge Japan In Hand to Hand Combat Developers The Kuratas robot was developed by artist Kogoro Kurata (after whom the suit is named), and roboticist Wataru Yoshizaki. Kurata stated that he was inspired by the mecha frequently featured in anime, especially those of the series Armored Trooper Votoms, which he watched as a child. \\"When I was a kid, I thought there were going to be giant robots in the future. But no matter how long I waited, people were only able to make small robots, like ASIMO.

Yoshizaki was brought onboard the project to create the software for the robot's movement and pilot interaction. Mechanics The vehicle weighs approximately 4,500 kg, and is approximately 4 meters high. It can be crewed by one person; that operator would sit in the \\"body\\" of the robot in a seat, with the control device in front of them. The Kuratas can also be controlled externally by remote control. Kuratas sports a four-wheeled, thirty joint exoskeleton. which is controlled by the pilot or can be controlled remotely. The remote operator uses a 3g touch screen phone as the primary interface. The on-board pilot's user interface (UI) is a Kinect based device. The vehicle can be \\"armed\\" with multiple weapons, such as a 6,000 round per minute twin BB rotary cannon, a \\"LOHAS\\" launcher which fires either water bottles or possibly fireworks, and a powered humanoid hand called the \\"iron crow\\" that is capable of picking up objects, and is linked to the pilot by \\"what appears to be a Mattel Power Glove\\". The main Suidobashi website lists two other \\"weapons\\", a \\"Kuratas Handgun\\", and a \\"Pilebunker\\". Currently, the Kuratas is not capable of walking, but is able to drive forward and backwards on its four wheels at around 10 km/h. It cannot turn without external assistance. , Kuratas has a price of US$1,353,500 (¬•134,555,495, or ‚Ç¨1,040,976).

Premise A 16-year-old working behind the candy counter of a movie theater dreams of someday being in show business. Cast *Bruce Norris as Scott Creasman, the \\"Popcorn Kid\\" of the series' title and, of course, the protagonist. A well-meaning yet trouble-prone sixteen-year-old high school student living in Kansas City, he is also an avid film enthusiast with dreams of making it big in movies. So far though, the closest he has come to achieving that dream is working as an usher and manning the candy counter at the Majestic Theatre, a local movie theatre that has seen better days. *Raye Birk as Mr. Leonard Brown, the balding, disgruntled manager of the Majestic Theatre. Although Scott is often skating on thin ice where he is concerned, Mr. Brown never carries out his frequent threats to fire him, probably because Scott has helped him to save some face on more than one occasion. When he is not at the ticket booth or shut up in his office going over the books, he is coming up with schemes to make more money for the theatre and impress the owner Mr. Tuttle, which usually prove ineffective. He is normally very conservative, but has been known to go berserk when things go really wrong. His one soft spot seems to be his wife Lorraine, whom he wants to please almost as badly as he wants to please Mr. Tuttle. *Jeffrey Joseph as Willie Dawson, a football star at the same high school Scott attends, and the only other male usher at the Majestic. He views his potential career in football primarily as a means of attracting girls. Often he shows up late to work because of football practice, but invariably avoids getting caught by Mr. Brown. *Penelope Ann Miller as Gwen Stottlemeyer, another student from the same high school as the other ushers at the Majestic Theatre. Although she sometimes comes across as snarky, she is a loyal friend to Scott, on whom she has a secret crush, and also has been known to offer help or advice to other people, even Mr. Brown. She frequently gets exasperated with her fellow usherette Lynn Holly over the fact that while Gwen is rarely recognized for the hard work she does, Lynn Holly effortlessly skates by on good looks and her parents' wealth. *John Christopher Jones as Marlin Bond, the projectionist at the theatre. Although Marlin is older and a bit of an oddball, Scott shares a bond with him over their mutual love of movies, and often hangs out with him in the projection booth despite the fact he is not supposed to be there. Marlin lives in a perennial cloudland in and out of his booth, quoting and acting out scenes from old movies, but he occasionally drops some good advice amidst his ramblings. *Faith Ford as Lynn Holly Brickhouse, a spoiled, ditzy blonde cheerleader at the same high school her co-workers at the Majestic go to. She is the newest member of the staff, and got the job through her wealthy parents' influence. Scott has a hopeless crush on her, but despite the fact that he sits behind her at school, she barely knows he's alive. She is often either sitting on the candy counter chatting with her friends on her cell phone or preening herself in front of the mirror in the staff washroom, much to the annoyance of the other ushers.

Note: Since the production of the map, the Hughes School District merged into the West Memphis school district in 2015 Note: Since the production of the map, the Hughes School District merged into the West Memphis school district in 2015 History Prior to desegregation circa 1970, white and black children attended separate schools. Sheryl Owens became superintendent in 2013. She was the final person to hold the position of superintendent and the first African American woman in the Hughes district to do so. =Enrollment decline and closure= According to Owens, circa 1996 enrollments declined gradually, and then around 2006 became severe. Owens stated that prospective teachers were wary of going to work for a district that could be forcefully consolidated in the future, and so the district had issues with recruitment. Under Arkansas law Act 60, the state can forcefully merge a school district which has fewer than 350 total students for a consecutive period of two years with another school district. The Hughes district had, in the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years, 348 students and 344 students, making it eligible to be merged. As the state determined that the district had financial problems, it was not eligible to apply for a waiver to stay open under House Bill 1263. In the 2014‚Äì2015 school year the Hughes district created a petition asking for a consolidation with the Forrest City School District, one which the district community anticipated would allow Hughes to keep an elementary school. However the Forrest City district stopped supporting the petition. The reason cited was that the Forrest City district was afraid of lawsuits surrounding the Hughes district. On April 9, 2015, the Arkansas Board of Education voted to consolidate the Hughes district with the West Memphis School District. =Post-closure= The West Memphis district took possession of the buildings, then gave them to the Hughes municipal government in 2016. Denisa R. Superville of Education Week stated that \\"The squat, brick buildings that were part of the Hughes district are in various stages of disrepair.\\" The high school gymnasium was leased at no cost to the police chief, who made it into an after school center. Former Hughes board member Lincoln Barnett stated that several area businesses, as a result of the district closure, encountered financial problems. Hughes School District, in its existence, employed the largest number of people in Hughes.  Demographics  In the 2014-2015 school year the district had 318 students. There were students in the area who instead attended other Arkansas school districts or private schools, with many white students in private school. The percentage of Hughes school district students allowed to have free or reduced lunches, a sign of poverty, was 94%.  Academic performance  In 2014 the percentage of students passing benchmarks in state examinations in math and English reading was 45.8%. In the 2014-2015 year the state ranked the school district as \\"needs improvement\\", the second lowest rating.  Schools  The schools' mascot and athletic emblem was the Blue Devil with royal blue and white as the school colors. * Mildred Jackson Elementary School, served prekindergarten through grade 6. ** In the Jim Crow period it served as the school for black children.

Brown was a defensive lineman from Sacramento, California and was found beaten and unresponsive on a street in nearby McPherson, Kansas early Sunday morning, September 16, 2012. He later died from his injuries at a Wichita hospital on September 22. Brown transferred to Tabor from a community college in California as a redshirt Junior for the team. Aftermath On October 4, 2012, the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference and presidents of McPherson and Tabor agreed to cancel their game scheduled for October 20, 2012. The game was cancelled in light of the ongoing investigation into the murder of Tabor football player Brandon Brown. Two former players from the nearby McPherson College Bulldogs football team have been charged with the murder: Alton Franklin and Dequinte Oshea Flournoy. Both were on the football roster at McPherson for the previous year, and Franklin was listed as a sophomore linebacker at the beginning of the 2012 season. He was dismissed from the team before the incident and Flournoy was also no longer a member of the team. Michael Schneider, President of McPherson College said that McPherson and Tabor colleges do not have a rivalry that would account for what happened. The murder garnered nationwide coverage, including ESPN, Sports Illustrated, The Huffington Post, USA Today, and Fox Sports. The Church of the Brethren also carried information to its church and schools nationwide. Both colleges were founded by the Church of the Brethren. Preliminary hearing Investigation of the crime was handled in cooperation by the McPherson Police Department, the McPherson County Sheriff's Office, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. After a preliminary hearing on January 31, 2013, the suspects Franklin and Flournoy were bound over for trial on charges of being accessories to second- degree murder. The McPherson County Medical Examiner testified that Brown's blood alcohol level was .30, well above the legal limit in the state of Kansas. Attorneys for the defense argued that their actions were self-defense, saying \\"The defendants were using force to try to remove them from the premises.\\" David Harger, Franklin's attorney continued, \\"Those people were armed. They then, as we know from police, stabbed the door with a knife.\\" Both Franklin and Flournoy entered a plea of not guilty.  Trial  On Tuesday April 2, 2013 DeQuinte Flournoy, 20, entered a plea of no contest to a lesser charge of aggravated battery. This allowed him to avoid a trial and he is expected to testify against his co-defendant Alton Franklin at his trial in the following week. On June 4, 2013, he received a sentence of 2 years probation. Alton Franklin faced trial on charges of murder and manslaughter. Two witnesses, testified they saw Franklin hit Brown. While Flournoy testified that he did hit Brown for safety reasons he did not see anybody else hit Brown. The defense argued that there was no evidence that Franklin had struck anyone. The jury found Franklin not guilty and he was released from jail.

The siege lasted just three days, and the sultan was victorious. The Muslims thus regained a major city which had been in Castilian hands since Alfonso XI of Castile took it from the Moroccans after the long 1342-1344 siege. Ten years after the capture of the city, in 1379 the sultan of Granada decided to completely destroy the city to prevent it falling into Christian hands. It was impossible to defend the place at a time when the Muslim kings of the Iberian Peninsula had lost much of military power they enjoyed in earlier centuries. Background Granada - Territory gained by Castile or Portugal between 1292 and 1462 Region around Al-Hadra Al-Yazirat. North is to the right of this map. The city of Al-Hadra Al-Yazirat was the first city founded by the Muslims under Tariq ibn Ziyad in the Iberian Peninsula on the ruins of the Roman city of Iulia Traducta. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it had been held by the rulers of Granada and of Morocco. In was conquered by Alfonso XI of Castile in the Siege of Algeciras (1342‚Äì1344). Castilian control of the city of Algeciras was important in giving control of the Strait of Gibraltar to the Christian kingdoms. However, the death of Alfonso XI during the siege of Gibraltar in 1350 resulted in a civil war between the two successors to the throne of Castile, Peter and Henry II of Castile. Muhammed V of Granada had embarked on a policy of friendship with Castile, supporting Peter as the legitimate heir to the throne. Relations with Aragon however were not as friendly, and the Aragonese supported the proclamation of Muhammed VI as ruler of Granada between 1359 and 1362. The return of Muhammed V in 1362 and his support of Peter caused closer relations between Aragon and Henry. The end of the Spanish civil war after Peter died in 1369 convinced the Granadans of the need to secure their borders with Castile and regain control of the Strait of Gibraltar. The Moorish king now engaged with the king of Portugal, Fernando I, against Henry, who he felt was the usurper of the throne of Castile. Muhammed V would attack Algeciras while the Portuguese would attack various sites in Galicia.  Siege  On 28 July 1369 Muhammed V appeared with a large army at the gates of the city of Algeciras. The siege was established by erecting siege towers and deploying his soldiers around the perimeter of the city. Algeciras at this time consisted of two separate towns separated by the R√≠o de la Miel. Each town had its own walls with strong towers and gateways. After the previous siege many of the city walls had been destroyed or severely weakened, so the Spaniards had to strengthen various sections. The rushed rebuilding left much to be desired compared to the original fabric of the thirteenth century Moorish defenses. Thus the main gate of the city, the Puerta del Fonsario, which had suffered most of the attacks by trebuchets during the siege of Alfonso XI, was rebuilt in part with a weak wall of mortar. The combination of decreased physical defenses and a small garrison for the town after movement of troops to the north caused the Muslim siege to be devastating for the city. The attacks focused at first on the Villa Nueva, the southern of the two towns. The soldiers of Muhammed V mounted numerous siege engines, used high ladders to scale the walls and assaulted the city. There were few defenders within the town and Villa Nueva, called al-Binya by the Moors, fell on 30 July. All its inhabitants were slaughtered. Capitulation The terror caused by the fall of the southern town and the conviction that no reinforcements would arrive from Castile forced the decision to deliver the besieged city before suffering more casualties. The mayor of the Villa Vieja, Alonso Fern√°ndez Portocarrero, third Lord of Moguer, asked the king of Granada to grant safe conduct to the inhabitants to leave the city with their most valuable possessions. After just three days of siege in which the Nazarites siege weapons were used more as a threat than a real attempt to open a breach, the Spanish defenders of Algeciras surrendered their weapons. On 31 July Muhammed V's troops entered the Villa Vieja of the city, letting its occupants leave with the belongings they could carry. The Cathedral of Algeciras, the former Mosque, was returned to Islamic worship, and the king of Granada occupied the ancient fortress located in the Cerro de Matagorda. The impact on morale of the people of Granada of the reconquest of Al-Hadra Al-Yazirat is evidenced in the many chronicles made in Granada praising the king's military operation. Nasrid control Ruins of Algeciras in an 18th-century illustration. After the capture of the city, Muhammed V rebuilt the defenses and installed a garrison. For ten years the city remained in the hands of Granada, but without achieving the importance it had in the past. The Kingdom of Granada was no longer an important military or economic power in the peninsula, so the main value of Algeciras as a port for entry of North African troops and trade was diminished. No notable events happened in connection with the city, which almost disappeared from written sources. In 1379 Henry II of Castile died and was succeeded by his son Juan I. The Christian kingdoms prepared for a new phase of the reconquest. In these circumstances, the Moorish kingdom considered consolidating its border with Castille. In the Bay of Algeciras there were two port cities, Algeciras and Gibraltar. Despite the strength of Algeciras, Gibraltar was easier to defend because of the natural defenses. Algeciras on the other hand had more than of walls, needing many more soldiers for defense. Destruction of the city The choice was clear. The city of Al- Yazirat had to be abandoned so Granada could concentrate future defensive efforts on nearby Gibraltar. Abandonment of the city should be accompanied by the destruction of its fortifications to make them unusable if it were reoccupied by Castile. Walls were dismantled, the port was blocked and the main buildings of Algeciras destroyed, including the palace and the fortress. The houses of the city were burned. The city remained in ruins until 1704, when the capture of Gibraltar by the British forced the original population of that city to take refuge in the ruins of the old Algeciras.

He took German citizenship in 1940. Joyce was convicted of one count of high treason in 1945 and sentenced to death, with the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords both upholding his conviction. He was hanged on 3 January 1946, making him the last person to be executed for treason in the United Kingdom. Theodore Schurch was hanged the following day, but for the crime of treachery rather than treason. Early life William Brooke Joyce was born on Herkimer Street in Brooklyn, New York, United States. His father was Michael Francis Joyce ( ‚Äì ), an Irish Catholic from a family of farmers in Ballinrobe, County Mayo, who had taken United States citizenship on 25 October 1894. His mother was Gertrude Emily Brooke, who although born in Shaw and Crompton, Lancashire, England, was from a well-off Anglican Anglo-Irish family of medical practitioners associated with County Roscommon. A few years after William's birth, the family returned to Salthill, Galway, Ireland permanently. Joyce attended Col√°iste Iogn√°id, a Jesuit school in Galway (from 1915 to 1921). Joyce's mother was strongly Anglocentric, devoutly Protestant, Unionist and hostile to Irish nationalism. There were tensions with her father for marrying a Roman Catholic. Joyce's father bought up houses and rented some to the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). During the Irish War for Independence Joyce was recruited by Capt. Patrick William Keating as a courier for British Army intelligence in Galway, then fighting against the Irish Republican Army (IRA). He was known to have hung around with Black and Tans at Lenaboy Castle, which reportedly resulted in the Irish Republican Army dispatching a volunteer, Michael Molloy, to murder Joyce on his way home from school in December 1921, although minors were normally not executed by the IRA, but expelled or ostracised. Joyce reputedly survived only because his father had moved his family to another house on a different route. Capt. Keating arranged for William Joyce to be mustered into the Worcester Regiment soon after, taking him out of the dangerous situation in Ireland to Norton Barracks. A few months later he was discharged when it was found out he was under age.A. N. Wilson, \\"After the Victorians\\", Hutchinson, London, 2005, p. 421. Joyce remained in England and briefly attended King's College School, Wimbledon, on a foreign exchange. His family followed him to England two years later. Joyce had relatives in Birkenhead, Cheshire, whom he visited on a few occasions. He then applied to Birkbeck College of the University of London, where he entered the Officer Training Corps. At Birkbeck, he obtained a first-class honours degree in English.A. N. Wilson, After the Victorians, Hutchinson, London, 2005.Holmes, Colin (2016). Searching for Lord Haw-Haw: The Political Lives of William Joyce. Routledge. p. 28. After graduating, he applied for a job in the Foreign Office, but was rejected and took a job as a teacher.Holmes, Colin (2016). Searching for Lord Haw-Haw: The Political Lives of William Joyce. Routledge. p. 31-32. He also developed an interest in Fascism, and worked with, but never joined, the British Fascists of Rotha Lintorn-Orman. On 22 October 1924, while stewarding a meeting in support of Jack Lazarus (the Conservative Party candidate for Lambeth North in the general election), Joyce was attacked by communists and received a deep razor slash that ran across his right cheek. It left a permanent scar which ran from the earlobe to the corner of the mouth. While Joyce often said that his attackers were Jewish, biographer Colin Holmes claims that Joyce's first wife told him in 1992 that \\"it wasn't a Jewish Communist who disfigured him .... He was knifed by an Irish woman\\". British Union of Fascists Flag of the British Union of Fascists In 1932 Joyce joined the British Union of Fascists (BUF) under Sir Oswald Mosley, and swiftly became a leading speaker, praised for his power of oratory. The journalist and novelist Cecil Roberts described a speech given by Joyce: In 1934 Joyce was promoted to the BUF's Director of Propaganda, replacing Wilfred Risdon (who had expressed concern to Mosley about the use of the spotlights at the Olympia rally in June) and later appointed deputy leader. As well as being a gifted speaker, Joyce gained the reputation of a savage brawler. His violent rhetoric and willingness to physically confront anti-fascist elements head-on played no small part in further marginalising the BUF. After the bloody debacle of Olympia, Joyce spearheaded the BUF's policy shift from campaigning for economic revival through corporatism to a focus on antisemitism. He was instrumental in changing the name of the BUF to \\"British Union of Fascists and National Socialists\\" in 1936 and stood as a party candidate in the 1937 elections to the London County Council. In 1936 Joyce lived for a year in Whitstable, where he owned a radio and electrical shop. Between April 1934 and 1937, when Mosley sacked him, Joyce also served as Area Administrative Officer for the BUF West Sussex division. Joyce was supported in this role by Norah Elam as Sussex Women's Organiser, with her partner Dudley Elam taking on the role of Sub-Branch Officer for Worthing. Under this regime, West Sussex was to become a hub of fascist activity, ranging from hosting Blackshirt summer camps to organising meetings and rallies, lunches, etc. Norah Elam shared many speaking platforms with Joyce and worked on propaganda speeches for him. One particular concern for Joyce was the Government of India Bill (passed in 1935), designed to give a measure of autonomy to India, allowing freedom and the development of limited self-government. Joyce harboured a desire to become Viceroy of India should Mosley ever head a BUF government, and is recorded as describing the backers of the bill as \\"feeble\\" and \\"one loathsome, fetid, purulent, tumid mass of hypocrisy, hiding behind Jewish Dictators\\". Joyce was sacked from his paid position when Mosley drastically reduced the BUF staff shortly after the 1937 elections, after which Joyce promptly formed a breakaway organisation, the National Socialist League. After the departure of Joyce, the BUF turned its focus away from anti-Semitism and towards activism, opposing a war with Nazi Germany. Although Joyce had been deputy leader of the party from 1933 and an effective fighter and orator, Mosley snubbed him in his autobiography and later denounced him as a traitor because of his wartime activities. Unlike Joyce, the Elams did not escape detention under Defence Regulation 18B; both were arrested on the same day as Mosley in May 1940. The relationship between Joyce and Norah Elam was evidence of the strange bedfellows that politics can bring together. Elam's father had been an Irish nationalist, while Joyce had been a Unionist and supporter of the Black and Tans. In later life Elam reported that, although she disliked Joyce, she believed that his execution by the British in 1946 was wrong, stating that he should not have been regarded as a traitor to England because he was not English, but Irish. In Germany D√§mmerung √ºber England (Twilight over England), 3rd edition, Berlin 1942 In late August 1939, shortly before war was declared, Joyce and his wife Margaret fled to Germany. Joyce had been tipped off that the British authorities intended to detain him under Defence Regulation 18B. Joyce became a naturalised German citizen in 1940. In Berlin, Joyce could not find employment until a chance meeting with fellow Mosleyite Dorothy Eckersley got him an audition at the Rundfunkhaus (\\"broadcasting house\\").45/25728/244. CAB 98/18. Simpson 135-6. Thurlow, the 'Mosley Papers' and the Secret History of British Fascism 1939‚Äì1940, K/L, 175. Reporting statement from the Mail on 14.3.40. Eckersley was the former wife or second wife of the Chief Engineer of the British Broadcasting Corporation, Peter Eckersley. Despite having a heavy cold and almost losing his voice, he was recruited immediately for radio announcements and scriptwriting at German radio's English service. William Joyce replaced Wolf Mittler. The name \\"Lord Haw-Haw of Zeesen\\" was coined in 1939 by the pseudonymous Daily Express radio critic Jonah Barrington, but this referred initially to Wolf Mittler (or possibly Norman Baillie-Stewart). When Joyce became the best-known propaganda broadcaster, the nickname was transferred to him. Joyce's broadcasts initially came from studios in Berlin, later transferring (because of heavy Allied bombing) to Luxembourg and finally to Apen near Hamburg, and were relayed over a network of German-controlled radio stations that included Hamburg, Bremen, Luxembourg, Hilversum, Calais, Oslo, and Zeesen. Joyce also broadcast on and wrote scripts for the German B√ºro Concordia organisation, which ran several black propaganda stations, many of which pretended to broadcast illegally from within Britain. His role in writing the scripts increased over time, and the German radio capitalized on his public persona. Initially an anonymous broadcaster, Joyce eventually revealed his real name to his listeners; and he would occasionally be announced as \\"William Joyce, otherwise known as Lord Haw-Haw\\".Nazi Wireless Propaganda: Lord Haw-Haw and British Public Opinion in the Second World War, Edinburgh University Press, 2000, page 13. Urban legends soon circulated about Lord Haw-Haw, alleging that the broadcaster was well- informed about political and military events to the point of near- omniscience.David Suisman, Susan Strasser, Sound in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, pages 55‚Äì56. Listening to his broadcasts was officially discouraged, but it was not illegal, and many Britons listened. At the height of his influence, in 1940, Joyce had an estimated six million regular and 18 million occasional listeners in the United Kingdom.Axis Sally: The Americans Behind That Alluring Voice, HistoryNet, 23 November 2009. The broadcasts always began with the announcer's words, \\"Germany calling, Germany calling, Germany calling\\". These broadcasts urged the British people to surrender and were well known for their jeering, sarcastic and menacing tone. There was also a desire by civilian listeners to hear what the other side was saying, as information during wartime was strictly censored. The Reich Main Security Office commissioned Joyce to give lectures at the University of Berlin for SS members in the winter of 1941‚Äì42 on the topic of \\"English fascism and acute questions concerning the British world empire\\".University of T√ºbingen - Chronologie Schulung und Elitebildung im 3. Reich Schwerpunkt: SS Joyce recorded his final broadcast on 30 April 1945, during the Battle of Berlin. Rambling and audibly drunk,An excerpt from the broadcast can be heard in the episode on Joyce of the 1990s documentary TV series Great Crimes and Trials of the 20th century. he chided Britain for pursuing the war beyond mere containment of Germany and repeatedly warned of the \\"menace\\" of the Soviet Union. He signed off with a final defiant \\"Heil Hitler and farewell\\". There are conflicting accounts as to whether this last programme was actually transmitted, although a recording was found in the Apen studios. The next day Radio Hamburg was seized by British forces, and on 4 May Wynford Vaughan-Thomas used it to make a mock \\"Germany Calling\\" broadcast denouncing Joyce. Besides broadcasting, Joyce's duties included writing propaganda for distribution among British prisoners of war, whom he tried to recruit into the British Free Corps of the Waffen-SS. He wrote a book Twilight Over England promoted by the German Ministry of Propaganda, which unfavourably compared the evils of allegedly Jewish-dominated capitalist Britain with the alleged wonders of National Socialist Germany. Adolf Hitler awarded Joyce the War Merit Cross (First and Second Class) for his broadcasts, although he never met Joyce. Capture and trial On 28 May 1945, Joyce was captured by British forces at Flensburg, near the German border with Denmark, which was the last capital of the Third Reich. Spotting a dishevelled figure while resting from gathering firewood, intelligence soldiers ‚Äì including a Jewish German, Geoffrey Perry (born Horst Pinschewer), who had left Germany before the war ‚Äì engaged him in conversation in French and English. After they asked whether he was Joyce, he reached into his pocket (actually reaching for a false passport); believing he was armed, Geoffrey Perry shot him through the buttocks, resulting in four wounds. Two intelligence officers then drove him to a border post and handed him to British military police. Joyce was then taken to London and tried at the Old Bailey on three counts of high treason: \\"Not guilty\\" were the first words from Joyce's mouth in his trial, as noted by Rebecca West in her book The Meaning of Treason (as noted by Whittaker Chambers in his 1947 review of that book). The only evidence offered that he had begun broadcasting from Germany while his British passport was valid was the testimony of a London police inspector who had questioned him before the war while he was an active member of the British Union of Fascists and claimed to have recognised his voice on a propaganda broadcast in the early weeks of the war ‚Äì Joyce had previous convictions for assault and riotous assembly in the 1930s. During the processing of the charges Joyce's American nationality came to light, and it seemed that he would have to be acquitted, based upon a lack of jurisdiction; he could not be convicted of betraying a country that was not his own. He was acquitted of the first and second charges. However, the Attorney General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, successfully argued that Joyce's possession of a British passport, even though he had misstated his nationality to get it, entitled him until it expired to British diplomatic protection in Germany, and therefore he owed allegiance to the King at the time he commenced working for the Germans. The historian A. J. P. Taylor remarked in his book English History 1914‚Äì1945 that \\"Technically, Joyce was hanged for making a false statement when applying for a passport, the usual penalty for which is a small fine.\\" =Appeal= His conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 1 November 1945, and by Lords Jowitt L.C., Macmillan, Wright, Simonds, and Porter ‚Äì although Porter dissented ‚Äì of the House of Lords on 13 December 1945. In the appeal, Joyce argued that possession of a passport did not entitle him to the protection of the Crown, and therefore did not perpetuate his duty of allegiance once he left the country, but the House rejected this argument. Lord Porter's dissenting opinion assumed that the question as to whether Joyce's duty of allegiance had terminated was a question of fact for the jury to decide, rather than a purely legal question for the judge. Joyce also argued that jurisdiction had been wrongly assumed by the court in electing to try an alien for offences committed in a foreign country. This argument was also rejected, on the basis that a state may exercise such jurisdiction in the interests of its own security. Joyce's biographer Nigel Farndale suggests on the basis of documents made public for the first time between 2000 and 2005 that Joyce made a deal with his prosecutors not to reveal links he had had to MI5. In return, his wife Margaret, known to radio listeners as \\"Lady Haw-Haw\\", was spared prosecution for high treason. Of the 32 British renegades and broadcasters caught in Germany at the end of the war, only Margaret Joyce, who died in London in 1972, was not charged with treason. Execution Joyce went to his death unrepentant. He allegedly said: Other sources refer to his having said, \\"may the Swastika be raised from the dust\\". Joyce was executed on 3 January 1946 at Wandsworth Prison, aged 39. He was the penultimate person hanged for a crime other than murder in the United Kingdom. The last was Theodore Schurch, executed for treachery the following day at Pentonville. \\"Soldier Executed.\\" Times, London, England, 5 January 1946: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 20 March. 2015. In both cases the hangman was Albert Pierrepoint. Joyce died \\"an Anglican, like his mother, despite a long and friendly correspondence with a Roman Catholic priest who fought hard for William's soul\\". The scar on Joyce's face split wide open because of the pressure applied to his head upon his drop from the gallows. As was customary for executed criminals, Joyce's remains were buried in an unmarked grave within the walls of HMP Wandsworth. In 1976 following a campaign by his daughter, Heather Landalo, his body was reinterred in Bohermore, Galway, Ireland, where he had lived with his family from 1909 until 1922. Despite his conviction, he was given a Roman Catholic Tridentine Mass. Wilson op cit. Family Joyce had two daughters by his first wife, Hazel, who later married Oswald Mosley's bodyguard, Eric Piercey. One daughter, Heather Landalo (formerly Piercey: stepfather's surname) has spoken publicly of her father.

He is a co-founder and former CEO of Blackboard Inc., a position he held from 1999 to 2012. In April 2013, Chasen co-founded SocialRadar, a technology startup company developing a location-based social app. In 2020, he co-founded ClassEDU, the maker of Class For Zoom, which aims to improve the effectiveness of Zoom-based remote learning.  Early life  Michael Chasen grew up in Cheshire, Connecticut. He developed an interest in computers at age 10, and he began writing programs on his father's Radio Shack TRS Model III. He later used his skills to offer local businesses computer consulting while still in school. Also during high school, he was an active member of BBYO (B'nai B'rith Youth Organization). Chasen attended American University and completed a degree in computer science in three years, graduating in 1993. While at American, Chasen worked part-time doing technology work for the FBI. He met future Blackboard co-founder Matthew Pittinsky in the American University dorms when Pittinsky wanted to borrow Chasen's laser printer. Following his undergraduate degree, Chasen earned an MBA with a focus in accounting from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business in 1995.  Career = Early career = While still at Georgetown, Chasen was inspired by the application process to multiple undergraduate and MBA programs to start Search and Apply Group, a company that offered a computer application allowing colleges to accept online applications. After hearing about Search and Apply Group, Greg Baroni, who was Matthew Pittinsky's manager at KPMG Peat Marwick (now KPMG Consulting), offered Chasen a job. In 1996, Chasen left law school after completing one year to join KPMG as a consultant in the Higher Education Group. During their time at KPMG, Chasen and Pittinsky observed that colleges were investing in connecting classrooms and dormitories to the Internet, but there was a gap in the adoption of software to aid learning. Chasen and Pittinsky left KPMG in 1997 to launch their e-learning business. In an oft-cited anecdote, Baroni allowed them to borrow their computers while they got themselves set-up, a situation that Chasen and Pittinsky used to then steal their office chairs. = Blackboard = Chasen and Pittinsky founded Blackboard LLC, a consulting company developing IMS (Instructional Management System) standards for elearning based on a contract from EDUCOM and the National Learning Infrastructure Initiative, in 1997. In 1998, the company merged with CourseInfo LLC, a software provider which had developed a platform for internet and networked learning, which they called a \\"Course Management System\\" platform. The combined company became known as Blackboard Inc.. Chasen became chief executive officer (CEO) of Blackboard in 1999, as one of the youngest CEOs of a publicly traded company when he orchestrated Blackboard's initial public offering in 2004. By 2012 Blackboard had grown to more than 3,000 employees with 20,000 clients in over 65 countries, and earning $600 million in revenue, and Chasen announced he would be stepping down as the CEO of Blackboard. Jay Bhatt was named as his successor. = SocialRadar = In 2013, Chasen founded SocialRadar, a D.C.-based mobile startup focused on building a social location app for smartphones and Google Glass. He is the CEO of the new company. In June 2013, it was reported that Chasen had secured $12.75 million in a first round of investments. SocialRadar's app was planned to enter beta testing in July 2013 and was initially developed for iPhone, followed by Android and Glass. On January 30, 2014, SocialRadar was released to the Apple AppStore.

Offering perhaps Marx's most detailed pronouncement on programmatic matters of revolutionary strategy, the document discusses the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\", the period of transition from capitalism to communism, proletarian internationalism and the party of the working class. It is notable also for elucidating the principles of \\"To each according to his contribution\\" as the basis for a \\"lower phase\\" of communist society directly following the transition from capitalism and \\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\\" as the basis for a future \\"higher phase\\" of communist society. In describing the lower phase, he states that \\"the individual receives from society exactly what he gives to it\\" and advocates remuneration in the form of labour vouchers as opposed to money. The Critique of the Gotha Programme, published after his death, was among Marx's last major writings. The letter is named after the Gotha Programme, a proposed party platform manifesto for a forthcoming party congress that was to take place in the town of Gotha. At the party congress, the SDAP (\\"Eisenachers\\", based in Eisenach) planned to unite with the General German Workers' Association (ADAV, \\"Lassalleans\\", from Ferdinand Lassalle) to form a unified party. The Eisenachers sent the draft programme for a united party to Marx for comment. He found the programme negatively influenced by Lassalle, whom Marx regarded as an opportunist willing to limit the demands of the workers' movement in exchange for concessions from the government. However, at the congress held in Gotha in late May 1875 the draft programme was accepted with only minor alterations by what was to become the powerful Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Marx's programmatic letter was published by Engels only much later, in 1891 when the SPD had declared its intention of adopting a new programme, the result being the Erfurt Programme of 1891. The Gotha Programme presented a moderate, evolutionary way to socialism as opposed to the revolutionary approach of the orthodox Marxists. As a result, the latter accused it of being \\"revisionist\\" and ineffective.

In 1939, he succeeded his brother Abdulkadir dan Abbas as Galadima Kano and was appointed the district head of Dawakin Kudu. Inuwa was influenced by Tijaniyya cleric Shaykh Yahya b. Muhamad Naffakh and was considered pious among his peers and patient. In 1944, he was a councilor in the Kano Native Authority and from 1952 to 1963, he was a member of the Northern Regional Assembly. He was already aged when he became the Emir of Kano in 1963, Muhammadu Inuwa succeeded his nephew Sanusi in April 1963, both were contenders for the position of emir in 1953. He ruled for only three months before he died.

Before the Second World War, Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) had wanted to concentrate trade within the British Empire, but the Union Movement attempted to stress the importance of developing a European nationalism, rather than a narrower country-based nationalism. Thag has caused the UM to be characterised as an attempt by Mosley to start again in his political life by embracing more democratic and international policies than those with which he had previously been associated. The UM has been described as post-fascist by former members such as Robert Edwards, the founder of the pro-Mosley European Action, a British pressure group. Mosley's postwar activity Having been the leader of the BUF in the 1930s, Mosley was expected to return to lead the far right. However, he remained out of the immediate postwar political arena, instead turned to writing and published his first work, My Answer (1946) in which he argued that he had been a patriot who had been unjustly punished by his internment under Defence Regulation 18B. In it and his 1947 sequel, The Alternative, Mosley began to argue for a much-closer integration between the nations of Europe, the beginning of his 'Europe a Nation' campaign, which sought a strong united Europe as a counterbalance to the growing power of the United States and the Soviet Union. Europe a Nation Mosley perceived a linear growth within British history and saw Europe a Nation as the culmination of that destiny. Therefore, he argued it to be \\"part of an organic process of British history\\" since Britain had united into one nation and that it was Britain's national destiny to unite the whole continent.Row, R. Oswald Mosley, Briton, Fascist, European He further envisaged a three-tiered system of government, headed by an elected European government, to organise defence and the corporatist economy. The continuation of national governments and a collection of local governments were still seen as necessary for the sake of independent identities. Mosley's ideas were not as such new since concepts of a Nation Europa and Eurafrika (the same idea but with parts of north Africa included as natural sectors of Europe's traditional sphere of influence, an idea that Mosley himself felt had some merit) were already growing in Germany's postwar underground. Also, Benito Mussolini's 1944 Italian Social Republic had returned to fascism's roots with an attempt at a corporatist economic system during its brief existence. Nonetheless, Mosley was the first to express the ideas in English, and it came as no surprise when he returned to proper political activism in 1948. Those plans were to form the basis for the policy programme of the Union Movement. Formation of party A flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement After the release of interned fascists at the end of the Second World War, a number of far-right groups were formed. They were often virulently anti-Semitic and tried to capitalise on the violent events taking place in Mandatory Palestine.Archive Hour, BBC Radio 4, first broadcast 19 April 2008. Large meetings were organised in Jewish areas of East London and elsewhere, which were often violently broken up by antifascist groups such as the 43 Group.Archive Hour, BBC Radio 4, first broadcast 19 April 2008. Fifty-one separate groups were united under Mosley's leadership in the Union Movement (UM), launched at a meeting in Farringdon Hall, London, in 1948. However, the four main groups were Jeffrey Hamm's British League of Ex-Servicemen and Women, Anthony Gannon's Imperial Defence League, Victor Burgess's Union of British Freedom and Horace Gowing and Tommy Moran's Sons of St George, all of which were led by ex-BUF men.Dorril, Stephen. Blackshirt: Sir Oswald Mosley & British Fascism, Penguin Books, 2007, p. 566 Another early member was Francis Parker Yockey, who had come to England to seek Mosley's help tp publish his written work. Yockey briefly headed up the UM's European Contact Section although he was gone fairly quickly after a dispute with Mosley. The Union Movement was also known for its attempts to recruit Irish people living in Britain, and Mosley wrote a pamphlet in 1948, Ireland's Right to Unite when entering European Union.https://www.oswaldmosley.com/irelands-right-to-unite/ There were also links between the UM and the Irish nationalist and pro-fascist party Ailtir√≠ na hAis√©irghe (Architects of the Resurrection), and Mosley wrote articles for its newspaper Ais√©irghe.Douglas, R.M., Architects of the Resurrection - Ailtir√≠ na hAis√©irghe and the fascist 'new order' in Ireland pp. 276-277, Manchester University Press 2009Ais√©irghe, 20 June 1948, January 1950 Mosley remained a critic of liberal democracy, and the UM instead extolled a strong executive that people could endorse or reject through regular referendums, with an independent judiciary in place to appoint replacements in the event of a rejection.Thurlow, R. Fascism in Britain London: IB Tauris, 1998, p. 214. The party marched 1,500 supporters through Camden the same year and went on to contest the following year's local elections in London. However, outside Stepney and Bethnal Green, where there was some support, the UM performed very poorly at the polls and secured no representation. The Union Movement then ceased to be a significant political party and attendance at meetings dwindled until it was negligible.Archive Hour, BBC Radio 4, first broadcast 19 April 2008. Disillusioned by the stern opposition that the UM faced and his style of street politics being exposed as somewhat pass√©, Mosley went into self-imposed exile in Ireland and left the UM to languish. The member F.B. Price-Heywood was elected as a councillor in Grasmere, Lake District, Cumbria, during the 1953 local elections, but it was a rare success for the party, and the UM gained no parliamentary seats.Bartlett, Roger Comrade Newsletter of the Friends of Oswald Mosley When Mosley Men Won Elections (November 2014)Bean, John Many Shades of Black: Inside Britain's Far Right Ostara Publications 2011, pp. 79-80 The Union Movement published several weekly newspapers and monthly magazines including Union, Action (also the title of the prewar weekly newspaper of the New Party and the British Union of Fascists), Attack, Alternative, East London Blackshirt, The European and National European. Racial tensions and rise of party After the British Nationality Act 1948, there was a great increase in immigration, particularly from the Commonwealth and the colonies. In the early 1950s, immigration was estimated at 8,000‚Äì10,000 per year, but it had grown to 35,000 per year by 1957. Perceptions of the new migrant workers were frequently oppositional and stereotypical, but the Conservative Party, despite the private opinions of some of its members, was loath to make a political issue out of it for fear of being seen as gutter politicians. Disturbances occurred in 1958 in Notting Hill after a Mosley rally and in Nottingham with clashes between racial groups, a new phenomenon in Britain.Taylor, S. The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 12 The new uncertainties revitalised the UM, and Mosley re-emerged to stand as a candidate in the 1959 election in Kensington North, which included Notting Hill, his first parliamentary election since 1931. Mosley made immigration his campaign issue and combined calls for assisted repatriation with stories regarding criminality and sexual deviance of black people, a common theme of the time.Mosley, Oswald. My Life, London: Nelson, 1970, pp. 447-452 The 8.1% share of the voteUK General Election results October 1959 that he secured was a personal humiliation for a man who still hoped that he would be called to serve some day as the British prime minister. However, the UM was as a whole buoyed by the immigration problem, which it saw as the next big issue in British politics. In April 1965, Mosley attempted to prove that he and the UM were not racist by forming an \\"Associate Movement\\" for ethnic minorities who agreed with his policies, including the financially-assisted repatriation of immigrants to their homelands of origin. The group was led by an Indian solicitor and an African airline pilot but was short- lived.https://www.oswaldmosley.com/top-10-lies-about-oswald-mosley/Macklin, Graham. Very Deeply Dyed in Black: Sir Oswald Mosley and the Resurrection of British Fascism after 1945, London: I.B. Tauris, 2007, pp. 75-76 European dimension Along his domestic politics, Mosley continued to work towards his goal of Europe a Nation and in 1962 attended a conference in Venice in which he helped to form a National Party of Europe, along with Germany's Reichspartei, the Mouvement d'Action Civique, and Jeune Europe of Belgium and the Italian Social Movement (MSI).Taylor, S. The National Front in English Politics London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 15 Adopting the slogan \\"Progress - Solidarity - Unity\\", the movement aimed to work closely for a closer unity of European states, but in the end, little came of it as only the MSI enjoyed any success domestically. The group replaced the earlier European Social Movement in which Mosley had also been involved. The Union Movement itself did not play an active role on the European stage although it helped to set in motion co- operation between like-minded groups across Europe, which still continues with the European National Front. Final days Mosley stood again in the 1966 election, this time in the Shoreditch and Finsbury constituency. However, capturing only 4.6% of the vote, Mosley lost interest thereafter and effectively departed the scene although he remained the official UM leader until 1973.Taylor, S. The National Front in English Politics London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 17 The increasingly-marginalised UM carried on into the 1970s and still advocated Europe A Nation but had no real influence and failed to capture support with its fairly-unusual policies. After Mosley A brief revival seemed possible after the UM became the Action Party in 1973, the name under which it fought six seats at the Greater London Council election. Under the leadership of Jeffrey Hamm, the party hoped for something of a revival although it was damaged severely in 1974 when a leading member, Keith Thompson, and his followers split to form the League of Saint George, a non- party movement that they claimed was the true continuation of Mosley's ideas. With a sizeable chunk of its membership long since lost to the National Front, the Action Party gave up electoral politics and in 1978 became the Action Society, which acted as a publishing house rather than a political party.Boothroyd, D. The History of British Political Parties Politico's Publishing: 2001, p. 3 The group continued until Hamm's death in 1994, when the funding of Mosley's widow, Diana Mitford, was withdrawn. The Action Society was quietly wound up and represented the final end of the Union Movement. Election results=House of Commons= { !

He was a key figure in the early history of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP, later the Communist Party of the Soviet Union [CPSU]), originally established 1898, and of its Bolshevik faction. Bogdanov co-founded the Bolsheviks in 1903, when they split with the Menshevik faction. He was a rival within the Bolsheviks to Vladimir Lenin (1870‚Äì1924), until being expelled in 1909. Following the Russian Revolutions of 1917, when the Bolsheviks came to power in the collapsing Russian Republic, during the first decade of the subsequent Soviet Union in the 1920s, he was an influential opponent of the Bolshevik government and Lenin from a Marxist leftist perspective. Bogdanov received training in medicine and psychiatry. His wide scientific and medical interests ranged from the universal systems theory to the possibility of human rejuvenation through blood transfusion. He invented an original philosophy called \\"tectology\\", now regarded as a forerunner of systems theory. He was also an economist, culture theorist, science fiction writer, and political activist. He was one of the Russian Machists. Early years Aleksandr Malinovsky was born in Sok√≥≈Çka, Grodno Governorate, Russian Empire (now Poland), into a rural teacher's family, the second of six children. He attended the Gymnasium at Tula, which he compared to a barracks or prison. He was awarded a gold medal when he graduated. Upon completion of the gymnasium, Bogdanov was admitted to the Natural Science Department of Moscow University. In his autobiography, Bogdanov reported that, while studying at Moscow University, he joined the Union Council of Regional Societies, and he was arrested and exiled to Tula because of it.Bogdanov, Autobiography The occasion of his arrest and exile is as follows. The head of the Moscow Okhrana used an informant to acquire the names of members of the Union Council of Regional Societies, which included Bogdanov's name. on October 30, 1894, students rowdily demonstrated against a lecture by the famous history Professor Vasily Klyuchevsky who, despite being a well-known liberal, had written a favourable eulogy for the recently deceased Tsar Alexander III of Russia. Punishment of a few of the students was arbitrary and unfair that the Union Council requested a fair reexamination of the issue. That very night, the Okhrana arrested all the students on the list mentioned above ‚Äì including Bogdanov ‚Äì who were expelled from the university and banished to their hometowns. Expelled from Moscow State University, he enrolled as an external student at the University of Kharkov from which he graduated as a physician in 1899. Bogdanov remained in Tula from 1894 to 1899, where ‚Äì since his own family was living in Sok√≥≈Çka ‚Äì he lodged with Alexander Rudnev, the father of Vladimir Bazarov, who became a close friend and collaborator in future years. Here he met and married Natalya Bogdanovna Korsak, who, as a woman, had been refused entrance to the university. She was eight years older than him and worked as a nurse for Rudnev. Malinovsky adopted the nom de plume that he used when he wrote his major theoretical works and his novels from her patronym. Alongside Bazarov and Ivan Skvortsov- Stepanov he became a tutor in a workers' study circle. This was organised in the Tula Armament Factory by Ivan Saveliev, whom Bogdanov credited with founding Social Democracy in Tula. During this period, he wrote his Brief course of economic science which was published - \\"subject to many modifications made for the benefit of the censor\\" - only in 1897. He later said that this experience of student-led education gave him his first lesson in proletarian culture. In autumn 1895, he resumed his medical studies at the University of Kharkiv (Ukraine) but still spent much time in Tula. He gained access to the works of Lenin in 1896, particularly the latter's critique of Peter Berngardovich Struve. In 1899, he graduated as a medical doctor and published his next work, \\"Basic elements of the historical perspective on nature\\". However, because of his political views, he was also arrested by the Tsar's police, spent six months in prison, and was exiled to Vologda. Bolshevism Bogdanov dates his support for Bolshevism from autumn of 1903. Early in 1904, Martyn Liadov was sent by the Bolsheviks in Geneva to seek out supporters in Russia. He found a sympathetic group of revolutionaries in Tver. Bogdanov was then sent by the Tver Committee to Geneva, where he was greatly impressed by Lenin's One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. Bogdanov was arrested on 3 December 1905 and held in prison until 27 May 1906. Upon release, he was exiled to Bezhetsk for three years. However, he obtained permission to spend his exile abroad, and joined Lenin in Kokkola, Finland. For the next six years, Bogdanov was a major figure among the early Bolsheviks, second only to Vladimir Lenin in influence. In 1904‚Äì1906, he published three volumes of the philosophic treatise Empiriomonizm (Empiriomonism), in which he tried to merge Marxism with the philosophy of Ernst Mach, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Richard Avenarius. His work later affected a number of Russian Marxist theoreticians, including Nikolai Bukharin.Cohen p. 15 In 1907, he helped organize the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery with both Lenin and Leonid Krasin. For four years after the collapse of the Russian Revolution of 1905, Bogdanov led a group within the Bolsheviks (\\"ultimatists\\" and \\"otzovists\\" or \\"recallists\\"), who demanded a recall of Social Democratic deputies from the State Duma, and he vied with Lenin for the leadership of the Bolshevik faction. In 1908 he joined Bazarov, Lunacharsky, Berman, Helfond, Yushkevich and Suvorov in a symposium Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism which espoused the views of the Russian Marxists. By mid-1908, the factionalism with the Bolsheviks had become irreconcilable. A majority of Bolshevik leaders either supported Bogdanov or were undecided between him and Lenin. Lenin concentrated on undermining Bogdanov's reputation as a philosopher. In 1909 he published a scathing book of criticism entitled Materialism and Empiriocriticism, assaulting Bogdanov's position and accusing him of philosophical idealism.Woods, Part Three In June 1909, Bogdanov was defeated by Lenin at a Bolshevik mini-conference in Paris organized by the editorial board of the Bolshevik magazine Proletary and was expelled from the Bolsheviks. He joined his brother-in-law Anatoly Lunacharsky, Maxim Gorky, and other Vperedists on the island of Capri, where they started the Capri Party School for Russian factory workers. In 1910, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Mikhail Pokrovsky, and their supporters moved the school to Bologna, where they continued teaching classes through 1911, while Lenin and his allies soon started the Longjumeau Party School just outside of Paris. Bogdanov broke with the Vpered in 1912 and abandoned revolutionary activities. After six years of his political exile in Europe, Bogdanov returned to Russia in 1914, following the political amnesty declared by Tsar Nicholas II as part of the festivities connected with the tercentenary of the Romanov Dynasty. During World War I Bogdanov was drafted soon after the outbreak of World War I, and he was assigned as a junior regimental doctor with the 221st Smolensk infantry division in the Second Army commanded by General Alexander Samsonov. In the Battle of Tannenberg, August 26‚Äì30, the Second Army was surrounded and almost completely destroyed, but Bogdanov survived because he had been sent to accompany a seriously wounded officer to Moscow. However following the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, he succumbed to a nervous disorder, and subsequently became Junior house surgeon at an evacuation hospital.Biggart J. (1998) 'the Rehabitation of Bogdanov' in Bogdanov and His Work, Aldershot: Ashgate In 1916 he wrote four articles for Vpered which provided an analysis of the World War and the dynamics of war economies. He attributed a central role to the armed forces in the economic restructuring of the belligerent powers. He saw the army as creating a \\"consumers' communism\\" with the state taking over ever-increasing parts of the economy. At the same time military authoritarianism was also spread to civil society. This created the conditions for two consequences: consumption-led war communism and the destruction of the means of production. He thus predicted that even after the war, the new system of state capitalism would replace that of finance capitalism even though the destruction of the forces of production would cease. During the Russian Revolution Bogdanov had no party-political involvement in the Russian Revolution of 1917, although he did publish a number of articles and books about the events that unfurled around him. He supported the Zimmerwaldist programme of \\"peace without annexations or indemnities\\". He deplored the Provisional Government's continued prosecution of the war. After the July Crisis, he advocated \\"revolutionary democracy\\" as he now considered the socialists capable of forming a government. However, he viewed this as a broad-based socialist provisional government that would convene a Constituent Assembly. In May 1917, he published Chto my svergli in Novaya Zhizn. Here he argued that between 1904 and 1907, the Bolsheviks had been \\"decidedly democratic\\" and that there was no pronounced cult of leadership. However, following the decision of Lenin and the √©migr√© group around him to break with Vpered in order to unify with the Mensheviks, the principle of leadership became more pronounced. After 1912, when Lenin insisted on splitting the Duma group of the RSDLP, the leadership principle became entrenched. However, he saw this problem as not being confined to the Bolsheviks, noting that similar authoritarian ways of thinking were shown in the Menshevik attitude to Plekhanov, or the cult of heroic individuals and leaders amongst the Narodniks. : Every organisation, on achieving a position of decisive influence in the life and ordering of society, quite inevitably, irrespective of the formal tenets of its programme, attempts to impose on society its own type of structure, the one with which it is most familiar and to which it is most accustomed. Every collective re-creates, as far as it can, the whole social environment after its own image and in its own likeness. After the October Revolution At the beginning of February 1918, Bogdanov denied that the Bolsheviks' October rise to power had constituted a conspiracy. Rather, he explained that an explosive situation had arisen through the prolongation of the war. He pointed to a lack of cultural development in that all strata of society, whether the bourgeoisie, the intelligentsia, or the workers, had shown a failure to resolve conflicts through negotiation. He described the revolution as being a combination of a peasant revolution in the countryside and a soldier-worker revolution in the cities. He regarded it as paradoxical that the peasantry expressed itself through the Bolshevik party rather than through the Socialist Revolutionaries. He analysed the effect of the First World War as creating 'War Communism' which he defined a 'consumer communism', which created the circumstances for the creation of state capitalism. He saw military state capitalism as a temporary phenomenon in the West, lasting only as long as the war. However, thanks to the predominance of the soldiers in the Bolshevik Party, he regarded it as inevitable that their backwardness should predominate in the re-organisation of society. Instead of proceeding in a methodical fashion, the pre-existing state was simply uprooted. The military- consumerist approach of simply requisitioning what was required had predominated and could not cope with the more complex social relations necessitated by the market: : There is a War Communist party which is mobilising the working class, and there are groups of socialist intelligentsia. The war has made the army the end and the working class the means. He refused multiple offers to rejoin the party and denounced the new regime as similar to Aleksey Arakcheyev's arbitrary and despotic rule in the early 1820s.Rosenthal, p. 118 In 1918, Bogdanov became a professor of economics at the University of Moscow and director of the newly established Socialist Academy of Social Sciences. Proletkult Between 1918 and 1920, Bogdanov co-founded the proletarian art movement Proletkult and was its leading theoretician. In his lectures and articles, he called for the total destruction of the \\"old bourgeois culture\\" in favour of a \\"pure proletarian culture\\" of the future. It was also through Proletkult that Bogdanov's educational theories were given form with first the establishment of the Moscow Proletarian University. At first Proletkult, like other radical cultural movements of the era, received financial support from the Bolshevik government, but by 1920, the Bolshevik leadership grew hostile, and on December 1, 1920, Pravda published a decree denouncing Proletkult as a \\"petit bourgeois\\" organization operating outside of Soviet institutions and a haven for \\"socially alien elements\\". Later in that month, the president of Proletkult was removed, and Bogdanov lost his seat on its Central Committee. He withdrew from the organization completely in 1921‚Äì1922.Rosenthal, p. 162 Arrest Bogdanov gave a lecture to a club at Moscow University, which, according to Yakov Yakovlev, included an account of the formation of Vpered and reiterated some of the criticisms Bogdanov had made at the time of the individualism of certain leaders. Yakovlev further claimed that Bogdanov discussed the development of the concept of proletarian culture up to the present day and discussed to what extent the Communist Party saw Proletkult as a rival. He further hinted at the prospect of a new International that might emerge if there were a revival of the socialist movement in the West. He said he envisaged such an International as merging political, trade union, and cultural activities into a single organisation. Yakovlev characterised these ideas as Menshevik, pointing to the refusal of Vpered to acknowledge the authority of the 1912 Prague Conference. He cited Bogdanov's characterization of the October revolution as \\"soldiers'-peasants' revolt\\", his criticisms of the New Economic Policy, and his description of the new regime as expressing the interests of a new class of technocratic and bureaucratic intelligentsia, as evidence that Bogdanov was involved in forming a new party. Meanwhile, Workers' Truth had received publicity in the Berlin-based Menshevik journal Sotsialisticheskii Vestnik, and they also distributed a manifesto at the 12th Bolshevik Congress and were active in the industrial unrest which swept Moscow and Petrograd in July and August 1923. On 8 September 1923, Bogdanov was among a number of people arrested by the GPU (the Soviet secret police) on suspicion of being involved in them. He demanded to be interviewed by Felix Dzerzhinsky, to whom he explained that while he shared a range of views with Workers' Truth, he had no formal association with them. He was released after five weeks on 13 October; however, his file was not closed until a decree passed by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 16 January 1989. He wrote about his experiences under arrest in Five weeks with the GPU.'The rehabilitation of Bogdanov' by John Biggart in Bogdanov and His Work: A Guide to the Published and Unpublished Works of Alexander A. Bogdanov (Malinovsky), 1873‚Äì1928, 1998, p. 12 Later years and death In 1924, Bogdanov started his blood transfusion experiments, apparently hoping to achieve eternal youth or at least partial rejuvenation. Lenin's sister Maria Ulyanova was among many who volunteered to take part in Bogdanov's experiments. After undergoing 11 blood transfusions, he remarked with satisfaction the improvement of his eyesight, suspension of balding, and other positive symptoms. His fellow revolutionary Leonid Krasin wrote to his wife that \\"Bogdanov seems to have become 7, no, 10 years younger after the operation\\". In 1925‚Äì1926, Bogdanov founded the Institute for Haemotology and Blood Transfusions, which was later named after him. But a later transfusion cost him his life, when he took the blood of a student suffering from malaria and tuberculosis (Bogdanov died, but the student injected with his blood made a complete recovery). Some scholars (e.g. Loren Graham) have speculated that his death may have been a suicide, because Bogdanov wrote a highly nervous political letter shortly beforehand. However, others attribute his death to blood type incompatibility which was poorly understood at the time.Rosenthal, pp. 161‚Äì162 Legacy Both Bogdanov's fiction and his political writings imply that he expected the coming revolution against capitalism to lead to a technocratic society.Sochor, p. ___ This was because the workers lacked the knowledge and initiative to seize control of social affairs for themselves as a result of the hierarchical and authoritarian nature of the capitalist production process. However, Bogdanov also considered that the hierarchical and authoritarian mode of organization of the Bolshevik party was also partly to blame, although Bogdanov considered at least some such organization necessary and inevitable. In the 1920s and 1930s, Bogdanov's theorizing, being the product of a non-Leninist Bolshevik became important, though \\"underground\\" influence on certain dissident factions in the Soviet Union who turned against Bolshevik autocracy while accepting the necessity of the Revolution and wishing to preserve its achievements.Socialist Standard, April 2007 Writing=Fiction= In 1908, Bogdanov published the novel Red Star, about a utopia set on Mars. In it, he made predictions about future scientific and social developments. His utopia also dealt with feminist themes, which would become more common in later utopian science fiction, e.g., the two sexes becoming virtually identical in the future, or women escaping \\"domestic slavery\\" (one reason for physical changes) and being free to pursue relationships with the same freedom as men, without stigma. Other notable differences between the utopia of Red Star and present day society include workers having total control over their working hours, as well as more subtle differences in social behavior such as conversations being patiently \\"set at the level of the person with whom they were speaking and with understanding for his personality although it might very much differ from their own\\". The novel also gave a detailed description of blood transfusion in the Martian society. Bogdanov followed the novel with a prequel in 1913, Engineer Menni, which detailed the creation of the communist society on Mars. In 1924 he published a poem entitled \\"A Martian Stranded on Earth\\" that was to be the outline for a third novel, but he did not finish it before his death. =Tectology= From 1913 until 1922, Bogdanov immersed himself in the writing of a lengthy philosophical treatise of original ideas, Tectology: Universal Organization Science. Tectology anticipated many basic ideas of Systems Analysis, later explored by Cybernetics and Bogdanov attributed some of his ideas on the development of a monistic system to Ludwig Noire. In Tectology, Bogdanov proposed to unify all social, biological, and physical sciences by considering them as systems of relationships and by seeking the organizational principles that underlie all systems. His three-volume book anticipated many ideas later popularized by Norbert Wiener in Cybernetics and Ludwig von Bertalanffy in General Systems Theory. Both Wiener and von Bertalanffy may have read the German translation of Tectology, published in 1926, with a second edition published in 1928. In Russia, Vladimir Lenin (and later Joseph Stalin) considered Bogdanov's natural philosophy an ideological threat to dialectic materialism. The rediscovery of Tectology occurred only in the 1970s.

He played a leading role in the British Union of Fascists, controlling the organisational structure of the movement. British Fascisti Francis Hawkins joined the British Fascisti (BF) around the time of its inception and became a member of the three-man Headquarters Committee, being seen by many of the male members as a preferable leader to Rotha Lintorn-Orman.Robert Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, London: Allan Lane, 1969, p. 36 Under the influence of Francis Hawkins and his close ally E. G. Mandeville Roe, the BF ‚Äì which, despite its name, had been fairly conservative in nature ‚Äì moved towards a more genuinely fascist position by emphasising the corporate state and anti- Semitism.Richard Griffiths, Fellow Travellers on the Right, Oxford University Press, 1983, pp. 90‚Äì91 Without Lintorn-Orman's approval he held a series of talks with Robert Forgan in which he agreed in principle the idea of merging the BF into the New Party. However, when Francis Hawkins presented the plan to the BF Grand Council, it was rejected by a single vote.Richard Thurlow, Fascism in Britain: A History, 1918‚Äì1945, I.B. Tauris, 1998, p. 65 British Union of Fascists The rejection of the merger resulted in a sharp division between Francis Hawkins and Lintorn-Orman and as a result he split the organisation in 1932 and took the bulk of the membership with him into Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (the name under which the New Party had been reconstituted).Benewick, p. 36 Francis Hawkins had met with both Mosley and Forgan and had been so impressed with their set-up that he split the British Fascists in order to join them.Richard Griffiths, Fellow Travellers on the Right, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 91 Francis Hawkins was appointed National Defence Force Adjutant upon joining the party, making him deputy head of the group's paramilitary Blackshirts, under the command of Eric Hamilton Piercy.Thurlow, p. 68 He rose quickly through the ranks, holding the posts of Officer in Charge of the London Area and Chief Administrative Officer before being appointed Director-General of Organisation, a post that made him effectively second in command behind Mosley.Benewick, p. 116 On 22 June 1935 he replaced Piercy as head of the Blackshirts.Thomas Linehan, British Fascism, 1918-39: Parties, Ideology and Culture, Manchester University Press, 2000, p. 119 In July 1935 he briefly became head of the BUF Women's Section during a period of restructuring for the movement, becoming the only man to hold the position.Paola Bacchetta, Margaret Power, Right-Wing Women: From Conservatives to Extremists Around the World, p. 35 As the leading member of the movement after Mosley, it was Francis Hawkins who developed the notion of BUF members wearing a black shirt under an ordinary suit, an important step for the movement to retain its identity following the banning of uniforms in the Public Order Act 1936.Benewick, p. 245 A firm believer in militarism, Francis Hawkins led the military faction within the BUF that successfully resisted the attempts of the likes of John Beckett, Bill Risdon and F.M. Box to convert the BUF into a more normal political party.Benweick, p. 273 His power was consolidated by his appointment as Director-General in 1936, a newly created post that gave him power both the political and administrative aspects of the BUF.Benewick, p. 274 He advocated a membership based on unmarried men, like himself, arguing that they would give the most fanatical devotion to the movement.Martin Pugh, Hurrah for the Blackshirts: Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the Wars, Pimlico, 2006, p. 129 He gained a reputation as a workaholic at BUF HQStephen Dorril, Blackshirt ‚Äì Sir Oswald Mosley and British Fascism, London: Penguin, 2007, p. 246 and he was equally noted for his personal loyalty to Mosley,Dorrill, p. 366 although he also had a strong influence over his leader and was identified by Special Branch as being responsible, along with William Joyce, for convincing Mosley to embrace anti- Semitism.Dorril, p. 306 Mosley would later describe him as \\"a man of outstanding character and ability\\".O. Mosley, My Life, London: Nelson, 1970, p. 332 He was particularly valued by Mosley for his skill as an organiser and bureaucrat.Linehan, p. 104 In 1936 F.M. Box, who had been deputy leader and Francis Hawkins' main rival, left the movement due to the growing influence of the militarists on Mosley. This decision left Francis Hawkins in effective control of the organisation of the BUF.Pugh, p. 221 He was thus appointed Director General of Organisation.Joseph Anthony Amato, Rethinking Home: A Case for Writing Local History, University of California Press, 2002, p. 127 His power ensured he undertook a reorganisation of the structure of the BUF, setting up training programmes for local election agents whilst also adding a more intellectual party organ Action alongside the existing, and more lowbrow, Blackshirt, in an attempt to attract more middle-class party members.Pugh, p. 223 His overall control of BUF organisation led to clashes with other leading figures, and in particular the party's failure in the March 1937 London County Council elections led to criticism of his methods by William Joyce and John Beckett.Linehan, p. 110 A few days after this public clash Francis Hawkins announced a series of cost-cutting measures at BUF headquarters, including the dismissal of several paid officials, including Joyce and Beckett, who established the National Socialist League the following month.Linehan, p. 111 Francis Hawkins continued to increase his power base with his two main internal rivals removed by spring 1938. A. K. Chesterton, one of the BUF's younger propagandists, had also resigned, citing Francis Hawkins' increasing role in policy development as a major reason.Linehan, p. 113 Later years Immediately after the outbreak of war he met with the leaders of other groups such as the Nordic League, the Right Club, The Link and the British Peoples Party in a failed attempt to organise a united front under Mosley.Dorril, p. 471 He also held meetings with Lord Tavistock aimed at finding a similar common course.Thurlow, p. 154 Although he volunteered for war service Dorril, p. 501 Francis Hawkins was arrested along with Mosley and others under the first wave of Defence Regulation 18B swoops in 1940.Benewick, p. 294 Held in internment in Stafford and Brixton prisons for much of the war, he was released in 1944 and concentrated on his business interests.Biography at Friends of Oswald Mosley site Francis Hawkins maintained a fairly low profile following his release, working for a time as a salesman for a Derby-based firm.Amato, p. 402 Involved in the foundation of the Union Movement in an organisational capacity, Francis Hawkins did not take a leading role due to his failing health.

William Joyce, Neil Francis Hawkins, Maxwell Knight and Arnold Leese were amongst those to have passed through the movement as members and activists. Structure and membership A flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement The organisation was formed on 6 May 1923https://www.stevenbooks.co.uk/british-fascisti by Rotha Lintorn-Orman in the aftermath of Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, and originally operated under the Italian-sounding name British Fascisti. Despite its name, the group had a poorly defined ideological basis at its beginning, being brought into being more by a fear of left-wing politics than a devotion to fascism. The ideals of the Boy Scout movement, with which many early members had also been involved in their younger days, also played a role, for the British Fascisti wished, according to General R. B. D. Blakeney, who was the BF President from 1924 to 1926, to \\"uphold the same lofty ideas of brotherhood, service and duty\\". At its formation, at least, the British Fascisti was positioned in the same right-wing conservative camp as the British Empire Union and the Middle Class Union, and shared some members with these groups. The group had a complex structure, being presided over by both an Executive Council and Fascist Grand Council of nine men, with County and Area Commanders controlling districts below this. Districts contained a number of companies, which in turn were divided into troops with each troop made of three units and unit containing seven members under a Leader. A separate structure existed along similar lines for the group's sizeable female membership. The group became notorious for its inflated claims of membership (including the ridiculous claim that it had 200,000 members in 1926, although at its peak from 1925 to 1926 it had a membership of several thousand. It mustered 5,000 people for a London march on Empire Day in London in 1925. Early membership largely came from high society, and included a number of women amongst its ranks, such as Dorothy, Viscountess Downe, Lady Sydenham of Combe, Baroness Zouche and Nesta Webster. Men from the aristocracy also joined, including Lord Glasgow, The Marquess of Ailesbury, Lord Ernest Hamilton, The Baron de Clifford, The Earl Temple of Stowe, Sir Arthur Henry Hardinge and Leopold Canning, Lord Garvagh, who served as first President of the movement. High-ranking members of the armed forces also occupied leading roles in the group, with General Blakeney joined by the likes of General Sir Ormonde Winter, Rear-Admiral John Armstrong (the BF Vice President 1924‚Äì1926) and Colonel Sir Charles Rosdew Burn, who combined a role on the Grand Council of the British Fascisti with that of Conservative Party MP for Torquay. Admirals Sir Edmund Fremantle and Sir Reginald Tupper, Brigadier-Generals Julian Tindale-Biscoe and Roland Erskine-Tulloch, Rear-Admiral William Ernest Russell Martin (BF's paymaster), Major-Generals James Spens, Thomas Pilcher and Colonel Daniel Burges were also members. Serving military personnel were eventually banned from joining the group by the Army Council however. At a more rank-and-file level, the group attracted a membership of middle- and working-class young men who spent much of their time in violent confrontations with similar men involved in the Communist Party of Great Britain; William Joyce was typical of this sort of low-level member. This domination by disgruntled members of the peerage and high-ranking officers meant that certain concerns not normally associated with the demands of fascism, such as anger at the decline of the large landowning agricultural sector, high levels of estate taxation and death duties, and the dearth of high-ranking civilian occupations considered suitable for the status of officers, were a central feature of the political concerns advanced by the British Fascisti. Other officials included Sir Michael Bruce, Arnold Leese, England cricket manager Sir Frederick Toone, England cricket captain Arthur Gilligan, John Baker White MP and Patrick Hannon MP. Early development The party confined itself to stewarding Conservative Party meetings and canvassing for the party. In particular it campaigned vigorously on behalf of Oliver Locker-Lampson, whose \\"Keep Out the Reds\\" campaign slogan struck a chord with the group's strong anti-communism. The group also indulged in a series of high-profile stunts, many of which were more in the vein of elaborate practical jokes than genuine subversion. In one such example, five British Fascisti forcibly removed Harry Pollitt from a train to Liverpool, where he was due to address a National Minority Movement event, and attempted to bundle him on to a different train. The five members arrested for the event insisted that they had intended to send Pollitt on a weekend break and even claimed that he had taken ¬£5 in expenses they offered him for that purpose. One of the group's few policies was a call for a reduction in income tax so that the well-off could hire more servants and so reduce unemployment. The group changed its name in 1924 from British Fascisti to British Fascists, in an attempt to distance itself from the Italian associations, although this move helped to bring about a split in the group with a more ideologically fascist group, the National Fascisti, going its own way. The group's patriotism had been questioned because of the Italian spelling of the name, while accusations were also made that it was in the pay of the Italian government. Placing emphasis on its support for the establishment, it even wrote to Labour Party Home Secretary Arthur Henderson in 1924 telling him that the group was at his disposal if he wished to deploy them against picket lines during industrial unrest, an offer to which Henderson did not respond. Blakeney had replaced Canning as President that same year, with Canning claiming that he lived too far from London to be politically influential enough. London was the group's major base of operation. In December 1925 an attempt to organise a meeting in Manchester was broken up by communists, and the BF abandoned its attempts to set up in the city as a result. Despite its close association with elements of the Conservative Party, the British Fascists did occasionally put up candidates in local elections. In 1924 two of its candidates in the municipal elections in Stamford, Lincolnshire, Arnold Leese and Henry Simpson, managed to secure election to the local council. Simpson would retain his seat in 1927 although by that stage both he and Leese had broken from the British Fascists. The 1926 strike The British Fascists began to take on a more prominent role in the run-up to the General Strike of 1926, as it became clear that their propaganda predicting such an outcome was about to come true. They were, however, not permitted to join the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies (OMS), a group established by the government and chaired by Lord Hardinge to mobilise a non-striking workforce in the event of general strike, without first relinquishing any explicit attachment to fascism, as the government insisted this group remain non-ideological. The structure of the OMS was actually based on that of the British Fascists, but the government was unwilling to rely on the British Fascists because of what they saw as the group's unorthodox nature and its reliance on funding from Rotha Lintorn-Orman (who had garnered a reputation for high living) and so excluded them as a group from the OMS. As a result, a further split occurred, as a number of members, calling themselves Loyalists and led by former BF President Brigadier-General Blakeney, did just that. In the event the British Fascists formed their own Q Divisions which took on much of the same work as the OMS during the strike, albeit without having any official government recognition. The strike severely damaged the party as it failed to precipitate the \\"Bolshevik Revolution\\" that Lintorn-Orman had set the party up to fight. In fact, the strike was largely peaceful and restrained, and fears of future outbreaks were quelled somewhat by the passing of the Trades Disputes Act. Many of its most prominent members and supporters also drifted away from the group in the aftermath of the strike. The party journal, initially called Fascist Bulletin before changing its name to British Lion, went from a weekly to a monthly while the loss of a number of key leaders and the erratic leadership of Lintorn-Orman, who was battling alcoholism, brought about a decline of activity. The group also became ravaged by factionalism, with one group following Lady Downe and the old ways of the British Fascists, and another centred around James Strachey Barnes and Sir Harold Elsdale Goad advocating full commitment to a proper fascist ideology. Decline Having been hit hard by the split from the General Strike, the British Fascists attempted to move gradually towards a more defined fascism, starting in 1927 by adopting a blue shirt and beret uniform in the style of similar movements in Europe. That same year they attempted to organise a Remembrance Day parade past Buckingham Palace where they requested the King should salute them from the balcony but the requests were rejected and the parade did not take place. The progress towards fascism did not however come quickly enough for Arnold Leese who in 1928 split from the group, which he denounced as \\"conservatism with knobs on\\", to establish his own Imperial Fascist League (IFL), a much more hard-line group which emphasised anti-Semitism. Before long, however, the British Fascists began to advocate a more authoritarian government in which the monarch would take a leading role in government, as well as advocating the establishment of a Benito Mussolini-style corporate state. These policy changes were made possible by the departure of Blakeney, who was committed to representative democracy and whose main economic opinion was opposition to the gold standard. Even without Blakeney they retained some of their earlier Conservative-linked views, such as loyalty to the king, anti-trade union legislation, free trade within the British Empire and a general preference for the rural, although these were bolstered by fascist-influenced policies such as limiting the franchise, gradual purification of the \\"English race\\" and stringent restrictions on immigration and the activities of immigrants admitted to Britain. However, as Martin Pugh has pointed out the British Fascists actively encouraged comparisons with the Conservative Party, feeling that it would add a sense of legitimacy and Britishness to their activities, particularly as they faced harsh criticism from not only the left but also some Tories for their increasingly paramilitary structure. Nonetheless some Tories were close to the group, with Charles Burn sitting on the Grand Council and support being lent by the likes of Patrick Hannon, Robert Tatton Bower, Robert Burton-Chadwick and Alan Lennox-Boyd. Indeed, in May 1925 Hannon even booked a room in the House of Commons to host an event for the British Fascists. After 1931 the BF abandoned its attempts to form a distinctly British version of Fascism, and instead adopted the full programme of Mussolini and his National Fascist Party. The already weakened group split further in 1932 over the issue of a merger with Oswald Mosley's New Party. The proposal was accepted by Neil Francis Hawkins of the Headquarters Committee and his allies Lieutenant-Colonel H. W. Johnson and E. G. Mandeville Roe, although the female leadership turned the proposal down due to objections over serving under Mosley. Indeed, the British Fascists had protested against public meetings being addressed by Mosley as early as 1927, when they denounced the then Labour MP as a dangerous socialist. As a consequence Hawkins broke away and took much of the male membership of the BF with him; soon afterward, the New Party became the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Relations with the BUF were as a result frosty for the remainder of the group's life, and although Mosley dismissed the BF as \\"three old ladies and a couple of office boys\\", in 1933 a BUF fighting squad wrecked the BF's London offices after British Fascists members had heckled the BUF headquarters. By this stage the BF membership had plummeted, with only a hardcore of members left. Various schemes were floated in an attempt to reinvigorate the movement, although none succeeded. Archibald Whitmore announced a plan to turn the British Fascists into an Ulster loyalist group and successor to the Ulster Volunteers, although after claiming that he was preparing to begin recruitment in Northern Ireland, nothing came of this. The scheme had been led by Mrs D. G. Harnett, a close friend of Lintorn-Orman, who hoped the BF could profit from the emergence of prominent Irish republican √âamon de Valera as President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State but the plan was scuppered when the policies of the Irish Free State towards Northern Ireland largely remained the same under de Valera. A small group did exist in the Irish Free State, claiming to have a thousand members, although in fact having no more than 25 active in Dublin under H. R. Ledbeater. Favouring reunification with the UK, the group was involved in sending anti-Semitic leaflets to prominent Jews such as Robert Briscoe. It sought a merger with the right-wing Army Comrades Association, but this was rejected by Eoin O'Duffy due to its pro- British stance.John M. Regan, The Irish Counter-Revolution 1921-1936, Gill & Macmillan, 1999, pp. 334-335 Plans for a merger with the IFL did not get off the ground and plans for a merger with Graham Seton Hutchison's National Workers Party were also abandoned when it became clear that, far from having the 20,000 members in Mansfield alone that Seton Hutchison claimed, the party was little more than a one-man show. In a bid to reverse its decline the party adopted a strongly anti-semitic platform. Thurlow notes: \\"it was noticeable that the BF became increasingly anti-semitic in its death throes.\\" In 1933 Lord and Lady Downe, as representatives of the British Fascists, entertained Nazi German envoy Gunther Schmidt-Lorenzen at their country estate and suggested to him that the Nazis should avoid any links with Mosley, whom Lady Downe accused of being in the pay of Jewish figures such as Baron Rothschild and Sir Philip Sassoon. Fellow member Madame Arnaud repeated similar allegations about Mosley to another German official, Dr Margarete Gartner of the Economic Policy Association. However, by this stage Lintorn-Orman's mother had cut her off financially after hearing lurid tales of debauchery involving the female fascist leader, and so the group fell into debt until being declared bankrupt in 1934 when a Colonel Wilson called in a ¬£500 loan. This effectively brought the British Fascists to a conclusion; Rotha Lintorn-Orman died the following year.

K√§the Schirmacher (Danzig, 6 August 1865 - Meran, 18 November, 1930) was a German writer, journalist, and political activist who was considered to be one of the leading advocates for women's rights and the international women's movement in the 1890s. Life K√§the Schirmacher was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, but her family fortune was lost in the 1870s early on in her life. Schirmacher was one of the first women in Germany to earn a doctorate, studying at the Sorbonne and from Autumn of 1893 to the Spring of 1895 in Germany and earning her doctorate in Romance studies in Z√ºrich under Heinrich Morf. Something that was unknown to the public was her homosexuality. Over the course of her life Schirmacher would have multiple partners, but her time in Zurich was spent with Margarethe B√∂hm. In 1899, Schirmacher was one of the principal founders of the Association for Progressive Women's Organizations in Berlin. In 1904 she was also involved with the International Alliance of Women. During this period of time between the 1890s and the early 1900s, Schirmacher travelled around Europe and the United States and have lectures on German culture and women's issues. One of the things that Schirmacher wrote and lectured about was the idea of the \\"modern woman.\\" In both her lectures and her personal writing, she expressed the necessary traits to be a modern woman; they are highlighted in Die moderne Frauenbewegung (The Modern Woman's Rights Movement, 1909). The first was for in education and instruction, women should enjoy the same opportunities as men. The second dictated that in the field of labour, women should have the freedom to choose any occupation and to be compensated equally as any man. The third was that women should be given full legal status before the law and full civil ability. The fourth was in the social field: recognition of the value of women's work, whether in the home or in professional circles. They were extreme views for her time, but in 1904, Schirmacher pivoted to more extreme circles of political ideology and began expressing nationalist sentiments. It was the same year that Schirmacher began to break her ties with the leftist groups that she had founded, led and organised. In 1913, with the prospect of war and the wave of nationalism that was hitting Western Europe, Schirmacher broke her ties completely with the women's organisations. At the outbreak of the World War I, Schirmacher was involved in the writing and publishing of German propaganda, mostly in the form of pamphlets, which were distributed across Germany and France. After the war, she was involved with the right-wing German National People's Party (DNVP). She shared their nationalist and anti-Semitic views. Published works * The Libertad.

However, at the insistence of the rest of the Presidium, he ceded control over the party apparatus in exchange for remaining Premier and first among equals within the collective leadership. He then became embroiled in a power struggle with Nikita Khrushchev that culminated in his removal from the premiership in 1955 as well as the Presidium in 1957. Throughout his political career, Malenkov's personal connections with Vladimir Lenin significantly facilitated his ascent within the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union. By 1925, he was entrusted with overseeing the party's records. This brought him into contact with Stalin who had by then successfully consolidated power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to become the de facto leader of the Soviet Union. As a result of this association, Malenkov became heavily involved in Stalin's purges before later being given sole responsibility over the Soviet missile program during World War II. From 1946 to 1947, he chaired the . In order to secure his position as Stalin's favorite, he successfully discredited Marshal Georgy Zhukov and suppressed all glory associated with Leningrad during World War II so that Moscow maintained its image as the Soviet Union's sole cultural and political capital. Following Stalin's death on 5 March 1953, Malenkov temporarily emerged as the Soviet leader's undisputed successor by replacing him as both Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier) and head of the party apparatus. However, only 9 days later, the Politburo (then known as the Presidium) forced him to give up the latter position while letting him retain the premiership. Henceforth, Malenkov served as the Presidium‚Äôs highest-ranking member and acting chairman until being eclipsed in early 1954 by the party's First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev. By 1955, he was also forced to resign as Premier. After later organizing a failed coup against Khrushchev in 1957, Malenkov was expelled from the Presidium and exiled to Kazakhstan in 1957, before ultimately being expelled from the Party altogether in November 1961. He officially retired from politics shortly afterwards. After a short sojourn in Kazakhstan, he returned to Moscow and kept a low profile for the remainder of his life. Early life Malenkov was born at Orenburg in the Russian Empire. His paternal ancestors immigrated during the 18th century from the area of Ohrid in the Ottoman Rumelia Eyalet, (present day North Macedonia). Some of them served as officers in the Russian Imperial Army. His father was a wealthy farmer in Orenburg province. Young Malenkov occasionally helped his father to do business selling the harvest. His mother was the daughter of a blacksmith and the granddaughter of an Orthodox priest. Malenkov graduated from Orenburg gymnasium just a few months prior to the Russian revolution of 1917 and joined the Red Army as a volunteer in 1918, fighting alongside the Communists against White Russian forces in the Civil War. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1920 and worked as a political commissar on a propaganda train in Turkestan during the Civil War. Cohabitation In 1920, in Turkestan, Malenkov started living together with Valeria Golubtsova, daughter of Aleksei Golubtsov, former State Councilor of the Russian Empire in Nizhny Novgorod and dean of the Imperial Cadet School. Golubtsova and Malenkov never officially registered their union and remained unregistered partners for the rest of their lives. Golubtsova joined the Soviet Communist Party in 1920; her personal views were described as anti-semitic by her co-workers. She had a direct connection to Vladimir Lenin through her mother ‚Äî one of the \\"Nevzorov sisters\\" who were apprentices of Lenin and studied together with him for years, long before the Revolution. This connection helped both Golubtsova and Malenkov in their communist career. Later Golubtsova was the director of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, a center for nuclear power research in USSR.Bazhanov, Boris (1980). Stalin's secretary memoirs. Paris, 1980. Career in the Communist Party After the Russian civil war, Malenkov quickly built himself a reputation of a tough communist Bolshevik. He was promoted in the Communist party ranks and was appointed Communist secretary at the military- based Moscow Higher Technical School in the 1920s. Russian sources state that, rather than continuing with his studies, Malenkov took a career of a Soviet politician ‚Äì his university degree was never completed, and his records have been indefinitely classified. Around this time, Malenkov forged a close friendship with Vyacheslav Malyshev, who later became chief of the Soviet nuclear program alongside Igor Kurchatov. In 1924, Stalin noticed Malenkov and assigned him to Orgburo of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. In 1925, Malenkov worked in the staff of the Organizational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee of the CPSU. Malenkov was in charge of keeping records on the members of the Soviet communist party ‚Äì two million files were made under his supervision during the next ten years. In this work Malenkov became closely associated with Stalin and was later heavily involved in the treason trials during the purging of the party. In 1938, he was one of the key figures in bringing about the downfall of Yezhov, the head of the NKVD. In 1939, Malenkov became the head of the Communist party's Cadres Directorate, which gave him control over personnel matters of party bureaucracy. During the same year, he also became a member and a Secretary of the Central Committee and rose from his previous staff position to full member of the Orgburo. In February 1941, Malenkov became a candidate member of the Politburo. Career during World War II After the German invasion of June 1941, Malenkov was promoted to the State Defense Committee (SDC), along with NKVD chief Beria, Voroshilov and Molotov with Stalin as the committee's head. This small group held total control over all political and economic life in the country and Malenkov's membership thus made him one of the top five most powerful men in the Soviet Union during World War II. Between 1941 and 1943, Malenkov's primary responsibility in the SDC was supervising military aircraft production as well as supervising the development of nuclear weapons. In 1943, he also became chairman of a committee that oversaw the post-war economic rehabilitation of some liberated areas with the exception of Leningrad. Building Soviet nuclear missiles and rocket launch sites Stalin gave Malenkov the task of building nuclear missiles in collaboration with Beria. Malenkov was appointed Chief of the Soviet Missile program, his first deputy was Dmitri Ustinov, a 33-year-old rocket scientist who later became one of the most powerful Soviet Defense Ministers. During World War II, Malenkov, Ustinov and Mikhail Khrunichev started the Soviet missile and rocket program that soon absorbed the German missile industry. Malenkov supervised the takeover of German V2 missile industry that was moved from Peenem√ºnde to Moscow for further development that resulted in building Vostok missiles and orbiting Sputnik a few years later. At the same time, Malenkov followed Stalin's orders of building several space centers, such as Kapustin Yar near the Volga river and Khrunichev missile center in Moscow. Malenkov's main role was supervising the top staff. He took a keen interest in recruiting the most talented young engineers and scientists produced by the university system. Instead of cross- examining candidates for their loyalty to the theoretical ideology of communism, Malenkov looked for team members with strong technical skills who could invent, improve and manufacture munitions most quickly and efficiently. He downplayed the role of the omnipresent commissars who understood little technology but were charged with ideological purification. The long-run lesson was that economic growth was the nation's highest priority. Defeating Zhdanovshchina \\"Zhdanovshchina\\" was the emphasis on purified communist ideology developed during the Second World War by Andrei Zhdanov. It emerged from Zhdanov's debates inside the party hierarchy opposing Malenkov's pragmatist faction. Malenkov stressed the universal values of science and engineering, and proposed to promote the technological experts to the highest positions in the Soviet administrative elite. Zhdanov's faction said proper ideology trumped science and called for prioritizing political education and ideological purity. However the technocrats had proven amazingly successful during the war in terms of engineering, industrial production, and the development of advanced munitions. Zhdanov's sought to use the ideological purification of the party as a vehicle to restore the Kremlin's political control over the provinces and the technocrats. He worried that the provincial party bosses and the heads of the economic ministries had achieved too a high degree of autonomy during the war, when the top leadership realized the urgent need for maximum mobilization of human and material resources. The highest priority in the postwar era was physical reconstruction after the massive wartime destruction. The same argument that strengthened the technocrats continue to operate, and the united opposition of Malenkov, the technocrats, the provincial party bosses, and the key ministries doomed Zhdanov's proposals. He therefore pivoted to devote Zhdanovshchina to purification of the arts and culture. Attack on Georgy Zhukov Georgy Zhukov was the most prominent Soviet military commander during World War II, winning several critical battles, such as the Siege of Leningrad, the Battle of Stalingrad, and Battle of Berlin. Stalin, Beria and Malenkov grew suspicious of Zhukov, worrying he possessed capitalistic tendencies, because Zhukov established a friendship with General Dwight D. Eisenhower, invited the future American president to Leningrad and Moscow, and endorsed collaboration between the United States and the Soviet Union. At the conclusion of World War II and shortly thereafter, Malenkov sided against several who were considered Soviet war heroes, among them Zhukov, Rokossovsky and several other popular generals. Malenkov's accusations against Zhukov were mostly based upon allegations of counter-revolutionary behavior and selfish \\"Bonapartism\\". Soon Zhukov was demoted in rank and moved to a lower position in Odessa where his only foes were local Party forces. Zhukov had his first heart attack not long after, and Malenkov's concerns about him had largely faded. After the ruthless attack on Zhukov, Malenkov gained strength and became closer to Stalin and several other top communists. In 1946, Malenkov was named a candidate member of the Politburo. Although temporarily trailing behind his rivals Andrei Zhdanov and Lavrentiy Beria, he soon came back into Stalin's favor, especially after Zhdanov's mysterious death in 1948. That same year, Malenkov became a Secretary of the Central Committee. Executions of competitors and Leningrad affair Time magazine cover, 23 March 1953|alt= During the late 1940s and early 1950s Malenkov gained more favor with Stalin than any other top Soviet communist. Malenkov's main competition were the leaders of Leningrad whose glory had been earned in resistance to Hitler's attacks during World War II. After the Siege of Leningrad the Mayor Kuznetsov and his deputies earned much fame and support all over the USSR. Malenkov followed Stalin's policy of suppressing that glory in order to maintain Moscow's image as the USSR's only center of power. In 1949, Malenkov personally came to Leningrad leading a regiment of armed men from Moscow MGB special forces and swiftly removed and arrested the city leaders. After a series of secret trials, 23 men, including the Mayor and deputies, were executed and buried in an unmarked pit on the outskirts of the city. At the same time, over two thousand top managers and intellectuals were uprooted and exiled from Leningrad to Siberia, their property was confiscated, and their positions were filled by communists loyal to Stalin. During the same years, Malenkov also exterminated the Jewish Anti- Fascist Committee. Many members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee were killed in the Night of the Murdered Poets. On August 12, 1952, thirteen Jewish writers were executed by gunshots in the basement of Lubyanka Prison. The antisemitic pogrom was approved by Stalin and supervised by Malenkov. Malenkov's loyalty to Stalin was proven by executions of political competition and the Leningrad affair and catapulted Malenkov to become the only successor of Stalin. 1952 and 1953 Time magazine covers indicate that Malenkov was generally considered to be Stalin's apprentice and successor.Time magazine 1952, 1953 cover and editorials. Premiership and duumvirate Malenkov among Soviet leadership speaking with Konrad Adenauer in 1955 Malenkov's ambitions and crafty politics bore fruit upon Stalin's death on 5 March 1953. Four days later Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria and Nikita Khrushchev gave the eulogy at Stalin's funeral. On 6 March, the day after Stalin died, Malenkov succeeded him as Premier of the Soviet Union. His name was also listed first on the newly named Presidium of the Central Committee (as the Politburo had been called since 1952). Although there had been no title identifying the leader of the party for almost a year, this indicated that Malenkov had succeeded Stalin as party leader as well. (fee for article) On 7 March, Malenkov's name appeared atop the list of secretaries of the Secretariat, confirming that he had succeeded Stalin as the most powerful man in the Soviet Union. However, after only a week, Malenkov was forced to resign from the Secretariat. The new leadership wanted to prevent too much power from being concentrated in one pair of hands. For all intents and purposes, Khrushchev replaced him as party leader; Khrushchev's name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries on 14 March, though he was not formally named First Secretary of the CPSU until September 1953. Malenkov remained as premier, beginning a period of a Malenkov-Khrushchev duumvirate. Malenkov retained the office of premier for two years. During this time his political activities were mixed with a power struggle within the Kremlin. Although he remained a staunch Stalinist, Malenkov expressed his opposition to research and development of nuclear armament, and inaugurated an international peace campaign against the use of nuclear weapons in 1953, declaring \\"a new world war... with modern weapons means the end of world civilization.\\" In debates on diplomacy, he always took the peaceful line. On economic issues, Malenkov advocated refocusing the economy on the production of consumer goods at the expense of heavy industry, with the goal of elevating the standards of living in the Soviet Union. Malenkov also advocated for an agriculture policy that included tax cuts for peasants, increase in the price paid to the Kolkhozes by the state for grains, and incentives for peasants to cultivate their private plots. These policies were put in place during Malenkov's premiership and duumvirate, but did not meet their objectives and were very expensive, which led Malenkov's influence to decline. Malenkov opposed promotions of younger generations of politicians which also led to his decline. Downfall and final years Malenkov in 1964 Malenkov was forced to resign in February 1955 after he came under attack for abuse of power and his close connection to Beria (who had been executed as a traitor in December 1953). He was held responsible for the slow pace of reforms, particularly when it came to rehabilitating and freeing political prisoners (in comparison, Khrushchev made at least considerable efforts in this endeavor). His economic program of prioritizing light industry was subsequently abandoned in favor of increasing investments into heavy industry in the 1955 federal budget. For two more years, Malenkov remained a regular member of the Presidium. Together with Khrushchev, he flew to the island of Brioni (Yugoslavia) on the night of 1‚Äì2 November 1956 to inform Josip Broz Tito of the impending Soviet invasion of Hungary scheduled for 4 November.Johanna Granville (1995) \\"Soviet Documents on the Hungarian Revolution, 24 October ‚Äì 4 November 1956\\", Cold War International History Project Bulletin, no. 5 (Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, Washington, DC), Spring, pp. 22‚Äì23, 29‚Äì34. However, in 1957, Malenkov organized an attempt at a coup against Khrushchev. In a dramatic standoff in the Kremlin, both Khrushchev and Georgy Zhukov (who had the backing of the Soviet Army) turned against Malenkov. Malenkov's attempt failed and he, together with two other prominent co-conspirators, Vyacheslav Molotov and Lazar Kaganovich, who were characterized by Khrushchev at an extraordinary session of the Party Central Committee as the \\"Anti-Party Group\\", were swiftly dismissed from the Politburo. In 1961, Malenkov was expelled from the Communist Party and exiled to a remote province of the Soviet Union. He became a manager of a hydroelectric plant in Ust'-Kamenogorsk in Kazakhstan.RUSSIA: The Quick & the Dead. TIME (22 July 1957). Retrieved on 22 April 2011. After his exile and eventual expulsion from the Party, Malenkov fell into obscurity and suffered from depression due to loss of power and the quality of life in a poor province. However, some researchers say that later Malenkov found this demotion and dismissal a relief from the pressures of the Kremlin power struggle throughout the 1950s. Malenkov in his later years converted to Russian Orthodoxy, as did his daughter, who has since spent part of her personal wealth building two churches in rural locations. Orthodox Church publications at the time of Malenkov's death said he had been a reader (the lowest level of Russian Orthodox clergy) and a choir singer in his final years. He died on 14 January 1988 at age 86. Personal life In 1920, Malenkov married Soviet scientist Valeriya Golubtsova (15 May 1901 ‚Äì 1 October 1987).http://ru.rodovid.org/wk/–ó–∞–ø–∏—Å—å:738267 They had two sons and one daughter.

In 1954, a delegation of the British Labour Party (including former Prime Minister Clement Attlee and former Secretary of State for Health Aneurin Bevan) was in Moscow. Sir William Goodenough Hayter, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, asked for a meeting with Nikita Khrushchev, then General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.OBITUARIES Sir William Hayter ‚Äì People, News. The Independent. 30 March 1999. Much to Hayter's surprise, not only did Khrushchev accept the proposal, but he decided to attend in the company of Vyacheslav Molotov, Anastas Mikoyan, Andrey Vyshinsky, Nikolay Shvernik, and Malenkov. Such was the interest aroused in British political circles by this event that Sir Winston Churchill subsequently invited Sir William Hayter down to Chartwell so as to provide a full account of what had transpired at the meeting. Malenkov seemed \\"easily the most intelligent and quickest to grasp what was being said\\" and said \\"no more than he wanted to say\\". He was considered an \\"extremely agreeable neighbour at the table\\" and was thought to have had a \\"pleasant, musical voice and spoke well-educated Russian\\". Malenkov even recommended, quietly, that British diplomatic translator Cecil Parrott should read the novels of Leonid Andreyev, an author whose literature was at that time labeled as decadent in the USSR. Nikita Khrushchev, by contrast, struck Hayter as being \\"rumbustious, impetuous, loquacious, free-wheeling, and alarmingly ignorant of foreign affairs\\". Hayter thought that Khrushchev seemed \\"incapable of grasping Bevan's line of thought\\", and that Malenkov had to explain matters to him in \\"words of one syllable\\". Convinced that Malenkov was in charge, nobody in the British delegation felt much inclined to expend effort with Khrushchev. Malenkov \\"spoke the best Russian of any Soviet leader I have heard\\", his \\"speeches were well constructed and logical in their development\\", and he seemed \\"a man with a more Western-oriented mind.\\" Portrayals Jeffrey Tambor played Malenkov in the 2017 satirical film The Death of Stalin, in which Malenkov is portrayed as naive and slow, contrary to reports of British diplomats.

In turn, the music of Charleston has had an influence on that of the rest of the country. The geechee dances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in Charleston followed a rhythm that inspired Eubie Blake's \\"Charleston Rag\\" and soon later James P. Johnson's \\"The Charleston\\", as well as the dance craze that defined a nation in the 1920s. \\"Ballin' the Jack\\", which was the popular dance in the years before \\"The Charleston\\", was written by native Charlestonian Chris Smith. Jazz Charleston is a very important city when it comes to deciphering the history of jazz music, America's greatest art form. Charleston, SC is one of the early \\"incubators\\" of jazz, along with other southern cities such as New Orleans. Author and historian Jack McCray explains, > The beginnings of jazz music on the southeastern coast of the United States > was centered in Charleston, South Carolina, one of only a handful of places > in the Western Hemisphere where Africa interacted with Europe in a seminal > way to produce New World culture. ...

The Jenkins Orphanage The Jenkins Orphanage was established in 1891 by Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston, South Carolina. Jenkins was a businessman and Baptist minister who encountered street children and decided to organize an orphanage for young African Americans. The orphanage took in donations of musical instruments and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music. Upon its establishment, it became the only black instrumental group organized in South Carolina. Eventually the orphanage garnered such a reputation that some parents sent their children there to study music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on a variety of instruments and were able to read music expertly. These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. The children were not taught jazz, but often performed rags and ragtime versions of popular marches, introducing the distinctive swing to the music. Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band's success. At the Colored Waif's Home Brass Band in New Orleans, Louisiana, for example, a young trumpeter named Louis Armstrong first began to draw attention. The Jenkins Orphanage Band, wearing discarded Citadel uniforms, performed throughout the United States and even toured England raising money for the support of the orphanage. It played in the inaugural parades of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft. It appeared at the St. Louis Exposition and the Anglo-American Exposition in 1914. It toured the United States from coast to coast, and played in Paris, Berlin, Rome, London, and Vienna. As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The band ceased to exist in the 1980s.Edgar, Walter. South Carolina Encyclopedia (2006) pp. 590-591, William \\"Cat\\" Anderson, Jabbo Smith and Freddie Green are but a few of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who became professional musicians in some of the best bands of the day. The Jenkins Orphanage Band also played on Broadway for the play Porgy by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, a stage version of the novel by Dubose Heyward of the same title. The story was based in Charleston, South Carolina and featured the Gullah Community. The Heywards insisted on an African American cast for their play and hired the real Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage. Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated with George and Ira Gershwin to turn his novel in to the now famous opera, Porgy and Bess. George Gershwin spent the summer of 1934 at Folly Beach outside of Charleston writing the \\"folk opera.\\" Porgy and Bess is considered the Great American Opera and is widely performed. Charleston's influence on the music of Porgy and Bess and therefore the American opera tradition is undeniable. Notable Musicians in Charleston Charles Theodore Pachelbel was a resident of Charleston in the Colonial Era. Charles, the son of the more famous Johann Pachelbel, composer of the popular Canon in D, was an important musical figure in early Charleston and was one of the first European composers to take up residence in the American colonies.http://www.voxnovus.com/resources/American_Composer_Timeline.htm American Composer Timeline Pachelbel became the organist of St. Philip's Church in 1740 and lived in Charleston for the rest of his life.http://www.allmusic.com/artist/charles-theodore-pachelbel- mn0002162590|accessdate=February 19, 2013 Another notable musician born in Charleston is country music and R&B; star Darius Rucker, well known as the lead singer of Hootie & The Blowfish. Today Today, organizations such as Jazz Artists of Charleston and the Charleston Jazz Initiative work to document, preserve and promote Charleston's unique and largely unknown jazz history, as well as its legacy. The Charleston Jazz Orchestra is a big band that does just this by presenting concerts of standard South Carolina jazz as well as new works. To this day Charleston maintains a vibrant and diverse jazz scene and is home to many musicians in all genres. As it has always been, Charleston remains a melting pot of musical styles and influences.

History  Streatlam Tower, 5 Princes Road As a young man, Bowes attended the Liverpool Collegiate Institution, a short distance from his home in the Islington area of Liverpool. Upon leaving college, he worked for nearly seven years in a merchant's office gaining useful experience in general merchandising, including the city's well-established cotton trade.The Japanese Consul,p10.(Family Archive) When he was 22, he joined his brother John who had just set up on his own account as a wool broker. The business prospered and in January 1859 he was made a full partner in the firm of John L. Bowes & Brother, Wool Brokers. In that same year, the business moved to the newly erected Queens Insurance Building in 11 Dale Street and the Bowes family moved house to the more up-market Canning Street. James also travelled to America that year in search of new business opportunities, the first of many overseas trips he was to make in the decades that followed.The Japanese Consul, p18. (Family archive) In 1867 James Lord Bowes moved to Streatlam Cottage, set in its own grounds adjacent to Strawberry Field in Beaconsfield Road, in semi- rural Woolton, some six miles south of Liverpool city centre.Gore's Directory of Liverpool, 1867, Also The Japanese Consul,p23 In 1871 he married Charlotte Vickery Adam, daughter of Mary Adam (n√©e De Bels)(1809-1898) and William Adam (1804-1867) formerly of Lisbon, Portugal. The Adam family were established importers of oranges and soft fruit based in London and Liverpool, William being the manager of their estates in Portugal. Charlotte's brother John Isabel Adam (1857-1919) was also a Wool Broker and worked for John L. Bowes and Brother.

James Lord Bowes immersed himself in the commercial and artistic life of Liverpool ‚Äì he was several times both Vice President of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and President of the Liverpool Art Club. In 1872 he commissioned the building of the imposing Streatlam Tower, 5 Princes Road, Liverpool by architect George Ashdown Audsley, with whom he shared a passion for Japanese art, particularly ceramics. From circa 1867 he had collected Japanese art works of all kinds and organised an exhibition of them in the Liverpool Art Club. Arising from this event he co- authored the Descriptive Catalogue of Japanese Lacquer ware of the Bowes Collection. 1875, and The Keramic Art of Japan. London: Sotheran & Co. 1875, 1881, both with Audsley.

Beginning his academic career at Oxford he specialized in physical chemistry. During the Second World War, he was the director of the Tube Alloys project, a clandestine programme aiming to research and develop British atomic weapons capabilities, from 1941 to 1945. After the war he was director of research at Imperial Chemical Industries. He also served as a member of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and the committee that drew up the organisation of what became the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. He died in 1954 at the age of 66. Biography Wallace Alan Akers was born in Walthamstow, England, the second child of an accountant, Charles Akers, and his wife, Mary Ethelreda Brown. He was educated at Lake House School in Bexhill-on-Sea, Essex, and Aldenham School in Hertfordshire. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, where he specialised in physical chemistry, graduating with first class honours in 1909. After university, he joined Brunner Mond & Company in Winnington, Cheshire, as a researcher. In 1924 he joined the Borneo Company, where he served as its general manager in the Far East. He returned to England in 1928, to join Imperial Chemical Industries, into which Brunner Mond had earlier merged. In 1931 he became the chairman of the Billingham division of ICI. This was mainly concerned with the manufacture of ammonia using hydrogen under high pressure, ammonia being one of the company's most profitable products at the time. Between 1933 and 1936 he was involved in a project to produce synthetic petrol from the hydrogenation of coal. ICI executives envisaged competing with oil companies. It became clear that the process would not be competitive, but since it had defence implications, he sought government subsidies. In this he was opposed by Sir John Anderson, the permanent secretary at the Home Office. The change of government following the October 1931 general election brought with it a change in policy, and he was able to secure some financial relief. A reorganisation of ICI in 1937 ended Akers' chairmanship of the Billingham division, and he was posted to ICI headquarters, where he worked closely with Holbrook Gaskell. At this time, Britain was starting to re-arm. Munitions contracts had begun to roll in, and ICI expanded its production capacity. He became executive manager in 1939. During 1941 Akers was recruited by the British war-time government as director of the Tube Alloys project, a clandestine programme aiming to research and develop British atomic weapons capabilities. This helped galvanize both Britain and America to proceed down a path which led to the Manhattan Project, and ultimately the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Official Historian Margaret Gowing noted that \\"No doubt Akers had been picked for his personality and drive that had been considered so important and which he possessed in abundance\\". Akers' ICI background led to difficulties when it came to dealing with the American Manhattan Project. American officials such as Vannevar Bush, James Conant and Leslie Groves saw him as \\"an Imperial Chemical Industries man at heart\\", and he aroused American suspicions that British interest in atomic energy was with its commercial possibilities after the war. As a result, James Chadwick was appointed the head of the British mission to the Manhattan Project, but Akers remained director of Tube Alloys until the end of the war. In 1946, Akers returned to the Board of ICI where he served as director of research until April 1953, when he retired, having reached the compulsory retirement age of 65. He established university research fellowships, and donated money to university laboratories for research purposes. In 1946, he established the Butterwick Research Laboratories to carry out fundamental research, unrelated to commercial objectives. They were later renamed the Akers Research Laboratories in his honour. Akers was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1944, and was knighted in 1946, both for his services to the war effort. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1953, and received honorary degrees of D.Sc. from Durham University and D.C.L. from Oxford University. After his retirement, he remained a member of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and was part of the three-man April 1953 committee that drew up the organisation of what became the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. He was a member of the National Gallery's scientific advisory committee, later becoming a trustee, and was the treasurer of the Chemical Society from 1948 to 1954. He married Bernadette Marie La Marre in 1953, and died at their home in Alton, Hampshire, on 1 November 1954.

Hackett is also known as one of the stars of Huffington Post's reality series, 'The New Activists' also appearing in MTV's Geordie OG's series one. Hackett's debut book 'FEARLESS' was published by Scholastic in 2020. Hackett is a regular contributor towards the global conversation surrounding technology and bullying and has advised the British, European and American Governments and speaks often at the United Nations in addition to writing for the United Nations about technological progression and challenges. In 2017 he became the youngest person to receive an honorary degree from the University of Sussex. Early life Hackett grew up in St Helens, United Kingdom and experienced both physical and emotional bullying at school. In the last few years at his secondary school, he was physically assaulted outside of school, causing him to be hospitalised. Hackett has said in some interviews that the bullying he experienced was homophobic. Hackett first came out as bisexual and, in his college years, he came out as gay. After college Hackett moved to Brighton to study business and management at the University of Sussex. He graduated in 2012 and has since been made notable alumnus. Founding of Ditch the Label = Infancy = After years of being told to 'ignore' those that were bullying him and failing to find adequate support elsewhere, Hackett took to the internet to post about his experiences of being bullied. He talked openly about the extreme verbal and physical bullying he had experienced, including his hospitalisation after a homophobic attack by a group of people from school. The online community rapidly expanded - soon thousands of people were seeking help, advice and comfort in the forum - the movement became so large, that in 2006 Hackett launched a specific MySpace profile to host the conversations that were taking place online and named it ‚ÄòDitch the Label‚Äô. Despite his young age, Hackett recognised the potential of Ditch the Label - the positive impact it could have upon young people and society at large. With drive and determination to help those who were in need, he approached the local Chamber of Commerce in 2007. Aged 16, he became the first person below the age of 18 to receive a grant in his local area to develop a Ditch the Label website - an online hub dedicated to helping and supporting those that had been impacted by bullying - prior to its inception, this had not existed elsewhere on the web. = Official Registration = Ditch the Label continued to grow in momentum behind the scenes as Hackett simultaneously studied for his degree at the University of Sussex. In 2012, he graduated with a degree in business and management and immediately registered Ditch the Label as a legal entity and began to formally develop the organisation. As a new graduate without financial aid or backing, he sold his personal possessions to fund the organisation, such was his belief and commitment to spreading awareness, campaigning for equality and helping those in need. He would continue to work without a wage, funding Ditch the Label out of his own pocket for the next three to four years. In March 2014, Ditch the Label was officially recognised and registered as a charity in the UK. = Expansion to USA and Mexico (2016) = In 2016 Ditch the Label announced their international expansion into the United States of America as \\"Ditch the Label\\" and as \\"Deja Las Etiquetas\\" in Mexico. Shortly after, Ditch the Label gained 501(c)(3) status in the US and then opened their office in Los Angeles. Hackett splits his time between both offices.  Controversies = Toxic masculinity and Lewis Hamilton = In 2017, Hackett publicly called out Hamilton for 'shaming his nephew' in response to a Tweet that Hamilton posted with a video of his nephew wearing a dress. As a result, there was a backlash launched against Hamilton and in response he removed the video and issued an apology. = Body fascism and Kim Kardashian = Hackett publicly called out Kardashian in response to her promotion of 'appetite suppressant lollipops', touting the impact that such promotion can have on the rates of eating disorders, Hackett called on the removal of the photo. The image was removed without apology. = Accessibility at Brighton Pride = In 2019, Hackett publicly called out Brighton Pride for their alleged discrimination against pride-goers with a disability after his relatives were confined to a 'disability tent' with no view of the stage. A backlash ensued with thousands turning to Twitter, with many sharing their own experiences and some calling for a complete boycott.

In one of his first interviews, Liam spoke on The Surgery with Alex for BBC Radio 1 about his own personal experiences of bullying \\\\- as an ambassador for equality, Hackett understands the importance of sharing his own personal story and journey - providing a role model and tangible success story for young people experiencing prejudice to look up to. He has also commented on how bullying can affect children from wealthy families for articles in The Daily Telegraph and The Independent. On July 2014, Hackett gave an exclusive insight into his experiences with homophobic bullying and his coming out story to Gay Star News Hackett spoke on Sky News about the sudden rise in cases of cyberbullying, he later debated the issues on Channel 5 News, where he frequently discusses bullying and the lives of young people. Following a major new Ditch the Label research report Hackett gave advice to young people via Sky News on how to overcome cyberbullying. He also spoke about the report on Good Morning Britain and urged key stakeholders to take action. Hackett has contributed articles about the current climate of bullying within the UK's education system for SecEd Magazine and the British Journal of School Nursing. In October 2013, Hackett was interviewed on Chinese state television broadcaster CCTV discussing issues surrounding cyberbullying.

At first a supporter of \\"true socialism\\", Weydemeyer became in 1845‚Äì1846 a follower of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and a member of the League of Communists, heading its Frankfurt chapter from 1849 to 1851. He visited Marx in Brussels, staying there for a time to attend Marx's lectures. He participated in the 1848 Revolution. He was one of the \\"responsible editors\\" of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung from 1849 to 1850. He acted on Marx's behalf in the failed publication of the manuscript of The German Ideology.David McLellan, Karl Marx: His Life and Thought (New York: Harper & Row, 1973), pp. 143, 151, 167. Weydemeyer worked on two socialist periodicals which were the Westph√§lisches Dampfboot (\\"Westphalian Steamboat\\") and the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. In 1851, he emigrated from Germany to the United States and worked there as a journalist. The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, written by Marx, was published in 1852 in Die Revolution, a German-language monthly magazine in New York established by Weydemeyer.Marcello Musto, Another Marx: Early Manuscripts to the International, trans. Patrick Camiller (London: Bloomsbury, 2018), p. 71. Weydemeyer took part in the American Civil War as a lieutenant colonel in the Union Army. Biography Born in 1818, the same year as Karl Marx, Weydemeyer was the son of a Prussian civil servant residing in M√ºnster, Westphalia. Sent to a gymnasium and the Berlin military Academy, he received his commission as a Leutnant in the Prussian artillery (1. Westf√§lisches Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 7):de:1. Westf√§lisches Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 7 in 1838. At the beginning of his short career, he was stationed in the Westphalian town of Minden. He began to read the bourgeois radical and socialist newspaper Rheinische Zeitung, the Cologne paper Marx became editor and which was suppressed by Prussian censorship in 1843. But it inspired many soldiers in the Rhineland and Westphalia. In the Minden garrison, the paper inspired revolutionaries like Fritz Anneke, August Willich, Hermann Korff, and Friedrich von Beust, all of whom, like Weydemeyer, will become prominent Forty-Eighters and after that officers of the Union army in the Civil War. The leftist officers in Minden formed a circle in which Weydemeyer took part. He also went frequently to Cologne and took part to discussions of social problems with the journalists of the Rheinische Zeitung. In 1844, Weydemeyer resigned from the Prussian army. He then became assistant editor of the Trierische Zeitung, a paper which advocated the Phalansteries of Charles Fourier and the True Socialism of Karl Gruen. In 1845, he joined the Westphaelische Dampfboot after paying a visit to Marx, exiled in Paris. Marx, as well as Engels, were publishing in the Dampfboot. The paper was edited by Heinrich Otto L√ºning in Bielefeld and Paderborn. L√ºning's sister Luise became Weydemeyer's wife in 1845. =1848= After a second visit to Marx in Brussels in 1846, Weydemeyer went back to Germany to organize the Communist League in Cologne. This was the organization for which Marx and Engels wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1847. He continued to work on the Dampfboot. At the same time, he made a career as a construction engineer for the Cologne‚ÄìMinden Railroad, but he quit the job soon after the beginning in 1848 because the company ordered its employees to stay out of political demonstration. During the rest of the year, he was a full-time revolutionary journalist. In June 1848, he was invited to Darmstadt by the socialist publisher C. W. Leske to be co-editor with Heinrich Otto L√ºning of the Neue Deutsche Zeitung. Near to Frankfurt, where the German National Assembly was meeting at the time, the newspaper intended to be a link between the left-wing of the Assembly and the extra-parliamentary movement. But in 1849, the counter-revolution succeeded and the Prussian absolutism crushed the Frankfurt Parliament, the armed democracy in Baden and the Electorate of the Palatinate and all the democratic papers. Marx's Neue Rheinische Zeitung disappeared under the censorship and the Neue Deutsche Zeitung survived by moving from Darmstadt to Frankfurt in the spring of 1849. The paper would be finally banished in December 1850 by the senate of the city. Weydemeyer remained in the country for half a year, underground. In July 1851, with his wife and two children, he went to Switzerland, where he did not find a job. On July 27, he wrote to Marx that he had no alternative than migrating to the United States. In his answer to Weydemeyer, Marx recommend New York City for his settlement, a place where Weydemeyer could have the chance to create a German-speaking revolutionary paper. At the same time, it was, for Marx, the city where the migrants were less likely to be touched by the Far West adventures. Marx also remarked that the United States would be a difficult country for the development of socialism, the surplus of population, being drained off by the farms and the fast-growing prosperity of the country, the Germans being easily Americanized and forgetting of their homeland. Weydemeyer and his family sailed from Le Havre on September 29, 1851, and arrived in New York on November 7. =New York=A Marxist journalist Die Revolution In December 1851, Weydemeyer issues a paper, named Die Revolution, a German-language revolutionary paper, which purpose was to make picture of the class struggle in the Old World. The paper first appeared on January 6 but was suspended on January 13. In a letter to Marx at the end of January, he attributed his failure because of the corrupting effect on the people of the American soil. He also pointed out the dominance of the liberal bourgeois-nationalist ideology on the people, among them Gottfried Kinkel and Lajos Kossuth. German immigrants were simply not sensitive to Marx ideas and analyses of the defeat of the 1848 revolutions and of the triumph of European reaction. In spring 1852, Weydemeyer brought out Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte as a final number of Die Revolution, after arranging for serial publication of Engels The Peasant War in Germany in the New York Turn-Zeitung between January 1852 and February 1853. He began to write for the Turn-Zeitung about different political issues, as the American aversion of the proletarian dictatorship, the calling of liberal American groups for free election in Europe and their silence about the conditions of the workers, the political immaturity of forty-eighters who raised money in the United States to foment revolution in Europe. To sum up, he wrote many articles which counterposed Marxism to liberalism for the German immigrants. In the July number of Turn-Zeitung, he began a discussion of American labor issues and the free trade versus protection debate, where he took a traditional Marxist stand for the industrial development. In the Turn-Zeitung of September 1, Weydemeyer analyzed the relationship between Australian cotton and American slavery. The development of American monopoly on the world market, in his point of view, promotes the rise of national economical development rather than regional and the rise of national parties in American politics rather than regional. He saw the shift from an agricultural dominance over the industrial to an industrial dominance over the former. In the Turn-Zeitung of November 15, Weydemeyer wrote a review of the election campaign of 1852, pointing the absence of labor issues in the platforms of the Whig and Democratic parties. In December, in a two-part Political-Economic Survey, he attempted to project a platform for American labor. He stands for organizations of the workers on a large scale political as well as economical, and urged the workers to adopt internationalism. The foundation of the American Workers League With four of his friends, Weydemeyer formed a tiny organization, the first Marxist organization in the United States, formed in the summer of 1852. The group, called Proletarierbund, won the attention of German immigrants with the organization of a meeting on March 20, 1853, in New York, where eight hundred German Americans assembled in Mechanics Hall and founded the American Workers League. This was an organization of mixed union and party functions, and presented a program of immediate issues for the working class and the socialist goal at the same time. The program was for immediate naturalization of all immigrants who wished to gain American citizenship, it favored federal, rather than state, labor legislation, stood for guaranteed payment of wages to workers whose employers went bankrupt, assumption by government of all costs of litigation with free choice of counsel, reducing the working day to ten hours, banning labor for children under sixteen, compulsory education with government maintenance for children whose families were too poor, against all Sunday and temperance laws, for the formation of tuition-colleges and for state acquisition of existing private colleges, for keeping the national lands on the frontier inalienable, etc. Beside the immediate demands, the League's platform stated some revolutionary principles. The preamble charged the capitalists of the everyday worse situation of the workers, the need of an independent political party for the workers, \\"without respect to occupation, language, color or sex\\", and the task of overthrowing the capital leadership with it as a way to solve social and political problems. It also leaned on the American Constitution of the Founding Fathers. The American Workers League functioned for several years under a central committee made up of delegates from wards clubs and trade unions. Member of its committee, Weydemeyer tried to wide the influence of the League to non German Americans but the League served primarily as a German recreation and mutual aid society, in isolation from the English-speaking workers. When in the context of the Know-Nothing agitation, in 1855, the members began forming a secret military organization to defend themselves against nativist attacks, Weydemeyer withdrew from the League. He devoted himself to study the American Economy and to writing and lecturing of Marxists ideas. =American Civil War= As the country was moving toward a civil war, German Americans played an important part in the emergence of the Republican Party, so did Weydemeyer, who was one of the men who drew the German community toward the Republicans and the antislavery cause. Weydemeyer's stand for the Republicans was consistent with the influence of the most prominent labor radicals at the time, as Wilhelm Weitling. William Sylvis, leading native-born trade unionist, didn't engage in Republican politics, but showed approval for their platform in several commentaries published by Die Welt. The Republican Party gained also influence through the free-soil movement. According to his Marxist opinion against the parceling out of government lands to small farmers, Weydemeyer denounced the Homestead Act agitation in 1854 as contrary to the interest of the workers and was in favor of large-scale agriculture. But in the 1860s, together with other German Republicans, he urged the party to campaign for \\"immediate passage by Congress of a Homestead law by which the public lands of the Union may be secured for homesteads of the people, and secured from the greed of speculators.\\" Weydemeyer's backing of the free-soil movement and shift of position about that issue wasn't a stand for the free-soil movement as a social progress (as Hermann Kriege endorsement in this movement in 1845), but a question of tactic. Weydemeyer's support of the free-soil movement at that moment signified his support for the antislavery cause, the main issue at the time in his point of view. Shortly after dropping the American Workers League, Weydemeyer left New York and settled down in the Midwest, where he lived for four years, first in Milwaukee and then in Chicago, where he worked a journalist and also as a surveyor. He tried to establish in Chicago, another independent German labor paper, and contributed to the Illinois Staats- Zeitung, a famous German Republican daily of the Midwest. He took part in the Deutsches Haus conference of German-American societies in Chicago in May 1860 to influence the Republican convention's platform and candidates. Back in New York at the end of 1860, he found a job as a surveyor of Central Park and became active in the election campaign for Abraham Lincoln. Eight months later, he was in the army. Thanks to his background as a Prussian military officer and surveyor, he became a technical aide on the staff of General John C. Fr√©mont, the commander of the department of the West. He superintended the erection of ten forts around St. Louis. After Fr√©mont was removed from his command in November 1861, Weydemeyer was made a lieutenant colonel and given command of a Missouri volunteer artillery regiment which took the field against Confederate guerillas in southern Missouri in 1862. At the end of the year, he was hospitalized for a nervous disorder and transferred to garrison duty in St. Louis, which he left in September 1863. Politically active in Missouri, Weydemeyer was facing two main issues: the extension of emancipation to Missouri and the prevention of a split between the Lincoln and Fr√©mont faction of the Republican Party. Despite his own sympathy for the Fr√©mont straight position, he tried to conciliate the factions and keep safe the victory in the 1864 election and in the war. In September 1864, Weydemeyer joined the army as colonel of the 41st Missouri Volunteer Infantry charged with the defense of St. Louis. While doing his military duty, he distributed copies of the Inaugural Address of the International Workingmen's Association, exchanged letters with Engels on military and political issues, contributed to local papers, as the Daily St Louis Press where he wrote an editorial greeting the founding of the First International. In July 1865, he demobilized his regiment and left the Army. At the end of the war, he began to write regularly for the Westliche Post and the Neue Zeit, two St. Louis papers. He won the election as county auditor, holding his office from January 1, 1866 until his death. He worked for harsher tax laws and collecting unpaid taxes of men who used the war to become rich. The same day William S. Sylvis inaugurated the National Labor Union in Baltimore, Weydemeyer died of cholera in St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of 48.

Also, when used as an adjective, the term revolutionary refers to something that has a major, sudden impact on society or on some aspect of human endeavor. Definition The term‚Äîboth as a noun and adjective‚Äîis usually applied to the field of politics, and is occasionally used in the context of science, invention or art. In politics, a revolutionary is someone who supports abrupt, rapid, and drastic change, usually replacing the status quo, while a reformist is someone who supports more gradual and incremental change, often working within the system. In that sense, revolutionaries may be considered radical, while reformists are moderate by comparison. Moments which seem revolutionary on the surface may end up reinforcing established institutions. Likewise, evidently small changes may lead to revolutionary consequences in the long term. Thus the clarity of the distinction between revolution and reform is more conceptual than empirical. A conservative is someone who generally opposes such changes. A reactionary is someone who wants things to go back to the way they were before the change has happened. Though a reactionary may advocate a popular revolution as a means re establish older institutions (such as Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch), the term \\"revolutionary\\" is, in practice, rarely applied to figures on the political right. A revolution is also not the same as a coup d'etat: while a coup usually involves a small group of conspirators violently seizing control of government, a revolution implies mass participation and popular legitimacy. Again, the distinction is often clearer conceptually than empirically. Revolution and ideology According to sociologist James Chowning Davies, political revolutionaries may be classified in two ways: # According to the goals of the revolution they propose. Usually, these goals are part of a certain ideology. In theory, each ideology could generate its own brand of revolutionaries. In practice, most political revolutionaries have been either anarchists, communists, or socialists. # According to the methods they propose to use. This divides revolutionaries in two broad groups: Those who advocate a violent revolution, and those who are pacifists. The revolutionary anarchist Sergey Nechayev argued in Catechism of a Revolutionary: > \\"The revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no private interests, no affairs, > sentiments, ties, property nor even a name of his own. His entire being is > devoured by one purpose, one thought, one passion - the revolution. Heart > and soul, not merely by word but by deed, he has severed every link with the > social order and with the entire civilized world; with the laws, good > manners, conventions, and morality of that world. He is its merciless enemy > and continues to inhabit it with only one purpose - to destroy it.\\"Nechayev > , Spartacus Educational website by John SimkinSergey Nechayev (1869).

Revolutionaries provoke differences and violently ram together contradictions within a society, overthrowing the government through the rising to power of the class they represent. After destructing the old order, revolutionaries help build a new government that adheres to the emerging social relationships that have been made possible by the advanced productive forces.\\" Revolutionaries may be terrorists, but there is no necessary overlap. Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin condemned terrorism for \\"destroying contact between the revolutionaries and the masses of the revolutionary classes of the population, and spreading both among the revolutionaries themselves and the population in general utterly distorted ideas of the aims and methods of struggle against the autocracy.\\" In his controversial essay \\"Our Morals: The Ethics of Revolution\\", the Marxist political theorist Norman Geras posited that terrorism should be rejected, but that violence could be justified in the case of extreme social injustice.

The text is written in Greek minuscule letters, in two columns per page, 13 lines per page (according to the reconstruction). The left column is written in Greek, the right column is written in Arabic. The codex contains fragments of lessons, which were red for fifth and sixth Sundays.  History  Gregory and Scrivener dated the manuscript to the 12th century. It has been assigned by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research to the 12th century. It once belonged to the Tischendorf's collection. It was bought from Tischendorf's family for the university in 1876. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener (297e) and Caspar Ren√© Gregory (number 311e). It was examined by Fenton John Anthony Hort. Gregory saw it in 1883. The codex is housed at the Cambridge University Library (Add. Mss. 1879.13) in Cambridge. The fragment is not cited in critical editions of the Greek New Testament (UBS4, NA28).

Born in Shenyang, Li spent much of his early career in Guangdong province, most notably as mayor, then party secretary of Shenzhen. He was transferred to Hubei province in 2007; he would go on to serve as Governor and party secretary there. During his term in Hubei, Li generated controversy after grabbing a recording pen from the hand of a journalist. Biography Li was born in Shenyang, but traces his ancestry to Changle County, Shandong province. During the Cultural Revolution, he performed manual labour as a sent-down youth in Sujiatun District, Shenyang, Liaoning Province. In 1978, he earned admission to the history department at Jilin University. After he graduated, Li was sent to work at the government. He worked for the General Office of the Shenyang municipal government, then a secretary at the ministry of electronics industry. In 1988 he was sent to Guangdong province, where he would go on to spend two decades of his political career. He successively served as the mayor and party chief of Huizhou City, then the vice governor of Guangdong, then in 2003, the acting mayor and mayor of Shenzhen, China's most prominent Special Economic Zone. In March 2005, he was named Communist Party chief of Shenzhen. In November 2007, he was transferred to Hubei province, where he took on the office of deputy party chief, governor, and then finally in December 2010, provincial party chief. During his Hubei governorship, the Shishou incident and Deng Yujiao incident occurred in the province. For some reason, during the elections for Vice- President at the 2013 National People's Congress, Li Hongzhong received one write-in vote. In preparation for the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, Li Hongzhong was only one of two regional officials (the other was Huang Qifan) selected to be part of the drafting committee on the \\"resolution for deepening reform.\\" On June 1, 2015, the Dongfang Zhixing ferry sank, causing the deaths of some 442 people. Only 12 people were rescued; but the Hubei government granted accolades to some 99 organizations and 253 individuals. On January 15, 2016, at a meeting of the provincial party standing committee, Li endorsed the \\"Xi Jinping leadership core\\" principle, stating, \\"the Politburo and its Standing Committee are the core leaders [hexin] of the party, General Secretary Xi Jinping is the core leader of the party center. To proactively maintain the authority of the party center means maintaining the leading core of General Secretary Xi Jinping.\\" In September 2016, Li was appointed the Communist Party Secretary of Tianjin, replacing Huang Xingguo, who was dismissed for corruption. The appointment meant that Li would likely advance one step further to the Politburo at the 19th Party Congress in 2017. Deng Yujiao incident In March 2010, when Li Hongzhong, then Governor of Hubei, was attending the 11th National People's Congress in Beijing, Beijing Times journalist Liu Jie asked him to comment on the case of Deng Yujiao, a Hubei pedicurist who killed a government official who tried to rape her. Li refused to comment on the case, which was considered an embarrassment to the government of Hubei, and instead grabbed the recorder from her. The incident was widely reported in Chinese media, but Li refused to apologize to Liu Jie, stating that she stuttered when he asked her which newspaper she represented, and that he was unsure about her identity. A week later, at least 210 intellectuals and journalists, including dramatist Sha Yexin, scholars Cui Weiping and Hu Yong, and the prominent former People's Daily editor Zhou Ruijin, signed an open letter demanding Li to resign. The petition was ultimately unsuccessful, as Li Hongzhong was promoted to party chief (i.e. top office) of Hubei in December. However, in the face of media scrutiny, Li made a statement suggesting that he was in favour of the media reporting the Shishou incident and the Deng Yujiao incident, as long as the news media conducted itself in a \\"fair and objective\\" manner.

Background Chancellor is a direct descendant of Murray Finch- Hatton the 12th Earl of Winchilsea, the daughter of journalist Alexander Chancellor and the cousin of actress Anna Chancellor. She is also second cousin of model Stella Tennant.  Career  While still a pupil at St Paul's Girls' School in Hammersmith, Cecilia Chancellor agreed to help her friend Camilla Nickerson, who would later become an influential fashion stylist, by modelling on a test shoot with photographer Perry Ogden. The resulting ¬£75 seemed like easy money to Cecilia and she moved into professional modelling, with her career being launched through the agency Models 1. It was Steven Meisel's decision to photograph her for Italian Vogue that helped propel her to international success. Since then, she has walked catwalks for designers from John Galliano to Prada and Comme des Gar√ßons to Givenchy, as well as working with fashion photographers such as Mario Testino (with whom she travelled around South America for a year shooting), Irving Penn, David Sims, Patrick Demarchelier, David Bailey, Corinne Day and Paolo Roversi. In the 1990s, she worked extensively with Helmut Lang and became synonymous with designer Marc Jacobs' 1992 grunge-influenced collection for Perry Ellis. She went on to model for Jacobs' own label, where he named a quilted leather handbag after her. She has appeared in numerous campaigns, from Banana Republic and Barneys to Ralph Lauren and Kenzo. She has a son named Lucas, who has been photographed alongside her in campaigns for Marc Jacobs, The Gap and on the cover of British Vogue. Nearly thirty years after starting her career as model she continues to regularly feature in the public eye, with The Sunday Times Style Magazine recently referring to her as one of the Great British Beauties. She modelled for Herm√®s' Autumn/Winter 2012 catwalk show and in its Le Monde d'Herm√®s publication. Other recent modelling credits include French Elle, American Vogue and French Vogue.

The railway was originally operated by Suffolk Punch horses hauling coal and iron from the main line to the Garrett Works. This was later taken over by steam shunting engine 'Sirapite' which was then replaced by a battery electric engine in 1962. The line closed in 1968, with the battery locomotive being scrapped. Restoration  After closure of the works, part of the complex was preserved as the Long Shop Museum, while Sirapite survived, unrestored, in the private collection of Sir William McAlpine. The locomotive has since been returned to Leiston and restored to operational condition. A group has been formed with the intention of restoring the 250 yard stretch of track running behind the Engineers Arms public house to the entrance of the Master Lord Industrial Estate, close to the former junction with the main line. The group paid ¬£17,000 for the trackbed and hope that original locomotive 'Sirapite', which has recently been restored, will be operated on the restored route periodically. In January 2013 the group took delivery of eighteen 60 foot track panels to use in relaying the route. The formal reopening of the railway in time for its 160th anniversary was on 1 June 2019. A visiting locomotive, Ruston 48DS No.294266, the first diesel to ever transverse the line, and fittingly once owned by Sir William McAlpine himself, had the honour of reopening the line. The loco is based at the nearby Mid Suffolk Light Railway, keeping a local connection and setting up a relationship between the two railways.  \\"Sirapite\\" the Works Shunter  \\"Sirapite\\" is the name of the shunting locomotive at the Leiston Works Railway. It was built as a shunting engine for Aveling and Porter in 1906 to serve their gypsum mines. In 1929, Sirapite was sold to Garret & Sons. It was used to perform the task of moving trucks between Garrett's two sites - the Long Shop, and the 'Top Works' which is now an industrial park near the disused station. It would also collect and deliver goods left in the exchange sidings adjacent to Leiston railway station which had been previously carried out by horses. During the movement of goods around the engine became a source of pride for the local area. A battery locomotive replaced Sirapite in 1962, and the steam locomotive was purchased by Sir WIlliam McAlpine, a well-known railway item collector - known primarily for owning Flying Scotsman and Pendennis Castle, two very famous steam locomotives from British railway history. However, Sirapite did not see the same \\"glitz and glamour\\" which it saw in Leiston - the locomotive ended up rusting away in Kent during its first years of preservation. Grants from both public and private funders saw Sirapite being returned to Leiston and she was eventually restored to full working order. Sirapite arrived at the Mid Suffolk Light Railway on the 26th of April 2019. The engine was there for the Summer season of 2019 for the railway. However, due to not being fitted with vacuum braking (as it was built as a goods engine and not a locomotive for passenger services), it could not haul passenger trains. The engine arrived at the railway so it could remain on display whilst the Long shop redeveloped part of its site. The outing to the \\"Middy\\" was the first time that the engine had more space to run on which was more than a few yards on the short demonstration line at the Long Shop Museum.

He is best known for having founded Wall Street Institute in 1972 to commercialise MultiMethod, a learning methodology that he devised that is student- rather than teacher-centric. Wall Street Institute teaches people to speak (as opposed to read or write) English as a foreign language. It has provided MultiMethod instruction to over 2 million students. It operates centers in North Africa, East Asia, South East Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. It is branded as Wall Street English in China where it was voted the most renowned Foreign Language Teaching Brand of 2012.  Early life and career  Peccenini was born, brought up and schooled in Ferrara, Italy, the only child of a modest family. An early aptitude for football, and his role as team captain, helped him to hone the leadership skills that he would later come to need in business. On leaving school he eschewed a university degree because of the financial implications for his parents and instead went directly into a succession of sales-based and management jobs.  Computex  In 1968, he set up Computex to provide training for programmers operating mainframes. He sourced manuals from IBM, Siemens, Honeywell and General Electric called ‚ÄòProgrammed Instruction‚Äô, i.e. self-training handbooks with multiple-choice questions. They had answers at the end of the book so that trainees could check they were answering the questions correctly. He removed the answers and replaced the checking process with a teacher. Students would study a manual at home, in their own time and at their own pace. When ready, they would go to Computex to have a tutorial with a teacher. One student might need to study at home for three hours, another 10 hours, another three days, and so on.  Wall Street Institute  Whilst running Computex, Peccenini studied at the weekends and earned a BA in Foreign Languages and Literature from Bocconi University in Milan. In 1972 he adapted his Computex learning methodology to the teaching of English as a foreign language and established Wall Street Institute in Milan to market it. He later franchised the business to fuel expansion and over the next few years over 50 centers opened in Italy. In the early 1980s an investment in proprietary courseware for the business proved too onerous to sustain. Peccenini had invested all his money into developing English Online, a state- of-the-art multimedia language instructional program. He had also borrowed heavily from banks and individual investors, planning to meet his heavy financial exposure through high sales. But it didn't work out. As a result, his company closed down. The franchisees were able to continue their activity, but disconnected from his company. \\"I lost everything, including my health\\", he said. \\"But I didn't lose my desire or let go of my vision.\\" In 1986, Peccenini placed an advertisement in Switzerland in search of a business partner with capital to invest. He found one and together they set up Wall Street Institute Switzerland and eventually he regained control of its Italian operations. In 1987, Peccenini expanded to Spain. In 1997 he sold the company to Sylvan Learning Systems. In 2000 he founded Wall Street English in China where he is known as Li Wenhao. In 2005 he sold Wall Street English to The Carlyle Group.  MultiMethod  MultiMethod does away with the pitfalls of adult evening or weekend classes, namely, students of unequal ability competing for the teacher's attention and a fixed timetable leading to missed classes. It permits students to choose their own hours of attendance at a learning center and follow a pace in tune with their personal requirements. They are free to use the resources of the center whenever they like. They learn new material on their own with the help of proprietary multimedia courseware. At successive trigger points they book onto a tutorial to reinforce their learning with a native-English speaker. They need never miss a tutorial since each one is repeated every few days. Tutorials are restricted to a maximum of four similarly-abled students. Students pay to achieve a certain level of ability and attend as many hours as they wish during the contract period until they achieve their objective.  Seminars on Business and Life Skills  Peccenini continues contributing to the education of younger generations through his seminars at universities and business forums where he lectures in English, Italian and Spanish on entrepreneurship, leadership, human relations and a healthy lifestyle. His contribution to the education of university students has led to his appointment as guest/adjunct professor at four universities in China.

Written by Samira Fazal and directed by Saife Hasan, the telenovela, which premiered on 1 September 2012, has been produced by Momina Duraid and ended its run in Pakistan on 16 February 2013 after telecasting 22 episodes. Featuring actors Savera Nadeem, Noman Ejaz, Ayesha Khan, Arjumand Rahim, Sajida Syed, Waqas Khan, Fahad Mirza, Mustafa Changazi, Sarah Khan, Syed Jibran and Madiha Rizvi. Plot Zubeida (Savera Nadeem), more commonly known as Badi Aapa, is the central character of the telenovela who possesses a rigid and dictatorial nature and her husband, Farmaan (Noman Ijaz), likes to stay out of her way. Zubeida's only daughter, Sharmeen (Sarah Khan), is in love with a man named Essa (Fahad Mirza) and wants to marry him but Zubeida doesn't agree to the union. Sharmeen decides that the only way to convince her mother is to talk to her uncle, Ghazanfar (Waqas Khan), who is the only man Zubeida listens to because Zubeida and Ghazanfar used to like each other when they were young. But at the same time Sharmeen gets to know that her mother has already decided of getting her married to Ghazanfar's son, Adeel (Mustafa Changazi), who happens to be Zubeida's nephew. Adeel had always loved Sharmeen. But as Adeel's mother, Firdouz (Arjumand Rahim), i.e. Zubeida's younger sister, doesn't want him to marry Sharmeen, Adeel refuses and Zubeida gets angry on her younger sister. And it is soon later that Zubeida gets to know that her husband has secretly got married for the second time to a lady named, Neelam (Ayesha Khan Jr). Zubeida believes that Ghanzanfar is still in love with her and will leave his family for her so she demands a divorce. Farmaan begs her to stay but Zubeida insists and tells him about Ghanzanfar still loving her. In a taxis on the way to Ghanzanfar Zubeida recounts the loving moments shared between the two. on arrival at her sisters home she's surprised her sister is back and that not only does Ghanzanfar care for his wife but he only sees Zubeida as his wife's sister and nothing more. Zubeida, embarrassed, makes her excuses and leaves to go back home. On arrival at home her husband tells her he has divorced her and he is moving out with Neelam.

When a wave propagates through subsurface materials both energy dissipation and velocity dispersion takes place. Energy dissipation is frequency dependent and causes decreased resolution of the seismic images when recorded in seismic prospecting. The attendant dispersion is a necessary consequence of the energy dissipation and causes the high frequency waves to travel faster than the low- frequency waves. The consequence for the seismic image is a frequency dependent time-shift of the data, and so correct timings for lithological identification cannot be obtained. Basics When we know the energy dissipation (attenuation), we can calculate the time shift due to dispersion because there is a relation between attenuation and the dispersion in a seismic media. Dispersion equations are obtained from the application of an integral transform in the frequency domain that are of the Kramers-Kr√∂nig type. This effect is described in the article ‚ÄòDispersive body waves‚Äô by Futterman (1962).Futterman (1962) ‚ÄòDispersive body waves‚Äô. Journal of Geophysical Research 67. p.5279-91 For a better understanding of dispersion waves in seismic medias I would recommend the book 'Seismic inverse Q-filtering' by Yanghua Wang (2008). He discusses the theory of Futterman and starts with the wave equation:Wang 2008, p. 60 :\\\\frac { dU(r,w)}{ dr} - ikU(r,w)=0 \\\\quad (1.1) where U(r,w) is the plane wave of radial frequency w at travel distance r, k is the wavenumber and i is the imaginary unit. Reflection seismograms record the reflection wave along the propagation path r from the source to reflector and back to the surface. Equation (1.1) has an analytical solution given by :U(r+\\\\bigtriangleup r,w) =U(r,w)\\\\exp (ik\\\\bigtriangleup r) \\\\quad (1.2) Where k is the wave number. When the wave propagates in inhomogeneous seismic media the propagation constant k must be a complex value that includes not only an imaginary part, the frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient, but also a real part, the dispersive wavenumber. We can call this K(w) a propagation constant in line with Futterman.Futterman (1962) p.5280 :K(iw) =k(w)+ i a(w) \\\\quad (1.3) Here a(w) is taken positive to assure that energy is lost from the wave to the medium. Now when K(w) are separated into a real part for attenuation and an imaginary part for dispersion, we can introduce the Kramer-Kr√∂nig relation by a Hilbert transform H of the attenuation a(w): :K(iw) = H(a(w))+ i a(w) \\\\quad (1.4) For our calculations to be valid we must make two assumptions: (a) the absorption coefficient a(w) is strictly linear in the frequency, over the range of measurement. We can call it bw. (b)The wave motion is linear i.e. the principle of superposition is valid. The second assumption is of more fundamental nature, and give us a possibility to express any pulse U as a superposition of plane waves. The reason why Futterman introduced the Hilbert transform was to impose causality on the wave pulse. Substituting this complex-valued wavenumber K(w) into solution (1.2) produces the following expression: :U(r+\\\\bigtriangleup r,w)=U(r,w)\\\\exp([-bw+ iH(bw)]\\\\bigtriangleup r ) \\\\quad (1.5) For a solution consistent with Futterman we can replace U(r,w) with the expression: :U(r,w) = U_0 exp(iwt) \\\\quad (1.6) We can replace the distance increment ‚àÜr by traveltime increment ‚àÜt = ‚àÜr/c. Here c is a constant. We can replace U0 with U' for correct scaling and equation (1.5) is expressed as :U(t+\\\\bigtriangleup t,w)=U' exp(iw\\\\bigtriangleup t)\\\\exp([-bw+ iH(bw)]\\\\bigtriangleup t) \\\\quad (1.7) The sum of these plane waves gives the time-domain seismic signal, :U(t+\\\\bigtriangleup t) =\\\\int_0^\\\\infty U(t+\\\\bigtriangleup t,w)dw.\\\\quad (1.8) Calculations Some solutions of (1.7) (1.8) are plotted here. The dispersion of Kramer-Kr√∂nig type is visible in the way that the wave moves to the right compared to a solution with no dispersion (Forward zero phase solution). This assures us that we always get a causal wave solution with the Kramer - Kr√∂nig relation. The time shift correction due to dispersion can be found from the difference between the center of the zero-phase pulse and the center of the dispersed pulse. Upper graph is from attenuation b=0.07. Lower graph with b=0.1. The time shift increase with increased attenuation. File:Kgraf1.png|Fig.1.a.Wave equation with Kramer Kronig relation b=0.07 File:Kgraf2.png|Fig.1.b.Wave equation with Kramer Kronig relation b=0.1 Inverse filtering In seismic processing, in most applications, we do not go in the forward direction as above. So the theory of dispersive body waves has most applications in the theory of seismic inverse Q filtering. From the Wikipedia article on this subject we get the inverse Q-filter: :U(t+\\\\bigtriangleup t,w)=U(t,w)\\\\exp \\\\bigg(|\\\\frac{w}{w_h}|^{-\\\\gamma} \\\\frac{|w|\\\\bigtriangleup t}{2Q(w)}\\\\bigg) \\\\exp \\\\bigg( i|\\\\frac{w}{w_h}|^{-\\\\gamma} w\\\\bigtriangleup t\\\\bigg) \\\\quad (1.8.a) : \\\\gamma =(\\\\pi Q_r)^{-1} We take the phase only inversion procedure outlined in Wang 2008 p.86 and apply the phase part of (1.8.a), the second exponential, on the solution with b=0.1. Trial and error gave us a good inversion where the phase effect of the earth filter (introduced by the Kramer-Kronig relation - magenta on fig.2) was well corrected for with a reference frequency Wang 2008 p.20 fh=80 Hz (wh=2 œÄ fh). We can see that the red graph on figure 2 is much like the black graph representing a zero-phase (non-dispersive) solution. A more used reference frequency is fh=30 Hz. On fig.2.b. we can see that this choice of reference frequency gives a solution that is more like a causal solution than for fig.2.a.

A deeper study of (1.7) can be found in Aki, K, and Richards, P.G. (2002).Aki, K, and Richards, P.G. 2002, Quantitative Seismology, theory and methods, University Science books In (1.8.a) Œ≥ is a function of Q, and in (1.7) the constant b is linked to Q with the equation: : b = ( \\\\frac{1}{2Q}) This relation is found in Aki, K and Richards Aki, K, and Richards p.166 In the outline above the method of Wang is used in seismic inverse Q filtering, and the Kramer-Kr√∂nig relation is used in the forward Q-filtering to create benchmark data for the inverse filtering. However, it is also possible to develop an inverse Q filter from the forward filter (1.7). This filter was developed by Hale D. (1981).Hale, D, 1981 An inverse Q filter: SEP report 26. This filter was further studied by Gelius (1987) Gelius L.J. 1987. Inverse Q filtering: a spectral balancing technique. Geophysical Prospecting 35, 656-67. In an article that is available on internet http://crewes.org/ForOurSponsors/ResearchReports/2004/2004-30.pdf written by Montana and Margrave - Crewes research report volume 16 (2004) - Hale‚Äôs inverse Q filter is compared with the inverse filter of Wang. They also compared with a third method, but this is not discussed here. The inversion method of Wang was by far the best method for phase correction.

The Brockville and Ottawa Railway (B&O;) was an early railway in Upper Canada, today's Ontario. It ran north from the town of Brockville on the Saint Lawrence River to Sand Point on the Ottawa River. It was built primarily to serve the timber trade on the Ottawa Valley, shortcutting routes that led into the city of Ottawa, further downstream. The first railway tunnel in Canada, the Brockville Tunnel, was dug in order to allow the B&O; to reach the port lands on the south side of the city, which sits on a bluff. A second railway company, the Canada Central Railway (CCR), was chartered to run from the B&O; at Carleton Place to the LeBreton Flats on the west side of downtown Ottawa. The two companies were later merged under the Canada Central name, and continued to push northward to Mattawa. The line was leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway and merged in 1881, and was later extended to North Bay and Sudbury. CP used the original CC routing as their primary access to Ottawa, joining it to the Ontario and Quebec Railway (O&Q;) at Perth.

The body's headquarters are in Penryn, Cornwall.  History of shinty in England  Shinty was previously played widely in England in the 19th century and early 20th century, with teams such as London Scots, Bolton Caledonian, Cottonopolis and evidence to suggest it was played in some form in Cumberland, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire, Nottingham, Cornwall and Lincoln. Nottingham Forest F.C. was established by shinty and bandy players as Nottingham Forest Football and Bandy Club. There is evidence to support that Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge were used for shinty matches in the 19th century. Shinty died out in England until only London Camanachd remained and they themselves struggled throughout the late 20th century into the new millennium. There was a Northallerton Camanachd in the late 60s to early 80s, and interest was maintained by the links to the nearby military base, but they only competed periodically. The revival of the London Club has sparked interest in Cornwall, and Cornwall were finally able to offer London some 'local' opposition in March 2012. London's success grew and the English Capital's side hosted a successful tournament in September 2011 featuring the hosts, Cornwall and the SCOTS Camanachd. The influence of the SCOTS and the tradition of English shinty being run by Scottish university graduates saw the resurrection of shinty in Northallerton under the name Northallerton Shinty Club. Atkins UK donated Helmets to the association to help provide protection, especially to the youth players, at club and international level.  Recent history  The English Shinty Association was founded in 2013 by three ex-University Shinty players with a passion for reviving the game in England. The three players in question, Matt Mossop, Graham Love and Alan MacDonald, had already founded/revived teams in their respective areas, Cornwall, London and Northallerton. With London crowned English Champions at the Shinty Shop Challenge Cup on goal difference over Cornwall at Bristol's expense, ESA organized the historic first shinty international against the USA in 2013 (England 2- USA 0), ESA entered the Bullough Cup for the first time in 2013, whilst its constituent teams were represented at St Andrews Sixes in 2013. Expansion continued in 2014, entering the Bullough Cup, running a tour to Scotland and various festivals being run in London, Cornwall and other locations in England.  Structure  The association currently supports four clubs: Cornwall Shinty Club, Oxford Shinty Club (set up in 2013), University of Nottingham Shinty Club (established 2015) and the oldest shinty club in England, London Camanachd. The association also supports development sides in Northallerton Shinty Club, The North West, East Anglia and Bristol. The committee was expanded in 2014 to facilitate the development of Women's and University Shinty as well as overseeing the day-to- day running of the association. An English Universities Championship will be held for the first time in 2014-15. The English Shinty Association is an affiliated member of the Camanachd Association, the world's governing body for shinty.  Clubs and teams  The association has a varied range of teams under its auspices. *English Shinty Team, which competes in Scottish cup competitions. There are two major clubs in England who are affiliated as separate members of the Camanachd Association. *London Camanachd, the oldest team in England, which have a long history of competition in Scottish cup competitions. *Cornwall Shinty Club, who also function as the co-ordinating club for shinty activity in South West England. There are five teams in the SW League: *Mabe Shinty Club *CSM Gold *CSM Blue *Devon *Mylor Cons The student teams also compete as Camborne School of Mines Shinty Club. The association also hosts the following sides: *Oxford Shinty Club *North Shinty Club  Competitions  The association runs the English Shinty Championship, played for the Shinty Shop Challenge Cup.

Sartori was born in Brescia, Italy, on 1 April 1913. He studied piano and literature, two activities he loved his whole life. He went to university and graduated with a dissertation in history of music. He started his career as a librarian in a school in Bologna in 1939. Here, Sartori started to develop his interest for musical sources and he published several articles on musicology. During World War II, he joined the Italian resistance movement; he was imprisoned by the SS and then released in 1945. After the war, Sartori started a career as a journalist in Milan writing for the newspaper Popolo di Milano. In the following years he worked as musicologist, journalist and music critic. In 1947, Sartori was appointed to the library of the Milan Conservatory. From this moment on, Sartori devoted himself to research in musicology. His efforts were concentrated on the cataloguing of the musical sources, which, in his opinion, was the paramount priority in musicology. Sartori managed to obtain the support and cooperation of many correspondents and was thus able to collect an impressive amount of data from Italian libraries. Since 1955, Sartori was a member of the Executive Committee of the International Association of Musical Libraries (IAML) / Association internationale des biblioth√®ques musicaux (AIBM). In 1959 he was appointed to the Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense in Milan, where a few years later in 1965, together with Mariangela Don√†, he founded the (URFM), which he directed until his retirement. With all the data collected through the URFM, Sartori completed three works of the highest value: the bibliography of printed Italian instrumental music before 1700, Il nuovo Vogel, and the majestic Catalogo dei libretti italiani a stampa or Catalogo Sartori. His daily hard work was interrupted only on occasion of his appointments as visiting professor at the universities of Buffalo in 1965 and Los Angeles in 1969. Sartori died in Milan on 11 March 1994. His contribution to musicology is highly remarkable and it is the result of his energy, hard work and passion. Works *I libretti italiani a stampa dalle origini al 1800.

Background Whilst visiting Cheapside Market, London, Devon-based weaver Thomas Whitty was impressed by a large Turkish carpet he saw. On his return to Axminster, he used his skills to work out how to produce a product of similar quality. After several months work he completed his first carpet on midsummer's day 1755. Whitty's carpets, looking much like horizontal-tapestries, became the benchmark for wealthy aristocrats to have in their country homes and town houses, between 1755 and 1835. The company produced Axminster carpets for: the music room of the Royal Pavilion, Brighton; Chatsworth House; Powderham Castle; Saltram House; and Warwick Castle. King George III and Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz purchased Axminster carpets and also visited the factory. In 1800, the company made a carpet for Mahmud II, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, known today as the most famous Axminster Carpet of all. Depicting a blazing sun, moon and a whole constellation of stars, it cost ¬£1000 (). Carried out of the factory by thirty men from the local Congregational Church, it was initially placed in the Topkapi Palace. It was then moved to the Defterdar Palace, where it became the property of Esma Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Mustapha III. Decline In 1828, a disastrous fire destroyed the weaving looms. In 1835 the company owner, Samuel Rampson Whitty, the founder's grandson, was declared bankrupt. Blackmores of Wilton, Wiltshire, near Salisbury, bought the remaining stock and looms and extended their business to include hand-knotted carpets, which were still called Axminsters. In July 2012, Axminster Heritage Ltd bought the now Grade II listed former original carpet factory in which Thomas Whitty founded the company and wove the first carpets. It now houses the town's heritage centre, incorporating the town museum and the tourist information centre. Refoundation Hamlyns's Mill, Buckfastleigh, which was bought by Harry Dutfield post-World War II to overcome supply difficulties for woollen yarn In 1929, Kidderminster-resident Scot's-born carpet manufacturer Harry Dutfield founded a new carpet company with his former schoolfriend Stephen Quayle. However, as the depression hit, the company became beset by Union problems. Setting off for the 1935 London Motor Show to buy his first Jaguar car, Dutfield met a vicar on the train from the West Country, who told him that carpets had not been made in the town of Axminster since the 1828 fire. Returning home, Dutfield formulated a business plan to move his company to Axminster and relaunch Axminster Carpets Ltd. He persuaded the Southern Railway to extend its station at , and from 1937 lease him land on which to build a suitable factory. At the outbreak of World War II, Dutfield converted the factory to produce stirrup pumps and later aircraft parts, while Dutfield himself was an officer in the Home Guard. After hostilities ceased, and with severe shortages of raw materials, keen fisherman Dutfield bought a wollen mill at Buckfast, near Buckfastleigh, which came with Salmon fishing rights on the River Dart. This enabled Dutfield to establish the company on its original basis, being the complete \\"from fleece to floor\\" carpet maker. After handing over day-to-day running of the company to his son Simon, Dutfield semi-retired from the company to pursue his hobby of fishing. Awarded an MBE for his services to British exports, Dutfield died at his home in Axminster on 21 May 1999. Present The factory outlet for Axminster Carpets Ltd, in Axminster, Devon Today, Axminster Carpets is the only manufacturer to purchase, wash, card, spin and dye its own yarn before weaving the carpet itself. To celebrate 250 years of carpet weaving in Axminster, in 2005 a commemorative rug was produced. Paraded by the company's weavers through the town, it was then blessed by the Bishop of Exeter and presented to the Earl of Devon. The carpet is now in Clarence House, the home of Prince Charles. Also in 2012, Axminster was awarded a Royal Warrant for the supply of goods and services to the Royal Household. The modern Axminster-type power loom is capable of weaving high quality carpets with many varying colours and patterns, and is manufactured all over the world. Due to their hard-wearing and durable nature, Axminster carpets are most frequently used in country homes, luxury hotels, global airlines and train carriages. Every Wetherspoon pub has a bespoke designed carpet manufactured by Axminster.The secret life of Wetherspoon‚Äôs freaky carpets The Guardian 10 January 2016 On 19 February 2020 it was announced that the company had gone into administration. However it was bought out of administration in March 2020 by a group of investers including the former owners.

Delegates are to focus on the potential conditions of a final global climate change agreement expected to be ratified in 2015 at the Paris Conference. Location and participation National Stadium in Warsaw, the main venue of the conference The location of UNFCCC talks are rotated by regions throughout United Nations countries. In 2013 Warsaw, the capital and largest city in Poland, was chosen to represent the Eastern European Group in the COP 19 Presidency. The choice of Poland has been criticised by environmental organizations, including Greenpeace, because of the country's lack of commitment to reduce its use of fossil fuels and increase use of renewable energy. As of 2013, 88% of Poland's electricity is sourced from coal, as compared to the global average of 68% electricity from fossil fuels. Its officials have been blocking EU proposals to more effectively act against global warming. Standing alone against the other EU member states, in 2011 Poland blocked the proposed emission targets for 2050, and its environment minister Marcin Korolec (president of the conference) declared himself sceptical about the EU's strategy of leading by example.Hakim, Danny and Mateusz Zurawik: \\"Poland, Wedded to Coal, Spurns Europe on Clean Energy Targets\\", in The New York Times, 31 October 2013 Over 10,000 participants from 189 countries registered to attend the conference, but only 134 ministers announced participation. Four countries that are among the most vulnerable to climate change were represented by their president or prime minister: Tuvalu, Nauru, Ethiopia and Tanzania.Yeo, Sophie: \\"Warsaw climate talks: nearly 3 in 10 countries not sending ministers\\", in The Guardian, 14 November 2013 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk dismissed Korolec in preference for a politician who would be better able to deliver a \\"radical acceleration of shale gas operations\\" in the country. However, he said that Korolec would remain the government's plenipotentiary for the conference. Negotiations The overarching goal of the conference is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius above current levels. According to the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, Christiana Figueres, :‚ÄúGlobal greenhouse gas emissions need to peak this decade, and get to zero net emissions by the second half of this century... National governments need to act to minimize impacts to their populations and ensure sustainable development over generations. The private sector needs to act to minimize climate risk and capture opportunity. And the international process must push forward now to build the foundation for an ambitious universal climate change agreement in 2015,‚Äù Clean energy, and specifically the financing and technology transfer of renewables in developing countries, will be of main importance during the conference. The Indian Minister of the Environment stated before the talks that ‚Äúthe most important milestone would be climate finance and capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has not happened at all... Developed countries that made a commitment earlier have now started talking of alternative sources of funding - whereas in our view these are commitments of the parties to the COP.‚Äù Agreements in the Copenhagen round ostensibly formalized $US 100 billion to the Clean Energy Fund by 2020 to assist developing countries in energy development, whereas only $US 7.5 million had been committed as of June 2013. Australia has support from Britain and others to head off demands for compensation payments to countries hit by damage they blame on climate change, sparking anger at a global summit meant to strike a deal this weekend. Acting on Tony Abbott‚Äôs edict to avoid any new financial commitments, Australian negotiators have held out against calls to support the ‚Äúloss and damage‚Äù payments sought by poorer countries Technology transfer and sharing of intellectual property between industrialised and developing countries will be a major concern in the Warsaw talks. Historically, these discussions have been stalled due to disagreements over the price and sharing mechanisms surrounding intellectual property, and thus new approaches are expected in the Warsaw conference. A stalemate surrounding the talks has been the insistence of the United States delegates on China and India conforming to binding reduction commitments - whereas Chinese and Indian delegates argue that funding from industrialised countries is needed before such emissions cuts can be executed without impacting GDP growth rates. India and Saudi Arabia blocked an agreement which could prevent the release of up to 100 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2050. A key paragraph in a draft resolution that would have accelerated international cooperation under the Montreal Protocol was reportedly deleted at the last minute. The deaths, injuries and destruction caused by Typhoon Haiyan were brought to attention during the opening day talks. In response to the typhoon and to climate change damage in general, Naderev \\"Yeb\\" Sa√±o, the lead negotiator of the Philippines delegation, received a standing ovation for announcing: On 21 November, the first Cities and Sub-national Dialogue took place. This consisted of selected ministers, mayors and sub-national leaders and civil society representatives discussing mitigation and adaptation at a local scale. =Walkouts= The G77 and China bloc led 132 poor countries in a walk out during talks about ‚Äúloss and damage‚Äù compensation for the consequences of global warming. Poor countries have demanded that the developed world give them $100 billion annually by 2020. Activists and poor countries accused Australian diplomats of not taking the talks seriously. The country did not send high-ranking officials to the UN summit, saying that they would be busy repealing the country's contentious carbon tax. The carbon tax is bad for the economy and it doesn‚Äôt do any good for the environment, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told The Washington Post. Despite a carbon tax of $37 a ton by 2020, Australia‚Äôs domestic emissions were going up, not down. The carbon tax was basically socialism masquerading as environmentalism, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going to get abolished. On the last day of the conference WWF, Oxfam, ActionAid, the International Trade Union Confederation, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace walked out of the conference. Greenpeace spokesman Gregor Kessler, however, said that they would not leave the city but would \\"follow the discussions from the outside. We will not be part of the internal discussions.\\" Oxfam' Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said: \\"[Governments] must...come back in 2014 ready for meaningful discussions on how they will deliver their share of the emissions reductions which scientists say are needed and their share of the money needed to help the poorest and most vulnerable countries adapt.\\" All six issued a statement that read: \\"Organisations and movements representing people from every corner of the Earth have decided that the best use of our time is to voluntarily withdraw from the Warsaw climate talks. The Warsaw climate conference, which should have been an important step in the just transition to a sustainable future, is on track to deliver virtually nothing.\\" =Conclusion= The conference ran beyond the scheduled end date of 22 November by a day before some consensus was reached. Member states agreed to work towards curbing emissions as soon as possible, with an idea date targeted at the first quarter of 2015. Talk however continued on the aid that developed countries would pay to help emissions cuts by developing countries. Having previously promised US$100 billion a year after 2020 from the US$10 billion a year between 2010‚Äì2012, they resisted calls to set targets for the rest of the decade. The draft resolution of the conference, though, only mentioned setting \\"increasing levels\\" of aid. Further the Warsaw Mechanism was proposed, which would provide expertise, and possibly aid, to developing nations to cope with loss and damage from such natural extremities as heatwaves, droughts and floods and threats such as rising sea levels and desertification. Criticism=Organisers= The organizers of COP19 were strongly criticised for posting comments in an online blog in the lead-up to the conference about the purported advantages of ice melting in the Arctic, stating that \\"we may build new drilling platforms and retrieve natural resources hidden below the sea bed\\", as well as \\"chasing the pirates, terrorists and ecologists that will come to hang around\\". The bloggers subsequently responded: \\"Our recent entry on north-west passage was widely discussed but unfortunately misunderstood. The readers considered the forthcoming, bitter, but unfortunately possible scenario as [an] option we like. We do not. But how to react to the featured situation? Should we be silent? We are glad, that the topic caused so much interest and discussion, because the matter is really very serious.\\"Vaughan, Adam: \\"Arctic melt means more pirate chases, say Polish climate hosts\\" in The Guardian, 10 October 2013 Organizers from the Ministry of the Economy in Poland were also strongly criticised for co-hosting an event with the World Coal Association alongside the UNFCCC talks. This has been seen as a provocation against changing the energy source mix in Poland. The dismissal of the conference president Marcin Korolec from his cabinet position as minister of environmental during the negotiations has been seen by delegates as a further sign of Poland's lack of commitment to progress global action on global warming. Prime minister Donald Tusk stated that the dismissal had to do with the need for \\"radical acceleration of shale gas operations\\".\\"Climate talks: Polish environment minister sacked to accelerate shale gas operations\\", in The Guardian, 20 November 2013 =Industrialised countries= The International Energy Agency has continually urged industrialised countries to reduce fossil fuel subsidies. It is expected that these subsidy actions will not be addressed. Several countries attending the COP 19 have been criticised for poor performance on stated environmental pollution targets. While the United States reduced its emissions of in 2012 by 11.8 percent compared to 2005, the largest reduction of any country, others have not done so well.

He is considered to be one of the chief architects of modern Oriya theatre. He brought in significant changes in the morphology of Oriya plays, both in theme and structure. He rescued them from the hold of opera and melodrama, and the overbearing influence of neighbouring Bengal. Gopal Chhotray dominated the Oriya professional theatre for more than three decades. Beginning with Pheria (Come Back) in 1946, he wrote more than 15 original stage plays and 8 adaptations of eminent Oriya novels, most of which were runaway success in professional stage. There were days, when both the professional theaters of Cuttack, holding daily shows, used to stage his plays concurrently. Apart from adapting works of eminent Odia novelists like Upendra Kishore Das (Mala Janha), Basanta Kumari Patnaik (Amadabata), Kanhu Charana Mohanty (Jhanja) and former Chief Minister of Odisha Dr. Harekrushna Mahtab (Pratibha), he also adapted Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's ‚ÄòRamer Sumati‚Äô, Henrik Ibsen's 'Enemy of the People', A A Milne's 'Man in the Bowler Hat', Henry Fielding's 'Mock Doctor', and the English thriller 'The Evil That Men Do'. Gopal Chhotray was associated with All India Radio (AIR), Cuttack since its inception in 1948. After years of writing as a freelancer, he joined AIR, Cuttack as an in-house script writer in 1956 and worked till 1975. He wrote more than half a thousand radio plays, including musicals and features, and made listening to his works a household habit. His monthly serial 'Purapuri Paribarika'(Entirely A Family Matter), which ran uninterrupted for three years, was perhaps the earliest chain-play the AIR produced. While in Radio, Gopal Chhotray made a unique contribution to the Odia musical tradition by reviving rural opera, which had gone out of fashion, and was frowned by the city bred and puritans. He brought both popularity and respectability for this genre by adapting them for broadcast by the AIR in 1960. He restored Baisnab Pani, the doyen of Odia Jatra, to his legitimacy and started an upsurge in musical plays by building up a large repertoire, consisting of his own originals and adaptations. He has nearly twenty LP records and cassettes of his own work including the all-time best 'Srimati Samarjani' which he produced for the radio with Akshaya Mohanty, based on Fakir Mohan Senapati's short story 'Patent Medicine'. It continues to be a listening rage even after 40 years. He was also pivotal in designing the dramatic contents of the Odisha Doordarshan when TV came to the State. He nurtured its foundation at Cuttack and continued to sustain it after it shifted to Bhubaneswar. He scripted nearly a hundred plays and features for the State TV, including serials and a memorable mythological called 'Devi Durga'. He started his career as an amateur stage artist in Bharati Theatres in Cuttack, but soon became the foremost playwright and film script writer for the Odia stage and films respectively. After 'Pheria', his early plays in the 50s, such as 'Bharasa' and 'Para Kalam', were recognized as unique creations. His instant recognition for film script writing came with the production of the mega mythological 'Sri Jagannath' in 1950. In the next thirty five years, he wrote screenplays and dialogues for a number of 'middle of the road' cinemas, combining class and box office hits. 'Amadabata', 'Kie Kahara', 'Matira Manisha' and 'Badhu Nirupama' had received high critical acclaim for his dialogues and treatment. When professional theatre withered away in Odisha and the State radio lost out its monopoly to private broadcasting and TV channels of doubtful quality, Gopal Chhotray, devoted himself to writing of short stories to respond to his creative urge. He published two volumes of his work, comprising about thirty stories, which were actually embryonic of the plays and films he wanted to write but could not. Apart from several State awards like Sarala Samman, Bisuva Samman and Governor's Plaque of Honour (1991), he received the Kendriya Sahitya Akademi Award in 1982 and Kendriya Sangeet Natak Academi Award in 1987. Gopal Chhotray spent his entire life in Cuttack. 2016 would be the centenary year of his birth. A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF HIS PUBLICATIONS PLAYS 1\\\\. Sahadharmini (1942) 2\\\\. Pheria (1946) 3\\\\.

Miskolczy was born in Vinkovci on January 23, 1909 to a notable Croatian Jewish family Miskolczy. His brother was Eugen Miskolczy. In Vinkovci he finished public elementary school and Gymnasium in 1927. In 1931 he graduated from the Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Zagreb. After graduation his father sent him on a one-year specialization in Trieste, hoping that he will lead the family trading company after return. At first Miskolczy worked with his father at the family company, but in 1937 he founded his own company \\"Oto Mi≈°kolci\\" za trgovinu i proizvodnju zemaljskih proizvoda (for trade and manufacture of land products). His mother inherited the family company from his father. During World War II, in order to avoid arrest and deportation, all members of Miskolczy family have escaped to Croatian Littoral which was then under Fascist Italy. Miskolczy settled in Crikvenica. But soon Fascists yielded under Nazis pressure, and all Jews were interned in camps on the coast and islands. Miskolczy was imprisoned at the concentration camp Kraljevica. In 1943 Italian fascist closed the camp in Kraljevica and moved all prisoners to the Rab concentration camp. After the capitulation of Italy and the liberation of the camp, Miskolczy joined the Partisans. There he worked as a stenographer and stenotypist. After the war he worked for the SR Croatia Government in Split, and later at the Ministry of supply in Zagreb. He soon retired due to the deteriorated health and returned to Vinkovci, where he married and helped his wife Ela in the newly formed company. As a most Croatian Jews, Miskolczy was deeply disappointed with the Yugoslavian government and made Aliyah to Israel with his wife and mother Berta. He died in Israel in 1978.

It is the first game published by 2K Sports since Take-Two Interactive gained the license from THQ in a bankruptcy filing.\\"2K and WWE announce exclusive multi-year agreement for WWE video game series\\", from WWE.com It is the sequel to WWE '13 and it is succeeded by WWE 2K15. It is the first game in the WWE 2K series. It was released on October 29, 2013 in North America, October 30 in Japan and November 1, 2013 in Europe. It is the final WWE videogame that featured the scratch logo, first appeared in the Attitude Era, as the company introduced a new logo in 2014, which was originally used as the logo of the WWE Network.\\"WWE unveils new logo\\" from wwen.com  Exhibition  Many of the gameplay features from WWE '13 have been updated. These include the navigation system, allowing for more fluid walking, running and dragging motions. Characters also move faster than previously. Before running, characters display \\"starting up\\" animations, to prevent players from spamming running attacks. All chain reversals now result in offensive attacks, to make for quicker matches by avoiding continuous reversal stalemates. Catapult finishers can now be used offensively. Some characters can launch an opponent into the air and catch them for a catch finisher. Seven new OMG moments have been added, allowing certain finishers to be done on two opponents, and players to interact with the arena environment. The nearfall system too has been improved, with more two counts. Few new matches have been added, though a Slobberknocker Mode, adapted from The Streak season mode, had been added as a gauntlet match.  Create Suite  The long-standing mode, \\"Create-a- Superstar\\" has been tweaked to have an expanded character save slot that can be filled with up to 100 created superstars. While the mode itself remains much of the same, the ability to use existing superstars as a template for new custom variants has been added. The player continues to have the option to create their own entrances and finishers. The ability to create a custom WWE championship is also available, having been made more reminiscent to previous iterations after having limited creativity in WWE '13.  Story modes = 30 Years of WrestleMania = WWE 2K14 features a new single player campaign called \\"The 30 Years of WrestleMania\\", a nostalgia-based gameplay mode that recreates nearly three decades of WWE history, including 45 matches, classic WWE footage and many legendary characters. Like WWE Legends of WrestleMania and WWE '13, the campaign revolves around historical stories rather than original ones. The mode features a distinct roster of wrestlers and alternate gimmicks, who wrestled at WrestleMania (especially in main events). In Wrestlemania mode, matches have primary objectives, required to beat the game, and bonus historical objectives, which result in recreated WrestleMania moments. Sometimes the player must follow a guided sequence of inputs, rather than freely control the character. In 45 primary matches, the player competes through storylines of various lengths, switching predetermined characters as they are completed. Each chapter has its own title and focus; \\"Hulkamania Runs Wild\\" focuses on Hulk Hogan and early WrestleManias, while \\"The New Generation\\" showcases the rise of Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels in the mid-1990s. The \\"Attitude Era\\" chapter brings back some matches from WWE '13's \\"Attitude Era\\" mode, as well as some not covered before. The \\"Ruthless Aggression\\" chapter focuses on the departure of The Rock, lessened focus on Triple H and rise of John Cena. The final \\"Universe Era\\" chapter focuses on the rise of Randy Orton and the returns of The Rock and Brock Lesnar. = The Streak mode = The game has a mode that focuses on The Undertaker's WrestleMania winning streak of 21 matches (21-0) at the time of the game's release. In \\"The Streak\\" mode, the player chooses to defend the streak as The Undertaker, battling waves of opponents, or to attempt to break it, with any character. When facing The Undertaker at WrestleMania, the difficulty level is higher than in any previous WWE game. The Undertaker can chokeslam the player if grappled at the head, submit the player with the Hell's Gate when The Undertaker is grounded and can appear once behind the player in an animation previously used for if the Undertaker interferes in a match, if he has a finisher stored. = WWE Universe mode = The sandbox mode, \\"WWE Universe\\", returns, though overhauled to a degree. Continuing the previous features, players get the option to customize existing WWE Shows, bring back retired series or create their own original shows and choose the superstars participating and the titles available. The ability to choose the status of a WWE superstar, whether assigned to one show, several, a legend or a free agent is also available. The ability to delete shows is once again present, as is a further renovated WWE statistics system. The ability to reset a Universe Mode, should it get too \\"clunky\\" is once again available. Continuing the ever expanding story mode options, WWE 2K14 offers the most control in customizing a player's \\"universe\\" by giving them more control over storylines through a new Rivalry Manager. Corroborating with the statistics tracker, the Rivalry Manager can stat-track all rivalries as well divide storylines into periods based on dates during which period the rivalry will continue depending on in- ring decisions. All previous storylines from earlier WWE games containing Universe Mode are present, but have been revamped to fit into the Rivalry Manager.  Marketing and release  Casey Collins, WWE Executive Vice President of Consumer Products, revealed on June 4 at the WWE Global Business Partner Summit, that The Rock would be featured on the cover of WWE 2K14.\\"The Rock lands on the cover of WWE 2K14 video game\\", from Wrestling-Online.com The official cover and trailer were revealed on the June 24 episode of WWE Raw.\\"Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler revealed the \\"WWE 2K14\\" cover\\" from WWE.com In July, The Ultimate Warrior was announced as a pre-order exclusive playable character. On August 1, 2K Games announced a special \\"Phenom Edition\\" which included Undertaker-themed extras, including the \\"American Badass\\" playable character. Downloadable content Three DLC packs were released for the game, focusing on the nWo, new superstars, and additional moves. Additionally, pre-order bonuses for Biker Undertaker and the Ultimate Warrior were made available to buy separate as well.  Reception  WWE 2K14 received positive reviews, with the Xbox 360 version receiving \\"generally favorable\\" reviews‚Äù, while the PS3 version received \\"average\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic which gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 75/100 based on 42 reviews and the PlayStation 3 version a score of 74/100 based on 21 reviews. IGN gave the game an 8.7 out of 10 saying \\"It still lacks the brains to deliver competent AI and commentators, but WWE 2K14 has more than enough brawn to make up for it. 30 Years of Wrestlemania provides the strongest campaign backbone the series has had in a long time, the in-ring action is faster and more fluid than it's been in years, and thanks to WWE 2K14s continually expanding creation suite, we're swimming in more options than we ever knew we wanted. It is indeed \\"time to play the game\\". GameSpot rated the game a 6 out of 10, saying that the game was clunky, \\"It's a shame the wrestling isn't up to par in WWE 2K14 because the elements surrounding it are so interesting‚Ä¶ For anyone who grew up loving professional wrestling, be prepared to be swept away in a tide of nostalgia. If only the core action could have been as compelling.\\" See also *List of licensed wrestling video games *List of fighting games *List of video games in the WWE 2K Games series *WWE 2K NotesReferencesExternal links * 2013 video games 2K Sports games Multiplayer and single-player video games WWE video games PlayStation 3 games Take-Two Interactive games Video games developed in Japan Video games developed in the United States Video games with AI-versus-AI modes Video games with user-generated gameplay content Video games with custom soundtrack support Xbox 360 games Yuke's games Professional wrestling games Video games using Havok ","title":"WWE 2K14"},{"id":"38585795","title":"FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2013 ‚Äì Men's sprint"},{"id":"38585797","title":"Asian Luge Cup"},{"id":"38585799","text":"Paschim Banga Gramin Bank (PBGB) is a 'premier Regional Rural Bank (RRB) in India.

The current system uses a 5-star rating system that awards points based on programming quality. The more points, the higher the rating and thus, the more 'stars' issued. If someone is providing child care of more than two children who are not related to them for more than four hours per day, the provider needs to be licensed by the State. History While all states have some regulations for center-based care, the rules differ and may span from simple health-related standards to more comprehensive rating systems that factor in child development and early childhood education guidelines. North Carolina's early regulatory attempts for Day care licenses were confusing to parents and difficult to navigate. The state had a two-tier system that listed centers who met minimum requirements as a level \\"A\\" provider. This was confusing to parents who believed that an \\"A\\" rating was the highest category available. In 1999, the state moved to the star system citing better clarification for parents and specific standards providers could strive to obtain. The newer star ratings were also meant to help recognize providers for their level of care. One star is the lowest rating while five stars is the highest. The system mandates both family centers (also called home child care) and child care centers located in commercial spaces. According to North Carolina statute: *Family or home child care can have a maximum of five preschool children in care and may reach the maximum of eight if three of those children are school-aged. *Child Care Centers provide for more than five preschool children and will be limited to a maximum based on total square footage of the center (indoor and outdoor) as well as sanitation, fire and possible zoning regulations that may be area- specific. Before switching regulatory guidelines in 1999, the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute/University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (FPG/UNC)was commissioned to evaluate whether the newly adopted star system would effectively mirror child care center quality. The team collected data from over 200 randomly selected child care centers across the state (not family care centers) just months before the new rules went into effect. The data collected was based on interviews from child care center directors and direct observations of child development practices based on Environment Ratings Scales (ERS). These scales were developed in 1980 by the FPG/UNC, improved by data over the years and now are considered a national standard. These standards included daily routines and activities as well as materials used in the classroom, interactions between teachers and students and the education and wages of teachers. The group then revisited the sample centers after the new star licensing rules took effect. Of the more than 200 centers originally included in the 1999 data collection, 84 child care centers had received the new star ratings by December 2000. Of these 84, the ERS measurements designated in 1999 were directly related to the star rating granted by the State of North Carolina in 2000. Therefore, early evidence showed that the new star rating system directly correlated to quality of child care. Since implementation, studies of the licensing program have been commissioned by North Carolina to evaluate the success of the program. National child care-related organizations such as the National Association of Child Care Research and Referral Agencies also provide reports cards on regulatory measures for North Carolina and other states. Concluding 2012, there were a total of 7646 licensed centers in North Carolina providing care to 251,798 children. How the star rating system works All centers licensed through the State of North Carolina must pass a one-star rating; however, both Home Care Centers and Child Care Centers can voluntarily choose to become licensed at the higher levels. There are certain exemptions to the regulatory rules. These exemptions include: * if the children within the home are related to each other and there is no more than two non-related children in the same care; * recreational programs that are run less than four consecutive months in a year; * programs that specialize in activities or instruction such as organized clubs, art or music lessons; * Drop-in or short-term care while the parents participate in a non-employment function such as health clubs, shopping, resorts or churches; * Public School programs or nonpublic schools accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as long as they operate for less than 6.5 hours per day; * Vacation Bible Schools; * Military bases, the Cherokee Indian Reservation or any federal property over which the federal government has jurisdiction or control. If an individual in North Carolina is considering taking care of two or more children who are not related to them for more than four hours a day and do NOT qualify for an exemption, the home or center must be regulated through the State. At a minimum, both family care and child care centers must have safe practices regarding transportation and discipline. NC law also specifies that parents have a right to enter the premises at any time while their child is in care at either a home or center-based facility. In addition to limits as to the number of children allowed in a home-based care center, a home being used for child care must be operated by someone deemed mentally competent over the age of 21. Likewise, all providers within that home must have undergone a criminal check and have current CPR and SIDS training. Child care centers have larger requirements such as curriculum and activity plans, health and safety certifications as well as space and equipment provisions. Providers who receive complaints substantiated by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Department of Child Development and Early Education could face fines or revocation of licensing. While the NC Division of Child Development and Early Education has statutory authority relating to childcare licenses, all providers must also pass local inspections including reviews by a local health department, fire and safety officials and child care nurses for immunization checks. Becoming licensed in North Carolina To become a licensed provider in North Carolina, an application must be filed with the North Carolina Division for Early Child Development and Early Education. This division is a part of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. There are two separate processes: one for a Family Child Care Home center and another for Child Care centers. Child care centers are assigned ratings by the State of North Carolina based on standards developed by the North Carolina Rated License Assessment Project (NCRLAP). Each rating is valid for three years; however, centers can apply to be assessed for a higher rating at any time. The NCLAP is housed at UNC Greensboro and employs licensing consultants and regional coordinators across the state. When a center requests an assessment, preliminary information is gathered prior to scheduling an organized site visit. During a site visit, two licensing agents observe the center - often in multiple classrooms and settings. Providers have access to many of the standards to be reviewed during the visit through the agency's \\"Additional Note s\\" feature so each center is aware of the expectations during a licensing visit. These \\"Additional Notes\\" are used as a primary resource for the assessment process in North Carolina. The classroom observation is supplemented by an interview with caregivers. Detailed reports are then provided by the license assessor within two weeks of the visit. Different standards are in place for different age groups. These standards range from hours of operation, ratios of adults to children that must be maintained at all times and sanitation requirements. * Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS) is specific to centers with children aged birth to 30 months. * Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ETERS) deals primarily with children over 2.4 years of age up to age 5. * Family Child Care Rating Scale and Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale (FCCERS) is used for centers that house multiple age groups in a home environment. * School-Age Care Environment Rating Scale (SACERS) is designed for centers who work with children aged 5 to 12. Points earned during the process are in direct correlation to observations made by the licensing assessor; however, education of the educators are taken into consideration as well. For family child care homes, coursework in early childhood education is taken into account with an Associate degree in Early Childhood Education considered the highest level of coursework. In child care centers, the more staff with early childhood education coursework or that show significant experience in the area, the higher the potential for point accrual toward licensing up to Bachelor's degrees. North Carolina licensing rules in relation to other states The 2010 US Census showed that nearly 7.4 million children under the age of five who had working mothers were in some form of care other than their parents. By elementary school age (considered ages 5 to 11) more than six percent of these children were home without adult supervision. All 50 states within the U.S. have some safety regulations in place for child care; however, they vary greatly regarding laws and compliance. Federal law has often implemented child care for low-income families through initiatives like Head Start and public subsidies for child care, but regulatory measures outside of those programs fall to each individual state. Likewise, every state that does regulate child care facilities may have different views of what constitutes a child care center, exemptions from the regulations and oversight actions. For instance, North Carolina requires a license within a home center if there are more than two non-related children being cared for more than four hours per day. South Dakota does not require licensing until there are more than 12 children in the home. The variances in program rules range from education requirements for a lead teacher to health and safety inspections. There is also a contrast between states in oversight of the centers. Statutory requirements within North Carolina continue to change from nuances in sanitation to how child care subsidies are administrated and paid throughout the state. As different advocacy groups highlight their causes such as child development research, childhood obesity or even after a death in child care is reported causing practices to be reviewed throughout the state, those issues are brought to state legislators for action.

Lam P√ºrevbat is the founder of the Zanabazar Mongolian Institute of Buddhist Art. He was born in 1965 in Bornuur in the T√∂v Province.Prince Claus Fund (2008) biography  Life  P√ºrevbat studied traditional Mongolian art at the National Art and Culture College in Ulan Bator. When he realized that the history of traditional thangka paintings originates in Tibetan Buddhism, he decided to become a Buddhist monk. Then he found two Mongolian connoisseurs of arts, the Damjiang Lama and the Dorje Zanchung Lama, who introduced him into this tradition.Byrne, Sue (oktober 2000) The Great Artistic Heritage of Mongolia In order to deepen his skills, he went for a study tour to Sanggye Yeshe, the official thangka painter of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, and Geshe Samten, a master in the making of mandalas. In this time he traveled extensively through the Himalayas, where he met great Tibetan masters in Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim. During his tour he collected source material and he acquainted himself intensively in Tibetan Buddhist iconography and econometrics. In fact, he followed the same tradition as one great Mongol artist and Buddhist clergyman had done so several centuries earlier, and to who bears now the name of his institute, to know Zanabazar. Artistically, P√ºrevbat is known for his conformity and his perseverance to essential authentic rules. Next to that, he is a great renewer as well, who has added modern disciplines and practices to his creations. His style, therefore, has been called dynamic and distinctive. Around 2008 P√ºrevbat worked on a publication of 23 volumes about art history and techniques. His work overall has led to a revival of activities and the spreading of art and culture in Mongolia.  Zanabazar Mongolian Institute  The Zanabazar Mongolian Institute of Buddhist Art is a part of the Gandantegchinlen Monastery in Ulan Bator. The monastery was destroyed in 1937 by the communists, as what happened to around 1,000 other monasteries in that era as well. P√ºrevbat decided that the monastery had to be rebuilt again, in which he succeeded in the course of years with the help of his disciples.Gonschior, Thomas (2004) Buddha's Painter, A Renaissance of Mongolian Art, online film on P√ºrevbat and his disciples With the Zanabazar Mongolian Institute P√ºrevbat regularly organizes exhibitions on painting, sculpture, appliqu√©, architecture and dance. Furthermore, he founded a school to educate artists and art teachers to educate in these professions. Furthermore, the institute documents historic places of discoveries, organizes restorations and reintroduces festivals that had vanished caused by the Mongolian regime of the 20th Century.  Acknowledgement  In 2004 Thomas Gonschior made a 55 minutes documentary film on P√ºrevbat and his disciples, called Buddha's Painter, A Renaissance of Mongolian Art. The documentary film was first shown on the Globians Film Festival in Berlin in 2005. In 2008 P√ºrevbat was honored with a Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands, within the theme Culture and the human body. The jury rewarded him for \\"the rigorous authenticity of his methods and techniques, for re-establishing an important ‚Äòun-modern‚Äô aesthetic practice, for his dedication and generosity in fostering future generations, and for nurturing local identity through artistic tradition and culture.\\"  References  External links  *Purevbat.de, Lam Purevbat - A Mongolian spiritual teacher, cultural leader, and master artist Mongolian painters Tibetan Buddhists from Mongolia Buddhist teachers Museum directors Living people 1965 births People from T√∂v Province 20th-century Mongolian painters 21st-century Mongolian painters ","title":"Gankh√º√ºgiin P√ºrevbat"},{"id":"38585872","text":"Tom Patricola, Ann Pennington & George White George White (15 April 1891 ‚Äì 11 November 1968) was an American theatrical and film producer and director who also was an actor, choreographer, composer, dancer, dramatist, lyricist and screenwriter, as well as a Broadway theater-owner. Biography Born Eassy White in New York City (other sources claim his birth name as \\"George Weitz\\" and his birthplace as Toronto, Canada; he performed under all three names), White started his career as part of a dance team with partner Benny Ryan, performing in the burlesque circuit. He appeared in supporting roles in many Broadway shows, but it was his appearance in Florenz Ziegfeld's Ziegfeld Follies that would provide the impetus for his own career as a theatrical impresario on Broadway.\\"George White\\", PBS, accessed October 7, 2015 White appeared in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1911 and 1915; in the latter show, he popularized the Turkey Trot dance. He launched his Ziegfeld Follies imitation, the George White's Scandals, in 1919. Scandals provided audiences with popular songs, comic sketches, eccentric dancers and his own version of the Ziegfeld girls. Though not as grand as the Ziegfeld Follies, his Scandals were quite successful. The shows, which were micromanaged by White and reflected his tastes, were fast-paced and featured a lot of dancing. White reached the apogee of his Broadway career with the 1926 edition of Scandals, which ran for 424 performances. The Black Bottom, danced by Ziegfeld Follies star Ann Pennington and Tom Patricola, touched off a national dance craze. However, by the time he produced his last staging of Scandals in 1939, the show was derided by critics as being old-fashioned. In addition to his Scandals and George White's Music Hall Varieties (essentially Scandals under a different name), White also produced several book musicals and legitimate plays on Broadway. White also was a movie director, producer and screenwriter. He produced the movies Flying HIgh (1931), George White's Scandals (1934) George White's 1935 Scandals (1935) and George White's Scandals (1945), and directed the 1934 and 1935 celluloid versions of his Scandals. He also appeared in and took screenwriting credit for the 1934 and 1935 pictures. he also received screenwriting credits for the movies Ziegfeld Follies (1945) and Duffy's Tavern (1945). In 1946, White was involved in a hit-and-run automobile accident in which two people died. He was sentenced to nine months in prison. Freed from jail, White tried to turn Scandals into a show that would tour the nightclub circuit. The venture failed and he went bankrupt. His attempt to open a nightclub in Las Vegas also failed. White died aged 77 from leukemia in 1968 in Hollywood, California and was interred in Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park in North Hollywood.

One of the problems was that the district failed to advance to subsequent short-term objectives, after the student met the prerequisite objectives. The Hearing Office found a denial of FAPE with respect to 4 IEP goals, ordered 90 hours of compensatory education, and rejected all other claims. As the Hearing Office noted, the district did not begin working with the student on his second short-term objectives related to color matching, photo matching, shape matching until November 2012, despite the fact the student had mastered the first short-term objectives for all three of these goals in September 2012.

While in prep school in Washington, D.C., Ratiff was named a McDonald's All-American in 1977 while attending Eastern High School. He was one of the most highly touted recruits in the nation. As a senior, Ratiff averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, 6 assists, and 5 blocks per game. For a time, Virginia Tech thought they were going to sign him as a recruit. Ratiff ended up choosing Tennessee instead. In 1977‚Äì78, he spent his freshman season playing for the Volunteers and averaged 5.4 points and four rebounds per game. He decided to transfer after one year, citing an undesirable social climate in Knoxville as well as unrealistic expectations by the media for trying to make him out to be the next Bernard King, a former Tennessee great. After sitting out one season due to transfer eligibility rules, Ratiff spent his final three collegiate years at his home city's Howard University. He garnered much success there: in all three seasons he was named an All-MEAC First Team selection, was a three-time All-MEAC Tournament First Team pick, and in his sophomore and junior years was named the MEAC Player of the Year.

Ebersold was an artist and the inventor of Contemporary Cloisonn√©. He was born in Santa Monica, California in 1943 and died in March 1976, from cystic fibrosis. He grew up in Vista, California were his family moved to in 1946, when he was just two. He spent most of his life in Vista, where he attended school, worked and lived for 23 years. Vista was also the place he met his lifelong friend, Margaret Tiefenthaler, who helped and supported him with his artwork.  His Work  Ebersold's original art form Contemporary Cloisonn√© took him ten years of experimentation to perfect. His art was inspired by the Asian art of Cloisonn√©. Oriental Cloisonn√© is a process that places tiny wires or strips of either copper, brass, gold or silver in shapes, they then have vitreous enamel placed in between forming the picture for the design. Mr. Ebersold was celebrated throughout the South-west for Contemporary Cloisonn√©. He began his career in the late 1960s using traditional Oriental Cloisonn√© and modern materials to produce works of intricate detail and vivid colour. His subjects range from Egyptian and Mayan to South-western themes. Ebersold would generally use copper wire in his work as he preferred the look of it and it was cheaper than other types of wire. Once he created his work, that included the copper wire, he would get it costume framed by The Frame House in Oceanside, California. The frame would then be backed with a simple paper bag. Usually he obtained these from the supermarket; Safeway Inc.. He would also attach a tag that gave advice on how to display and look after each piece as well as a small bit of information on the work. Tom Ebersold would spend long periods of time working on each piece, making it perfect. This meant each work of art could take hours, especially with all the small pieces of wire he would include. However this was not a problem because although the majority of the work was done by Ebersold, he had help from Margaret and her two daughters Sonja and Ingrid Soyland. The two young girls enjoyed making what they called petals, to add to Ebersold's work. These petals would be tear drop shapes that are featured in works such as the piece that includes an image of an oriental pot and a quail. Sadly the title for this work is unknown.  The Life and Death of Tom Ebersold  Thomas Ebersold went to Vista High School and the University of California. He studied art throughout his high school years and at University. He received a bachelor's degree in design from the University of California. Once he left university he began travelling around the world, gaining ideas and inspiration from the places and cultures he experienced. When he returned to his home to Vista, he began creating his artwork and served as a photographer for The Vista Press. He was a photographer for many years and an artist for many more. He continued his artwork until the end. Thomas G. Ebersold died at the age of 32 in 1976 from cystic fibrosis, but at the time was the longest living person with the disease.  Ebersold's Parents  Raymond Ebersold was Thomas Ebersold's father and served consecutively on the Historical Society board of directors from 1980 until his voluntary retirement in June 2008. He was honoured for his many years of service at the January 2008 board meeting. Ray left his job with Douglas Aircraft at the end of World War II and with his wife Harriet and son Tom came to Vista in 1946 when, as Ray recalled, ‚ÄúVista Way was gravel all the way to the ocean.‚Äù Ray and Harriet were married in 1940. After World War II, they discovered Vista, ‚Äúa quiet place with an exceptional climate,‚Äù and purchased six acres on Alta Vista Drive at Crescent Drive. They ran the community's largest rabbitry for several years and lived in their Alta Vista Drive home for 26 years. They later moved to a home on Escondido Avenue and then for 27 years lived at Grandview Terrace Mobile Estates on Sycamore Avenue. The couple was active in the Farm Bureau and the Rabbit Club in the 1940s and 1950s, in the Community Church of Vista for many years, and in the 100-member North County Dance Club. They also belonged to the Vista Trailer Club and travelled extensively. Raymond Ebersold is survived by his wife of 69 years, Harriet. Services were held at Community Church on Tuesday, March 23.

It is scored for SATB choir and soloists, violin I, violin II, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones colla parte, 2 timpani, and basso continuo (violoncello, double bass, and organ, with optional bassoon obbligato). The setting was composed for liturgical use in the Salzburg Cathedral. The title \\"de confessore\\" was not Mozart's own, and was added by a later hand to his manuscript. It suggests that the work was intended for vespers held on a specific day on the liturgical calendar of saints (\\"confessors\\"); however, the saint in question has not been conclusively established. This was Mozart's final choral work composed for the cathedral. Structurally, it is very similar to Vesperae solennes de Dominica (K. 321), composed in 1779. The setting is divided into 6 movements; as in Dominica, a setting of the Minor Doxology (Gloria Patri) concludes all movements, each recapitulating the opening themes. The first three psalms are scored in a bold, exuberant manner, contrasting with the strict, stile antico counterpoint of the a cappella fourth psalm, and the tranquility of the fifth movement. The Magnificat sees a return to the style of the opening settings. # Dixit Dominus (Psalm 110) Allegro vivace, C major, 3/4 # Confitebor tibi Domine (Psalm 111) Allegro, E-flat major, common time # Beatus vir qui timet Dominum (Psalm 112) Allegro vivace, G major, 3/4 # Laudate pueri Dominum (Psalm 113) Allegro, D minor, cut common time # Laudate Dominum omnes gentes (Psalm 117) Andante, F major, 6/8 #: Mozart departs from the structure of K. 321 in this movement. The earlier setting of Laudate Dominum is a highly melismatic soprano solo, with no choral interlude. In K. 339, the soprano solo is much simpler; the choir quietly enters at the conclusion of the psalm with the Gloria Patri, and the soloist rejoins them at the Amen. #: This movement is well known outside the context of the larger work, and is often performed in isolation. #Magnificat (Canticle for Vespers) Andante, C major, common time #:‚Äî\\"Et exultavit...\\" Allegro, C major, common time References External links   * Steiner, R., Falconer, K., Kirsch, W., & Bullivant, R.

History In 1877, Prescott School District was founded when voters approved a two and a half mill school tax. In 1880, Thomas Allen donated the block of land between West 2nd, West 3rd, West Elm, and West Vine Streets to the school district and shortly thereafter, a two story frame building was constructed. Prof. G.A. Hayes of Texarkana was elected as the schools first principal. In 1902, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas C. McRae donated land to the school district for an African American school. From 1924 to 1931, the school held classes for grades 1 through 8. By 1932, classes extended to the tenth grade and in 1939, McRae High School graduated its first twelfth grade student. In 1969, Prescott and McRae Schools were joined through integration and McRae Middle School was named in their honor.http://www.ark- ives.com/documenting/manuscripts/fulldetail.aspx?id=383 In the early 1950s, Thomas Allen Elementary, Jr. High and High School were moved to a larger property that is located on Martin Street, southeast of downtown Prescott. The new campus allowed consolidation of facilities and room for expansion. New Elementary, Middle, and High School buildings were constructed, a football stadium and a new gymnasium were added, and the new facilities were named after the City of Prescott. Due to its rural setting, Prescott's athletic participants were originally known as the 'Aggie's', but since 1933, the district and its schools have employed the unique mascot and athletic name of the Curley Wolves. The name originated from an Arkansas Gazette reporter asking Little Rock High School coach Earl Quigley what he thought of the 1933 Prescott football team after they upset the larger Little Rock 'Tigers' team. The phrase \\"Curley Wolves\\" was quickly adopted by student body assembly the following day.

According to the Stephens school district's attorney, Clay Fendley, there was, in the words of Mike McNeill of the Magnolia Reporter, \\"bitterness\\" resulting from the McNeil consolidation. =Dissolution= In the 2010‚Äì2011, 2011‚Äì2012, 2012‚Äì2013, and 2013‚Äì2014 school years, respectively, the district had 355, 333, 344, and 314 students.See preview Under Arkansas law it was required to be shut down and consolidated into a larger district because it had fewer than 350 students for two consecutive years. Findley stated that the Stephens district failed to find another school district that was willing to consolidate with Stephens. The Stephens district had until March 1, 2014, to voluntarily consolidate. Since no voluntary merger was arranged, the Arkansas Board of Education was to determine whether and how the Stephens district would be consolidated or dissolved. Findley asked the board to have the district consolidated with the Nevada County School District in an effort to keep the Stephens School campus open. Whitney Moore, a lawyer representing the Camden Fairview School District, the Magnolia School District, and the Nevada School District, instead advocated for breaking the Stephens district into three parts and giving one part to each of those three districts. The state board opted against keeping the Stephens district together and instead pursued a plan to break the district into three parts; this meant the Stephens School would not have enough students to remain open. McNeil residents favored the split-up proposal since their children could go to school in Magnolia, which is closer to McNeil than Stephens. In April 2014 the state education board voted 5‚Äì2 to dissolve the Stephens School District, with Alice Mahoney and Toyce Newton opposing. One board member, Joe Black, was not present for the decision. The district was divided along county boundaries, with assets and debts given according to the area that the property was located in. The portion of the district in Ouachita County was assigned to Camden Fairview, which took ownership of the Stephens School District facilities in Stephens. The portion in Columbia County, serving McNeil and the surrounding area, was given to the Magnolia district. The portion in Nevada County was assigned to the Nevada county district. The numbers of students moved to these districts were about 140 and about 160 for the first two, respectively, while the number of students in Nevada County was smaller. The district was dissolved on July 1, 2014. According to Mike McNeill, the expected outcome was that the Camden Fairview district would give the Stephens school property to the Stephens city government.

Stations were opened in Elat, Lolodorf, Metet, Foulassi, Yaound√©, Bafia, Abong Mbang, Batouri and Momjepom. By 1894 the Bible and hymns were translated to the Bulu language. During the first world war the administration of the country passed into British hands and the German and Swiss missionaries were called back. This had a tragic effect on the work of the mission, but a small group of faithful people continued the work, making the church a truly indigenous one. In 1925 European missionaries began returning to the country. The second world war again disrupted church life, which was however followed by a period of intense activity and growth. The church became autonomous in 1957, at which time there were 69 000 members.Eglise presbyt√©rienne camerounaise, Reformiert Online. A new constitution was drawn up and adopted, marking the autonomy of the church. It consists of three parts: basic principles, organization, worship and life. PCC is the biggest English-speaking Church in Cameroon, with its headquarters in Buea. The church runs 27 Presbyteries and is estimated to have one million members.Presbyterian Church in Cameroon (PCC), Evangelical Mission in Solidarity. Theology The church adheres to the Apostles Creed, the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Nicene Creed and the Heidelberg Catechism. Activities Graduation ceremony at Cameroon Christian University (CCU) The church missionaries are active in the whole territory of the country. There are parishes in France, Switzerland and in the neighbouring Gabon. The church runs four general hospitals, a rehabilitation center for leprosy patients, 17 health centres, a central pharmacy and other health facilities. Much emphasis is placed on primary health care in the villages. In the educational field the church has 35 nursery schools, 137 primary schools, 16 secondary or high schools, one technical school and a teacher training college.Presbyterian Church in Cameroon, Alliance of Religions and Conservation (pdf). There is also a centre for agricultural and employment training. The pastors receive their training at the theological seminary in Kumba (66 students in 2004/05). Some are still being trained outside Cameroon, in Africa and overseas. The church had begun a university in 2007 called the Cameroon Christian University, CCU. The church has departments for women, men and youth. The radio and communication department runs its own radio station, the Christian Broadcasting Service in Buea, with branches and reporters all over the nation. It also runs two major church centers in the country, in Bamenda and Kumba with a third soon to be in Douala. The PCC has joined other Protestant churches in Cameroon to address common issues of an educational, social, political as well as spiritual nature. It supports and promotes the information and eradication of HIV/AIDS and has a very strong policy statement on the issue. A few years back the PCC celebrated one hundred years of the gospel in the Grassland, in Ntanfoang, Bali, where the first Basel missionaries settled. The church also celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2007: the Golden Jubilee of its autonomy. The church runs one of the biggest printing presses in the country, has bookshops as one of its evangelical tools and also hostels to help students provide lower rates in university towns.

As of the 2016‚Äì17 school year, the Ackerman Charter School District serves approximately 587 students.  History  The Ackerman School District and Bowman School were established in 1895 and has served as a focal point for the Bowman community since its establishment. When widening of the interstate cut a swathe through the area, the school remained to keep the community intact. Placer County's Bowman community, the intersection of mini marts and mountain homes, agriculture and fast food huts, sees traffic move to and from the Sierras. Behind the franchised facades and small one of a kind cafes are residential neighborhoods that date back to the days of the Gold Rush. Settled in the mid 1800s, the community of Bowman was an outgrowth of the regions‚Äô mining camps. Sitting on the bluffs above the North Fork of the American River, this area proved more suitable for raising cattle and growing fruit than for mining gold. The village of Bowman, a country store and post office was firmly established with a spur from the Central Pacific Railroad. The school, originally a one-room school building topped by a wood shingled bell tower, was opened to serve the growing population which included dairy farmers, cattle ranchers, and fruit growers. Berries, especially raspberries and strawberries were some of the richest crops, although apples, pears, and peaches were also planted.

Early life and education Khatami was born in Rasht in 1920. His father was a tea house owner and later dealt with real estate. His mother was a relative of Imam Jomeh, a significant religious figure in Tehran and a relative of Nasr ed Din Shah. After graduating from the American High School in Tehran, Khatami then attended the military high school. In 1939, he began to study at the air force branch of the military college and graduated as a second lieutenant. Next he went to the United Kingdom and joined pilot training courses. He graduated from the Royal Air Force College Cranwell. He was also trained at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, Germany, in the 1950s. Shahpour Gholam Reza Pahlavi (left) and Mohammad Khatami Career In 1946, Khatami was named personal pilot of the Shah. Days before the 19 August 1953 coup on 16 August, the Shah, accompanied by his second wife Sorayya Esfandiary Bakhtiari and Aboul Fath Atabay, escaped from Iran to Iraq and then to Italy by a plane aviated by Khatami. In 1957, Khatami was appointed chief of staff for the imperial air force. He succeeded Hedayat Gilanshah in the post following the latter's death in a plane crash. Khatami served in this post until his death in 1975. In addition, he served as the chairman of the board of the Iranian National Airlines and chief of the council of the Civil Aviation Department. He was also co-owner of a construction company. Personal life Khatami married twice. His first spouse was his cousin with whom he had a daughter. She was killed in an accident in 1954. Then Khatami married Princess Fatimeh Pahlavi on 22 November 1959, half-sister of the Shah. The Shah and his then fianc√©e Farah Diba attended the wedding ceremony. They had two sons, Kambiz (born 1961) and Ramin (born 1967), and a daughter, Pari (born 1962). A declassified CIA report argues that Khatami was close to Hossein Fardoust and Taqi Alavikia, and that they were part of a dowreh, or circle of associates. The dowreh, along with familial relations, was a significant element in the political functioning of Iran in the Pahlavi era. Until his death, Khatami raised his wealth to nearly $100 million. Death Khatami died in a kiting accident on 12 September 1975 in Dezful. His death has been considered to be mysterious and the Shah was implicated in his death.

He was convicted of corruption, sentenced to death, and is currently awaiting execution.

Zanjani was claimed to be \\"a key facilitator for Iranian oil deals and transferring oil-related money\\". He denied the accusation, declining any ties with the Iranian government and calling the Europeans' decision \\"a mistake\\". The EU sanctions against Iran describe Zanjani as \\"a key facilitator for Iranian oil deals\\" and transferring oil related money and accused the Malaysia-based First Islamic Bank of being used to channel Iranian oil-related payments. Zanjani said the complex nature of his companies' transactions, involving large sums, might have misled EU authorities.

He called the passport's copy \\"fake\\", saying in an interview with the news website of Rahahan F.C., his football team: \\"This story [the copy of my passport] is too badly fabricated that they even put my picture on the passport without a tie.

He was accused of embezzling more than ‚Ç¨2.7 billion, involving, among others, the National Bank of Tajikistan. Some days later, a spokesman from the National Bank of Tajikistan denied any cooperation between Zanjani and the bank and claimed all documents presented by Zanjani about their two-way communications were fake.

Until January 2015, Kepler-37 was the smallest star to be measured via asteroseismology. Planetary system Kepler-37b is the closest planet to the Kepler-37. At the time of its discovery in February 2013, it was the smallest known exoplanet. At in diameter, it is slightly larger than the Moon. It orbits Kepler-37 once every 13 days at a distance of about 0.1 astronomical units (AU). Kepler-37b has a rocky surface and is believed to be too small and too close to its star to support water or maintain an atmosphere. Surface temperature is estimated at . Kepler-37c is around three- quarters of the diameter of Earth and orbits approximately every 21 days at a distance of just under 0.14 AU. Kepler-37d is about twice the diameter of Earth. It orbits in around 40 days at a distance of nearly 0.21 AU. Neither is able to support water due to their proximity to Kepler-37. The periods of the three inner planets are close (within one per cent) to a 5:8:15 mean-motion resonance relationship. =Discovery= The Kepler planets were discovered in September 2012 with the aid of transit events detected by the Kepler space telescope, and announced to the public in February 2013. Computer simulation was used to rule out other astronomical phenomenon mimicking planetary transit with probabilities of error <0.05% (3œÉ) for each potential planet. Additionally, simulation demonstrated that the proposed planetary configuration was stable. The exoplanets were considerably smaller than any previously detected, leading Science World Reports to state that \\"a major technological improvement for the telescope\\" had been achieved. Thomas Barclay, an astrophysicist on the Kepler space telescope team, said the discovery was \\"really good news\\" in the search for hospitable planets, a prime objective of the project, because it demonstrated the telescope was capable of detecting Earth-sized planets. However, he does not anticipate finding many planets as small as Kepler-37b due to the very small amount of light such planets obscure. According to NASA scientist Jack Lissauer, the discovery of Kepler-37b \\"suggests such little planets are common, and more planetary wonders await as we continue to gather and analyze additional data.\\" Astronomer John Johnson of Caltech university said the discovery would have been \\"unimaginable\\" a few years ago and that the telescope had revolutionized astronomers' picture of the universe. The asteroseismology work was, in part, paid for by White Dwarf Research Corporation, a crowd funded non-profit organization. In 2014, a fourth planet with orbital period of 51 days was confirmed through transit timing variations. Previously this signal was thought to be a false positive.

Berryman Wheeler Edwards, a graduate of Harvard Law School (1853), Confederate veteran, and state senator (1886‚Äì89). It remained in the Edwards family until the 1990s. According to local tradition, the Wilds-Edwards house was not destroyed by General William T. Sherman's army during the Campaign of the Carolinas because Klickner was in the detachment sent to burn Darlington and he persuaded the captain of the raiding company to delay its destruction. In the meantime, the Union troops encountered General Joseph Wheeler's cavalry and were unable to return to burn Darlington.Carl Julien and James McBride Dabbs, Pee Dee Panorama (Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina Press, 1951), p. 116.

He was also known as 'Blackbird'. Assiginack is thought to have been at what is now Harbor Springs, Michigan. Early in life he studied at a Sulpician school in lower Canada where he became a Catholic. He seems to have fought with the British at Michilimackinac and Praries du Chien during the War of 1812. In July 1813, Assiginack and Captain Matthew Elliott led a band of Ottawas to the Niagara peninsula. There they added to the British infantry and fought in the Beaver Dams battle. Possibly, Assiginack was subsequently honored with medals for his role in the war. Starting in 1815 he was an interpreter for the British Government on Drummond Island. Starting in 1827 he returned to Harbor Springs to work as a Catholic missionary, hoping a priest would soon join him, but had to carry out the efforts of Catholicizing the local Ojibwe population all on his own. After the war, in 1815, the Indian Department at Drummond Island hired Assiginack as an interpreter. There he met Captain Thomas Gummersall Anderson, and a long friendship grew between the two men. Assiginack's command of several Indian dialects proved a crucial asset for the Indian Department‚Äôs operations in the northern Great Lakes area. After the 1828 transfer of Drummon Island to the United States Assiginack lead a large number of Ojibwe to relocate to Penetanguishene. In 1832 he relocated to Coldwater, Ontario. He had continued his Catholic evangelizing activities, and at Coldwater convinced John Aisance to switch from being a Methodist to being a Catholic. Starting in 1836 Assiginack was the leading Ojibwe in the area around Manitowaning. He generally supported various British treaties over the coming years. In 1862 he was the leading spokesman for the British treaty while one of his sons, Edowishkosh, was a leading spokesman for the opposition faction based around Wikwemikong.

Background On November 27, 2012 Prodigy announced an upcoming collaboration album with producer The Alchemist via his Twitter account, along with the title of Albert Einstein. He also would say the album was scheduled for an early 2013 release. It would be their second collaboration album after 2007's Return of the Mac. In November 2012, when speaking about the album with Complex Prodigy described it as a concept album. On April 7, 2013 The Alchemist revealed via Twitter that the album had been completed. Then on April 12, 2013, the album's official track listing was revealed. The album contains 16 tracks and features guest appearances by Roc Marciano, Domo Genesis, Havoc, Raekwon, and Action Bronson. Release and promotion The first single, \\"Give ‚ÄòEm Hell\\" was released on January 28, 2013 via Prodigy's SoundCloud page. The song features vocals by Prodigy and was produced by The Alchemist. The album was originally scheduled to be released on May 14, 2013, but Amazon.com would later reveal a release date for the album of June 11, 2013. The second song released in promotion of the album would be \\"Dough Pildin'\\" on May 12, 2013. On June 4, 2013, the music video was released for \\"Y.N.T.\\" featuring Domo Genesis. The music video for \\"Dough Pildin'\\" was released on June 17, 2013. On June 25, 2013, the music video was released for \\"Give ‚ÄòEm Hell\\". On February 3, 2014, the music video was released for \\"IMDKV\\". Critical response Albert Einstein was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 7 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

He is currently the President and Managing Member of The Flowers Counsel Group, LLC, one of the region's largest minority-owned corporate law firms (he founded the firm in 2006) that specializes in corporate procurement, transactions and mergers & acquisitions for Global and Fortune 500 clients and colleges & universities.http://www.flowerscounselgroup.com The firm has offices in Massachusetts and Delaware. Flowers also serves as Deputy Legal Counsel of the Massachusetts Democratic Party under James Roosevelt Jr. (grandson of former U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and Co-Chair of the Democratic National Committee's Rules Committee). In October 2014, Flowers married Megan Elizabeth Lallier at the historic Quechee Inn at Marshland Farms in Vermont; the couple has one child.  Early life and education  Flowers is the youngest child of Ltc. Chipman Flowers Sr., a retired Army officer, and C. Jean Johnson Flowers, a former teacher and guidance counselor for the U.S. Department of Defense Dependent Schools. Flowers' father was commissioned by General Daniel \\"Chappie\\" James, the nation's first African-American four-star general officer in the United States.  Early life  As the son of a military officer, Flowers traveled extensively in his youth, attending public schools in Dallas, Texas, Lawton, Oklahoma, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended middle and high school in Italy while his father was stationed overseas. He is a graduate of Vicenza American High School in Vicenza, Italy. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1996, earning a bachelor's degree in economics, and then attended Georgetown University, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree and a Master of Business Administration in 2000. While attending Georgetown, Flowers worked at the A. Philip Randolph Institute, the Congressional Joint Economic Committee and in the White House Office of Political Affairs during the Clinton administration. Flowers later studied at the Harvard Kennedy School where he earned a Master of Public Administration and received the Don K. Price Award for academic excellence and public service.  Career  After graduating from Georgetown, Flowers began his legal career in Delaware in the Wilmington office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, LLP, where he worked as a mergers and acquisition attorney. He served as chairman of the Multicultural Judges and Lawyers Section of the Delaware State Bar Association. Flowers worked as the Chief Democratic Analyst for Delaware Tonight, a nightly news program on WHYY-TV, where he served until the show was cancelled. In 2006, Flowers founded Flowers Counsel Group, LLC, a corporate law firm that specializes in mergers and acquisitions and procurement law. The firm, which is one of the region's largest minority-owned corporate law firms, provides corporate purchasing services for international and Fortune 500 companies, as well as the nation's leading academic institutions and has represented clients in transactions totaling in excess of $1 billion.  Treasurer of Delaware = Campaign and election = In 2010, after a largely self-financed campaign, Flowers won the Democratic primary for Delaware State Treasurer against incumbent Velda Jones-Potter, who was appointed by Governor Jack Markell to serve the remainder of his term, with 54.3 percent of the vote. His platform, entitled ‚ÄúThe Flowers Framework for Restoring Prosperity,‚Äù included a \\"Financial Warning System\\" that aimed to categorize economic conditions using a color scheme. Additionally, Flowers proposed a \\"Hometown Tax Credit\\" that encouraged businesses to hire from Delaware schools. In the general election in November 2010, Flowers defeated Colin R. Bonini, a three- term Republican state senator from the Dover area, 153,203 to 147,031. Flowers, elected at the age of 35, became the first African-American elected to serve in Delaware and was the youngest statewide elected official during his term. = Term = During 2011, his first year in office, Flowers restructured the Delaware State Treasury into four distinct offices and began publishing the Delaware Economic Index. He implemented the Delaware Early Warning System, a financial warning system that rates the health of the state's economy. Within 90 days of assuming office, Flowers also was confronted with the challenge of deciding whether to remove hundreds of millions of uncollateralized state funds from a potential failing financial institution, Wilmington Trust, that failed to meet the state's standards for holding deposits prior to his assuming office. To resolve the issue, Flowers ordered the failing financial institution to move state funds into federally insured transaction accounts and proposed major reforms to diversify the state's assets by spreading state deposits throughout multiple financial institutions to reduce risk - a decision that was not supported by Governor Jack Markell and his appointees on the Cash Management Policy Board who desired to keep the money in the failing financial institution (many of Wilmington Trust's senior executives were eventually indicted by the federal government for making false and misleading statements in public filings relating to the health of the institution).http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/08/05/former- wilm-trust-president-robert-harra-indicted/31172977/ Though his actions to reduce the state's exposure to the failing financial institution was viewed as necessary and proper by many in the financial community and among his fellow Treasurers, it created tension with Governor Markell and the Cash Management Policy Board that lasted throughout his term. That year he was elected to the Executive Committee of the National Association of State Treasurers, representing the treasurers of the Eastern states. He donated his entire first year salary of over $100,000 to fund two fellowships at the Treasury in partnership with United Way of Delaware. = Cash Management Policy Board debate = During 2012, Flowers and Governor Markell debated over the role of the state's Cash Management Policy Board and the need for ‚Äúopen and competitive‚Äù contracts in securing the state's investment managers. Flowers contended that the board's investment decisions had led to lower than average returns on the state's investment portfolio and the state needed to engage new investment managers on an open and competitive basis to increase returns and reduce fees. Markell and his aides, in supporting the board (the Governor appoints most of the members of the Policy Board), claimed that Flowers was attempting to usurp the board's traditional responsibilities to hire fund managers and make decisions about investment policies. Flowers commissioned a report by Credit Suisse Securities USA, LLC, which determined that the rate of return on the state's portfolio lagged behind the returns realized by similar states. He authored an article that summarized his position. That same year, he increased the returns of the portfolio by $4 million. Flowers, under a revamped model, made over $55 million for the State of Delaware during his term. Following publication of the Credit Suisse report,Credit Suisse report the state Treasury began reallocating assets. In October 2012, the Treasury and the board reached agreement to diversify the state's assets, increase the number of investment managers and require them to meet certain financial performance benchmarks. The Treasury also negotiated a lower fee structure. = Financial education and protection of state deposits = In May 2012, the White House commended Delaware and two other state treasuries, for their efforts to promote financial literacy, praising both the Delaware Economic Index and the Prosperity Portal, a web-based repository of information on financial topics. In early 2013, all three major rating agencies (Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch) awarded a AAA rating to Delaware's bonds. Later in 2012, when the federal Transaction Account Guarantee (\\"TAG\\") Program was set to expire, Flowers made a decision to secure Delaware's state deposits by requiring banks holding state funds to post collateral for state accounts with the Federal Reserve (prior to taking office, Delaware was one of a couple of states that did not require state funds to be collateralized by its financial institutions).http://www.treasury.de.gov This action protected hundreds of millions of state funds and is viewed as one of his major achievements of his term. = Honest Way proposal = In January 2013, Flowers held a major press conference proposing a series of reforms called the \\"Honest Way\\" proposals to reform Delaware's financial system - particularly, the operations of the state's Cash Board. Under the Honest Way proposals, Flowers proposed that members of the state's Cash Board would have to file annual financial disclosures (the Cash Board was only required to file disclosures when initially appointed to the Cash Board with no annual update requirement), meet at least quarterly in the management of the state's investments (the Cash Board was only required to meet twice a year), recuse from votes where members have a conflict (the Cash Board had no policy that required its members to recuse from votes where the members had a personal interest), require term limits (some of the Cash Board members had served since the early 80s) and prohibit Cash Board members from making political contributions from elected officials having a role in the state's finances. Flowers stated the impetus of the proposals was the one of the Cash Board members, who had given significant funds to the Governor's campaign and his political action committee, had requested the Treasury place state funds in financial institutions based on his personal interest, not the best interest of the state.http://delawareway.blogspot.com/2014/04/chip-flowers-soldiers-on- against-jack.html The proposals resulted in months of public debate regarding the role of the Cash Board, with the Governor and Democratic leaders of the legislature opposing the proposed reforms. During the press conference, Flowers stated, \\"I want to work with an honorable Board operating with integrity, not a corrupt Board seeking to use your money for their advantage...I want to do it the right way, not the corrupt way.\\" In February 2013, in a rare vote, Flowers almost achieved a major upset when the state's Republican caucus in the House of Representatives joined some Democrats causing a tie vote for a reform measure sponsored by State Rep. John Kowalko that would have immediately adopted the annual financial disclosure requirement for the Cash Board over opposition from the Governor and the Speaker of the House of Representatives (ultimately, the reforms were sent to a committee of the state legislature for review). However, as political payback, the Governor and Democratic leaders of the legislature introduced legislation to reduce the powers of the State Treasurer. Flowers refused to back down and ultimately, certain portions of the Honest Way reforms were adopted by the state's General Assembly. In February 2014, Flowers released The Fourth Report on the Delaware State Treasury, which noted over 35 accomplishments during his tenure, highlighted by the state portfolio returning over $44 million (including positive returns 30 out of 37 months), measures to protect the state's portfolio and a $400,000 reduction in annual fees. Despite his accomplishments and potential for re-election success after strong debate performances against his primary opponent, in August 2014, Flowers held a press conference, which was broadcast live in the state, announcing his decision not to seek re-election for a second term citing exhaustion in constantly battling \\"lies and deception\\" by his former deputy Erika Jane MacZuba Benner (aka, Erika Benner, Jane Benner, Erika MacZuba or Erika MacZuba Benner).http://www.chipflowers.com Flowers removed MacZuba Benner from office in January 2014 after it was revealed that she made over 30 personal charges on her state credit card totaling in excess of $6,000 (over a two-year period) in violation of state policy without the knowledge of Flowers.http://treasury.delaware.gov/treasurer-chip-flowers-responds-to-audit- report/ One of MacZuba Benner's personal charges on her state credit card was a Stubhub charge for football game tickets where she invited Flowers to attend the game by misleading him to believe that the tickets were owned by her family as season tickets.http://www.WDEL.com MacZuba Benner misled Flowers, Treasury investigators and law enforcement authorities for almost a year telling multiple fabrications about the nature of the Stubhub charge. Flowers informed the public about MacZuba Benner's deception relating to the Stubhub charge and other questionable actions by her that were being investigated by federal and local law enforcement authorities during the August 2014 press conference.http://www.Treasury.Delaware.gov It was later discovered by law enforcement authorities that MacZuba Benner was the subject of multiple civil lawsuits in Delaware from various creditors dating back to 2010, where she owed significant amounts of money for failure to pay.http://www.courts.Delaware.gov Thirty days before his primary election and prior to his announcement not to seek reelection, MacZuba Benner filed false claims against Flowers which were quickly dismissed by law enforcement authorities as being without merit, after authorities subpoenaed text messages and phone calls from MacZuba Benner to Flowers.http://www.doverpost.com/article/20140903/NEWS/140909928/0/SEARCH After receiving the text messages and phone calls, authorities stated \\"once that was presented, it was clear\\" that the claims by MacZuba Benner were false and she never returned calls from law enforcement authorities seeking to question her about her false claims (it is not clear if MacZuba Benner's actions were part of larger political plan to damage Flowers through falsehoods and deceptions nor is it clear if the authorities were seeking to prosecute MacZuba Benner for her false claims and manipulating a police report prior to giving the police report to the Delaware press). Even though Flowers was cleared by law enforcement authorities and received numerous requests for him to re-enter the primary race, he remained firm on his decision to not seek re-election and leave Delaware politics. Flowers, who refused to withdraw his name officially from the ballot until his name was publicly cleared from the falsehoods, stated, ‚ÄúI hope this serves as a strong warning to any individual or political campaign that seeks to resolve political disagreements by using our legal system inappropriately...this should never happen again\\"http://www.doverpost.com/article/20140903/News/140909928#ixzz3FT9s6i9r In an email to Delawareans on August 28, after being publicly cleared of the falsehoods, Flowers reaffirmed his decision to not seek re-election by telling the public, \\"We have achieved something greater than re-election victory, the truth that I have served our state honorably and that wrongs will be righted. History will record it correctly in due time and through faith, let us be at peace with it in our time.\\"http://chipflowers.com/?p=1397 On Primary Day in September 2014, Flowers' political popularity remained strong as he still received approximately 30% of the primary vote, despite not being a candidate for the office and his name being removed from many of the state ballots. In addition to Flowers' strong vote total during the primary, the impact of the false claims and state Democratic Party's negative treatment of Flowers as the first African-American statewide officeholder during his term, particularly by Governor Markell and his administration, rippled through the largely Democratic electorate in the general election.http://www.wdel.com/blog- post.php?postid=4113 Not only did many Democratic base voters in the election fail to vote (causing a very low voter turnout rate), many traditional Democratic base voters joined the state's Republican voters and defeated Markell's and U.S. Senator Tom Carper's supported candidate to replace Flowers by a large margin (over 10%), thus giving the state Republicans their first statewide office victory in over 20 years. Flowers stated that he felt \\"vindicated\\" that the voters had sent a strong message for the wrongdoing undertaken by senior members of the state's Democratic establishment. The shift in Flowers' supporters to the Republican candidate in a statewide election is viewed as a pivotal turning point in the traditionally Democratic state and is likely to have major implications in future statewide elections if state Republicans are able to maintain this unique coalition of voters, with some believing that the state's significant minority population, suburban New Castle County and Northern Kent County voters may continue to vote Republican in protest against the state's Democratic Party in future elections. On January 4, 2015, Flowers held his last major press conference in Delaware announcing that the state made over $55 million during his term in office, and \\"strengthened and reformed [its] financial system through independent investment advice, protected hundreds of millions from a failing state bank, fostered diversity among [its] investment managers, modernized the treasury, rewarded merit over political connections and allowed innovative ideas to flourish in a political climate that often rewards the status quo.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WF4oy4_AdQ In addition, the speech was noteworthy as Flowers also discussed his experience as Delaware's first African-American statewide elected official. Flowers commended the people of Delaware for showing \\"true progress and leadership on the issue\\" and expressed his gratitude for their support, but criticized the state's political leadership, particularly, the administration of Governor Jack Markell and The News Journal (the state's largest print media, aka delawareonline.com) for inappropriately fostering racial stereotypes to deceive the public. Despite his record achievements, unlike other state media, the News Journal printed over 50 articles about Flowers during his term without printing any of his accomplishments and often conveyed misleading and false information to the public, even after state and other government agencies issued reports showing that the information being printed in the publication was false and inaccurate (though the News Journal reassigned its Government Investigations Editor shortly after Flowers was cleared and the lead reporter assigned to Flowers was not employed by the paper less than a year after the false and misleading reporting was revealed and began employment with an agency under Governor Markell's direction). Shortly after Flowers' speech, many community and civic leaders and lawmakers began investigating and documenting claims of racism prevalent throughout Delaware state government during the administration of Governor Markell and questioned diversity at the state's largest university, the University of Delaware.http://www.delawareonline.com/longform/news/local/2015/08/07/pastors- racism-unchecked-state- government/31315171/http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/education/2015/07/24/ud- told-improve-student-diversity- now/30645747/http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/education/2015/02/09/naacp- state-lawmakers-ud-lacking- diversity/23154215/http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2016/02/29/pastors- protest-lack-action-gov-markell-address-racism-state-government/81101926/ During his speech, Flowers stated, \\"Diversity means having the courage to allow people who are different from you to sit at the table and share ideas that you may oppose, but not seek to destroy their lives because they see the world in a different way. We must never allow political leaders or those in media with an agenda to lead the people of this state down this dark and divisive road again.\\" Flowers announced that he would create a website to provide a roadmap for others seeking to serve the public. He stated, \\"the best legacy is to encourage good and decent people to enter government, so we can forever change the political landscape with those who truly support openness and diversity\\" to move the state forward. Flowers also stated that he would consider entering public service in his new home state of Massachusetts after a period of rest noting on his final day in office, \\"my political career isn't ending today, it's truly just beginning.\\" Flowers completed his term in January 2015 and moved to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to engage in the \\"great policy debates of our time.\\".http://www.treasury.delaware.gov In March 2016, Flowers gave his first keynote address in Delaware since leaving public office in Wilmington.http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/5/former- state-treasurer-says-forgave-those-during-t/ During the speech, in addressing those members of Delaware state government who created numerous falsehoods about him during his term, Flowers stated, ‚ÄúIt was hell going through it, but the first thing I did, and I didn‚Äôt do it right away, I forgave them.\\"http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/2016/03/04/flower- speech-forgave/81345696/ Though Flowers made millions for the state during his term, Flowers also stated, \\"When I went to Dover every day, I saw people who were thinking about themselves. It‚Äôs not about making a monument to yourself or getting a plaque to yourself. It‚Äôs about the fact that you can walk away from something saying, 'I helped people.'\\" = Freedom of Information Act issue = In March 2015, shortly after leaving office, Flowers and the Archives of The Honorable Chip Flowers Jr. (the Archives) filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Office of Governor Jack Markell seeking all electronic and other correspondence from Governor Markell and his cabinet officials involving Flowers, the Cash Management Policy Board, Flowers' former Deputy State Treasurer Erika MacZuba Benner (Erika Benner) and Flowers' primary opponent, Sean Barney (who worked for Governor Markell) during the Flowers' term.http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/14/ag-asks- governors-office-to-review-withholding-of-/? Governor Markell denied providing the documents to Flowers and the Archives claiming common law privilege, executive privilege and legislative privilege and only provided Flowers and the Archives press clippings given to the Governor by his Press Secretary during Flowers' term. In September 2015, the legal team for Flowers and the Archives appealed to the Office of the Attorney General, providing specific evidence that Governor Markell and his administration had failed to provide key correspondence not subject to privilege. In March 2016, Flowers and the Archives received a major legal victory when the Office of the Attorney General in response to the appeal stated it was unclear if Governor Markell had violated FOIA by withholding certain emails solely on the basis that a member of the legislature was copied and ordered a reexamination of all the documents withheld from Flowers and the Archives.http://opinions.attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/2016/03/14/16-ib06-3142016-foia- opinion-letter-to-the-hon-chip-flowers-re-foia-complaint-concerning-the- office-of-the-governor/ Flowers said he wants the information so that the public can have an accurate picture of his relationships with other state officials, his power struggles with members of the Cash Management Policy Board, and the controversies surrounding Benner, though many believe that the requested documents may support Flowers' claim that many of the controversies and falsehoods surrounding him during his term could have been led by the Markell administration.http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2016/03/19/inconsistencies- seen-delaware-foia-tracking/81972678/ Upon receiving notice of the legal win, Flowers stated, ‚ÄúThe issue is whether or not the administration can continue to not disclose these important documents to the public,‚Äù, describing the opinion as ‚Äúa victory for the public.‚Äù No timetable has been given for the release of the documents and proposed changes to Delaware's FOIA law may be forthcoming after a report gave the state a \\"F\\" in releasing documents to the public. In July 2016, it was publicly announced that Markell engaged an outside law firm with state funds to appeal the decision of the Attorney General to the Superior Court of the State of Delaware.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/governors-office-fights-ag- opinion-on-withholding-of- emails/2016/07/08/2511b698-4534-11e6-a76d-3550dba926ac_story.htmlhttp://delawarepublic.org/post/gov- markell-appeals-ag-ruling-over-records-request-denial Markell's term expires January 2017. Additionally, on September 30, 2016, Flowers and the Archives received another legal victory from the Delaware Office of the Attorney General when the Attorney General found that the State of Delaware attempted to overcharge Flowers and the Archives in excess of $15,000 to receive electronic mail correspondence sent and received by Flowers during his term in office.http://delawarestatenews.net/news/former-state-treasurer-foia-issues- delaware/ The Attorney General Office found that Flowers' successor, State Treasurer Ken Simpler and the Office of State Treasurer, sought to overcharge Flowers and the Archives for the costs associated with a legal review of the electronic correspondence in direct violation of state law. The true cost for the FOIA request was approximately $1,500. = Travel expense issue = In November 2013, Flowers was questioned about funds spent during a business trip to Alaska with then-deputy treasurer Erika MacZuba Benner the previous year. Flowers stated that his travel expenses were justified and that he spent the trip meeting with bankers and lawyers regarding Delaware's $2 billion portfolio. The trip was subject to reimbursement by the National Association of State Treasurers, but the reimbursement was incorrectly filed by a Treasury staff member. Flowers, who contributed over $550,000 to his campaigns and donated over $100,000 of his first year salary, chose to return $460.80 for the trip and returned an additional $415.25 for an additional day's stay related to a National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers meeting in Seattle in 2012. On July 30, 2014, the Office of the Auditor of Accounts issued a full report that found that Flowers had traveled for only legitimate business purposes and his travel to Alaska and Seattle were paid (in full or in part) by the National Association of State Treasurers and the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers, resulting in the State of Delaware owing him for his reimbursements (the report only found the Governor, Flowers and other senior members of state government had failed to sign a state travel form authorizing themselves to travel - a finding that both the Governor and Flowers claimed needed updating since an elected official should not sign a form authorizing themselves to travel). Flowers declined to seek his reimbursements from the State of Delaware stating during his final day in office in Delaware during a press interview, \\"Though I have forgiven those who tried so hard to stop me from doing good, the people should not have to suffer for their wrongdoing.\\"  Boards and associations  Flowers served or has served on the following boards and associations: * Co-Chair, National Democratic State Treasurers * Co-Chair, State of Delaware Deferred Compensation Council * Member, Massachusetts Historical Society * Museum Council Member, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston * Member, Boston Bar Association * Proprietor, Boston Athenaeum * Member, Union League of Philadelphia * Member, Harvard Club of Boston * Member, Harvard Club of New York * Member, State of Delaware Cash Management Policy Board * Member, State of Delaware Farmland Preservation Board * Member, State of Delaware Employee Benefits Committee * Shareholder, The Library Company of Philadelphia * Vice-President, Eastern Region, National Association of State Treasurers * Chair, Alexis de Tocqueville Society, United Way of Delaware * Board of Trustees and Board of Directors, Delaware Symphony Orchestra * Board of Directors, OperaDelaware * Board of Directors, Nehemiah Gateway Community Development Corporation * Board of Directors, American Red Cross of Delmarva * Chair, Multicultural Judges & Lawyers Section, Delaware State Bar Association * Board of Advisors, Trustees of Color * Board of Directors, Kuumba Academy Charter School * Board of Directors, Kalmar Nyckel Foundation * Delegate, Democratic National Convention 2004, 2012 * Member-At- Large (Appointed), Executive Committee, Delaware State Bar Association * Member, Warren Bennis Leadership Circle, Harvard University Center for Public Leadership  References  External links  * Official Delaware State Treasurer website * Official website of State Treasurer Chip Flowers * Official website of The Flowers Counsel Group, LLC 1974 births Living people African-American people in Delaware politics Delaware Democrats Delaware lawyers Georgetown University Law Center alumni John F.

Near the intersection of Routes 2 and 16, it is also connected to the Alewife Red Line subway terminus and bus station by a walking path, and to the Minuteman Bikeway. It was the home office of Arthur D. Little, an international management consulting firm, from 1953 to 2002. Since 2000, CDP has been owned and managed by an affiliate of Bulfinch, a real estate firm. Bulfinch has since redeveloped the office park, positioning it as a \\"world-class sustainable urban office and research campus\\". The Park is master-planned for six different LEED-certified office and laboratory buildings totaling up to 820,000 sf and two structured parking garages. It includes green space with walking and bicycle trails as well as two buildings and a parking garage. Cambridge Discovery Park and surrounding Alewife Brook Reservation represents one of the largest campuses in Cambridge (after Harvard and MIT) and is home to tenants including Forrester Research, the [Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory , Siemens, Pfizer, and Genocea Biosciences. History and original uses The site of Cambridge Discovery Park was used for farming until 1950 when Arthur D. Little, Inc., the world's first management consultancy firm, which pioneered the concept of contracted professional services,Arthur D. Little bought seven acres of farmland, and began construction of one of the first post-war suburban office parks. In 1953, the Park opened and was named Acorn Park, based on the company's motto: Glandes Sparge Ut Quercus Crescent 'Scatter Acorns That Oaks May Grow', and it grew to approximately 40 acresArthur D. Little as new buildings were added. With simple exteriors and austere interiors, the Park projected a utilitarian image for a major industrial research centers. In total, Acorn Park consisted of 14 buildings and over 400,000sf with multiple surface parking lots. Arthur D. Little owned the site until 1999 and continued to occupy the site as a tenant until 2002. The original buildings at Acorn Park were demolished by Bulfinch over several years beginning in 2003, partly to restore and preserve the neighboring wetlands. A memorial stands on the site to commemorate Arthur D. Little and includes the 1953 cornerstone of the first Arthur D. Little building. In 2011, Bulfinch received a preservation award from the Cambridge Historical Commission for this memorial. Development Cambridge Discovery Park is master-planned and permitted for 820,000 sf and is being developed in phases. Building 100 (150,00sf +/-) was first developed and leased by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; Building 200-300 (200,000 sf +/-LEED- Gold certified) followed and is currently leased by Forrester Research, and a 650 space +/-parking garage also has been developed. Approximately 450,000 sf +/- of office and/or laboratory space and an additional parking garage remain to be developed. Bulfinch manages the property. Sustainability When Bulfinch purchased the Arthur D. Little site in 2000, it returned nearly 10 acres back to open space and natural vegetation, restoring areas of the 1950s post-war office park into green space. Bulfinch also converted former parking lots and impervious areas into a natural buffer between the Little River and portion of the property to be developed (closest to Route 2), including adding ponds and other natural features to treat storm water, which earned Bulfinch the \\"Go Green\\" Award from the City of Cambridge for Stormwater Management Design. Future buildings are intended to be LEED certified \\"silver\\" or higher Location Cambridge Discovery Park is located adjacent to Route 2, a major artery to and from Boston and Cambridge, in close proximity to Harvard and MIT, not far from Logan International Airport and downtown Boston, and adjacent to the Alewife Reservation and Little River. The Park is situated just a few miles to Interstate 95/Route 128 and the western Boston suburbs. Public transportation can be accessed via a 300 yard+/- pedestrian footpath or a shuttle bus to the MBTA Alewife Red Line station. The Park also is easily accessible by bicycle via the Minuteman Bike Path. The Park is situated in an expanding neighborhood with numerous residential projects underway including the adjacent Vox on Two plus over 1,000 multi-family units within approximately ¬Ω mile of the campus.

From the source of its East Fork to its mouth at the Yakima, it flows about , passing through Kennewick and Richland. The East Fork as well as the main course north of where both forks come together flow south to north. The West Fork starts in Badger Canyon by heading south, but slowly wraps around along with the topography of the canyon to flow out of it northbound. There is an easily visible riparian zone along most of the length of the main course, along with the West Fork up Badger Canyon and the East Fork until I-82.  Course  The entire course of Amon Creek, as well as its two forks, is within Benton County. The creek flows through the semi-arid climate in the rain shadow of the Cascade mountains. Because of this, the creek serves an important role as an oasis, especially outside of developed areas. The flow in the West Fork mainly comes from springs in and around Badger Canyon whereas the flow in the East Fork is primarily runoff from nearby irrigation canals. = Main course = The East and West Forks of Amon Creek come together at the Meadow Springs Country Club in Richland. It then flows north in a canyon through residential portions of Richland. After passing under Columbia Park Trail, the creek enters the dense forest of the Yakima River Delta before ending at the Yakima River a mile from where it meets the Columbia. Only about 1% of the discharge into the Yakima River is natural. = West Fork = The West Fork of Amon Creek rises in Badger Canyon southwest of Richland. It flows through the canyon parallel to Badger Road until near Cottonwood Elementary School, where it breaks away and flows under Interstate 82 to the west of Badger Road. From there it flows through the Amon Creek Natural Preserve. After that it flows into the Meadow Springs Country Club where it meets the East Fork. = East Fork = The East Fork of Amon Creek rises in the Horse Heaven Hills south of Kennewick and typically only flows when the irrigation canals are full. Above Interstate 82, the East Fork is usually dry except in times of heavy snow melt or rainfall. After passing under I-82 and entering Kennewick, the East Fork is largely used as a wasteway for canals operated by the Kennewick Irrigation District (KID). It then flows past orchards, under Clearwater Avenue, briefly through Amon Basin, and enters the Meadow Springs Country Club.  Amon Basin  Amon Basin is a bowl-shaped area upstream of the Meadow Springs Country Club which holds both the West Fork and the East Fork of Amon Creek. While the two forks pass within about a third of a mile of each other, their confluence is about a mile upstream. The Amon Basin has unique ecological significance to the area, especially in the wetlands along the West Fork where several different kinds of animals can be seen. Outside of the riparian zone, one finds sagebrush as well as animal life that is typical of the Columbia Basin. The basin extends further south along the West Fork than it does along the East Fork.  Recreation  There are several recreational opportunities along the length of the creek. South of Thompson Hill, many people make use of small two-track roads that cross the East Fork for off-roading. On the West Fork just north of I-82, there is the Amon Creek Nature Preserve in Amon Basin which includes several trails for hiking and observing the wildlife. The confluence of the two forks is in the Meadow Springs Country Club, which is an 18-hole golf course. At the mouth of the creek in the Yakima River Delta there is a dense forest administered by the USACE which holds many trails for hiking and mountain biking. Bird watching is also popular along the entire length of the creek as many migrant birds utilize the ecosystem around the creek while they are in the Columbia Basin.  Wildlife  A beaver dam on the West Fork of Amon Creek in Amon Basin Below Meadow Springs Country Club, several fish species have been spotted. In some years, these can include salmon and trout, however summer water temperatures, which can exceed , can be lethal to fish populations. The creek also serves as an oasis with heightened amounts of vegetation around it. The basin around the creek serves as a home to hares, quail and beavers. River otters have been spotted in the creek. In Amon Basin, there are about a half dozen beaver dams which form small ponds along the length of the creek in that area. It is believed that fish hatcheries run by the Yakama Nation have contributed to the fish population in the creek.  History  Around 8 million years ago, as the Cascade Mountains were starting to rise, the Columbia River changed its course to flow through what is now Wallula Gap. The Yakima River then formed and flowed through Badger Canyon and the Amon Basin, which were carved by the Columbia. Around 10,000 years ago, the Missoula Floods further altered the landscape, opening up the Horn Rapids area for the Yakima River to flow through. The West Fork now utilizes the canyons left by the Yakima and Columbia Rivers. In 1970, the West Fork was altered to provide irrigation to the new Meadow Springs Country Club. They built four reservoirs connected by culverts. This made fish passage through the golf course on the West Fork nearly impossible. The East Fork was left in its natural state. Conditions on the West Fork further worsened in 1998 when a KID canal broke, causing release of sediment with the floodwater. Though the floodplain upstream of the golf course served its purpose well, the upper two reservoirs were filled with four feet of sediment, decreasing the depth to between 12 and 18 inches (30 to 46 cm). This starkly raised temperatures in the creek. In 2008, over 16 tons of illegally dumped trash were removed from the newly established Amon Creek Nature Preserve along the West Fork directly upstream of the golf course. Volunteers also removed 14 broken-down vehicles.

Early life and education Born Emma Cecilia Milow, but known as Cecilia ('Cissy' to her intimate circle), she was the youngest of three daughters born to Johan Fredrik Milow (born 1814) and Mary Lindgren (1825‚Äì1906). Her London-born Anglo-Swedish mother was a translator, author and pedagogue. Her musical eldest sister, Thekla Milow (born 1848, London), was the wife of Baron Sten Miles Sture (1806‚Äì75), the last of his historic dynastic line. Milow was originally devoted to education, founding a girls' school in Sk√∂vde 1887‚Äì1902 with the patronage of the wealthy philanthropist Consul Oscar Ekman (1812‚Äì1907). He also urged her to pursue further studies in England and Germany. Already an English Language teacher, she was first able to graduate in History at London, in 1894, then in both language and literature from the George J. Burch School of English at Oxford, in 1898. Between 1902 and 1911, Ekman sponsored Milow to take further prolonged periods of study leave. She first returned to England, where she concentrated on childcare and the social problems of industrial towns and cities. She then continued to America, where she pursued her study of philanthropic and social work, visiting various social clubs and working class districts in a number of states. She was particularly fascinated by two boys‚Äô clubs, one founded by a wealthy business man named Cornelius Loder in New York, and another set up by a Scot named Thomas Chew, at the industrial town of Fall River, an hour‚Äôs journey from Boston. Work Upon return to Sweden, Milow dedicated her life to social work, founding and directing the pioneering Kungsholmens Youth Club in Stockholm 1904‚Äì22. She was also a founder of the Swedish People's Association in 1906, a political propaganda organisation. She was also a member of the board of the Central Committee and a member of the working committee of an organisation called 'Svensk Folkviljan', or the Swedish People‚Äôs Will, avidly campaigning for women‚Äôs rights and suffrage. Between 1922 and 1930, she held the post of editor for Sweden‚Äôs civic-spirited Women‚Äôs Organisation journal and published papers on defence, children and youth. On several occasions, Milow was invited to 'Stronvar House', the baronial pile of James Carnegie on the shore of Loch Voil in the Braes O‚ÄôBalquhidder, Perthshire, Scotland. It was on one of these visits that Milow first met General Robert Baden-Powell, an introduction which would lead to her founding Sweden‚Äôs first Boy Scout troop, one of the first in the world. In 1916, King Gustav VI awarded Milow the 'Illis Quorum' in recognition of her contribution to Swedish culture and social work. In 1928, L. Wahlstr√∂m published a study of her work with disadvantaged boys, entitled 'Cecilia Milow och hennes Kungsholmspojkar' [‚ÄòCecilia Milow and her Kungsholm Boys‚Äô].

The focus of CONA is works cataloged in scholarly literature, museum collections, visual resources collections, archives, libraries, and indexing projects with a primary emphasis on art, architecture, or archaeology. The target users are the visual resources, academic, and museum communities. In the CONA database, each work's record (also called a subject in the database, not to be confused with iconographical depicted subjects of art works) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to each work's record are titles/names, current location, dates, other fields, related works, a parent (that is, a position in the hierarchy), sources for the data, and notes. By using terms from all four Getty Vocabularies to control many of these fields, CONA uses linked data principles to pull together multiple vocabularies in the creation of an authority file for works of art. The coverage of CONA is global, from prehistory through the present.  History  Detailed discussions regarding the Getty Vocabulary Program compiling a vocabulary comprising unique numeric identifiers and brief records for art works began in 2004. It was determined that various Getty projects collected data for movable works and architecture that could form an initial data set, upon which other contributors could build over time. The project was enthusiastically embraced by the user community. In 2005 mapping of the data model used for all three existing vocabularies (the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), and the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)) to potential CONA fields was completed. The effort coincided with the development of CCO (Cataloging Cultural Objects), a more concise offshoot of the CDWA (Categories for the Description of Works of Art), and CDWA Lite, which is an XML schema intended to serve as an exchange format for art information. Both CCO and CDWA, which reflect consensus in the user community of best practice in cataloging art and architecture, lay out the required fields and rules for cataloging art objects. Technical development of CONA began in 2010. The editorial system and online search screens for CONA are similar to those used for the existing Getty vocabularies. The data is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of CONA is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. Contributions to CONA from the user community commenced in 2012. A pilot release of CONA with a limited number of records is currently available online. The growth and utility of CONA will depend upon contributions from users. As with the AAT, TGN, and ULAN, CONA will grow and change via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program. The current manager of the Getty vocabularies is Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor. Administratively, the Vocabulary Program resides under the GRI Collection Management and Description Division (David Farneth, Head). Other GRI departments in this division are General Collection Cataloging, Special Collections Cataloging, Digital Services, the Registrar's Office, Institutional Records and Archives, and Conservation and Preservation. The Vocabulary Program works with Digital Art History Access (Murtha Baca, Head) to foster foreign language translations of the vocabularies, maintain national and international partnerships, and oversee licensing and marketing.About CONA  Terms  The focus of each CONA record is a work of art or architecture. Each work is identified with a unique and persistent numeric ID, which aids in the disambiguation of similar works. There are many fields in CONA, however through titles/names (equivalence relationships), as well as hierarchical and associative relationships, the basic structure of CONA is that of a thesaurus in compliance with ISO and NISO standards. Names or titles may be current, historical, and in various languages.  Design  Although it may be displayed as a list, CONA is a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the CONA hierarchy (Subject_ID: 700000000). There may be multiple broader contexts, making CONA polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships (e.g., between a print and the larger volume to which it belongs), CONA has equivalence relationships (between equivalent titles/names) and associative relationships (e.g., between a sketch and the final work). The primary top divisions of CONA are the facets Built Work and Movable Work. With the exception of performance art, CONA records unique physical works. However, CONA may include works that were never built or that no longer exist, for example designs for a building that was not constructed or a work that has been destroyed. Built Works: Built works within the scope of CONA are architecture, which includes structures or parts of structures that are the result of conscious construction, are of practical use, are relatively stable and permanent, and are of a size and scale appropriate for‚Äîbut not limited to‚Äîhabitable buildings. Most built works in CONA are manifestations of the built environment that is typically classified as fine art, meaning it is generally considered to have aesthetic value, was designed by an architect (whether or not his or her name is known), and constructed with skilled labor. Movable Works: The term movable works is borrowed from legal jargon, referring to tangible objects capable of being moved or conveyed from one place to another, as opposed to real estate or other buildings. It is useful to separate the two types of works‚Äîbuilt works and movable works‚Äîinto different facets in CONA because movable works typically are located in a repository, have a repository identification number, have a provenance of former locations, and other characteristics that typically differ from architecture. Movable works within the scope of CONA include the visual arts that are of the type collected by art museums, although the objects themselves may actually be held by an ethnographic, anthropological, or other museum, or owned by a private collector. Performance art is included in CONA under this facet as well. The minimum fields and editorial rules of CONA are in compliance with CDWA and CCO. The minimum fields are the following: Catalog Level, Object/Work Type, Title or Name, Creator, Creation Date, Measurements, Materials and Techniques, Depicted Subject, and Current Location.

He is best known as the founder, creator, and author of the Axtelera Ray fantasy series. Early life Prateek Mathur was born in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. Initially training as an engineer, Prateek‚Äôs passion for animation led him to study the world of 3D and computer generated imagery. Since, he has worked for different companies on a variety of projects, including feature films such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2, Green Lantern and Men in Black 3. His long list of projects also include the virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) industry, developing the look and design of 360 applications and producing 360 content, as well as imputing his boundless creativity in music videos for artists such as The Courteeners, Larkins and Band of Skulls. Although Prateek is passionate about his work, his love for storytelling, reflected in his interest for the entertainment industry and the various media used to convey a story, led him to create the fantasy series Axtelera Ray. He has worked in collaboration with talented artists, including author Maurice J. Gallagher, developing what initially started as a simple comic into a six novel-long series.  Career = Axtelera Ray - Novel Concept = In the year 2000, Prateek became fascinated by the mythologies of the world. That interest was spurred by his father, Dr. D.K Mathur, an accomplished archaeologist, who took Prateek along on his numerous excavations across India. It led to Prateek‚Äôs love of history and legends. From the ancient Egyptians to the Norse gods, Prateek studied these ancient tales, thus imagining what would one day be known as Axtelera Ray. The developing CGI industry also brought with it a huge source of inspiration, bringing to life characters that once lived only in his imagination. Inspired by the Greats such as Stan Lee and JRR Tolkien, Prateek began developing a story that was initially planned as a comic. However, as his idea developed into something much bigger, Axtelera Ray became a series of novels, featuring well-developed characters in the meticulously built world of Octavia. Over the course of the following five years, Prateek spent time refining his story and characters, wishing to offer the world a brand new tale that would take his audience on the adventure of a lifetime. After travelling to the United Kingdom, in 2013, Prateek got the chance to work with author Maurice J. Gallagher also known as Mo Gallagher, with whom he later shared his idea. Fascinated by the world Prateek was building, Mo eventually came on board, putting into writing Prateek‚Äôs notes and ideas. In early 2015, Prateek released a 40-page preview edition of the first book in the series, entitled ‚ÄòAxtelera Ray: The Chronicles of Astrone‚Äô which knew instant success on Goodreads, Lulu and Amazon. The positive reviews bear testament to the genuine interest in the world‚Äôs mythology, myths and legends. In 2018, Prateek released the 90-page preview edition which is available for free to audience across the globe. The full first novel is currently in development, however a complete encyclopaedia of the world of Octavia can be found on the official Axtelera Ray website. = Ocean Tears = Prateek‚Äôs desire to use his skills to bring about change with thought-provoking artwork led him to create the concept he entitled ‚ÄòOcean Tears‚Äô. Inspired by Greta Thunberg and Sky‚Äôs Ocean Rescue, it came from the idea that with the destruction of the world‚Äôs fauna‚Äôs natural habitats, animals would come out of the oceans, forests and jungles to protest. The initial idea featured a Humpback Whale, floating across the sky in Manchester‚Äôs Media City, forced to leave the polluted oceans to find a cleaner home. This long-running campaign would see the whale appear in different places around the globe. Furthermore, in order to spread the awareness of climate change, Prateek has provided the full source material to any artist who desires to get involved. = London Olympic = While working as a volunteer for Sports Maker, Rush Hockey and UK Centre for Carnival Arts, Prateek produced graphics such as posters and promo videos for various events. These graphics were then used nationally as well as internationally by sports companies, leading him to win the 2012 Bedfordshire Gold achievement award. He was invited to join the 2012 London Olympic Sports/Game Makers parade with the Olympic Gold medallist Etienne Stott in Bedford, and was later awarded the title of Young People of the Year (YOPEY's) positive role model 2012 by the founder Tony Gearing MBE, endorsed by the leaders of all three main political parties, Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, and Opposition leader Ed Miliband. = UKCCA = Prateek volunteered with UKCCA, the UK Centre for Carnival Arts, which aims to promote the carnival arts and communities, providing large spaces and technical facilities across the UK. This major new cultural resource attracts thousands of people each year including carnival artists, schools, course attendees, conference visitors and creative industry start-ups. It is run by the Luton Carnival Arts Development Trust (LCADT). The UKCCA enabled Prateek to meet and work for renown companies, eventually leading him to join the 2012 London Olympics Sports/Game Makers parade and produce artwork for these large scale events. = Beauty and the Beast = In 2015, after Disney first confirmed Emma Watson had been cast as Belle in the new live-action film Beauty and the Beast, Prateek produced a brilliant concept artwork of the actress in the protagonist‚Äôs iconic yellow dress. The finished piece created a buzz and was posted and shared on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. It was featured in The Ellen DeGeneres Show, as well as in a number of magazines including Look, Business Insider, Moviepilot, Ok!, Popsugar, m-magazine and Techinsider. The speed painting of the artwork is featured on Prateek‚Äôs website, showing the work and detail that went into the making-of the poster.

Clerici vagantes or vagabundi (singular clericus vagans or vagabundus) is a medieval Latin term meaning \\"wandering clergy\\" applied in early canon law to those clergy who led a wandering life either because they had no benefice or because they had deserted the church to which they had been attached. The term refers also to wandering students, ex-students, and even professors, \\"moving from town to town in search of learning and still more of adventure, nominally clerks but leading often very unclerical lives\\".Charles Homer Haskins, Rise of Universities, p. 111 Recently, the belief that the clerici vagantes played an important role in the literary atmosphere of the so-called Renaissance of the 12th century, for the kind of fresh poetry in medieval Latin called goliardic poetry, in which famous wandering scholars (scholares vagantes; in German fahrenden Sch√ºler) like Hugh Primas and the anonymous Archpoet (both 12th century) satirically criticised the Medieval Church, has been questioned.Marian Wei√ü, Die mittellateinische Goliardendichtung, p. 387-388  History  As early as the fifth and sixth centuries, measures were taken against them, such as when the Council of Chalcedon forbade ordination without appointment to a specific church, or when the Council of Valencia (524?Hauck, Albert, \\"Vagantes\\". In: Jackson, Samuel Macauley, New Schaff‚ÄìHerzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, vol. XII (1914)) threatened the vagantes with excommunication, a penalty extended in the same year by the Synod of Arles to those who gave them shelter. Nevertheless, the vagantes still flourished, and frequently aided bishops and other clergy in the discharge of their duties or became chaplains in the castles of the knights, thus making their profession a trade and interfering with the orderly conditions and ministrations of the regular clergy. In 789 Charlemagne renewed the Chalcedon injunctions, and also forbade the entertainment of any clergy who could not produce letters from their bishops. But even these measures failed, and in the ninth century several synods (such as those of Mainz in 847 and Pavia in 845‚Äì850) sought to check the vagantes and their efforts to take possession of benefices already conferred on others, and such prelates as Agobard of Lyon, in his De privilegio et jure sacerdotii, also opposed them. In the twelfth century Gerhoh of Reichersberg again complained about them in his Liber de simonia, but matters became far worse in the following century, when the Synods of Mainz (1261), Aschaffenburg (1292), Sankt P√∂lten (1284) and Treves (1310) declared against the vagantes. In Bavaria they were expressly excluded from the king's peaces (Landfrieden) of 1244, 1281, and 1300. The pressure against goliards ended in 1231 when, after the University of Paris strike of 1229, pope Gregory IX (himself an alumnus of the University of Paris) issued the papal bull Parens scientiarum, by which, among other exemptions, he confirmed a decision of Philip Augustus to grant students immunity from lay jurisdiction.Charles Homer Haskins, Rise of Universities, p. 23 = Goliards = A peculiar type of vagantes arose in France in the twelfth century, later spreading to England and Germany. These were the roving minstrels: mostly dissolute students or wandering clergy, first called clerici vagantes or ribaldi (\\"rascals\\"), later (after the early 13th century) chiefly known as goliardi or goliardenses, terms apparently meaning \\"sons of Goliath\\". They were masters of poetic form, but many councils of the 13th and 14th centuries sought to restrict the goliards and their excesses. These measures seem to have practically suppressed the goliards in France by the end of the 13th century, but in Germany they survived under various names until the late 15th century. Hugo von Trimberg devoted a special chapter of his Der Renner (\\"The Runner\\") to the ribaldi and other vagantes, and in England Geoffrey Chaucer alluded to them in uncomplimentary terms. The goliards were believed to play an important role in the literary atmosphere of the so-called Renaissance of the 12th century, with fresh medieval Latin poetry, from poems in the Cambridge University Library MS Gg. 5.35 to the well known Carmina burana of the 13th century (the Codex Buranum). Although they were part of the clergy, their poetry was believed to be \\"one of the earliest disintegrating forces in the mediaeval church\\".Helen Waddell, The Wandering Scholars of the Middle Ages, 2000, p. v Wandering scholars and poets include Walter Map (ca. 1140‚Äì1208), Hugh Primas (12th century), and the anonymous Archpoet (ca. 1130‚Äìca. 1165),Helen Waddell The Wandering Scholars of the Middle Ages, 2000, p. 295 \\"the greatest\\"Helen Waddell, The Wandering Scholars of the Middle Ages, 2000, p. 166 of them all. However, historical and philological research recently questioned that assumption and at times strictly distinguished between \\"goliardic poets\\" on the one hand and \\"goliards\\" on the other hand.Marian Wei√ü, Die mittellateinische Goliardendichtung, pp. 4-7 So far, not a single contact between both groups has been traced in the source material.

Preparation A plate of Marseille-style pied paquet Writing in 1958, Waverley Root observed that although the packages used to be cooked with calves' feet, that was no longer the case except in Nice, where the dish was called tripes √† la ni√ßoise. If using sheep's feet, the hair on them is seared off, then the feet are placed in the bottom of the pot in which the packages will be stewed. To make the packages, sheep's tripe is cleaned and cut into four to eight squares. Each piece is stuffed with onions, parsley, garlic, and salt pork before being rolled and wrapped into a small pouch or package. The stuffed offal is then stewed for several hours in a white wine and tomato sauce. The feet and stuffed offal can also be cooked without tomato sauce, in which case it is eaten with a vinaigrette and known as tripo √† la reboulado.Dictionnaire de la Provence, p. 606.

Her only surviving work is the spiritual autobiography An Alarm Sounded to Prepare the Inhabitants of the World to Meet the Lord in the Way of His Judgments (1709).Title page of An Alarm Sounded to Prepare the Inhabitants of the World to Meet the Lord in the Way of His Judgments (1709)Bowers was one of twelve children of Quakers Benanuel Bowers and Elizabeth Dunster Bowers, the niece of Henry Dunster, first president of Harvard University. Her parents were from England and immigrated to America, settling in Charlestown, Massachusetts, where Bowers was born and raised. Anti-Quaker persecution prompted the Bowers family to send their four eldest daughters to Philadelphia, which had a large Quaker population. Bowers never married, though her sisters did, and the diary of Ann Bolton n√©e Curtis, the daughter of Bowers' sister Elizabeth who lived with the Bowers family for a brief time, provides what little biographical information is known of Bowers outside of her own writing. In Philadelphia, Bowers was noted for her eccentricity. Near a spring, she built a small home that the locals called \\"Bathsheba's Bower\\" or \\"Bathsheba's folly\\" and lived as a recluse. She cultivated her garden and adopted the principles of vegetarian Thomas Tryon. She professed Quakerism but had a deep argumentative and independent streak. According to Bolton, Bowers was \\"so Wild in her Notions it was hard to find out what religion she really was of\\". An Alarm was likely published in New York by Quaker printer William Bradford in 1709. In the work, she presents her life as a series of tests designed by God for her to overcome and outlines her spiritual progress overcoming them. While An Alarm adheres to many of the conventions of Quaker spiritual autobiographies, its tone is that of what one critic describes as \\"a woman always emotionally on edge\\". Jill Lepore of The New Yorker writes, \\"The only book that year [1709] written by a woman, it's twenty-two pages long, and Bowers spends a good three of them apologizing for having written it. Bowers published an unknown number of other works, including a biography. The public response, if any, to her work is also unknown. She received no attention from scholars until the late 20th century, especially after her inclusion in the Heath Anthology of American Literature (1990). When she was thirty-five, Bowers moved to South Carolina, where there was a growing Quaker population. According to Bolton, Bowers believed she could not die. Bolton wrote of an Indian attack: > ... the Indians Early one morning surprised the place - killed and took > Prisoners several in the house adjoining to her. Yet she moved not out of > her Bed, but when two Men offered their assistance to carry her away, she > said Providence would protect her, and indeed so it provided at the time, > for those two men no doubt by the Direction of providence took her in her > Bed for she could not rise, conveyed her into their Boat and carried her > away in Safety tho' the Indians pursued and shot after them. Bowers, however, eventually did die in South Carolina at the age of 46.

The film's story takes place in Miami, Florida and Canc√∫n, Mexico, although it was filmed in the Dominican Republic. Plot James Ziegler has spent five years of his life planning the perfect crime, bugging the communication devices of Rosentski, an influential and rich businessman. His dream finally comes through when he records a sensitive conversation between Rosentski and the President of the United States; so sensitive that he demands $2 million in diamonds from Rosentski for a disc of the recording. Rosentski decides to pay Ziegler for the disc but instead sends his enforcer to retrieve it. The enforcer tries to kill Ziegler but fails and Ziegler successfully escapes with the disc and the diamonds. Ziegler goes to hide out with his brother David, who lives as a beach bum and shark hunter on the coast outside of Canc√∫n. David lives with his friend and business partner Paco and has a seagoing neighbor, a man-eating shark named Cyclops. James Ziegler crash lands in a seaplane near David's shack. The plane explodes, while James survives just long enough to hand over the disc and the diamonds to David. Rosentski is displeased with his enforcer's jumping the gun. He correctly surmises that James had gone to hide with his brother David and arranges a meeting with David's ex-wife, Liz. Rosentski promises he will pay off Liz's considerable business debts as well as reward her if she recovers the disc and diamonds. Rosentski's enforcer, however, wants the diamonds for himself and leads an assassination squad against David. David abhors firearms but has no objections to fighting back using bladed weapons, booby traps, molotov cocktails and his shark, Cyclops.

He owned plantations and sugar refineries in Louisiana and a large distillery in New York City. In 1858 his distillery was at the heart of a scandal when an expos√© in a weekly magazine accused it (and other distilleries) of producing altered and unsafe milk, called \\"swill milk\\", for sale to the public. The swill milk scandal helped to create the demand for consumer protection laws in the United States. Early life and education Bradish Johnson's father, William M. Johnson, was a sea captain from Nova Scotia. In 1795 he purchased land in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, along with a partner from Salem, Massachusetts named George Bradish. The partners built a sugar plantation there called \\"Magnolia\\", where they settled and began to produce sugar. In the 1830s, William Johnson moved his family to a new plantation four miles further up the Mississippi River, in Pointe √† la Hache, Louisiana. He named his new plantation \\"Woodland\\". Bradish Johnson, born in 1811, was the third of four sons. He was named after his father's business partner, George Bradish. By 1820, Captain William Johnson had also begun purchasing property on the West side of Manhattan and had gone into the distillery and sugar refining business in New York. Bradish Johnson, who was born in Louisiana, attended Columbia College in New York City, graduating in the class of 1831. Business Johnson started out as a partner in the distilling company William Johnson and Sons. After his father's death, he went into business with a man named Moses Lazarus as Johnson and Lazarus. Upon the retirement of Lazarus, the firm was renamed Bradish Johnson and Sons. The Johnsons owned several properties, including a distillery at 244 Washington Street. The largest facility occupied two city blocks near the Hudson River, from Ninth Avenue to Eleventh Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. The distillery was east of Tenth Avenue, while the cow barns and dairy were located west of Tenth. Through his distilleries and his investments in real estate, Johnson became very wealthy. He became one of the directors of the Chemical Bank of New York when it was rechartered in 1844. He served as a director for the next twenty years. Johnson was an innovator in the sugar industry, and his refinery was the first to \\"successfully make use of centrifugal machines in the manufacture of sugar\\". Johnson inherited Woodland Plantation from one of his brothers before the Civil War. He eventually purchased a number of other plantations in the area: Pointe Celeste, Bellevue, and the Orange Farm. He also acquired two plantations above New Orleans which he renamed after his married daughters: Whitney Plantation and Carroll Plantation. When Johnson's estate was settled in 1900, it included 31 pieces of New York real estate, which together added up to 78 acres. All the lots were purchased by a corporation formed by his heirs for a total of $4,769,100. \\"Swill milk\\" scandal A 19th century illustration of \\"swill milk\\" being produced: a sickly cow being milked while held up by ropes. The Johnson & Lazarus distillery at 16th Street was the subject of a famous muckraking expos√© by Frank Leslie‚Äôs Illustrated Newspaper in 1858. Distilleries in 19th century New York had to dispose of the tons of organic waste they generated, and their solution was to feed the still hot mash to hundreds of sick old cows and then sell the milk. The cows were crowded into filthy stables, and were so sickly that some of them were reportedly held up by slings. The milk, referred to as \\"swill milk\\", was often cut with water and then thickened with chalk or flour. Swill milk was accused of being a major cause of infant mortality ‚Äî it was sold from pushcarts all over the city, advertised, e.g., as farm-fresh milk from Orange County. Johnson was a supporter of the Tammany Hall politician Alderman Michael Tuomey, known as \\"Butcher Mike\\". Tuomey defended the distillers vigorously throughout the scandal ‚Äî in fact, he was put in charge of the Board of Health investigation. Frank Leslie‚Äôs Illustrated Newspaper staked out Johnson's mansion at 21st and Broadway, and reported that in the midst of the investigation, Tuomey was observed making late night visits. The Board of Health exonerated the distillers, but public outcry led to the passage of the first food safety laws in the form of milk regulations in 1862. Civil War years=Petitioning Lincoln= In 1863 Johnson took a leading part in the \\"Conservative Unionists\\", a group of businessmen with interests in the South who wanted occupied Louisiana let back into the Union with her 1852 constitution intact. They claimed that the state constitution had not been dissolved and the secession was illegal, so the President should allow the state back into the Union with slavery intact. Johnson and two other plantation owners made their argument in a letter to President Lincoln, reinforced by a personal visit. Lincoln was not impressed. In his dismissive response he wrote \\"I do not perceive how such committal could facilitate our military operations in Louisiana, I really apprehend it might be so used as to embarrass them.\\" =Johnson v. Dow= In 1863 Johnson brought a suit against a Union general. The suit claimed that in 1862 the occupying Union Army, under the command of General Neal S. Dow of the 13th Maine Regiment, 'took from Johnson's plantation twenty-five hogsheads of sugar, plundered the dwelling- house hereon and took one silver pitcher, one-half dozen silver knives, one- half dozen silver spoons, one fish knife, one-half dozen silver teaspoons and other articles.' Johnson presented himself as a loyal citizen of the Union, residing in New York, who had simply been robbed by the Union Army. He was awarded $1750 in damages by the court. When Dow failed to pay him, he sued Dow in Dow's home state of Maine after the war. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which handed down a decision in 1876 against Johnson, pointing out that his holdings were in conquered territory during a time of war, and that it would be very hard to engage in warfare if the enemy could sue for damages. \\"Johnson v. Dow\\" became a hot topic of debate during the heated Tilden-Hayes Presidential election of 1876, as the country tried to figure out the confusing nature of the status of the defeated Confederate states. =Woodland described= In 1863 the Union Army's \\"Office of Negro Labor\\" was sent to Woodland to investigate conditions there. They found that on the plantation \\"great ill feeling and discontent\\" existed. The slaves begged to be given permission to enlist in the Union Army. They complained that their rations were \\"unfairly curtailed\\" by the overseer and that he was \\"lecherous toward their women\\". After the inspectors had left, the overseer is said to have \\"harangued the Negroes, boasted of his unlimited power over them,\\" and \\"used seditious and insulting language\\" towards the Union. This report presents a very different picture from the one that appeared in Johnson's New York Times obituary and in the official history of the Chemical Corn Exchange Bank, which claimed that he had freed his slaves prior to the Emancipation Proclamation. Personal life The Bradish Johnson House, New Orleans Johnson married a New Yorker named Louisa Anna Lawrance around 1834. Together they had ten children. Their New York residence was located near fashionable Madison Square, at 21st Street on the short block between Broadway and Fifth Avenue.In opposition to a plan to run a railroad up Fifth Avenue in 1885, group, including Cornelius Vanderbilt, Chauncey M. Depew, John Sloane, Bradish Johnson and William Waldorf Astor, organized the Association for the Protection of the Fifth Avenue Thoroughfare (Robert T. Swaine, The Cravath Firm And Its Predecessors: 1819-1947, 2006:413ff). In 1874 Johnson retired from business in New York and moved to New Orleans, where he had a new Italianate mansion built in the Garden District at 2343 Prytania Street. The house is now home to the Louise S. McGehee School. The family also had an estate in East Islip, on the South Shore of Long Island, NY, which is where Johnson died on November 3, 1892. Johnson is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Legacy After Johnson retired to New Orleans, his house at 21st and Broadway was home to the Lotos Club. In 1918 the Johnson heirs had an office building erected on the site. The building, at 921‚Äì925 Broadway, is called the Bradish Johnson Building. An image of \\"Woodland\\" was used on the logo of the liqueur Southern Comfort from 1934 to 2001. Since 1997 the site of the Johnson & Lazarus distillery at 16th Street and Ninth Avenue, later the factory of National Biscuit Company, has been home to Chelsea Market. The house at Woodland Plantation has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1998, and is operated as a bed and breakfast.

In this role, Monaco led U.S. policy to disrupt terrorist threats against the United States, including degrading Al-Qaeda and affiliates from Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, putting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant on a lasting path to defeat, and building partner capacity to prevent and disrupt terrorist threats. She also led initiatives to expand collaboration with the private sector to counter ISIL's messaging and abuse of online platforms while lifting up alternative narratives. Separately, she led a comprehensive hostage policy reform effort from 2014 to 2015 to better align and coordinate U.S. Government efforts and better serve affected families. On May 23, 2013, Daniel Klaidman, writing for the Daily Beast reported a White House official confirmed Monaco would handle \\"day-to-day responsibilities\\" for Guantanamo. In late July 2014, Monaco answered a question as to whether the mandate to keep Guantanamo open would end when U.S. troops had effectively retired from Guantanamo. Scholars at Lawfare interpreted Monaco's comment as a sign that the Obama Presidency would ask the United States Congress to pass legislation enabling Guantanamo to remain open after U.S. involvement in the Afghan war ended. In February 2016, the White House and Department of Defense presented a comprehensive plan to Congress to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Monaco briefs President Obama, October 2014 In the Homeland Security Advisor role, Monaco was also President Obama's chief cybersecurity advisor. She drove the policy decision to create the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in 2015, to provide integrated all-source analysis of intelligence on foreign cyber threats and incidents affecting U.S. national interests similar to the National Counterterrorism Center on terrorist threats. She also helped develop the Cybersecurity National Action Plan, which was released in February 2016, to guide the actions the U.S. Government took over the remaining duration of the Obama Administration and to put in place a long-term cybersecurity strategy‚Äîboth within the federal government and across the country. In July 2016, Monaco gave remarks at the International Conference on Cyber Security, outlining the Obama Administration's cyber policy and announcing its new directive laying out how the federal government responds to significant cyber incidents. Finally, over her tenure as President Obama's chief homeland security advisor, Monaco managed the United States response to Ebola and coordinated whole-of-government preparedness efforts to prevent its spread in the United States. In January 2017, Monaco led the Principal-Level Exercise, convening outgoing and incoming Principals across the U.S. Government to share lessons learned during prior crises and discuss best practices in preparing for future crises.

Simon. It was directed by Noel Black from a screenplay by Erich Segal, stars Michael Brandon and Tippy Walker, and features Robert De Niro in a minor role. This was one of the many early 1970s films dealing with addiction following the explosion of recreational drug use in the 1960s.Review Summary The New York Times The basic premise of the movie is centered around two rich American young adults who meet and fall in love in Venice, Italy. With plenty of money and no real responsibilities or direction in life, the couple begin experimenting with illicit drugs. The movie travels through a series of flashbacks showing their progression from marijuana to harder drugs as a result of their complex romantic entanglement with each other. Plot Marcus Rottner (Brandon), 24-year-old heir of his late grandfather's fortune, is living in his New Jersey Palisades apartment as he finds out hippie girlfriend Jennifer Da Silva (Walker) has died of a heroin overdose in his living room. Fearing that he might be arrested for her death, he decides to dump her body, but not before his sister Selma (Taylor) and her psychologist boyfriend Sergei (Bonerz)‚Äîwhom Marcus detests‚Äîsuddenly drop in. They notice his strange behavior and suspect that he has gotten himself into trouble. They search his apartment but find nothing. A flashback shows how Marcus and Jennifer met: He first notices Jennifer in Venice, where both are enjoying their holiday. Marcus is immediately drawn to her reckless, careless behavior, and she falls for his looks and charm. She unexpectedly leaves Europe with her parents and he follows her to their home in Oyster Bay, where they briefly date until Jennifer again cuts all ties. Heartbroken, Marcus leaves for Venice, but returns to see Jennifer on her birthday; he's shocked to find her injecting heroin with two minstrels (Bostwick and Conaway). Marcus scares them away and tries to save Jennifer as she, under the influence, jumps from her rooftop. Fearing that she might become a heroin addict, Marcus convinces Jennifer to return to Venice, but she grows bored and expresses her desire to return to New York. As he visits the Venetian Ghetto, she leaves a recording explaining that she cannot be with him. He returns to the Lower East Side in Manhattan meets with his friend Ornstein (Vinovich) to get advice on how to dispose of a body in a novel. Marcus follows his advice and drives to a river. His reverie is interrupted by three Hells Angels who harass him. Their shake- down is interrupted by two police officers on motorcycles. Marcus drives off, dreamily talking of how this is the most time he has spent with Jenny. Flashback: Marcus moves to New Jersey to clear his mind. Months later, Jennifer suddenly shows up on his doorstep, telling Marcus that she has traveled the world and still has not found her place in life. She asks to stay at his place for a while. As he cooks her dinner, Jennifer secretly puts several prescription capsules into the blender of chocolate milk and drinks the mixture. While he sets the table on the balcony, she freaks out and he finds her in the kitchen preparing a needle over the stove flame. She climbs up on the balcony railing but he pulls her down. She asks him to inject the syringe of heroin and he does, bringing on a fatal overdose. When a carload of men chase him, his sports car crashes, catches fire and explodes with the body in the trunk. In the final scene, he is dressed in white, back in Venice.

Friede was the son of Evelyn Annenberg Hall and her first husband, Kenneth Friede. Crenshaw and Friede's story is told in the book Turned On: The Friede-Crenshaw Case (1967) by Dick Schaap.Dick Schaap, Turned On: The Friede-Crenshaw Case. New American Library, 1967. Based on Simon's 1968 novel, the film's working title was Heir. The rights of the novel were initially acquired by Anthony Spinner and Barry Shear in October 1968. In June 1969, it was announced that Herb Jaffe of United Artists was set to produce the film in collaboration with Joseph M. Schenck Enterprises. Actress Kim Hunter filmed some scenes as Jennifer's mother, but they were cut following a \\"disastrous preview\\" in San Francisco, which prompted the film's makers to edit it several times. The film marked the feature debuts for Bostwick and Conaway. It was shot on location in New York City, Venice and New Jersey. Reception The film received generally negative reviews. A reviewer of Variety noted: \\"The delightfully ridiculous plot, mock-sentimental narration, absurd dialog, infectious syrupy music and intermittent idyllic interludes all parody Love Story. And yet, like Pretty Poison, this is a potpourri of disarming satire, black comedy and poignancy that creates a strangely haunting aura. Michael Brandon, as Marcus, is charmingly boyish and natural. Tippy Walker, as Jennifer, comes across with a bitchy ethereal allure.\\"Review of Jennifer on My Mind Variety See also * List of American films of 1971 References External links   * 1971 films 1970s black comedy films 1971 comedy- drama films American black comedy films American films English-language films Films about heroin addiction Films based on American novels Films directed by Noel Black Films set in New Jersey Films set in New York City Films set in Venice Films shot in New York City Films shot in Venice United Artists films 1971 comedy films 1971 drama films ","title":"Jennifer on My Mind"},{"id":"38588774","text":"William Upton Richards (1811‚Äì1873) was an English Anglican priest.

It is the sixth game of the Killzone series and the fourth game of the series for home consoles. Killzone Shadow Fall was released on 15 November 2013 as a launch title for PlayStation 4 in North America and 29 November 2013 in Europe. Taking place 30 years after the events of Killzone 3, Shadow Fall follows a new set of characters, putting players in the role of Lucas Kellan, a \\"Shadow Marshal\\", who is investigating a rising threat in the continuing war between Vekta and the Helghast. As the first game in the series made for Sony's next-gen console, Killzone Shadow Fall received a number of changes to the series formula. The single-player campaign is more open-ended and stealth- based than its predecessors, and the multiplayer modes feature new customization options for weapons. The game also introduced a new proprietary in-house game engine called Decima. Killzone Shadow Fall received generally favorable reception overall; it received praise for its visuals, art design and multiplayer modes, while criticism was directed towards the game's single- player mode and several gameplay features, although several critics appreciated the game's attempt to change direction from its predecessors, as well as its more open-ended level design. Critics also criticized the title's lack of innovation as one of the first eighth generation games. As of January 2014, Killzone Shadow Fall has sold over 2.1 million copies, making it the first PlayStation 4 game to surpass the million copy mark and one of the best- selling PlayStation 4 games. Gameplay Like its predecessors, Killzone Shadow Fall is a first-person shooter in a science fiction setting. Staple weapons such as the M82 Assault Rifle, stA-52 Assault Rifle, and stA-18 pistol return from the earlier Killzone games, albeit in new forms and variations. New weapons include the LSR44, a recoil-free, hybrid assault/charge sniper rifle that functions much like a miniaturized rail-gun, and the OWL, an advanced hovering attack drone (used by the Shadow Marshals) that can attack/stun when it is adjacent to an adversary, as well as deploy an instant zip line, protect the player from enemy fire with an energy shield, and hack/scan terminals and enemy alarms to prevent reinforcements from arriving. While the previous games in the Killzone series portrayed a large war-zone with numerous allies by the players side at any given time and an overall linear design, Killzone Shadow Fall opts for a more open-ended level design and allows players to utilize stealth to approach their missions in addition to engaging in direct confrontations with enemies. Levels are much more open than in previous games, allowing for multiple ways/routes to complete objectives. Also in Shadow Fall, for the first half of the campaign, the player is alone in firefights, with the OWL as the player's only \\"companion\\", which is able to lay down cover fire, among other abilities. During the second half onward, the player is occasionally joined by Echo as an ally, where she is able to snipe enemies marked by the player. Multiplayer shipped with 10 maps. Users are encouraged to create their own custom map presets called \\"Warzones\\", which then can be shared with others or promoted by the Killzone community. Classes, abilities and weapons are unlocked from the start. The class system has been simplified to just three: Assault, Scout and Support (with some medic abilities from previous games now subsumed under \\"Support\\"). The player unlocks skill enhancements based on completing challenges unique to his class. Alongside competitive multiplayer, a 4-player online co-operative mode was introduced with the Intercept expansion pack, released on 24 June 2014.  Synopsis =Setting = Following the Petrusite detonation that rendered the planet Helghan uninhabitable in Killzone 3 (an event now referred to as \\"The Terracide\\"), the ISA grants refuge to the Helghast survivors on the planet Vekta, allowing them to colonize half the planet, with that half of the planet dubbed New Helghan. A massive security fortification called The Wall is constructed to separate the two civilizations from each other, due to the resentment they bear over the previous war. Both the Vektans and Helghast routinely perform covert operations against each other in the hope of finishing the war each claims the other started. The majority of the game takes place in Vekta City, home to the Vektan Security Agency (VSA) headquarters, as well as a prison in New Helghan, and Helghan, the original homeworld of the Helghast, now dead and shattered due to the Petrusite detonation. = Plot = The game begins in the year 2370, several years after the construction of \\"The Wall\\", during the forced relocation of Vektans out of New Helghan. Michael Kellan and his 5-year-old son, Lucas, attempt to sneak through New Helghan to The Wall. Along the way, they meet Sinclair, a Shadow Marshal, who aids them in making it through to safety. Just as the group makes it to The Wall, Helghast forces spot them and kill Michael. After Sinclair dispatches the remaining forces, he promises Lucas that he will look after him. A brief cutscene plays, showing Lucas rising through the ranks of the Shadow Marshal Academy, eventually becoming a full-fledged Shadow Marshal and working under Sinclair's command. 20 years later, tensions between the Vektans and Helghast have reached a boiling point. Kellan, who let himself be captured by the Helghast as part of an investigation, is being brought across The Wall as part of a prisoner exchange for a Helghast agent named Echo. After the exchange, Kellan is ordered to return to the Helghan side of The Wall in order to retrieve classified data. Kellan recovers the classified information and makes a bold escape out of the area. Using the recovered data, Sinclair sends Kellan to the ISC \\"Cassandra\\", a classified research ship, to destroy evidence of a bio-tech weapon being created by head scientist Dr. Hillary Massar and send the \\"Cassandra\\" into the nearby sun. Once on the station, Kellan encounters Echo, who escapes with Massar in tow; while Kellan makes it off the ship just as it drifts into the sun. Upon arriving at VSA headquarters, a massive explosion rips through the building, killing several civilians and soldiers. Through the confusion, Kellan meets up with Sinclair; just as a broadcast comes through from Vladko Tyran, leader of \\"The Black Hand\\", a paramilitary terrorist group claiming responsibility for the attack. As a result of the terrorism, all Helghast citizens residing on the Vektan side of The Wall are deported to New Helghan. Sinclair sends Kellan under-cover with the rest of the refugees in order to locate Tyran. Eventually he finds Tyran and learns that he is working for Jorhan Stahl (having survived the events of Killzone 3), who plans to use Massar's bio-tech weapon that has been altered to target Vektans. Shortly after, Kellan is taken captive. Kellan is approached by Echo in his cell. He informs her that Stahl plans to use Massar's bio-tech weapon to kill Vektans and half-breeds alike, including Echo (who is half-Vektan, half-Helghast). Echo, who is revealed to be Lady Hera Visari's daughter, is displeased with Visari for being in league with Stahl and planning to ignite another war. She helps Kellan escape his cell and returns him to the Vektan side of The Wall in order to convince the VSA to stand down. Upon his return, Sinclair ignores Kellan's pleas to stand down, outraged that he is siding with Echo. Instead, Sinclair informs him that the VSA have tracked Massar to a massive mining spire in orbit over the planet Helghan, and dispatches him to recover the doctor. Kellan infiltrates the main spire and finds Massar. She states that the bio-weapon is now with Stahl, being prepped for its final test. Sinclair orders Kellan to take Massar into custody, but Echo arrives and kills Massar as Kellan watches on. Now viewed as a traitor by Sinclair, Kellan teams up with Echo, and the two descend to Helghan to stop Stahl. Once the duo arrive on the destroyed surface of Helghan and head to Stahl's base, they confront and defeat Tyran. Kellan then radios Sinclair, warning him to abort the ISA assault on Stahl, but Sinclair ignores him. As the ISA begin their attack on Stahl's base, Stahl activates Massar's weapon, destroying all of the ISA ships. Echo and Kellan are separated in the chaos. Finally, Kellan reaches Stahl himself, strapped to a life support system due to his advanced age (and presumably due to Petrusite exposure). Stahl claims that the Terracide happened because the weak had to be destroyed, and that it is Vekta's turn to share the same fate, but is suddenly shot dead by Sinclair, who enters the room and also shoots Kellan. As Kellan dies, Sinclair states that with the newly reacquired weapon, they can end the Helghast threat forever. Sinclair then apologizes to Kellan before killing him. A mid-credits scene lets the player take control of Echo, sneaking into Vekta City to assassinate Sinclair during a speech he gives to the Vektans, calling for war against the Helghast. Echo comes to a perch overlooking the ceremony, lines up her shot with a sniper rifle and quietly says \\"For Kellan...\\" before pulling the trigger, killing Sinclair and preventing a new war from beginning.  Development and release  Promotion of the game at E3 2013 Killzone Shadow Fall was seen by Guerrilla Games as an opportunity to revitalize the franchise, since it was established early in development that they would be working on a new platform. The main point during development was to give players more options on how to proceed, particularly during the single-player mode. According to Guerrilla Games, the original size of Killzone Shadow Fall was 290GB because the game has no assets designed for lower spec systems. The demo of Killzone Shadow Fall shown during the PlayStation 4's announcement only used 4GB of memory ‚Äì not the full 8GB GDDR5 RAM available to developers in the final hardware, Guerrilla has revealed. According to the studio, 3072MB (3GB) of the PS4's 8GB were dedicated to video resources powering the demo, with 1,536MB used for system resources. A further 128MB were shared between the two. Of the 3GB reserved for video memory, 1,321 MB were used by non-streaming textures. According to Guerrilla, the demo featured 8200 physics objects, 500 particle systems and real-time reflections - which include \\"a lot of Guerrilla secret sauce\\". Guerrilla's decision to stick with 4GB suggest that the developer may not have been aware of Sony's decision to include 8GB in final retail hardware ‚Äì something Just Add Water CEO Stewart Gilray told VideoGamer.com had been kept secret from third-party developers until the console's announcement. \\"We were told [PS4] was 4GB originally and we first knew it had 8GBs when Mark said at the event's stage, 'And it has 8GB of memory'. We'd had kits at that point for a good while.\\" Killzone Shadow Fall ended development and \\"went gold\\" on 21 October 2013. The game was released on 15 November 2013 in North America, and was released on 29 November 2013 in Europe, and on 22 February 2014 in Japan, as a launch title for the PlayStation 4. Participating retailers offered the Shadow Pack as a pre-order bonus. It included three exclusive skins for the OWL combat drone, the MP Spotlight Move (a special victory move to humiliate fallen opponents in multiplayer), and the official soundtrack. = Soundtrack = Killzone Shadow Fall is the second game in the series in which Joris de Man did not compose the score, following the PlayStation Vita title Killzone: Mercenary. For Shadow Fall, Tyler Bates and electronica artist Lorn were hired to compose music for the Vekta and Helghan missions, respectively. The style of the soundtrack is vastly different from previous installments, favoring ambient soundscapes and beat-driven electronica over orchestral arrangements. The official soundtrack for Killzone Shadow Fall received two releases: first, as a standalone app on PlayStation 4, released on 31 December 2013, and then as a digital download on iTunes, released on 16 September 2014.  Reception = Critical response = Killzone Shadow Fall received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. It was mostly praised for its visuals and multiplayer mode, but criticism was directed at the game's story and AI problems. Destructoid's Dale North was very positive of the game; he scored it a 9/10 and said: \\"I like Killzone Shadow Fall for its change of direction from previous series games, as well as its change of pace over other first-person shooters. Guerrilla has tried a few new things this time around, and should be commended as such. I welcome the almost sandbox-ish level approach, and the stealth segments did a nice job of breaking up the standard shooting action. It's really nice when gameplay concepts win out over big set pieces and cinematic events. Oh, and it's beautiful. A stunner. Killzone Shadow Fall is the game that will make you happy to own a PS4.\\" Oli Welsh's review for Eurogamer scored a 7 out of 10. He praised the visuals, gunplay, movement, level design, and multiplayer, as well as the OWL, which was called a \\"fun tactical toy\\". Welsh said \\"It's a game that any new PlayStation 4 owner will be proud to show off - but it won't be one they remember by the time PS5 rolls around.\\" In his review for Game Informer, Dan Ryckert scored the game an 8/10 and stated: \\"When you look past the gorgeous visuals, Killzone Shadow Fall is a competent shooter in terms of both campaign gameplay and multiplayer offerings. It may not be the most innovative title on the market, but it's certainly one of the top stars of the PlayStation 4's launch lineup.\\" Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot scored the game a 7 out of 10 and said: \\"As much as I enjoyed my online time with Killzone Shadow Fall-and as much as I will enjoy lots more time with it, unlocking perks that allow me to personalize my weapons-I missed Killzone 3s jump pack, which brought a nifty nimbleness to the battlegrounds. I missed it in Shadow Falls disappointing single-player campaign, too, which sorely needed a shot of adrenaline. Where I look back fondly on Killzone 2s finest single-player moments, the moments I recall here are those in which I wandered through corridors and rocky meadows wondering where the bad guys were. Luckily, Guerrilla Games remembered what drew me and many others to the front lines of online war, and it's here that Shadow Fall emerges from the rubble and flies into the electric skies.\\" GamesRadar's Ryan Taljonick gave the game a positive review. He scored it a 4/5 and stated: \\"Killzone Shadow Fall is an excellent way to kick off the eighth console generation. Sure, its characters may not be all that convincing, and its multiplayer is more a well-crafted distraction than a long-term destination, but the game as a whole contains plenty of unexpected surprises that make it worth your time. The open-ended missions, though not as plentiful as you might like, are made even better thanks to the awesome tools at your disposal, and its story has some powerful moments that are sure to catch you off guard. And even when it hits lulls, you'll still have a great time shooting to your heart's content.\\" Colin Moriarty of IGN gave a generally positive review, with a score of 8 out of 10. He called it \\"great\\", praised the \\"stunning\\" graphics, said the multiplayer was \\"fun\\" and liked the gameplay improvements. Some negative comments were made concerning the AI and level design. Moriarty summed up the review by saying \\"There's never been a better time for everyone to be paying attention to the Killzone franchise, because Shadow Fall is a step in an all-new, very welcome direction.\\" Polygon's review was more harsh, with Arthur Gies giving the game a score of 5 out of 10. Gies praised the visuals but said the game is filled with \\"shooter cliches\\" and is marred by poor execution. \\"Shadow Fall looks like the future, but it's stuck in the past,\\" Gies said. \\"In a launch lineup crowded with shooters, Killzone Shadow Fall sits at the bottom.\\" = Sales = Killzone Shadow Fall was a commercial success, selling almost 800,000 copies as of 25 December 2013. As of 2 March 2014 it has sold over 2.1million copies.http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/01/29/killzone-shadow-fall- sells-21-million-copieshttps://www.engadget.com/2014/01/29/killzone-shadow- fall-global-sales-top-2-1-million/ Killzone Shadow Fall received several awards after its release, including the Best PS4 Shooter and Best PS4 Graphics by IGN. It also received the People's Choice awards on both categories. = Lawsuit = On 5 August 2014, Sony was sued for $5million in a class action lawsuit. Sony was accused of \\"deceptive marketing\\" because the game's multiplayer mode does not run at the resolution advertised. The case was dismissed on 22 April 2015.

It is the third installment in the Infamous series. The game was released worldwide on March 21, 2014. The player-controlled protagonist possesses superpower abilities that players use in combat and when traveling across the city. The story follows protagonist Delsin Rowe fighting the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) in a fictionalized Seattle. Over the course of the game, Delsin acquires new powers and becomes either good or evil as player choices influence his morality. Sucker Punch began planning the game as early as 2011, when they began discussion with Sony to bring the Infamous series onto a new generation of hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions they would like to see on the PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin's powers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design. Infamous Second Son was met with generally positive reviews; critics praised its gameplay, dynamic combat, visuals and design, while criticism was aimed at the game's morality system, which some found to be dated and binary, as well as the game's repetitive side missions. The story was met with a mixed response, with some critics finding the narrative and characters to be a step backwards from previous installments in the series, while others viewing the writing as an improvement over its predecessors. Infamous Second Son was a commercial success, and sold over a million copies within nine days, making it the fastest-selling entry within the Infamous franchise and one of the best selling PlayStation 4 games.  Gameplay  Delsin may use his superpowers to subdue enemies rather than killing them. Players make choices like these, with Delsin's alt=The player character Delsin Rowe has just used his powers to subdue an enemy, who lays restrained on the floor with light particles that resemble chains wrapped around him. The text prompt in the upper-left hand corner reads \\"Enemy subdued\\". Infamous Second Son is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. Players control the main character Delsin Rowe, who can parkour-style climb vertical surfaces like high-rise buildings. Delsin is a Conduit, which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke, neon, video, and concrete. These materials can be weaponized (such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from his fingertips) or used to deftly navigate the game world (such as using neon to dash up buildings). Using powers depletes a meter in the head-up display (HUD), which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles. Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story, which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) during missions. Each time Delsin gains a new power set he must destroy D.U.P. Core Relays to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it. Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected, they are scattered throughout Seattle. Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin's suite of abilities. Players may choose to act in either a good or evil way. Examples including healing civilians, doing drug busts, and stopping suspect brutality for good, or killing innocent civilians and killing instead of apprehending enemies. Several times throughout the story, Delsin finds himself in a scenario where he must make a good or evil choice, such as whether to encourage Conduit vigilante Abigail \\"Fetch\\" Walker to stop slaying drug dealers, or to train her to become a more prolific killer. Player choices influence outcomes in some later missions. In combat, Delsin may use his abilities to incapacitate foes or obliterate them with headshots. He may choose to open fire on innocent civilians. Delsin's choices manifest in a logo displayed on his jacket and the HUD, which features a blue (good) and red (evil) bird. Performing actions that are villainous gradually change the logo so that the red bird dominates the other, with the opposite happening with heroism. This is a visual representation of Delsin's Karma level, that increases as good or evil depending on his choices. As his Karma level increases, Delsin can acquire new powers that correspond to his play-style (e.g. very destructive powers with high levels of evil Karma) and his jacket also changes. If you have good karma, the jacket completely changes white whereas if evil the jacket turns red. A continual streak of either good or evil actions fills up a bar in the HUD, which then lets Delsin perform a powerful finishing move called a Karma Bomb. When not completing story missions, players can explore the city and complete activities such as tagging graffiti spots or assassinating D.U.P. secret agents. The city is split into districts that are all initially controlled by the D.U.P., but Delsin gradually liberates each district by completing activities. When D.U.P. control of a district falls below 30 percent, Delsin can enter a District Showdown that requires him to eliminate a wave of D.U.P. forces, eradicating D.U.P. presence there.  Plot = Setting and characters = Second Son takes place in 2016, seven years after Infamous 2s Conduit protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifices himself to cure humanity of a plague and destroy The Beast.http://conduitrightsleague.com/quiz?locale=en \\"Approximately 15% of conduits all over the world died when The Beast was destroyed in New Marais. The deaths were so widespread that conduits were believed to have experienced an extinction event. But in the following months it became evident that some conduits managed to survive‚Äîeven some who were present at New Marais at the time of The boys destruction. To this day, we do not know why some perished and others survived, but we suspect some kind of Ray Field Radiation event occurred.\\" Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon, which kills him and most of the other Conduits. The U.S. government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world's remaining Conduits, dubbing Conduits with the pejorative \\"Bioterrorists \\". The protagonist is Delsin Rowe (Troy Baker), a 24 year old graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation. Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of Power Mimicry, allowing him to mimic the powers of other Conduits he comes into contact with. His brother, Reggie (Travis Willingham), is the local sheriff, and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism. Both are Akomish Native Americans, whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay, Washington. The antagonist is Brooke Augustine (Christine Dunford), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over Concrete. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry \\"Hank\\" Daughtry (David Stanbra), a convict with control over Smoke; Abigail \\"Fetch\\" Walker (Laura Bailey), an ex- junkie who uses her Neon powers to hunt down illegal drug dealers in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a reclusive video gamer who uses his Video (digital materialization) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P. = Story = In 2016, after Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their subsequent argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages to pull the third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank in an effort to figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or say nothing. Regardless, Augustine knocks him out before moving on to the other tribe members. Delsin awakens a week later and discovers that Augustine has tortured the rest of the tribe in an unsuccessful bid to gain information. However, she has left them to gradually die from concrete shards buried into their bodies, including their leader Betty (Karen Austin). Reggie, who was spared from the torture, learns that the only way to remove the shards is to use Augustine's power on them. Delsin realizes that he can absorb Conduit powers and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine's powers and save the tribe. Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him. They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits. With Reggie's help, Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers. He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits, Fetch and Eugene, and absorbs their powers. After both confrontations, Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie, who initially views them as \\"freaks\\", and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them. Now possessing three powers, Delsin encounters Hank, who has escaped again. Hank tells Delsin that Fetch and Eugene have been captured by the D.U.P., and are being held on an artificial concrete island in Puget Sound. However, the situation turns out to be a trap set by Augustine. Reggie appears and rescues Delsin with a rocket launcher. While the brothers free Fetch and Eugene, Augustine encases Reggie's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform. As they dangle above the ocean, Reggie realizes that Delsin cannot save both of them, tells him that he is proud of him, and lets Delsin's hand go. Reggie falls to his death as he drowns in the ocean. Distraught and enraged, Delsin climbs back up onto the platform and battles Augustine, destroying the entire island. Augustine flees back to the D.U.P. headquarters. Delsin tracks Hank down to the docks, where he is fleeing from D.U.P. forces. Hank begs for forgiveness, saying that he only worked with Augustine because she threatened to hurt his daughter. Delsin can choose to either kill Hank out of revenge, or let him escape Seattle with his daughter. Aided by Fetch and Eugene, Delsin rallies an assault on the D.U.P. headquarters. After breaking through the building's defenses, Delsin confronts Augustine and reveals to her that he has figured out she staged the Conduit escape at Akomish to instill fear in the population and give the D.U.P. a reason to continue their regime. Augustine lets Delsin absorb her powers, and tells him that she wants to save the Conduits by imprisoning and protecting them from the population. Delsin battles and eventually defeats Augustine with his new concrete powers. If Delsin has good Karma, he spares Augustine and exposes her crimes to the world. She is arrested and the D.U.P. disbands. Delsin, Fetch and Eugene convince the humans that they can peacefully coexist with the Conduits. All of the imprisoned Conduits are freed. Delsin returns to the reservation and heals the tribe members, then paints a mural dedicated to Reggie. If Delsin has evil Karma, he kills Augustine and, together with Fetch and Eugene, takes control of Seattle. He releases all of the imprisoned Conduits and absorbs their powers. Upon returning to the reservation, Delsin is met by a wheelchair-bound Betty who banishes him from the tribe for the killings in Seattle. Shocked and angered, Delsin destroys the entire reservation.  Development = Origins and PlayStation 4 = Sucker Punch Productions were very involved with the development of the PlayStation 4 platform. They discussed with Sony how much power they would like with the new hardware and what refinements they would like to see on the DualShock 4 gamepad. Sucker Punch Productions began to develop Second Son while the PlayStation 4 was still being designed. Having finished work on Infamous: Festival of Blood, they began to plan a new entry in the Infamous series under the working title Infamous 3. As early as 2010, they discussed with Sony their desire to bring Infamous to a new PlayStation platform. Sucker Punch were in close connection with the PS4's lead system architect Mark Cerny, who visited the studio several times. They gave Cerny feedback about how much power a new PlayStation system would require to render their ideal open world, how fast it would be capable of doing so and to what degree of texture detail. \\"We had some experience there that was useful for that team when they were planning some aspects of the hardware design\\", producer Brian Fleming explained. He found that during the PS4's development, there was a great level of interactivity between the system's designers and game developers such as Sucker Punch. Sucker Punch made suggested improvements they would like to see for the DualShock 4 gamepad. Second Sons designer Jaime Griesemer traveled to Sony's headquarters in Japan to discuss such improvements. The developers found they were able to adopt the DualShock 4's touchpad into Second Sons gameplay (for example, players emulate the in-game fingerprint scanner using the DualShock 4 touchpad). The game was envisioned to take full advantage of the hardware, without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while he draws neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new. Over 110 developers worked on the game, a number that director Nate Fox considered small. He felt that working with a small team necessitated having a defined vision for the game from the outset, \\"to answer those first questions about what you want your game to be\\". Sometimes, ideas came about during development that would have to be thrown out for not fitting with the game's original vision. \\"We kill our darlings at Sucker Punch. It's not easy; it's necessary\\", Fox explained. Second Son displays a native resolution of 1080p at 30 frames per second. = Design = Second Sons graphical quality was possible because development was conducted on the PS4, which Sucker Punch found powerful and easy to use. Their research for the game world led to the reproduction of Seattle landmarks such as the alt=A screenshot of the game world's Seattle skyline, with the Space Needle depicted in the center. Lighting, draw distances and weather effects are visible. Sucker Punch elected to set Second Son in their hometown of Seattle as they could draw from their personal experiences in the open world's design. During early development when team members debated where Second Son would be set, Seattle rated high on a list of possibilities. Fleming considered that the city had not been featured in many games prior to Second Son and so would not be \\"overblown\\", and felt that Seattle's weather and mixture of \\"old and new\\" architecture would make it an interesting setting. The team conducted fieldwork in Seattle's nearby forests with audio and video equipment, which was used to reproduce local flora and the chirping sounds of local American robins. Seattle landmarks such as Pioneer Square, the Space Needle and Elephant Car Washes feature in the game. The developers licensed logos and signs from local businesses. Griesemer called the game world an \\"abstraction\\" of Seattle rather than a re-creation since its layout did not suit Second Sons gameplay and required the team to make necessary changes. The team wanted to thematically explore Seattle's heritage of Pacific Northwest, Native American tribes in the game. The designers used graphic sliders in the game engine to determine the amount of water covering the streets. Like Seattle, rain is frequent in the game. The lighting effects (such as neon light from Delsin's powers) coupled with reflections help bring color into Seattle's dark and rainy atmosphere. Because of the move to the PS4, Sucker Punch were able to render more open world than what was possible in previous Infamous games. \\"You get a better feel of the city when you can see more of it\\", said Griesemer. After deciding on Seattle for the setting, the developers began to think about the superpowers that Delsin would possess. They added neon lighting to the city to amplify the \\"beautiful reflective streets\\", and subsequently decided to make neon a source of power for Delsin because of its prevalence. Animation director Billy Harper considered Delsin's smoke powers challenging to design, as the team wanted to make powers feel more fluid than in previous Infamous games. They removed Cole's \\"contorted hand poses\\" to improve the connection between Delsin and his powers. Fox felt that smoke helps Delsin deftly navigate the game world by letting him zip up buildings and through enemies. Griesemer (who previously worked with Bungie on the Halo series) wanted to bring the fluidity of first-person shooters to Second Sons combat. The team reviewed the control scheme of previous Infamous games and \\"removed some of the complexity that was preventing people from interacting with the game\\". Griesemer said that a recurring theme throughout Infamous games that they wanted to continue with Second Son was the idea of \\"modern elemental powers\\", variations on commonplace powers drawn from the game world. Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. \\"This is a game about super powers, so for us, the way the effects look tells you a lot about how you're playing the game\\", he explained. Fox considered that the game world's resemblance to Seattle helped the superpower elements feel authentic. \\"Because we have that sweet foundation of plausibility, you buy into the super-powered element\\", he explained. = Character development = Second Sons premise is built from the ending of Infamous 2 that sees protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifice himself to save humanity. They looked at Trophy data and found the majority (78%) of Infamous 2 players chose this ending, and concurred with the popular choice. This allowed them to create the new protagonist, Delsin, from scratch. \\"Moving forward onto [Second Son], we said 'Alright, Cole's dead. People have voted for this. Let's make a new hero'\\", Fox explained. Griesemer felt that taking the Infamous series to the PS4 signified a new era, and that departing from the story of previous games would help them reach new audiences. \\"We needed a new entry point, and Delsin was the first step for that\\", he explained. The idea to move away from Cole's story came about during pre-production staff meetings, and was confirmed after discussions both internally and with Sony Computer Entertainment. Griesemer described the contemporaneous sentiment as \\"It's going to be new hardware, a new platform and we're going to have a new audience\\". alt=A digital rendering of a man's face in a motion capture software. Delsin's Native American heritage came from the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where four of the six team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: \\"What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?\\". Harper considered Delsin \\"full of reckless abandon\\", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin \\"flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to\\", trying to live up to his successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a \\"hero's journey\\". Digital Domain were brought on board for the motion capture work. Fox helped direct the actors' performances, but found that they did not need much guidance for their roles. \\"You need to let them understand what you need from a scene, but the actors are so much better equipped to deliver that than me\\", he explained. Fleming considered that using motion capture added authenticity to the characters. \\"The ability to capture [Delsin's] facial reaction when he's like 'Oh, shit', but doesn't say 'Oh shit'‚Äîthat's a big deal\\", he explained. Most of the non-player characters (NPCs) that inhabit the open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked their friends and families if they would like to appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons‚Äîany blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.  Release  On February 20, 2013, Sony held a conference in New York that announced the PlayStation 4. Fox appeared on-stage during the conference and recounted participating in an anti-globalization protest in Seattle in 1999. He announced Second Son, and a debut trailer was shown that introduced the game's premise and lead character. The game was privately demoed at E3 2013, and its March 21, 2014, North American release date was confirmed during a PS4 launch event on November 14, 2013. By February 25, 2014, Second Son went gold (finished development). On March 8, it was announced that Second Sons pre- order sales had surpassed those of The Last of Us in the United Kingdom. Two special edition versions of the game were produced; pre-ordered and first-run copies of the game received the Limited Edition, which includes the Coles Legacy mission pack that explain story events between Infamous 2 and Second Son. The Collector's Edition includes a unique box cover, a replica of Delsin's beanie, eight pins from his vest, an exclusive in-game vest, and a D.U.P.-themed patch. All pre-ordered copies of the game included four in-game vests for Delsin. = Downloadable content = Paper Trail is a free downloadable content (DLC) with alternate reality game features. The story is split into six parts, with the first being available after reaching a certain point in the main story. Each subsequent part was made available each Friday from March 28, 2014 in North America and, concluding with the release of the final part on April 25, 2014. At E3 2014, the DLC package Infamous First Light was announced and was released on August 26, 2014 in North America and August 27, 2014 in Europe. In First Light, the player controls Fetch. It is a stand- alone expansion and Second Son is not required to play the game, but ownership of Second Son grants players access to exclusive content and music. The track \\"Sanctus Immortale\\" composed and produced by Menelik Eu'el Solomon also features on the exclusive content pack. Infamous First Light received mixed to positive reviews from critics.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Vince Ingenito of IGN recalled being left \\"staring slack-jawed\\" at the visuals, and called the open world \\"beautifully and diversely realized\\" with impressive lighting effects. Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot called the visuals \\"incredible\\". Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised Seattle's art direction, and found the draw distances and frame rate consistent. David Meikleham of PlayStation Official Magazine (OPM) was very impressed with the graphics and 1080p definition, but cited occasional frame rate dips during intense combat. He enjoyed playing in Seattle and using his powers to level the destructible environments. Tamoor Hussain of Computer and Video Games (CVG) praised graphical details like the particle and lighting systems. \\"[The game is] colorful, rich in detail and has some of the best effects we've seen on console\\", he wrote. GameSpot's Mc Shea considered the combat well-balanced between Infamous's slower pace and Infamous 2s frenetic action, and enjoyed Delsin's agility and power. Chris Carter of Destructoid considered the combat's simplicity its strength, finding Delsin easy to control and navigate the world. Edge were underwhelmed with the game's opening because of its \\"skittish\\" parkour, but noted that once Delsin gained powers and reached Seattle, the game became very fun. They felt that enemies were clever enough to make combat a fun challenge, and called the main missions \\"for the most part well designed and generously proportioned\\". IGN's Ingenito enjoyed using Delsin's powers in combat, and called each set \\"strong enough to hang an entire game on\\". He found upgrading Delsin's powers helped keep the combat fresh and made for good replay value. Philip Kollar of Polygon favored using neon power, but praised the balance and variety between all of them. He called the combat \\"a hell of a lot of fun\\". Eurogamer's Welsh found the combat imperfect yet fun, but did not think that upgrading Delsin's skills made enough of a difference to his power. Destructoid's Carter thought that Delsin was a more interesting protagonist than \\"wooden\\" Cole, which helped his investment into the story. IGN's Ingenito thought Delsin was an interesting lead character, especially because of the chemistry with Reggie. He found Troy Baker's performance of Delsin \\"[imbued] with a charm and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling tropey or overwrought\\". However, he found supporting characters like Fetch underdeveloped and the narrative too straightforward. Although calling the characters clich√©d, Edge felt that they were written and acted well. GameSpot's Mc Shea called Delsin annoying and immature, and found the gameplay more interesting than the \\"tired\\" story. Eurogamer's Welsh considered the plot driven by \\"inconsequential MacGuffins\\" and thought the ending rushed, but praised the story for not stretching on too long. Polygon's Kollar felt that the story did not explore its themes of surveillance and security-over-freedom well enough, such that its impact was diminished. He was overall disappointed with the narrative, despite finding the main characters written better than in previous Infamous games. OPM's Meikleham was put off by Delsin's arrogance and was underwhelmed with the story, but he was impressed by the quality of the motion capture performances. Edge and Eurogamer's Welsh faulted the morality system because they did not think it had enough influence on the story. IGN's Ingenito called it \\"woefully outdated\\", and felt that making evil choices severely jarred with Delsin's character. He found the system redundant because Delsin became more powerful when he strictly adhered to either a good or evil play-style, rather than crossing in-between. GameSpot's Mc Shea felt that the morality system was too binary because there was no \\"moral gray area\\" between playing good and evil. Polygon's Kollar reflected Mc Shea's opinion that the morality choices were too binary, and had difficulty connecting to his choices because they were too polarized between good and evil. OPM's Meikleham felt that the morality system had \\"little to no impact on gameplay\\". Danny Cowan of Joystiq thought that the morality system was well-balanced, with equal incentive and drawback tied to Delsin's choices. GameSpot's Mc Shea found Second Sons open world beholden to a dated formula. He described Seattle as \\"a playground for you to go nuts in\\" instead of \\"a living, breathing world\\", with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players. CVGs Hussain called Seattle \\"hauntingly empty\\", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He felt that the open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V, Sleeping Dogs and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that Second Son did not innovate the open world genre as well as it could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as \\"virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs\\". Edge found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. \\"Approach [Second Son] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense\\", they wrote. Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards. Tom Watson wrote in New Statesman that Second Son was his ¬£20-¬£40 game of the year, and justification for his purchasing PlayStation 4 after owning Xbox 360. = Sales = The game sold over one million copies in nine days after its launch, making it one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games as well as the fastest-selling installment in the series.

The album was recorded at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon, at five performances in February and May 2012. It contains works by three English 20th-century composers: Edward Elgar's Cockaigne (In London Town), Ralph Vaughan Williams' Symphony No. 5, and \\"Four Sea Interludes\\" and \\"Passacaglia\\" from Benjamin Britten's opera Peter Grimes. The recording was the orchestra's second under Kalmar's leadership, following Music for a Time of War (2011), which also included works by Britten and Vaughan Williams. This England received positive critical reception but failed to chart. Background and composition The album was recorded at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. This England, released by Dutch record label PentaTone Classics on November 13, 2012, contains compositions by three English 20th-century composers: Cockaigne (In London Town) by Edward Elgar, Symphony No. 5 by Ralph Vaughan Williams, and \\"Four Sea Interludes\\" and \\"Passacaglia\\" from the opera Peter Grimes (1945) by Benjamin Britten. The album contains ten tracks, with works divided into separate tracks for each movement and interlude. The works were recorded live at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon, at five performances in February and May 2012. Symphony No. 5 and Cockaigne were performed February 18 and 19 as part of the program \\"Kahane Plays Mozart\\";\\"Kahane Plays Mozart\\":  the works by Britten were performed May 12‚Äì14 as part of the program \\"Arnaldo Cohen Plays Tchaikovsky\\".\\"Arnaldo Cohen Plays Tchaikovsky\\":  In his review of the February 18th live performance, The Oregonian James McQuillen noted disturbances from the audience, including coughing and the ringing of one attendant's cell phone. McQuillen suggested the disturbances could be removed from the audio by engineers if the February 19th recording was not preferable. The album was the second recorded during Kalmar's tenure, following Music for a Time of War (2011), which also included works by Britten and Vaughan Williams and which received Grammy Award nominations for Best Orchestral Performance and Best Engineered Album, Classical. The recording was the second of four albums expected to be produced by the Symphony and PentaTone by the end of the 2014‚Äì2015 season, all under Kalmar's artistic leadership. Like Music for a Time of War, This England was recorded in hybrid multichannel (surround sound) Super Audio CD format. Blanton Alspaugh served as producer. Alspaugh and John Newton were the recording engineers, and mixing and mastering was conducted by Mark Donahue. In addition to recording the performances, the Boston-based company Soundmirror edited, mixed and mastered the audio. Program notes for the recording were written by Steven Kruger. The album's cover art was designed by David McLaughlin, art director for the Symphony. The Symphony celebrated the recording by hosting a CD release party in late October. =Works= Elgar conducted the world premiere of Cockaigne (In London Town) at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert at Queen's Hall in London in June 1901. The Oregon Symphony last performed the overture in January 1990, under Norman Leyden. The work, which is approximately 15 minutes in length, employs two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, one contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, two cornets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, five percussionists, strings. Symphony No. 5 was composed during the period 1936‚Äì1943 and premiered in June 1943, with Vaughan Williams conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Royal Albert Hall in London. The widely performed work evokes serenity and pastoral settings; despite being completed during World War II, Vaughan Williams originally intended the work to be an opera when he began writing it before the war. The symphony, which is approximately 41 minutes in length, contains four movements (\\"Preludio\\", \\"Scherzo\\", \\"Romanza\\" and \\"Passacaglia\\") and includes two flutes (second doubling piccolo), oboe, English horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani and strings. The Oregon Symphony's February 2012 performances were its first performances of Symphony No. 5. The recording continues with Britten's \\"Four Sea Interludes\\" and \\"Passacaglia\\". The four interludes (\\"Dawn\\", \\"Sunday morning\\", \\"Moonlight\\" and \\"Storm\\") have been published separately as Opus 33a; \\"Passacaglia\\" has also been published separately as Opus 33b. Peter Grimes premiered on June 7, 1945, at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London, conducted by Reginald Goodall. On June 13, Britten conducted the four interludes with the London Philharmonic in Cheltenham; Adrian Boult conducted \\"Passacaglia\\" with the BBC Symphony Orchestra on August 29. Prior to 2012, the Oregon Symphony's most recent performance of \\"Four Sea Interludes\\" had been in 1993 under James DePreist; the orchestra had never presented \\"Passacaglia\\". The interludes and \\"Passacaglia\\" are approximately 16 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively, and include two flutes (both doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, bells, cymbals, gong, snare drum, tam tam, tambourine, tenor drum, xylophone, celeste, harp and strings. The percussion section added a 14-foot chime to produce bell sounds, which had to be stationed horizontally on stage. Reception This England received positive critical reception. David Patrick Stearns of Philadelphia Daily News awarded the album 3.5 out of 4 stars and, also referring to the success of Music for a Time of War, wrote that the repertoire has \\"perfectly wide appeal, especially in vital, muscular performances such as these\\". Stearns, who appreciated Kalmar's balance of technicality and the music's \\"exterior atmosphere\\", called the performances \\"thoughtful\\" and \\"incisive\\". He also noted the originality of the interludes and \\"Passacaglia\\" from Peter Grimes, claiming they \\"won't be mistaken for anybody else's.\\" In his review for The Huffington Post, Brian Horay wrote that the orchestra delivered \\"knockout\\" and \\"beefy-yet-restrained\\" performances of the Peter Grimes compositions. Referring to This England and its preceding album, which featured Sinfonia da Requiem, Horay said the recordings \\"showcase Kalmar and his band as supreme interpreters of Benjamin Britten's amazingly colorful brand of orchestral anxiety, inviting the listener to delve ever deeper into painful, yet rewarding, symphonic ambivalence.\\" Classical CD Review's Robert Benson called the Elgar performance \\"brilliant\\" and appreciated that \\"Passacaglia\\" was programmed before \\"The Storm\\". Benson complimented Kalmar (calling him a \\"conductor to watch\\") as well as the sound of the recording, describing it as \\"well-balanced orchestral sound, with a wide dynamic range\\". He noted the lack of audience interference with the sound and assured audiophiles that they would appreciate the quality. Steven Ritter of Audiophile Audition wrote that the Symphony performed \\"with a brilliance and verve equal to any on record\\" and were \\"entirely attuned to the 'English' idiom\\". Ritter complimented Kalmar and the orchestra for the performances, saying \\"Who knew Oregon could sound like this? PentaTone should hold on to this bunch as long as they can, and explore as much repertory as they can handle. Great sound, performances, and production!\\" Several Oregon publications included This England on their lists highlighting local products. Portland Monthly included the album on their list of \\"November's Best PDX Stuff\\", which showcases Portland's \\"coolest products and ideas\\". The Oregonian included the album on their list of \\"25 local gifts under $25\\". Oregon ArtsWatch contributor Brett Campbell recommended the album on his list of Oregon classical music \\"stocking stuffers\\". Campbell wrote that, despite the acoustic limitations of the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, the live recordings \\"achieve admirable depth and clarity that bring out unexpected elements in both major 20th century English compositions\\". He also complimented Kalmar and the orchestra for their \\"tightly wound expressiveness\\" and \\"sharp\\" performances, and said their recording of Cockaigne can \\"proudly stand alongside other top versions by the likes of the London Symphony Orchestra\\".

It was designed for people with a serious interest in rock and pop, and was considered the journal of record for the Australian music scene, along the way producing some of the country‚Äôs best writers on music and popular culture. History RAM was founded in Sydney by Anthony O'Grady ‚Äì a former advertising creative who'd contributed to the earlier pop weekly, Go-Set, in its dying days, and had edited the short-lived Ear for Music magazine ‚Äì and Phillip Mason, a young British publishing executive with the IPC media empire who‚Äôd been seconded to Australia. It was modelled on the English music trade papers, New Musical Express and Melody Maker, and O'Grady's stated objective was that there would be no drop in quality between the copy it imported from those papers - which it was able to arrange thanks to Philip Mason‚Äôs relationship with his former employers, who owned both the NME and MM - and the copy it generated domestically, which had been the case with previous Australian rock magazines. There were three eras of RAM, each defined by their editors/ownerships ‚Äì with O'Grady, Greg Taylor and Phil Stafford as successive editors - and launched with a first issue, with Mick Jagger on the cover, on 8 March 1975. Under O'Grady, who at first virtually wrote the magazine single- handedly under a variety of pseudonyms ‚Äì his then-girlfriend Annie Beaumont taking the photos ‚Äì RAM charted the transition of the Australian music scene from the Countdown era, with its teenybopper battles between Sherbet and Skyhooks, to the emergence, in the latter 70s, of the fabled pub circuit with its figureheads like Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil and the Angels. Recruiting writers like Jenny then-Hunter/later-Jewel Brown, Glenn A. Baker and Annie Burton plus an older hand like Vince Lovegrove, the magazine was starting to reach a significant audience, and reach O'Grady‚Äôs objective of putting Australian rock journalism on a par with its counterpart overseas. The late-70s‚Äô punk uprising that took place as readily in Australia as it did elsewhere around the world was a challenge for RAM, but one that O'Grady, with his personal championship of Radio Birdman, managed to meet quite successfully. Additionally bringing in new younger writers like, progressively, Andrew McMillan, Jodie ‚ÄòJ.J.‚Äô Adams, Stuart Coupe, Richard Guilliatt, Samantha Trenoweth and Clinton Walker, RAM integrated the new wave alongside its coverage of the mainstream, and this gave it another edge over its competitors like Juke and Australian Rolling Stone, who were slower on the uptake. By 1980, after having started out in a terrace house in Paddington and then moved to another terrace in Glebe, RAM had taken over a building on Crown St. in the heart of Darlinghurst, and so successful was the burgeoning little media empire overseen by Philip Mason and his partner Barry Stewart ‚Äì called Soundtracks ‚Äì that it had bought up the surfing magazine Tracks and launched a fashion magazine called Ragtimes too. Like RAM, Tracks was the leader in its field, and the pair were trailed by Ragtimes, which Mason had created as a plaything for his wife, Alexandra Joel. In May 1980, Soundtracks sold RAM to Eastern Suburbs Newspapers, thus beginning O'Gradys slow exit from the magazine. (Mason-Stewart would go on to long publish Australian editions of Playboy and Smash Hits.) Greg Taylor, a musician as well as a journalist (sax player with Jimmy and the Boys), meantime served an apprenticeship as Assistant Editor under O‚ÄôGrady. New writers like Kent Goddard, Miranda Brown (Jenny‚Äôs younger sister) and Elly McDonald were blooded. In late 1981, O'Grady finally, formally left his creation and Greg Taylor took over the editorship. O‚ÄôGrady went on to work successfully in print, film, TV and radio, founding the influential tipsheet The Music Network in 1994; he died in 2018. RAM left Darlinghurst to move into new corporate headquarters in central Sydney; Eastern Suburbs Newspapers was a division of Fairfax, the media empire that owned the Sydney Morning Herald and Melbourne's Age, meaning that ironically RAM was now owned by the same company that also owned its principal rival Juke. RAM and the corporate world was not, unsurprisingly, a good fit ‚Äì no longer were there joints before lunchtime, or at any time for that matter ‚Äì but still the magazine continued to thrive. The early 80s was a very real golden age for Australian music, in terms of both numbers that reached heights that would never be repeated and quality that was consistently spread across a wide base, and RAM was the chief chronicler of the period, despite increasing competition from the now-monthly and ever more localized Rolling Stone finally making up some ground. Juke‚Äôs reach was never much beyond its base in Melbourne, and start-ups like Roadrunner and Vox had already folded. Writers like Jenny Brown, Andrew McMillan and Stuart Coupe continued to occasionally contribute to the magazine but less so as they went in different directions, Coupe to edit TAGG magazine and manage bands like the Hoodoo Gurus and Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls, Brown to work for Mushroom Music, and McMillan to move to Darwin to live and work; McMillan died in 2012. Greg Taylor bought in Phil Stafford as Assistant Editor, and when Clinton Walker left Australia to go and work overseas in 1982, two new young guns, Frank Brunetti and Mark Mordue, came in to fill the gap specializing in the ‚Äòinner city sound‚Äô, to use the term Walker had coined for his recently published first book about the post-punk indy underground that was becoming a growing market sector. Photographers Phillip Morris, Bob King, Linda Nolte, Francine McDougall and later Ian Greene, Tom Takacs and long-serving Art Director Garry Fletcher, gave the magazine its visual signature. Toby Creswell, who up to this time had also occasionally contributed to the magazine, now shifted over to concentrate on Rolling Stone, and it was his subsequent editorship (and ownership) of the local Stone franchise that redoubled its challenge to RAM. By 1984, with many other new writers like Marie Ryan and Virginia Moncrieff joining the roster of freelancers, Phil Stafford had bought the magazine, taken over as Editor, and moved it back to its spiritual home in Darlinghurst. There, with Stafford‚Äôs family by his side - his wife Jacqui and brother Chris, who drew brilliant cartoons for the magazine as well as associate-editing - RAM found a new lease on life. Clinton Walker returned to the fold, making for a formidable front- line alongside Frank Brunetti and Mark Mordue, at least until Brunetti drifted away to concentrate on his band the Died Pretty, and Mordue went off to edit Stiletto and then Australian Style. But new waves of writers continued to come through, including Wanda Jamrozik, Jon Casimir, Mark Demetrius, Bernard Zuel, Jack Marx, Paul Toohey, Craig N. Pearce, Lynden Barber, Tim McGee, Pat Sheill, Ignatious Jones, John Encarnacao, Brent Clough, Mara Smarelli and others. RAM even acquired a designated American correspondent, the LA-based Cary Darling. The difference now was that proto-‚Äòalternative‚Äô acts like Nick Cave or the GoBetweens could make the cover; although it‚Äôs almost certain that when would- be stadium rockers like, say, Jimmy Barnes or INXS, graced the cover, those issues sold better. But still the scene was sufficiently rich, even as the pub circuit was starting to shrink, that RAM was never caught short for content. The careers of so many iconic Australian acts were chronicled in the pages of RAM, whether Midnight Oil, the Angels, INXS, the Sunnyboys, the Church, Mental As Anything, Paul Kelly, the GoBetweens, Nick Cave, the Triffids, the Divinyls, Crowded House, Hunters & Collectors, the Hoodoo Gurus‚Ä¶ the 80s were the great glory days of pub rock, and a RAM stringer always had his or her 'name on the door'. In the end though, RAM was caught between a rock and hard place. On one hand, the rise of the free street press stole a lot of its advertising, and even without the writing firepower, papers like Sydney's On the Street, Melbourne's Beat, Brisbane's Time Off and Perth's X-Press stole a lot of its readers due to being weekly, free (of course), and offering comprehensive regionalized gig guides (something RAM could never quite manage, despite trying). On the other hand, the local monthly edition of Rolling Stone, now owned and edited by Toby Creswell, was no longer inky newsprint but a colour glossy, and was finally tapping into the Australian scene to as intimate an extent as RAM ever had - and now had the pool of writers to tell the stories. Phil Stafford fought valiantly to keep RAM alive but its time had passed. After a quick succession of a couple more very short-lived editors, Stephen Cadbury and Paul Toohey, the magazine died a much-lamented if sadly timely death after its last issue in July 1989. In 2012, Jenny Brown was the presenter of a radio documentary, Paper Trail, which described her ‚Äòhack‚Äôs progress‚Äô from the underground hippie press of the early 70s to RAM in the late 70s. Clinton Walker has also published online a personal history of the Australian music press in the era of ink, called Lowest of the Low, and it gives much coverage to RAM generally as well as his involvement with the magazine. When Anthony O'Grady died just before Christmas in 2018, it prompted an outpouring of affection and admiration, and finally the tag that he himself so modestly resisted - the Godfather of Australian rock journalism - could be applied and would stick.

The work depicts the interior of a packed omnibus carriage. It is held by the Tate Gallery in London. It is a genre painting, showing a contemporary subject matter in modern dress, as became popular in the Victorian period. Egley's work may be inspired by paintings of cramped railway carriages by French painter Honor√© Daumier. The early omnibus was a horse-drawn carriage drawn along a set route, picking up and dropping off passengers as it went. It was introduced in London on 4 July 1829 and soon became a popular form of transport for the middle classes - the working class would not be able to afford the fare, and upper classes could afford their own vehicle or to hire a hackney carriage. The typical London omnibus was an enclosed and glazed carriage with four wheels, drawn by one or two horses. Passengers could sit on benches to either side inside, entering via a door at the rear, or climb up to exposed seats on the roof. A driver would ride at the front of the carriage, with a conductor assisting passengers to climb aboard or depart and taking fares at the rear. Egley painted the interior of an omnibus carriage at a coachbuilder's yard in Paddington, showing a view from near the front of the carriage towards the rear door. A view of Westbourne Grove can be seen through the rear windows, near Egley's home at a chemist's shop on the corner of Hereford Road. The scene enables Egley to paint a variety of people crowded into the carriage. The passengers are forced together without regard to their social status and do their best to ignore avoid catching each other's eye. An elderly country woman with piles of luggage looks in concern at the plight of a well-dressed young mother (based on Egley's wife) with two children, who demurely averts her gave; further back a city clerk sits with his cane. A young woman with parasol and fashionable crinoline is attempting to enter, with the conductor peering in to check if there is any space. The painting measures by , and has a distinctive quatrefoil frame. It was exhibited at the British Institution in 1859 and sold to William Jennings for 50 guineas (¬£52 10s). A version was engraved for the Illustrated London News in 1859. The painting was bequeathed to the Tate Gallery by Jenny Louisa Roberta Blaker in 1947, possibly from the collection of her brother Hugh Blaker (she also donated Modigliani's Le Petit Paysan to the Tate Gallery in 1941, and left The Ugly Duchess by Quentin Matsys to the National Gallery in 1847).

The work spans a period of five centuries, focusing around the plebeian prophet Petrica Kerempuh, who is a type of Croatian Till Eulenspiegel. It is written in a language based on the Kajkavian dialect. Krle≈æa's expression is heavily interspersed with archaic words of Latin, German, and Hungarian origin‚Äîmost of them are found in Kajkavian or constructed to match it. Kajkavian has many Latin, German, and Hungarian loanwords, as opposed to standard Croatian, which mostly has loanwords from Turkish. This difference evident in the work comes from the two languages belonging to two distinct cultural circles: the former to the central Europe and the latter to the Balkans. Krle≈æa usually did not write in Kajkavian, but he decided to put this dialect with over 1000 years of history into the focus of this work. He succeeded in showing that even if in his time Kajkavian was not used in formal domains of life, it was still possible to create a work of great literal expression in it. The poem is generally considered a masterpiece of Krle≈æa's literary opus and of Croatian literature. The Ballads have been translated (mostly only in part) into Slovene, Italian, Macedonian, Hungarian, Czech, French, Russian, and Arabic. A full German translation was published in 2016.

Influenced by the Art Nouveau style, the red brick building was designed by Anton Rosen and completed in 1910. History The ballroom The hotel was built by the master butcher Anders Jensen, from 1909 alderman of the butchers' guild in Copenhagen, who had made a move into the hotel business in 1897 when he acquired Hotel Marienlyst in Helsing√∏r. In 1907, he purchased a lot on the square in front of the new Copenhagen City Hall which had been completed in the grounds of the city's old Haymarket just two years earlier. The architect Anton Rosen was commissioned to design the hotel which was inaugurated on 15 July 1910. King Frederik VIII was among the first to visit the hotel. Rosen not only designed the building but also everything from furniture to wallpaper, textiles, uniforms, luggage tags and keys. He also designed cutlery and door handles in collaboration with Georg Jensen. In 1927, Jensen sold the hotel to Valdemar Nielsen, who changed its original name \\"Palads\\" to the more international \\"Palace Hotel\\" and spent a large sum on refurbishing its interiors. In 1937, the hotel changed hands once again when it was acquired by the Danish-Norwegian hotelier Waldemar Jensen. Assisted by his Hungarian architects, he converted the Marble Garden into the \\"Ambassadeur\\", turning the hotel into a popular entertainment venue. The Danish businessman Fritz Schur purchased the building in November 1999. From 2005 until 2009, the hotel was run by the Starwood chain and was put through a major renovation which was to upgrade it to a five-star hotel under the Le M√©ridien brand. After failed negotiations between Schur and Starwood, the hotel was taken over by Scandic Hotels. Architecture Floor plans of the hotel The Palace Hotel building is considered one of Rosen's most important works and shows clear evidence of his appreciation of Jugendstil. He received the commission shortly after completing the L√∏venborg building on nearby Vesterbrogade, the first example of the style in Denmark. The building is constructed in red brick and stands on a sandstone plinth. The portal and other details on the facade are also in sandstone. The copper canopy above the main entrance is a later addition. Facade detail A distinctive feature of the exterior is the slender tower which together with those of the City Hall and the former Hotel Bristol dominates the City Hall Square. The copper-roofed tower is high and decorated with mosaics by the painter Johannes Kragh on all four sides, symbolizing morning, day, evening and night. The hotel is also noted for its beautiful lobby. Anton Rosen designed the entire block between the City Hall Square and Mikkel Bryggers Gade where the Grand Cinema is now located. It was heritage listed in 1985. Today Palace Hotel is owned and operated by Scandic Hotels but marketed under the Summit Hotels and Resorts brand. It has 169 rooms, 40 of which have balconies overlooking the City Hall Square. Other facilities include five conference rooms and a restaurant and cocktail bar on the ground floor. In popular culture The hotel has been used as a location in the films Dorte (1951), Hendes store aften (1954), Mariannes bryllup (1958) and Een blandt mange (1961).

It was founded in its present form in 1931, but can trace its roots back in principle to the early 1920s and in name well before that. It is affiliated to the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship (UCCF) and adopts the UCCF doctrinal basis. It is also affiliated to the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. Structure The 2012 DICCU Carol Service in Durham Cathedral Weekly meetings happen in almost every college during term time. There is also a central meeting every Friday evening, which includes Bible study, prayer and praise; and a central prayer meeting on Monday mornings. These events are aimed primarily at Christians, but people from all backgrounds are welcomed. A Christmas Carol Service is held at the end of Michaelmas term in Durham Cathedral, where there are regularly more than 3000 students in attendance. This is the largest service held by the Cathedral and one of the largest gatherings of Durham students in one place at any point in the year. DICCU also hosts an Easter Carol Service in the Cathedral, and both of these services have traditional hymns accompanied by a short talk. Many other events are run throughout the year at both the central and college levels, and all of these events are aimed particularly at people who wish to find out more about Jesus and the beliefs of Christianity. History Durham is well known for its religious heritage, and in this highly religious atmosphere several attempts over past years to found Evangelical and Bible Unions died out. On 8 December 1919 one Durham man joined around 60 other students from Cambridge, Oxford and London at the Egypt General Mission Headquarters, Drayton Park for the inaugural Inter-Varsity Conference. The early 1920s saw the formation of 'Durham University Bible Union', but this did not last long. The University journals for 1922 and subsequent years show a Christian Union affiliated to the World's Student Christian Fellowship and to the Student Christian Movement, but whether the Bible Union and this movement are related is unclear. Another attempt to found a Union was made in 1929, when two men from St John's gathered with others from their college. A Fresher from Bede, Joseph Harrison Stringer, also joined them, following a meeting with Norman Grubb over the summer. Weekly prayer meetings began, along with Bible studies held each Sunday and occasional extra meetings where outside speakers were welcomed. Over the coming terms it began to be regarded as a subsection of the aforementioned SCM, and witness to Christ's saving power and Biblical truth decreased. In March 1931 Joseph Stringer wrote to the recently formed Inter-Varsity Fellowship (what is now known as UCCF) about a separate Union in Bede, where a number of other men were keen. He consequently attended the Inter-Varsity Conference that year, and a new Union was formed. Many were for remaining as a subsection of the SCM, but rather than a big storm there was simply an agreement to differ, with those in favour of the new Union determined to keep the saving death of Jesus and the truth of the Bible as central to their witness. The Union struggled along for a year, at which point, following a post-dinner conversation in Hild on the topic 'spiritual certainty', around 20 women professed faith in Jesus. The men's Union quickly heard of it and joined forces with the women, and from there the Union grew rapidly. In March 1932 the Union arranged a weekend House Party along with the Newcastle Colleges, taking advantage of Dr. Howard Guinness' trip to the North. At this event two undergraduate students professed faith in Jesus Christ. ReferencesBibliography * Christ and the Colleges / F. D.
