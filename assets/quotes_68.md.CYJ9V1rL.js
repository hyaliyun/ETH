It was then a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bogotá. The first bishop, José Jorge Torres Estans, a native of Cartagena, ruled from 30 August 1837, to 17 April 1853, when he died at the age of 81, an exile in San Antonio del Fáchira, Venezuela. His successor, José Luis Niño, named vicar Apostolic, was consecrated in October, 1856, and also died an exile in San Antonio del Fáchira, 12 February 1864. The third bishop, Bonifacio Antonio Toscano, governed from 13 October 1865, to his retirement in 1873. He convoked the first diocesan synod, and assisted at the Provincial Council of New Granada in 1868 and at the First Vatican Council. Indalecio Barreto succeeded him 3 December 1874, and died 19 March 1875, at La Vega near Cúcuta. The Bishop of Panamá, Ignacio Antonio Parra, his successor, ruled from 8 June 1876, until his death, 21 February 1908. Bishop Parra had been exiled by the Liberal government from 1877 to 1878.

He was well regarded by other, more notable writers and made his fortune as owner of Cressbrook Mill, near Tideswell. He died on 3 November 1830. Biography St John's Church in Tideswell, where Newton was buried Newton was born at Cockey Farm near Abney. He attended a dame school and then followed his father into the carpenter's trade. He soon showed mechanical skill in constructing spinning-wheels, and was apprenticed for seven years as machinery carpenter at a mill in Monsal Dale. A mutual interest in books meant he came to the notice of Reverend Peter Cunningham, a poet who was curate at Eyam and encouraged Newton to write. In the summer of 1783, Newton was introduced to Anna Seward, who also encouraged him in his writing and corresponded with him until her death. In her account of their meeting, Miss Seward expressed a high opinion of \\"the elegance and harmony\\" in Newton's writing. Her account appeared the following year under the title \\"The Minstrel of Woodlow\\" in The Gentleman's Magazine and at the start of 1785 in both The Scots Magazine,vol. 47, pp.88–91 and under the editorship of James Boswell in the newly founded Edinburgh Magazine. Accompanying it was Newton's complimentary address to Cunningham in one of his own poems, and Seward's address to Newton, \\"Written in the blank leaves of her own poems, presented by her to William Newton\\": > Thou gentle bard, on whose internal sight Genius has pour'd her many- > coloured light… And tho' proud Fame her sunny glance has shed On the low > roof that screen thy modest head, The same exalted spirit scorns to wail Her > echoes silent in thy lonely vale. Seward's poem is also an evocation of the wild moorland scarred by quarries and smoking lime kilns, among which he works unregarded like a second Chatterton. Newton was soon to contribute to the industrialisation of the area himself, for he went on to become the agent of Richard Arkwright, often called \\"father of the industrial revolution\\", for his invention of the spinning frame at nearby Cressbrook Mill. He was dismissed by Arkwright in 1790 and Anna Seward came to his rescue with a loan that enabled him to invest in a new mill. Later Newton personally rebuilt Cressbrook Mill, after its destruction by fire. Archives at Manchester Central Library contain evidence that he sought to provide better living conditions for his apprentices than were prevalent at many other mills, and he oversaw the construction of model cottages and a village school. Nonetheless, an apprenticeship even at Cressbrook Mill was far from ideal. There are accounts of Newton's violent treatment of the 300–400 indentured boys from orphanages and charity hospitals that he employed there. Any offence resulted in a beating from him with \\"hazel sticks across our bare buttocks and loins till he cut the flesh and made the blood flow\\".The account of John, apprentice 253, published in the Ashton Chronicle (19 May, 2 and 23 June 1849) and reprinted in Dark Satanic Mills, Working Class Library, Manchester. 1980. Cressbrook Mill, from which Newton made his fortune Industrialisation of this remote area is mentioned in the writer John Holland's account of a visit he paid to Newton in 1823. The poet turned mill-owner \\"appeared venerable in years, with locks white and floating in the breeze; his poetical feeling was not extinct and some latent sparks of that enthusiasm remained.\\"The Old Arm-chair, London 1824, pp.135–40 His reason for putting financial betterment before literature was explained in accounts by others by his early marriage and his several children by his wife Helen. Newton died at his home in Tideswell on 3 November 1830, just short of his 80th birthday. He was buried in St John the Baptist's churchyard there. His wife died only eight days after her husband. His eldest son William (1785–1851) took over the mill and is said to have supplied the village with good water at his own expense. Poetry Newton's friendship with Anna Seward gave him entry into a group who imitated the Della Cruscan school in writing each other complimentary verses under assumed names. They were also among those reviving the sonnet in the final decades of the 18th century,Marianne Van Remoortel, Lives of the Sonnet, 1787–1895: Genre, Gender and Criticism, Ashgate Publishing 2013, pp.11–12 an example appearing in the Gentleman’s Magazine for January 1789. Clustered on the page are one of Seward's adaptations of Horace's odes, followed by Newton's sonnet in her praise and another of her sonnets in reply.p.71 In the following year, Newton published two more sonnets there of a despairing tone, occasioned by the death of a son, and it has been conjectured, the threat to his livelihood after falling out with Arkwright.Gentleman's Magazine, January 1790, p.74 Another poetic exchange with Miss Seward concerns a poem describing the countryside about Eyam, which no longer exists. It is known only from her \\"Epistle to Mr. Newton, the Derbyshire Minstrel, on receiving his description in verse of an autumnal scene near Eyam, September 1791\\".The Poetical Works of Anna Seward, Edinburgh 1810, vol. 3, pp. 22–24. Hers is a tearful acknowledgement of childhood memories brought back by the familiar landscape that he evokes. In fact little of Newton's poetry remains outside the files of old magazines and newspapers. He submitted his poems to the Sheffield Register (1787–94) and its successor the Sheffield Iris (1794–1816), where there appeared such verses as \\"Sonnet to a Mountain Cowslip\\", \\"Verses addressed to Mr. Home, written upon reading his tragedy of Douglas\\", and \\"Verses occasion'd by the tolling of a passing bell\\". Others may have appeared under the signature Edwin, the name he went by in the Seward circle. However, Newton never collected his verse for publication in a single edition.Sandro Jung, \\"William Newton: Anna Seward's 'Peak Minstrel'\\", Wordsworth Circle, Spring/Summer 2009, Vol. 40 Issue 2/3, p113 Another poem was published in The Northern Star in 1818p.330 and later privately printed by James Montgomery, editor of the Sheffield Iris. This \\"supposed soliloquy of a Father under the Gibbet of his son, upon one of the Peak Mountains\\" made a stir at the time. It has been credited with contributing to the end of the practice of gibbeting, although that did not occur until 1834. A final sonnet, hitherto unpublished, accompanied a late reminiscence of Newton. Dated October 1822, when he was nearing his 72nd birthday, the poem is a mellow piece that draws together an evening scene and anticipation of retirement. Memorial window to William Newton > Beneath my Alder's peaceful bough, > While whispers soft the Western wind, > My limbs I indolently throw, > And leave the world and care behind. > Here blest with peace, with ease and health, > Life’s toilsome scenes, O let me shun! > Forego ambition, fame and wealth, > To bask me in the evening sun. > And as this gentle bosom'd stream > With silent lapse serenely flows, > Smiles and reflects the golden beam, > Ere modest evening's glories close; > So let me, in life's tranquil evening, find > Calm, soft, unruffl'd joys – the sunshine of the mind! Heritage Francis Chantrey initially mistook Newton for a peasant when he met him by chance. As a result the sculptor made a pencil sketch of the poet, which he left with him, as the only life portrait of Newton known to exist. An engraving based on it was reproduced in the Reliquary Quarterly for 1860.Vol. I, following 192 In 1996 a memorial window to Newton was installed in St John the Baptist, Tideswell. Representing Jesus welcoming little children, it remembers the Chantrey's apprenticeship scheme and his descendants in the Williams family, whose daughter Gwendoline died in 1993.The work of Alfred Fisher of Chapel Studio References People from Derbyshire Dales (district) 1750 births 1830 deaths English male poets ","title":"William Newton (poet)"},{"id":"16004214","text":"The Crown Prince Cup was one of four competitions in the Kuwaiti 2007/2008 season, and all 14 clubs participated in this championship.

These coefficients are natural numbers, which the Littlewood–Richardson rule describes as counting certain skew tableaux. They occur in many other mathematical contexts, for instance as multiplicity in the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of general linear groups (or related groups like the special linear and special unitary groups), or in the decomposition of certain induced representations in the representation theory of the symmetric group, or in the area of algebraic combinatorics dealing with Young tableaux and symmetric polynomials. Littlewood–Richardson coefficients depend on three partitions, say \\\\lambda,\\\\mu, u, of which \\\\lambda and \\\\mu describe the Schur functions being multiplied, and u gives the Schur function of which this is the coefficient in the linear combination; in other words they are the coefficients c_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}^ u such that :s_\\\\lambda s_\\\\mu=\\\\sum_ u c_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}^ u s_ u. The Littlewood–Richardson rule states that c_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}^ u is equal to the number of Littlewood–Richardson tableaux of skew shape u/\\\\lambda and of weight \\\\mu.  History  The Littlewood–Richardson rule was first stated by but though they claimed it as a theorem they only proved it in some fairly simple special cases. claimed to complete their proof, but his argument had gaps, though it was so obscurely written that these gaps were not noticed for some time, and his argument is reproduced in the book . Some of the gaps were later filled by . The first rigorous proofs of the rule were given four decades after it was found, by and , after the necessary combinatorial theory was developed by , , and in their work on the Robinson–Schensted correspondence. There are now several short proofs of the rule, such as , and using Bender-Knuth involutions. used the Littelmann path model to generalize the Littlewood–Richardson rule to other semisimple Lie groups. The Littlewood–Richardson rule is notorious for the number of errors that appeared prior to its complete, published proof. Several published attempts to prove it are incomplete, and it is particularly difficult to avoid errors when doing hand calculations with it: even the original example in contains an error. = Littlewood–Richardson tableaux = A Littlewood–Richardson tableau A Littlewood–Richardson tableau is a skew semistandard tableau with the additional property that the sequence obtained by concatenating its reversed rows is a lattice word (or lattice permutation), which means that in every initial part of the sequence any number i occurs at least as often as the number i+1. Another equivalent (though not quite obviously so) characterization is that the tableau itself, and any tableau obtained from it by removing some number of its leftmost columns, has a weakly decreasing weight. Many other combinatorial notions have been found that turn out to be in bijection with Littlewood–Richardson tableaux, and can therefore also be used to define the Littlewood–Richardson coefficients. Another Littlewood–Richardson tableau = Example = Consider the case that \\\\lambda=(2,1), \\\\mu=(3,2,1) and u=(4,3,2). Then the fact that c_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}^ u=2 can be deduced from the fact that the two tableaux shown at the right are the only two Littlewood–Richardson tableaux of shape u/\\\\lambda and weight \\\\mu. Indeed, since the last box on the first nonempty line of the skew diagram can only contain an entry 1, the entire first line must be filled with entries 1 (this is true for any Littlewood–Richardson tableau); in the last box of the second row we can only place a 2 by column strictness and the fact that our lattice word cannot contain any larger entry before it contains a 2. For the first box of the second row we can now either use a 1 or a 2. Once that entry is chosen, the third row must contain the remaining entries to make the weight (3,2,1), in a weakly increasing order, so we have no choice left any more; in both case it turns out that we do find a Littlewood–Richardson tableau. = A more geometrical description = The condition that the sequence of entries read from the tableau in a somewhat peculiar order form a lattice word can be replaced by a more local and geometrical condition. Since in a semistandard tableau equal entries never occur in the same column, one can number the copies of any value from right to left, which is their order of occurrence in the sequence that should be a lattice word. Call the number so associated to each entry its index, and write an entry i with index j as i[j]. Now if some Littlewood–Richardson tableau contains an entry i>1 with index j, then that entry i[j] should occur in a row strictly below that of (i-1)[j] (which certainly also occurs, since the entry i − 1 occurs as least as often as the entry i does). In fact the entry i[j] should also occur in a column no further to the right than that same entry (i-1)[j] (which at first sight appears to be a stricter condition). If the weight of the Littlewood–Richardson tableau is fixed beforehand, then one can form a fixed collection of indexed entries, and if these are placed in a way respecting those geometric restrictions, in addition to those of semistandard tableaux and the condition that indexed copies of the same entries should respect right-to-left ordering of the indexes, then the resulting tableaux are guaranteed to be Littlewood–Richardson tableaux.  An algorithmic form of the rule  The Littlewood–Richardson as stated above gives a combinatorial expression for individual Littlewood–Richardson coefficients, but gives no indication of a practical method to enumerate the Littlewood–Richardson tableaux in order to find the values of these coefficients. Indeed, for given \\\\lambda,\\\\mu, u there is no simple criterion to determine whether any Littlewood–Richardson tableaux of shape u/\\\\lambda and of weight \\\\mu exist at all (although there are a number of necessary conditions, the simplest of which is |\\\\lambda|+|\\\\mu|=u|); therefore it seems inevitable that in some cases one has to go through an elaborate search, only to find that no solutions exist. Nevertheless, the rule leads to a quite efficient procedure to determine the full decomposition of a product of Schur functions, in other words to determine all coefficients c_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}^ u for fixed λ and μ, but varying ν. This fixes the weight of the Littlewood–Richardson tableaux to be constructed and the \\"inner part\\" λ of their shape, but leaves the \\"outer part\\" ν free. Since the weight is known, the set of indexed entries in the geometric description is fixed. Now for successive indexed entries, all possible positions allowed by the geometric restrictions can be tried in a backtracking search. The entries can be tried in increasing order, while among equal entries they can be tried by decreasing index. The latter point is the key to efficiency of the search procedure: the entry i[j] is then restricted to be in a column to the right of i[j+1], but no further to the right than i-1[j] (if such entries are present). This strongly restricts the set of possible positions, but always leaves at least one valid position for i[j]; thus every placement of an entry will give rise to at least one complete Littlewood–Richardson tableau, and the search tree contains no dead ends. A similar method can be used to find all coefficients c_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}^ u for fixed λ and ν, but varying μ. Littlewood–Richardson coefficients The Littlewood–Richardson coefficients c appear in the following interrelated ways: *They are the structure constants for the product in the ring of symmetric functions with respect to the basis of Schur functions ::s_\\\\lambda s_\\\\mu =\\\\sum c_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}^ u s_ u :or equivalently c is the inner product of sν and sλsμ. *They express skew Schur functions in terms of Schur functions ::s_{ u/\\\\lambda} =\\\\sum _\\\\mu c_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}^ u s_\\\\mu. *The c appear as intersection numbers on a Grassmannian: ::\\\\sigma_\\\\lambda \\\\sigma_\\\\mu =\\\\sum c_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}^ u \\\\sigma_ u :where σμ is the class of the Schubert variety of a Grassmannian corresponding to μ. *c is the number of times the irreducible representation Vλ ⊗ Vμ of the product of symmetric groups S|λ× S|μappears in the restriction of the representation Vν of S|νto S|λ× S|μ|. By Frobenius reciprocity this is also the number of times that Vν occurs in the representation of S|νinduced from Vλ ⊗ Vμ. *The c appear in the decomposition of the tensor product of two Schur modules (irreducible representations of special linear groups) ::E^\\\\lambda \\\\otimes E^\\\\mu =\\\\bigoplus_ u (E^ u)^{\\\\oplus c_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}^ u}. *c is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape ν/μ that are jeu de taquin equivalent to some fixed standard Young tableau of shape λ. *c is the number of Littlewood–Richardson tableaux of shape ν/λ and of weight μ. *c is the number of pictures between μ and ν/λ. Generalizations and special cases extended the Littlewood–Richardson rule to skew Schur functions as follows: :s_\\\\lambda s_{\\\\mu/ u} = \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda+\\\\omega(T_{\\\\ge j})\\\\in P}s_{\\\\lambda+\\\\omega(T)} where the sum is over all tableaux T on μ/ν such that for all j, the sequence of integers λ+ω(T≥j) is non-increasing, and ω is the weight. Pieri's formula, which is the special case of the Littlewood–Richardson rule in the case when one of the partitions has only one part, states that *\\\\displaystyle S_\\\\mu S_n=\\\\sum_\\\\lambda S_\\\\lambda where Sn is the Schur function of a partition with one row and the sum is over all partitions λ obtained from μ by adding n elements to its Ferrers diagram, no two in the same column. If both partitions are rectangular in shape, the sum is also multiplicity free . Fix a, b, p, and q positive integers with p \\\\geq q. Denote by (a^p) the partition with p parts of length a. The partitions indexing nontrivial components of s_{(a^p)}s_{(b^q)} are those partitions \\\\lambda with length \\\\leq p+q such that *\\\\lambda_{q+1} = \\\\lambda_{q+2} = \\\\cdots = \\\\lambda_p = a, *\\\\lambda_q \\\\geq \\\\mathrm{max}(a,b) *\\\\lambda_i + \\\\lambda_{p+q - i + 1} = a+b, \\\\quad {i = 1, \\\\dots, q}. For example, 400px. Examples The examples of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients below are given in terms of products of Schur polynomials Sπ, indexed by partitions π, using the formula :S_\\\\lambda S_\\\\mu =\\\\sum c_{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}^ u S_ u. All coefficients with ν at most 4 are given by: *S0Sπ = Sπ for any π. where S0=1 is the Schur polynomial of the empty partition *S1S1 = S2 \\\\+ S11 *S2S1 = S3 \\\\+ S21 *S11S1 = S111 \\\\+ S21 *S3S1 = S4 \\\\+ S31 *S21S1 = S31 \\\\+ S22 \\\\+ S211 *S2S2 = S4 \\\\+ S31 \\\\+ S22 *S2S11 = S31 \\\\+ S211 *S111S1 = S1111 \\\\+ S211 *S11S11 = S1111 \\\\+ S211 \\\\+ S22 Most of the coefficients for small partitions are 0 or 1, which happens in particular whenever one of the factors is of the form Sn or S11...1, because of Pieri's formula and its transposed counterpart. The simplest example with a coefficient larger than 1 happens when neither of the factors has this form: *S21S21 = S42 \\\\+ S411 \\\\+ S33 \\\\+ 2S321 \\\\+ S3111 \\\\+ S222 \\\\+ S2211. For larger partitions the coefficients become more complicated. For example, *S321S321 = S642 +S6411 +S633 +2S6321 +S63111 +S6222 +S62211 +S552 +S5511 +2S543 +4S5421 +2S54111 +3S5331 +3S5322 +4S53211 +S531111 +2S52221 +S522111 +S444 +3S4431 +2S4422 +3S44211 +S441111 +3S4332 +3S43311 +4S43221 +2S432111 +S42222 +S422211 +S3333 +2S33321 +S333111 +S33222 +S332211 with 34 terms and total multiplicity 62, and the largest coefficient is 4 *S4321S4321 is a sum of 206 terms with total multiplicity is 930, and the largest coefficient is 18. *S54321S54321 is a sum of 1433 terms with total multiplicity 26704, and the largest coefficient (that of S86543211) is 176. *S654321S654321 is a sum of 10873 terms with total multiplicity is 1458444 (so the average value of the coefficients is more than 100, and they can be as large as 2064).

Among his work are over 150 actions of the Royal Navy, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy, the British Institution and the Royal Society of British Artists. His pictures are highly sought after today.

It is known that he was in Bristol in 1787 and later travelled to the South Coast; there are few ports or harbours from this region that do not feature in his work. In 1789 he toured Wales and in 1813 he travelled to Devon, painting scenes around Plymouth harbour. During his career he also painted scenes showing the Cape of Good Hope, Madeira, Cuba and Cape Horn. Between 1783 and 1824 he lived in London, including addresses in Covent Garden and Somers Town during the course of his exhibiting career. His date of death, like that of his birth is uncertain; it was not before 1824, and possibly as late as 1834. Style His range of work embraced naval engagements, ship portraits, coastal scenes with shipping and ships at sea in fresh breezes and storms. The topography of the background is interesting and well observed and the depiction of the ships themselves detailed and technically very correct, a legacy of time spent in dockyards studying the subject matter. The backgrounds are delightfully atmospheric and, like many British marine artists of the 18th and 19th century, Whitcombe favoured a dark foreground. Artistic Achievement Whitcombe was, with Nicholas Pocock, Thomas Luny, Francis Holman and Robert Dodd, a leading maritime painter of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. He painted over 150 actions of the Royal Navy including fifty plates for The Naval Achievements of Great Britain, a splendid volume issued after the cessation of hostilities. He exhibited at the Royal Academy fifty-six times between 1783 and 1824 and once each at the British Institution and the Royal Society of British Artists. Many of his paintings are today in the collection of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, and in other important naval collections around the world.

Life Tolomei was born of noble parentage at the ancestral castle of the Counts of Capraia () in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, located between Pistoia and Florence. At the age of fifteen, after an early schooling at Florence, he studied law at the University of Pisa. On 18 February 1673 he entered the Society of Jesus at Rome, and was ordained a priest in 1684. Although later made a cardinal, he was never raised to the rank of bishop. Tolomei was master of eleven languages: Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean, Syriac, Arabic, English, French, Spanish, Illyrian, as well as his native Italian. He began his public career at Rome by expounding the Sacred Scriptures on Sunday evenings in the Church of the Gesù. At the age of thirty Tolomei was elected in the General Congregation of the Society as its Procurator General, an office he held for the next five years, relinquishing it to take the Chair of Philosophy at the Roman College (now the Gregorian University). Here his lecture room was thronged. His lectures were printed in Rome in 1696 under the title of Philosophia mentis et sensuum, and demonstrated that, while loyal to the principles and method of Aristotle, he welcomed every discovery of his time in the natural sciences and wove these into his course. The lectures were reprinted in 1698 in Germany and evoked praise from the noted philosopher, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.Die Philosophischen Schriften von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bd.IV, S.399 Tolomei later filled the Chair of Theology at the Roman College and revived the courses in controversial dogma begun by St. Robert Bellarmine a century earlier. These lectures in manuscript form filled six volumes in folio but were never printed. Successively Rector of the Roman College and of the German College, he was at the same time Consultor to the Sacred Congregation of Rites, as well as of the Index, and of Indulgences, in addition to being one of the appointed examiners of bishops. On 17 May 1712, unexpectedly created a cardinal by Pope Clement XI, with the title of Santo Stefano al Monte Coelio, Tolomei became chief adviser to the pope in matters of theology, particularly in the preparation of the condemnation of the ideas of Pasquier Quesnel. As cardinal he assisted at the conclaves which elected Pope Innocent XIII and Pope Benedict XIII. Tolomei died at Rome at the Roman College, and was buried before the high altar of the Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius there. Works His published works are the Philosophia mentis et sensuum (with the addition of natural theology and ethics, Rome, 1702), De primatu beati Petri (in the second series of the miscellany printed from the manuscripts in the library of the Roman College, Rome, 1867), and a little pamphlet containing Daily Prayers for a Happy Death (in Latin, Vienna, 1742; also in German, Augsburg, 1856).

German  This form of address originally had connections with the ability of a Freiherr (Baron) to bequeath a family coat of arms and to hold landed property as allodial instead of a fief. The actual address is Euer Hochwohlgeboren (\\"Your High Well-born\\") and is the correct form of address not only German Freiherren but also Ritter and Edle. The title should not be confused with (Euer) Hochgeboren. This title ranks higher than Hochwohlgeboren and is the style of mediate Grafen (mediate Counts; immediate counts or Reichsgrafen are entitled to the address Erlaucht) and those Freiherren descending from the mediæval Uradel. Another honorific title was (Euer) Wohlgeboren which ranked lower than Hochwohlgeboren and was claimed by Bourgeois notables. In the 19th century it became customary to address academic and other civil honoraries by this title, e.g., a number of letters to Sigmund Freud are addressed to \\"Hochwohlgeboren Prof. Dr. Sigmund Freud\\". It is commonly abbreviated in correspondence as: “I.I.H.H.” for married couples “I.H.” (= Ihre Hochwohlgeboren) for women. “S.H.” (= Seine Hochwohlgeboren) for men.  Swedish  In Sweden Högvälboren (High Well-born) is used to address barons and counts, Välboren (Well-born) is used to address untitled nobles.  Dutch  In The Netherlands Hoogwelgeboren (High Well- born) is used to address a Baron, a Knight or a Jonkheer. Hooggeboren (High- born) is used to address Dukes, Margraves, Counts or Viscounts.  Russian  In Imperial Russia, civil, military and court officials in the 6th to 8th grades according to the Table of Ranks were addressed with a style similar in meaning (Ваше высокоблагородие). Similarly the style (Euer) Wohlgeboren (Ваше благородие) was applied to officials in the 9th to 14th grades, while (Euer) Hochgeboren (Ваше высокородие) was enjoyed by officials in the 5th grade. As such the honorific address was also implied by membership in some grades of the Russian dynastic orders of chivalry.

Early life and war service Rudd became involved with motor racing in the 1930s when he became an informal assistant to Prince Chula and Prince Bira's White Mouse Racing team. This inspired him to take up engineering as a career and family influence led him to take up an apprenticeship at Rolls-Royce. Rudd's engineering studies were interrupted by the Second World War during which he served in the Royal Air Force. Trained as a pilot, he flew Avro Lancasters on a tour of 30 operations.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1160509.ece He became an expert in diagnosing failures in Merlin engines, but his main interest remained cars. Rudd resumed his engineering apprenticeship after the War and built an Aston Martin-based 'special'.  Career  = Arrival at BRM = The much-delayed BRM V16 engine was fitted with Rolls-Royce superchargers and Rudd was seconded to BRM in 1951 to assist with their development. He never returned to Rolls-Royce, becoming part of the BRM team for almost two decades. Rudd was involved in the development of the V16 and four-cylinder P25 cars and started to assume more prominence after the Rubery-Owen takeover of the team. Peter Berthon and Raymond Mays were eventually sidelined after the drivers threatened to strike and Rudd assumed full technical control of the team in 1960. = Successes at BRM = Rudd put in place proper engineering procedures within the team. Rudd drove a monocoque Killeen car at Folkingham and increased his interest in vehicle rigidity. His spaceframe and monocoque V8-engined designs took BRM to 1 constructors' and 1 drivers' World Championships. However, his H-16 engine for the new three litre formula (based on two of the successful 1.5 litre V8s on top of each other) proved to be heavy and overcomplicated. The team struggled with the complex design and gradually lost momentum in the late Sixties. Rudd claims that the H-16 would have been successful had the drawings been followed accurately - as it was the engine had heavier castings than planned and its power-to-weight ratio was unfavourable; it also had breathing difficulties and only started to improve when it fired as a sixteen-cylinder engine rather than two eights. After abandoning the H-16, Rudd designed a compact V-12 that was to be the foundation of renewed success in the years after his departure from BRM. As a sideline to BRM's main development, Rudd and Peter Wright were also involved with the design of a ground effect car that never raced; driver John Surtees was adamant that it could not be made raceworthy. Rudd and Wright were later to be reunited at Lotus on work that did lead to successful ground-effect racing cars. = The move to Lotus = During a poor 1969 season and after management changes at BRM, Rudd left for Lotus Cars, gradually working up to the position of Engineering Director on the road-car side of the company - he was not directly involved in racing, which Colin Chapman looked after. Rudd's achievements included the development of Lotus' own four-cylinder engine as well as improving production quality of their cars. Rudd also developed Lotus as an engineering consultancy working on high-technology projects for the rest of the automotive industry, creating another profit centre within the business. = Ground effect and consultancy = Team Lotus were struggling in the mid-1970s and Rudd led the research effort that produced ground effect Lotus 78, which brought the team back to the forefront of Grand Prix success. Rudd went back to the road-car side of the company to research active suspension, turbocharging, and lead consultancy work for other manufacturers. After Chapman's death in 1982 Rudd took on an increasingly significant role in the business but advanced engineering remained his forté. = Final return to racing = After the conviction of Fred Bushell for financial irregularities related to DeLorean, the Chapman family (who retained ownership of Team Lotus) asked Rudd to step in to head the racing team. He returned to racing for a year in 1989 until the team was sold on, then retired to become a freelance consulting engineer.  Retirement and writing  In retirement, Rudd remained active in the Society of Automotive Engineers, wrote a widely acclaimed autobiography It Was Fun: My Fifty Years of High Performance and collaborated with Doug Nye on a multi-volume history of BRM. Tony Rudd died in 2003 at the age of 80. He was married to Pamela and had three daughters.

He also had short spells playing abroad for Edmonton Drillers (Canada), IK Brage (Sweden) and Falu BS (Sweden) for whom he was player-manager. Hornsby was an attacking midfielder playing 222 English league games and scoring 48 goals. His career was seriously curtailed by a hamstring injury when playing for Sheffield Wednesday in 1980. Playing career As a schoolboy Brian captained Peterborough Boys and earned England caps at School boy and Youth level. =Arsenal= Hornsby joined Arsenal straight from school in 1970, he was member of the Arsenal team which won the FA Youth Cup in 1971, beating Cardiff City 2–0 over two legs. He signed as a professional for Arsenal in September 1971. Arsenal had just won The Double in the 1970–71 season and had a very strong team. Hornsby's chances of breaking into the first team were very rare and he did not make his debut until May 1973 in the final league game of the 1972–73 season in a 1–6 defeat at Leeds United. He was very much a reserve and squad player for the Gunners making only 26 league appearances in his almost five seasons at Highbury, scoring six goals. Hornsby was released by Arsenal at the end of Bertie Mee's reign as manager and he signed for Shrewsbury Town in May 1976 for £40,000. =Shrewsbury Town= Hornsby while playing under Shrewsbury boss Alan Durban and was virtually ever present during his almost two years at Gay Meadow playing in 75 league games and scoring 16 goals. He helped Town win the Welsh Cup in 1977. In February 1978 Durban left to be manager of Stoke City and the following month Hornsby signed for Sheffield Wednesday in a £45,000 deal. =Sheffield Wednesday= Sheffield Wednesday manager Jack Charlton had been tracking Hornsby for some time and he finally got his man. There is a famous anecdote regarding Hornsby which sums up Charlton's laconic personality. Wednesday were playing Shrewsbury away at the end of February 1978, just before Hornsby's move to Sheffield. Charlton was giving his pre-match team talk and midway through turned to Wednesday midfielder Jeff Johnson and said, \\"You're up against the lad Hornsby, he's a very skilful player ... I'm buying him to replace you\\". As it happened there was room for both Hornsby and Johnson in the Wednesday team. Hornsby made his debut for Wednesday on 18 March 1978 in a 1–3 away defeat to Lincoln City, however after that Wednesday only suffered one more defeat in the remaining 12 matches that season. On signing, Hornsby had said on local radio that he would score plenty of goals from midfield, his first came on 25 March in a 2–0 away win at Rotherham. It was a 25-yard volley into the roof of the net which was named as Goal of the Season on Yorkshire Television by Martin Tyler. Jeff Johnson scored the other goal that day.

Bowditch was born on Aug. 9, 1808, in Salem, Mass to Nathaniel Bowditch, a renowned mathematician. He graduated from Harvard College in 1828, earned his medical degree there in 1832, and afterwards studied medicine in Paris for 2 years with leading physicians of the day. From 1859 to 1867 Bowditch was Jackson professor of clinical medicine at Harvard; he later founded the Massachusetts State Board of Health. Bowditch was a fellow of the American Academy of Public Health and wrote a seminal textbook on the subject; Public hygiene in America  Early Life and Introduction to Abolitionism  While in England in 1833, Bowditch observed the funeral of William Wilberforce, \\"a great and constant advocate for the abolition of slavery\\" (Bowditch, 55). Shortly after returning to Boston from Europe, Bowditch observed the attempted lynching of William Lloyd Garrison and declared himself an abolitionist. Bowditch thereafter received the customary ostracism of society and close friends who \\"would even stare and scowl without speaking when we met after I had openly declared myself as one of the hated Abolitionists\\" (Bowditch 101). Bowditch's medical practice also lost business as a consequence of his abolitionism; however Bowditch remained in the movement. Bowditch was an active, passionate abolitionist. He gave lectures and kept company with abolitionist leaders such as Charles Sumner, Charles C. Emerson, and Fredrick Douglass. After briefly participating in Warren Street Chapel, a charity for impoverished children, Bowditch left the institution because of his conviction that their policy of exclusively serving white children was incompatible with his principles. Bowditch resented such culture- driven racist religious institutions, and proclaimed that his \\"soul arose indignant...to the whole race of priestly sycophants\\" who refused to combat racism and slavery (115).  Radical Abolitionist Action  He also took action in association with the fugitive slave cause. Bowditch became a founding member of the Latimer Committee and an editor of The Latimer Journal. Each was created in response to the plight of George Latimer, an apprehended fugitive slave in danger of deportation back South. Bowditch's efforts led to a massive petitioning of the Massachusetts General Court (legislature) that resulted in legislation forbidding the use of state and municipal jails from detaining fugitive slaves, a blow to slave-hunters. However, Bowditch was also a witness to a vast number of unjust fugitive deportations. His response was the organization of the Anti-Man-Hunting League. This radical organization trained members to capture and hold slave-hunters in exchange for the ransom of a fugitive slave's freedom. Although the league was given no opportunity to prove its efficacy, this society was useful both in uniting anti-slavery men, and preparing their paradigms for the violent opposition of slavery manifested in the Civil War. He was also a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that assisted fugitive slaves. During the Civil War, after his son died from battlefield wounds Bowditch published a pamphletA Brief Plea for an Ambulance System for the Army of the United States, as Drawn from the Extra Sufferings of the Late Lieut. Bowditch and a Wounded ComradeIn Have we the best possible ambulance system? the author of the \\"Prefatory remarks\\" — which is H. I. Bowditch according to Google Books — even suggests that the members of the ambulance corps on the battlefield should be \\"inviolate in their persons\\", an idea reminiscent of the contemporary work of Henri Dunant. which helped extend to the whole Union the \\"Letterman system\\" of care for the wounded. After the Civil War, Bowditch kept ties with the completed movement by contributing to the historical discussion of abolitionism by providing an interpretation of historical abolitionism that was sympathetic to the plight of John Brown.  Contributions to Medicine and Public Health Bowditch also made significant contributions to the fields of science and public health. He introduced inductive reasoning into American medical science, popularized the stethoscope, contributed to the understanding of tuberculosis, and laid the groundwork for public health by chairing the Massachusetts State Board of Health. He published Preventive Medicine and the Physician of the Future to propagate inductive reasoning as well as Public Hygiene in America to explain the concepts behind State Health. He also served as president of the American Medical Association.  See also  *William Francis Channing  Notes and references  *Bowditch, Vincent Y.

Founded in 1990, the San Diego Children's Choir is the area's oldest and largest choral training program serving more than 500 children ages four–18 at locations throughout San Diego County. It was incorporated as a non-profit public benefit corporation in 1990. Rehearsals and performances of fine music literature form the foundation of instruction and provide the youth of San Diego opportunities for artistic and personal growth through choral music performance.  Structure  Early Years Program - Early Years is a beginning music exploratory program designed for preschool, TK, and Kindergarten students. This class focuses on the fundamentals of music — ear training, healthy singing, intonation, early-music reading skills, beat-keeping, focus, concentration, and improvisation. Early Years is an active learning environment, engaging students' motor, oral, aural, and cognitive skills. Instruction is active and game-oriented. This is a non-auditioned, non- performing group. Early Years classes are offered in 8-week sessions in the Fall, Winter, and Spring. Each of the following Core Choir levels builds a foundation of skills for the next level. Weekly rehearsals consist of between 20-30 students at each site, with the full choir gathering for all-together rehearsals and performances Preparatory Choir - for 1st -3rd graders. Children joining Preparatory Choir typically have little to no prior musical experience. They learn basic vocal techniques such as posture, resonance and breathing, sight-reading and performance skills, including choreography. They sing unison and two-part repertoire in many languages and present four to six public performances locally each year, including two major concerts with the auditioned upper level choirs. Children and youth in 3rd through 12th grade require an audition for placement purposes. Apprentice Choir - for 3rd-5th graders. Children match and repeat pitches and rhythms, are competent English readers and function comfortably in the group rehearsal environment. They continue to develop their well-supported healthy singing voice (head-voice) and work weekly on a sequential music literacy curriculum. They sing in unison, frequently in rounds and occasional two-part repertoire in many languages and present five to eight local public performances yearly, including an optional full-day mini-tour each spring. Intermediate Choir - for 5th-7th graders. Children continue to hone posture, breathing and vocal technique, developing a greater degree of musical independence through part- singing, sight-singing and aural skills. They participate in discussions regarding style, cultural context and history of various repertoire. They are local ambassadors of the Choir and frequently represent the organization at events. Intermediate choristers are becoming vocal and social leaders through development of their musical skills and confidence. This ensemble begins advanced level repertoire singing in two, three and four part rounds, and has six to 10 public performances and concerts each season, including an optional full-day mini-tour each spring. Premier Choir - for 6th - 12th graders. At this level, choristers sing independently in three-four parts. They demonstrate advanced vocal techniques, fluency in sight-reading and harmony, and perform music successfully in a variety of languages and styles. Advanced sight singing and aural skills, an understanding and analysis of the choral score, a secure sense of vocal independence and adaptability as a performer are taught and emphasized. Youth take on elected roles to further develop leadership and independence both in and out of the Choir program. Extensive home study is required intermittently throughout the year. Choristers are required to attend an overnight retreat at the start of the fall semester, and perform in eight to 15 concerts each season, including local collaborative and high-profile performances. They have the opportunity to participate in summer tours that alternate from national to international each year. Chamber - for 10th - 12th graders or changed voice males. Simultaneous participation in Premier Choir is required to participate in the level, including all required events and retreats. However, certain exceptions can be made in special circumstances. Choristers in this changed voice ensemble are expected to exhibit advanced musical independence and be able to sing mixed-voice choral works with confidence. Extensive home study is required intermittently throughout the year. OUTREACH PROGRAMS: Neighborhood Choir - offered on a limited, contractual basis to schools and community sites throughout San Diego County. In this sliding-scale program, elementary school students from all economic backgrounds experience choral music education in a convenient location. Children who start with limited to no choral experience benefit from peer interaction, musical knowledge and leadership skills. Informal recitals are held for family and friends at the end of each session. Summer Camp - a week-long day camp for elementary school children. Program features singing, dancing, music making and art inspired by a special guest world teaching artist. A final recital is held at the end of the week.  Performances  The San Diego Children's Choir schedules two major concerts each year at which all ensemble choristers perform – the Holiday Concert at the end of the Fall semester and the Spring Concert at the end of the Spring semester. During the year, they perform at other venues suitable for each choir level. The younger choristers perform many outreach programs at librariesCarmel Valley News, March 13, 2008 and senior citizen homes. The Choir has collaborated over the years with other performing groups. They regularly participate in Holiday ConcertsSan Diego Tribune with the San Diego Symphony. In 1996, they performed the world premiere of \\"Requiem in Memoriam, Oklahoma City\\" under the direction of the composer, Ron Gillis. The San Diego Children Choir has performed Carl Orff's \\"Carmina Burana\\" three times: once under the direction of Sir David Willcocks in Royal Albert Hall, London, under the direction of Maestro Yoav Talmi with the San Diego Symphony, and with the Choirs of the University of San Diego. The Choir presented the opera \\"Noye's Fludde\\" in 2012 which was featured in Voice of San Diego.Voice of San Diego Tours are also part of the educational program, providing an opportunity to be ambassadors for San Diego as well as travel and performance experience. The Premier and Chamber Choirs travel every summer, and they follow the tradition of international tours every other year. Tours normally include 6 to 7 concerts, home stays with host choir organizations, and daily tours of the visited countries. The Intermediate and Apprentice Choirs tour locally in Southern California in preparation for the longer tours when the choristers advance to the Premier Choir. In June 2017, select choristers toured to New York and performed music composed by Francisco J. Nunez (also under his direction) in the prestigious Carnegie Hall.

He was named \\"greatest living traveller on earth\\" in 2007 in Jorge Sánchez's list of Viajeros notables contemporaneous (Notable Contemporary Travellers). He has made a documentary film of his first, 18-year trip and has devoted his life to spreading the message of the Baháʼí Faith worldwide. Biography Brugiroux was born in Villeneuve-Saint- Georges, Val-de-Marne, in the outskirts of Paris, to a railwayman father and an accountant mother. He spent his childhood in Brunoy, Seine-et-Oise and attended the Mardelles school in Brunoy and then the Saint-Augustin collège (secondary school) in Montgeron. Lack of work on the family farm in Langeac, Haute-Loire had led his father to move to the Paris region. It was not his father who encouraged him to travel, however, but rather his mother, who had done some touring before getting married. She unwittingly gave him his taste for travel and provided him with the key to developing his future resourcefulness by enrolling him as a scout. The name he received as a scout was incredibly apt: \\"fouine babillarde\\" (in French), or \\"chattering beech marten\\" (a beech marten is a cunning animal and chattering means \\"talkative\\") Growing up in wartime made such an impression on him from his early childhood that his decision to travel the world was unconsciously inspired by the desire to find out whether peace might one day be possible. =Travels= Hitchhiking around the world (400,000 km/250,000 miles) 1955-1973. Complete journey (60 years on the road) 1955-2015. Brugiroux left home in 1955, at the age of 17, with a diploma from the École hôtelière de Paris and ten francs in his pocket, working first for seven years in Europe to learn various foreign languages by doing part-time jobs. Between his time in Spain and West Germany he did his military service in the Congo (1958 and 1959). Then, after working as a translator in Canada for three years (from 1965 to 1967) to save up the funds, he managed to visit the whole planet over six years without working. He travelled only by hitchhiking (including by plane, ship and yacht), spending no more than an average of one dollar a day. During his travels he was imprisoned seven times, almost killed on several occasions, deported and robbed. He stayed with Dr. Schweitzer at his hospital in Lambaréné (Gabon) and the hippies in San Francisco, with head-hunters in Borneo and Buddhist monks in Bangkok; he studied Yoga at an ashram in India and worked on a kibbutz in Israel; he also saw, among other things, the gem-smuggling business in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and refugee camps in Cambodia. In the course of his journey, he discovered and accepted an idea extolled in the nineteenth century by a Persian noble named Baháʼu'lláh: \\"The Earth is but one country.\\" He returned home with a new vision of history. After publishing his first book, producing a documentary film of his first trip and recovering his health, Brugiroux hit the road again in order not only to visit the countries he had missed the first time round and their peoples but to share the Baháʼí principles and teachings he had learnt. He travelled abroad from his base in France continuously for the next 30 years, spending six to eight months away each year and combining lectures with visiting new places. He has also travelled all over France. In 1984 he married Rinia Van Kanten, a sociologist from Suriname whom he had met in Cayenne (French Guiana). They have a daughter named Natascha. In 2005, Brugiroux completed his dream of seeing the whole world by watching polar bears in the bay at Churchill, Manitoba (Canada). Since then, Brugiroux has kept travelling to know more about the world and share his convictions. In 2007, he celebrated his 70th birthday on the island of Socotra (Yemen) with other travellers. In 2008, he finally enjoyed the last forbidden kingdom: Saudi Arabia. In 2009, in Siberia, he went down the Lena river and drove along the road of bones from Yakutz to Magadan with the greatest travellers on earth. In 2011, he visited a brand-new country: South Sudan. In 2013, he reached Tristan da Cunha, the remotest island in the world. Since then, in 2015 he entered Sascha Grabow's list GreatestGlobetrotters.com in 2nd position, and in 2016 Harry Mitsidis's Thebesttravelled22 in 6th position.

He was a Gallican opponent of Jansenism. Life He was born in Antibes, Provence, to poor and obscure parents. An uncle, a priest at Paris, invited him there and gave him a good education. On completing his philosophical and theological studies, he became a doctor of the Sorbonne in 1686, and two years later was sent by the king to the University of Douai to teach theology. Here, he distinguished himself by his lectures and by his opposition of the Jansenists. He was even accused of forgeries in order to compromise them, but the proofs of this accusation have never been forthcoming. Four years later he was recalled to Paris, appointed professor of theology at the Sorbonne, made a canon of the Sainte-Chapelle, and given the Abbey of Plainpied (Diocese of Bourges). He taught with unvarying success for twenty-four years, and at Douai showed himself the determined opponent of the Jansenists. In return they published pamphlets and multiplied attacks to discredit him and his teaching, especially after the publication of the Constitution Unigenitus, in which Pope Clement XI condemned (1713) their errors as manifested in the 'Reflections morales of Quesnel. Tournély was actively engaged in furthering the acceptance of this Constitution by the assembly of the French clergy, of which he was a consultor, and by the faculty of theology of which he was an influential member. When, after the death of Louis XIV (1715) and after the connivance of Cardinal Noailles, the Jansenists became masters of the faculty of theology, they expunged from its registers the Bull \\"Unigenitus\\" and expelled from its meetings Tournély and a score of his friends among the doctors (January 1716). It was only at the earnest intervention of the regent, the Duke of Orléans, that they were reinstated five years later (February 1721). Tournély died at Paris. Works Praelectionum theologicarum, 1746. Tournély had so far published nothing, at least in his own name, but he is regarded as the author or inspirer of several anonymous works against the Jansenists which appeared at that time. On his retirement he immediately began to revise his lectures and, at the request of Cardinal de Fleury and others, to publish them in 1725. With the common title \\"Præ Theologicæ\\", he issued in Latin the following treatises in octavo: *\\"On God and His Attributes\\" (1725); *\\"On grace\\" (1726); *\\"On the Trinity\\" (1726); *\\"On the Church\\" (1726); *\\"On the Sacraments in general\\" (1727); *\\"On the Incarnation\\" (1727); *\\"On the Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation\\" (1727); *\\"On Penance and Extreme Unction\\" (1728); *\\"On the Eucharist\\" (1729); *\\"On Holy Orders\\" (1729); *\\"On Marriage\\" (1730). The work passed through several editions, among others those of Paris (16 vols., in 8 vo, 1731–46), Cologne (10 vols., in fol., 1752–65). Several of these treatises were abridged for use in seminaries, still appear in Tournély's name, but they were in reality the work of Montagne, Robinet, and Collet.According to the following source, the persons concerned are: Mr Montagne, Docteur de Sorbonne, Prêtre de St Sulpice and Mr Robinet, qui a été depuis Official de Pons - Tournély's own work is still so important in extent and value that he may be regarded as one of the most notable theologians of his age. The learned Lafiteau, Bishop of Sisteron, even then declared him \\"one of the greatest men who has ever been in the Sorbonne\\", and his works were highly esteemed by Alphonsus Liguori. His chief characteristics are clearness of explanation, elegance of style, learning and orthodoxy.

Despite having a two-year contract at Leeds, he grabbed the opportunity to join Richard Hill's rejuvenated Bristol side a season later, returning to the club as captain. He took a gamble in stepping down a flight to play with Bristol, but it turned out to be the right decision. At the end of his first season as captain he was celebrating Bristol's promotion back to the Guinness Premiership. Following his retirement from professional rugby, Salter became the Director of Rugby (union) at the University of Bristol, and is currently Head Coach at Clifton Rugby.

Over the course of 6 and a half years, Shane underwent 6 CDH repairs, tying for the world record. Shane spent the majority of his first year of life in the hospital on life support. During times when visiting hours were over, Williamson researched CDH in the university medical library, looking for sources of support and information, but found support only from other parents. After 10 months of intensive care and numerous complications, Williamson brought her son home.Fox 22 News, Raleigh, North Carolina, 1993 At 21 years old, Williamson filed non-profit paperwork and began to create CHERUBS from a typewriter on her kitchen table with one other member. In 1996, CHERUBS was invited to participate in the American Pediatric Surgical Association's annual convention. In 1997, CHERUBS conducted its first Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Research Survey. In 2000, CHERUBS became a source for a 20/20 piece on In Utero Surgery. Also in 2000, CHERUBS held its first International Member Conference in Orlando, Florida, offering families the opportunity to meet each other and to learn about congenital diaphragmatic hernia from medical experts. In 2004, CHERUBS was represented at the International CDH Study Group of doctors.Oxford Public Ledger, reporter Kathy Judd-Jenkins, Oxford, North Carolina, 2002 Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Ribbon In 2007, CHERUBS launched an on-line forum for CDH families and medical professionals. Also in 2007, CHERUBS members created and voted on the official Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Ribbon, which is baby blue, pink and pale yellow with clouds. CHERUBS also created several Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness logos to appeal to the public to help raise awareness. In 2008 CHERUBS changed its name to CHERUBS – The Association of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Research, Awareness and Support.

It was formed by a group of 32 West Africans, who in 1860 were included in the last known illegal shipment of slaves to the United States. The Atlantic slave trade had been banned since 1808, but 110 enslaved people held by the Kingdom of Dahomey were smuggled into Mobile on the Clotilda, which was burned and scuttled to try to conceal its illicit cargo. More than 30 of these people, believed to be ethnic Yoruba and Fon, founded and created their own community in what became Africatown.Robertson, Natalie. The Slave Ship Clotilda and the Making of AfricaTown, USA: Spirit of Our Ancestors. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2008. They retained their West African customs and language into the 1950s, while their children and some elders also learned English. Cudjo Kazoola Lewis, a founder of Africatown, lived until 1935 and was long thought to be the last survivor of the slaves from the Clotilda. In 2019, scholar Hannah Durkin from Newcastle University documented Redoshi, a West African woman who was believed at the time to be the last survivor of slaves from the Clotilda. Also known as Sally Smith, she lived to 1937. She had been sold to a planter who lived in Dallas County, Alabama. Redoshi and her family continued to live there after emancipation, working on the same plantation. Durkin later published research indicating that another slave, Matilda McCrear, in fact outlived Smith, dying in 1940. The population of Africatown has declined markedly from a peak population of 12,000 in the 20th century, when paper mills operated there. In the early 21st century, the community has about 2,000 residents. It is estimated 100 of them are descendants of the people from the Clotilda. Other descendants live across the country. In 2009, the neighborhood was designated as a site on Mobile's African American Heritage Trail. The Africatown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Its related Old Plateau Cemetery, also known as Africatown Graveyard, was founded in 1876. It has been given a large historical plaque telling its history. History In 1860, some wealthy slaveholders of Mobile and their friends decided to see if they could evade the federal law that prohibited importing slaves from Africa. This Atlantic slave trade had been prohibited by the United States by the 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, although the domestic slave trade continued. The slave traders bet each other and a group of men from New England that they could evade federal authorities. Timothy Meaher, a shipbuilder and landowner; his brother Byrnes (also spelled Burns) Meaher; John Dabey; and others invested money to hire a crew and captain for one of Meaher's ships to go to Africa and buy enslaved Africans. They used Timothy Meaher's ship Clotilda, which had been designed for the lumber trade. It was commanded by Captain William Foster. While the ship was in port at Whydah in the Kingdom of Dahomey (present-day port of Ouidah in Benin), additional work was done to accommodate and conceal the transport of enslaved people. Foster bought the slaves and loaded them. The ship sailed in May 1860 from Dahomey for its final destination, Mobile, with 110 persons held as slaves. Foster had paid for 125 slaves, but as he was preparing for departure, he saw steamers offshore and rapidly departed to evade them. The captives were said to be mostly of the \\"Tarkbar\\" tribe, but research in the 21st century suggests that they were Takpa people, a band of Yoruba people from the interior of present-day Nigeria. They had been taken captive by forces of the King of Dahomey. He sold them into slavery at the market of Whydah. The captured people were sold for $100 each to Foster, captain of the Clotilda. Abaché and Cudjoe Kazoola Lewis at Africatown in the 1910s, two persons from Clotilda In early July 1860, the Clotilda entered Mobile Bay and approached the port of Mobile. Trying to evade discovery, Foster had the ship towed at night upriver beyond the port. He loaded the slaves onto a steam riverboat and sent them ashore; he set fire to the Clotilda and scuttled it to hide the evidence of its smuggling slaves. The Africans were mostly distributed as slaves among the parties who had invested in the venture. Before being taken from Mobile, they were on their own in terms of surviving. They built shelters of whatever they found growing in the Alabama lowlands, and adapted their hunting to the rich game. Some slaves were sold to areas more distant from Mobile. Among them were Redoshi, a woman from the Clotilda, and a man who became her husband, who were both sold to Washington Smith of Dallas County, Alabama. He had a plantation in the upcountry of the state, and later founded the Bank of Selma. Redoshi was known as Sally Smith as a slave. She married and the couple had a daughter. The family continued to work at the Smith plantation after emancipation. While Redoshi Smith was interviewed by Zora Neale Hurston and known by others, later in her life and after her death, she was forgotten. In 2019, researcher Hannah Durkin published new information about her: she documented that Redoshi Smith lived until 1937, making her apparently the last survivor of the slaves from the Clotilda. = US v. Byrnes Meaher, Timothy Meaher and John Dabey = Federal authorities prosecuted Meaher and his partners, including Foster. Lacking the ship and related evidence, such as its manifest, the 1861 federal court case of US v. Byrnes Meaher, Timothy Meaher and John Dabey did not find sufficient grounds to convict Meaher. The case was dismissed. Historians believe the start of the American Civil War contributed to the federal government's dropping the case. =Post-Civil War to World War II= Meaher initially used 32 of the enslaved Africans as workers on his plantation. After the Civil War (1861–1865) they were emancipated, but they continued to work Meaher's property in the delta north of Mobile on the west side of the river. The formerly enslaved people founded a community known as Africatown, bounded on three sides by water: a bayou, Three Mile Creek (formerly Chickasabogag Creek), and the Mobile River. Among the founders of Africatown was a man named Cudjoe Kazoola Lewis (his Yoruba name was Kazoola or Kossola). He was said to be the oldest slave on the Clotilda and a chief. Accounts also refer to Charlie Poteet as a chief. Their medicine man was named Jabez, or Jaba. Charles Lewis (Oluale was his Yoruba name) and his future wife Maggie were also among the Africans on the Clotilda. Cudjoe Lewis lived until 1935 and until 2019 was thought to be the last survivor of the original group. He was a spokesman for the community and was interviewed by early 20th-century writers Emma Langdon Roche and Zora Neale Hurston, among others, who both relied on his accounts for the history of the capture, voyage and community. In the post-Civil War and emancipation period, the people in Africatown were joined by people from the same ethnic groups who were living in the Mobile area. They gathered as a community to live independently and evade supervision by whites. The community had two major sections: the first and larger one, of about 50 acres, and a second section of about 7 acres, located about two miles west.Sylviane A. Diouf, \\"Africatown\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama, published December 6, 2007 Last updated: September 14, 2017. The latter area was called Lewis Quarters after founder Charlie Oluale Lewis and his wife Maggie. Historic Union Missionary Baptist Church Cudjo Lewis's son Joe (Joseph) learned to read and write at the church which the settlers founded in Africatown.Sandra E. Garcia and Matthew Haag, \\"Descendants' Stories of a Slave Ship Drew Doubts. Now Some See Validation\\", New York Times, January 26, 2018; accessed January 26, 2018. He helped preserve the story of his father and the Clotilda, as did the families and later community schools, through oral histories. The women raised and sold crops, and the men worked in mills for $1 a day, saving money to purchase the land from Meaher. When possible, they avoided white people. They established the African Church, later known as the Old Landmark Church. In 1876, they opened the Old Plateau Cemetery, also known as the Africatown Graveyard. In the early 20th century, they replaced the old church with the brick Union Missionary Baptist Church, which is still in use. The community started its first public school in 1880; it is known as the Mobile County Technical School. Cudjoe Lewis helped his fellow Africans to adapt to their new country, although they had been badly treated by whites. For decades, he served as a spokesman for the people of Africatown. He was visited by American writers Emma Langdon Roche and Zora Neale Hurston, and educator Booker T. Washington, president of Tuskegee Institute. Roche published a book in 1914 about American slavery and the Africatown community. In 1927, Hurston interviewed Cudjo Lewis for the Journal of Negro History. Although she never published the article, she made a short film about him. She returned later and frequently visited Lewis over a period of three months. She wrote a book about this experience and Lewis's life but was unable to get it published. Her book was posthumously published as Barracoon: The Story of the Last \\"Black Cargo\\", in an annotated edition in May 2018. During interviews, Lewis would tell about the civil wars in West Africa, in which members of the losing side were sold into slavery to Africans and Europeans. His were Takpa people, who had lived in a village in the interior. Cudjo related how he and others from his village had been captured by warriors from neighboring Dahomey, taken to Ouidah and imprisoned within a large slave compound. They were sold by the King of Dahomey to Foster and transported to the U.S. on the Clotilda.David Pilgrim. \\"Question of the Month: Cudjo Lewis: Last African Slave in the U.S.?\\" Jim Crow Museum, Ferris University, July 2005. After the Civil War and emancipation, the people asked the U.S. government to repatriate them to Africa, but they were refused. The community developed along the spine of Telegraph Road in the early 20th century, becoming known both as Plateau, for its high ground, and Magazine. Those areas became part of the cities of Mobile and Prichard, respectively. Considerable company housing was built in Prichard for workers at the shipyards and paper mills. =Post-World War II changes= Up until World War II, Africatown survived as a distinct community, but later it was absorbed as a neighborhood of Mobile. It was also known as Plateau. The Cudjo Lewis Memorial Statue was placed in front of the Union Missionary Baptist Church in 1959, in recognition of his leadership in the community. In 1977 the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, in cooperation with the Amoco Foundation, gave a bronze plaque to the City of Mobile to commemorate the life of Lewis. It was installed in Bienville Square downtown.Diane Freeman, \\"Mobile Given Plaque Honoring Noted Slave\\", Press Register, July 23, 1977; Digital Collection, Mobile Public Library. Africatown expanded as newcomers arrived to work in the paper mills of International Paper (IP) and Scott Paper. In this period, the population reached a peak of 12,000. But it declined later in the 20th century, following the closing of the major industries. In 1997, descendants and friends founded the AfricaTown Mobilization Project to campaign for the community to be designated as an historic district and to promote its redevelopment. The Africatown Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 2012. In 2010, Neil Norman of the College of William and Mary conducted an archeological excavation and preservation project in Africatown. It was funded by local and state agencies. He excavated three homesites of former enslaved people trafficked on the Clotilda: Peter Lee, Cudjo Kazoola Lewis, and Charlie Lewis. They identified some artifacts that may have been brought from Africa.Roy Hoffman, \\"Dig reveals story of America's last slave ship -- and its survivors\\", Press-Register, August 9, 2010; accessed January 29, 2018. In 2012, there was clean-up work in the newly designated historic district, and the cemetery was cleaned and restored. Also, a large historical marker has been installed outside the cemetery that explains its history and significance.Lawrence Specker, Gallery: \\"Africatown and the Clotilda\\", AL.com, January 23, 2018; accessed January 26, 2018. About 2,000 people live there in 2018, including 100 known descendants of survivors of Clotilda. Among the descendants of Charles Lewis and his wife Maggie, who was also born in Africa, is a great-great-great grandson Ahmir Khalib Thompson, the 21st-century drummer and music producer known as Questlove. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he is descended from their son Joseph and his wife.Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Finding Your Roots, Season 4, Episode 9 (aired December 12, 2017).  Africatown Historic District  Old Plateau Cemetery, or Africatown Graveyard Most of the community now lies within Mobile's city limits. Its people passed down the story of its founders and how they were brought to the United States, preserving their history through families, the church, and schools. Part of the community's land was appropriated by the government for the development of the western approach of the Cochrane- Africatown USA Bridge, completed in 1992. In 1997, descendants and friends formed the Africatown Community Mobilization Project to seek recognition of an Africatown Historic District and encourage the restoration and development of the town site. In 2000 it submitted documentation as a Local Legacy Project to the Library of Congress, through Representative Sonny Callahan from Alabama's 1st congressional district. \\"Materials include[d] 16 pages of text, 11 color photographs, a map of the AfricaTown district, newspaper articles, information on the AfricaTown Mobilization Project, and a videotape, \\"AfricaTown, USA,\\" made by a local news station.\\" Defined as roughly bounded by Jakes Lane, Paper Mill and Warren roads, and Chin and Railroad streets, the historic district was designated in 2009 as a site on Mobile's African American Heritage Trail. The Africatown Historic District was subsequently affirmed as significant by the state and the National Park Service, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 2012.  2017 pollution lawsuit  Given its location along waterways, this area was developed for mills and other industrial uses, especially in the early 20th century. A paper plant was built in 1928 and operated for decades on land first owned by A. Meaher Jr. on the edge of Africatown. Residents say they have a serious industrial pollution and public health problem, which has caused a high rate of cancer since the late 20th century. In 2017, a group of about 1,200 residents launched a lawsuit against International Paper (IP), as this company had owned the now- shuttered paper plant. The environmental group claim that IP's improper handling of waste through the decades contaminated the land and water, and the company did not clean up the site as required after closing the plant. Discovery of the wreck of the Clotilda In January 2018, reporter Ben Raines found the charred remains of a ship that he thought might prove to be the Clotilda. On March 5, 2018, Ben Raines announced that the wreck he had discovered was likely not the Clotilda as the wreckage appeared to be \\"simply too big, with a significant portion hidden beneath mud and deep water\\". A few weeks later, Ben Raines and a team from the University of Southern Mississippi returned to the river and performed the first ever modern survey of the 12 Mile Island section of the Mobile River. One week later, Raines and Monty Graham, head of Marine Sciences at the University of Southern Mississippi, explored several of the 11 wrecks identified in the survey, along with Joe Turner and a team from Underwater Works Dive Shop. On April 13, the team pulled up the first piece of Clotilda to see the light of day in 160 years. The coordinates and survey data were shared with the Alabama Historical Commission, which hired Search Inc., to verify the find. The discovery was kept secret for a year, until the verification process was complete. On May 22, 2019, the Alabama Historical Commission announced that the wreckage of the Clotilda had been found in the Mobile River near Africatown. Representation in other media * A local Mobile TV news program produced a program, \\"AfricaTown, USA\\", about the settlement and its history. * In Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s Finding Your Roots, Season 4, Episode 9: \\"Southern Roots\\", December 12, 2017, he showed census data for Mobile and Captain William Foster's journal from the Clotilda, as part of explaining the family history of Questlove, a drummer and producer, head of The Roots. His 3× great- grandparents Charles Lewis (b. c. 1820) and his wife Maggie (b. 1830), listed in the 1880 census as born in Africa, were among the captives brought from West Africa on the slave ship Clotilda. Gates also discussed an article from The Tarboro Southerner, which reported on July 14, 1860, that 110 Africans had arrived in Mobile on Clotilda. A Pittsburgh Daily Post article of April 15, 1894, recounted the \\"wager\\" that Captain Timothy Meaher made in 1859 – that he could smuggle in \\"a cargo\\" within two years, which he accomplished in 1860.Henry Louis Gates, Jr's Finding Your Roots, Season 4, Episode 9 (December 12, 2017), PBS, sections on Questlove's ancestors. * Natalie S. Robertson's book The Slave Ship Clotilda and the Making of AfricaTown, U.S.A.: Spirit of Our Ancestors is the only comprehensive work that identifies the West African geographical and cultural origins of the Clotilda Africans. Robertson's book, which began as her doctoral dissertation entitled “The African Ancestry Of The Founders Of AfricaTown, Alabama\\" (published in 1996), is based upon 15 years of transatlantic research that was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Stanley-UI Foundation, PASALA (Project for the Study of Art and Life in Africa), the CIC-Mellon Award, and the UNCF-Mellon Award (through Spelman College). * Zora Neale Hurston's book Barracoon: The Story of the Last \\"Black Cargo\\", edited and with an introduction by Deborah G.

The program's presenter, Rob Newman, also contended that the 20th century decline of the mussel should have been treated as a warning for the looming health crisis of Africatown's human population, due to filter-feeding species' status as barometers of water cleanliness.

Jack Skurnick Career Skurnick worked in a music store on West 44th Street near Madison Avenue in New York; the store was owned by his parents, Max and Anna Skurnick. The Elaine Music Shop had many loyal customers. Doris Day bought records there, and many of the great classical musicians came in to make purchases and chat with Skurnick. One of these was Edgard Varèse; another was Safford Cape, director of Pro Musica Antiqua. When Skurnick started his record company, EMS Recordings, he named it after the shop. He also convinced Cape and Varese to record with him. EMS was the first label to record Varese.Ferdand Ouelette, \\"A Biography of Edgard Varese\\", Translated from the French by Derek Coltman, The Orion Press, New York, 1966, p 170-171 In the magazine, which became internationally known, Skurnick sought to build respect for music as an art and to raise performance standards. In the EMS recordings, he put these principles into practice. His aim was to record a history of music, with special attention to the lesser known masterpieces, in performances that would be a model of authentic musicianship. He had mapped out plans far into the future when his work was suddenly interrupted. Interests Skurnick played the violin. A movie buff, he wrote a script that he shot himself. Film director Jules Dassin, then an actor at the Artef, a Jewish theater in New York, appeared in it. It was shown to a small group at a space Skurnick rented in New York. A fan of old movies, Skurnick twice rented a hall in which to show them. Because he was not able to afford to rent the space regularly, he suggested the project to Betty Chamberlain, Director of the Department of Communications at The Museum of Modern Art from 1948–53, who subsequently introduced a more elaborate series of films at MoMA. Personal Skurnick was married to the painter Fay Kleinman for 18 years, and had one daughter, Davida. Since her marriage, Davida has been known as Davi Napoleon. Skurnick has two grandsons he never met, Brian Napoleon and Randy Napoleon; a great grandson, Jack Napoleon, who is named after him, and a great granddaughter, Juliet Napoleon.

A Clinical Associate is a specialist regulated mental health professional whose duties include assessing, formulating, and treating clients all within specified ranges of conditions and age. Clinical Associates work either in primary care adult mental health settings or in a range of setting working with children, young people, and their families. History & Development The role of Clinical Associate was first introduced in 2005. Following consultation with National Health Service Scotland (NHS Scotland), NHS Education for Scotland (NES) commissioned a new master's level training program designed to equip graduate Psychologists with the competencies required to deliver circumscribed psychological services.Dickson, Graeme. Applied Psychologists and Psychology in NHS Scotland. Working paper. The Scottish Government, 15 Mar. 2011. Web. 5 Mar. 2012. . The role of Clinical Associate was developed with an aim to increase access to primary care psychological services in two main specialities: child and adolescent therapies in primary care and adult therapies in primary care. The University of Stirling and the University of Dundee developed the initial one-year Clinical Associate training scheme sponsored by NHS Education for Scotland (NES).NHS Scotland, \\"MSc in Applied Psychology for Children and Young People,\\" Accessed 5 March 2012,. Since inception, Master of Science (MSc) applied training programs in Scotland for Clinical Associates have been developed in two specialties: Psychological Therapy in Primary Care (adults) and Early Interventions for Children and Young People. The master's level training program focused on Psychological Therapy in Primary Care (adults) is intended to equip trainees with the ability to assess and treat adults experiencing more common mental health disorders (such as anxiety and depression) while under clinical supervision.\\"Psychological Therapy in Primary Care,\\" The University of Stirling. Web. 12 Mar. 2012. . The master's level training program focused on Early Interventions for Children and Young People is intended to train skills required to assess and treat children, young people, and their families experiencing more common mental health disorders with a strong emphasis on the early years and early intervention. Although other forms of therapy are also explored, currently the emphasis of existing Clinical Associate in Applied Psychology (CAAP) programs is on a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) based approach.Dickson, Graeme, \\"Applied Psychologists in NHS Scotland,\\" pg. 24  Professional Training and Certification to Practice  The training required to practice as a Clinical Associate consists of an MSc in either Psychological Therapies in Primary Care (adults) or in Applied Psychology for Children and Young People. Clinical Associate candidates must have a British Psychological Society (BPS) accredited psychology undergraduate degree. It is intended that the undergraduate psychology knowledge base will be further developed during the postgraduate training in one of the Clinical Associate MSc level programs. Currently, it is required that the master's level training programs encompass a theoretical, research, and applied foundation of psychology. The knowledge acquired during the master's level training will then be applied to the needs of specific client groups. Training in the existing Clinical Associate MSc programs generally takes place during a little over one year of full-time study. Once admitted to training, Academic requirements (non-clinical) must be demonstrated to masters MSc level, including the production of an original piece of research which will contribute to the scientific understanding of a relevant area. Requirements to practice are similar to that of Clinical Psychology in the UK (within the appropriate speciality) and include demonstration of competence in clinical practice, assessment, diagnosis, formulation, treatment and research design and evaluation. While enrolled in one of the master's level training programs, Clinical Associates receive a salary from the NHS Health Boards in Scotland. At the end of the training, if they were successful in the program, the candidate would be awarded a master's degree in Applied Psychology (as a Clinical Associate), often with a specific client group listed as expertise.“Scottish Subject Benchmark Statement, Clinical Psychology and Applied Psychology (Clinical Associate) Scotland,” July 2006. Accessed 4 March 2012, , pg. 12 Clinical Associates have a circumscribed nature of expertise and must often consult with senior colleagues (fully licensed psychology practitioners) under whose support and supervision they practice. After graduation, master's level Clinical Associates are classified as having the expertise to work within a specific client group and with specific psychological disorders. As in all psychological fields, it is expected that Clinical Associates remain aware of ongoing research regarding (at least) their specialized client groups. It is intended that, following completion of one of the master's level training programs in Applied Psychology (as a Clinical Associate), newly appointed Clinical associates will apply for Clinical Associate in Applied Psychology (CAAP) job posts in the NHS of Scotland.. While award of the MSc in Applied Psychology (Clinical Associate) confers eligibility for a Clinical Associate in Applied Psychology post in the NHS of Scotland, there is no guarantee of employment following training.  Master's in Applied Psychology (Clinical Associate) vs. Doctorate in Clinical Psychology/Counselling Psychology  The Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, and that in Counselling Psychology are recognized by the British Psychological Society (BPS), as the threshold levels required to work as a largely autonomous scientist practitioner, while the Master's in Applied Psychology (Clinical Associate) is more limited with regard to the level of academic preparation and range of certified practice. Clinical Associate practitioners operate in a relatively circumscribed manner within a particular specialty while holders of a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology can work in a range of environments and specialties. In addition, Applied Psychology (Clinical Associate) practitioners are required to work under the supervision of a qualified Clinical Psychologist/Counselling Psychologist while those with a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology or Counselling Psychology can work, \\"unsupervised\\"; aside from the requirements of professional practice.  Similar Roles in the United States  Although the label of \\"Clinical Associate\\" or \\"Clinical Associate in Applied Psychology (CAAP)\\" is unique to Scotland, there are other countries that also allow holders of master's degrees in Clinical Psychology to practice in somewhat limited capacities. In the United States, there are a number of U.S. schools that offer master's degree programs in Clinical Psychology. These programs often take 2 to 3 years to complete post-Bachelor's degree and the training usually emphasizes theory and treatment over research, quite often with a focus on school or couples and family counseling.Northamerican Association of Masters in Psychology. (2004). Licensure Information . While many graduates of master's-level training programs go on to earn their Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, a large number chose to go directly into practice—often as a Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA), or Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). When working under the supervision of a doctoral psychologist, master’s graduates can work as Psychological Assistants in clinical, counseling, or research settings.\\"How to Become a Psychologist.\\" U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Web. 14 Apr. 2012. . Most master's degree programs do not require an undergraduate major in psychology, but do require coursework in introductory psychology, experimental psychology, and statistics.

Examples of tension members are bracing for buildings and bridges, truss members, and cables in suspended roof systems.  Calculation  In an axially loaded tension member, the stress is given by: F = P/A where P is the magnitude of the load and A is the cross-sectional area. The stress given by this equation is exact, knowing that the cross section is not adjacent to the point of application of the load nor having holes for bolts or other discontinuities. For example, given an 8 x 11.5 plate that is used as a tension member (section a-a) and is connected to a gusset plate with two 7/8-inch-diameter bolts (section b-b): The area at section a - a (gross area of the member) is 8 x ½ = 4 in2 However, the area at section b - b (net area) is (8 – 2 x 7/8) x ½ = 3.12 in2 knowing that the higher stress is located at section b - b due to its smaller area.  Design  To design tension members, it is important to analyse how the member would fail under both yielding (excessive deformation) and fracture, which are considered the limit states. The limit state that produces the smallest design strength is considered the controlling limit state. It also prevents the structure from failure. Using American Institute of Steel Construction standards, the ultimate load on a structure can be calculated from one of the following combination: 1.4 D 1.2 D + 1.6 L + 0.5 (Lr or S) 1.2 D + 1.6 (Lr or S) + (0.5 L or 0.8 W) 1.2 D + 1.6 W + 0.5 L + 0.5 (Lr or S) 0.9 D + 1.6 W L= 14 * D… is the dead load or the weight of the structure itself * L… is the live load which vary for different structures * S… is the snow load * W… is the wind load the central problem of designing a member is to find a cross section for which the required strength doesn't exceed the available strength: Pu < ¢ Pn where Pu is the sum of the factored loads. to prevent yielding 0.90 Fy Ag > Pu to avoid fracture, 0.75 Fu Ae > Pu therefore, the design must consider the loads applied to this member, the design forces acting on this member (Mu, Pu, and Vu) and the point where this member would fail.

It was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as the Davenport Village. At the time of its nomination it included 145 contributing properties, most of which were working-class housing. with It is roughly defined as the area between the Mississippi River, Spring, Judson, and 13th Streets, Kirkwood Boulevard and Jersey Ridge Road. The historic district was started as an independent community and became a part of the city of Davenport within five years. Today it is a shopping and entertainment area. History In 1851 William H. Hildreth and Dr. G.W. Witherwax laid out a town they called Upper Davenport, which would later be called East Davenport. The area was a broad ravine along a bend of the Mississippi at the foot of the Rock Island Rapids. The area was known to rivermen as \\"Stubb's Eddy\\" for a hermit who lived in a cave in the area whose name was James R. Stubbs. The small town was ten blocks in size. By 1856 it had been incorporated into the city of Davenport. The first industry in the town was a steam-powered sawmill which was established by Robert Christie in 1851. In the 1860s it became Lindsay & Phelps. In 1854 the Renwick & Sons mill opened. Logs were rafted down the river from the forests in the north and were processed at the mills. In 1856 the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi River was built just south of The Village. The railroad was important in moving the lumber from the mills to the frontier out west. In 1874 the Davenport and Northwestern Railroad, which became part of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, built a railroad trestle on the west side of The Village that remains today.Svendsen, 3.4 A lithograph showing Davenport in 1888. The Village is in the upper center part of the picture. Davenport became the home to five army camps during the Civil War. Camp McClellan, the largest of the camps, was established in 1861.Svendsen, 16.1 As the war escalated the camp served as a hospital. It was also the location of a prison for 300 members of a Sioux tribe who were involved in raids in Minnesota. They were released when President Abraham Lincoln commuted their sentences and sent them to reservations in the West. On July 24, 1901, one of the worst fires in Davenport history occurred in The Village. A shanty town had grown up around the Weyerhaeuser Mill, Lindsay & Phelps Mill, the Roberts wood yard, and the Standard Oil storage tanks. The area was a square mile of shingles, kindling, sawdust, and high piles of lumber. The fire began at the Rock Island Fuel Company and spread quickly. The fire was so hot it warped the rails of the railroad bed and buckled the pavement, and the smoke was so thick it made the area as dark as midnight. Flames leapt into the air and the intense heat created an updraft that sucked lumber into it and sent them into the air and helped spread the fire. The fire moved toward the downtown area, but stopped at the Tremont Avenue hill where St. Katherine's Hall, an Episcopal girls' school, was located. In the end, 20 acres of land were burned, 250 people were left homeless and businesses suffered $1.25 million in losses. The Village was also the scene for a raid at the East Davenport Turner's Hall during Prohibition in 1928. A Federal Prohibition officer and Davenport Police Officers seized 4,185 bottles of homebrew, 90 gallons of mash, 15 crocks, 50 cans of malt, beer cases, capers, and other materials for making beer. Today the Village of East Davenport contains many of its original Civil War era buildings that house specialty shops, restaurants, taverns and other businesses. The building stock largely dates from 1848 to 1910. The former Turner's Hall now serves as a theater. The former Hose Station No. 4 on 11th Street has been converted into the International Fire Museum. It was listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1993. The Village was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 17, 1980. The former Pierce School is individually listed on the NRHP. Lindsay Park was listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Places in 1998 and Indian Springs Park in 2005.

Jurf al-Sakhar housed a large military complex including the Al Hakum facility, at one time Iraq's most sophisticated and largest biological weapons production factory. During the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, Jurf al-Sakhar was one of the first towns under the \\"concerned citizens\\" program, in which the local populace was paid to secure the town via checkpoints along its roads, funded by money supplied by the U.S. military. The influx of money led to an almost instantaneous decrease in violence in the area. It is also the location of some of the most bitter fighting during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Nine medals for valor were awarded to the paratroopers of Apache Company, 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment (Geronimo), for their actions in and around the town. The unit was also awarded the Valorous Unit Award, the second highest unit award in the US Army. ISIS control In 2014 Jurf al-Nasr was captured by the ISIS terrorist organization.

He was the lieutenant colonel of the 151st Pennsylvania Infantry and commanded the regiment in severe combat during first day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Early life George McFarland was born on April 28, 1834, to John and Elizabeth McFarland at Todd's Mill in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. At age fifteen, the family moved to the city of Harrisburg, and he began working as a boat pilot with his father on the Susquehanna River. As early as age sixteen, he worked as an amateur teacher in the Harrisburg area. In the early 1850s, he attended Freeburg Academy in Snyder County. Following his graduation, he became an assistant teacher and later principal at Freeburg. In 1856, at age twenty-one, he married Adeline \\"Addie\\" Griesemer, who was two years senior to him. While serving as principal at the school in Freeburg, he started a family with Addie. Their first child, Clara, was born in August, 1857, but died in 1860.Dreese, An Imperishable Fame, pp.5-6 In December, 1858, the McFarland purchased an academy in McAlisterville and moved his family there as he set to work as principal there. Upon taking over McAlisterville Academy, McFarland began expanding the school's curriculum and facilities. Under McFarland's administration, the academy taught mathematics, science, music, languages, art, and physical education. Enrollment at the academy between 1858 and 1862 ranged between 43 and 70 students. While living in McAlisterville, the McFarlands had a son, John Horace, in 1859, and a daughter, Emma Viola, in 1862.Dreese, An Imperishable Fame, p.6. Civil War service When the American Civil War began in April, 1861, McFarland chose to remain in McAlisterville and continue his duties as an educator. However in 1862, the war no longer appeared that it would come to a quick resolution. In July, President Abraham Lincoln issued a call for 300,000 additional volunteers to enlist in the Union Army. McFarland took up the task of recruiting a company of men from Juniata County for service to the Union. Countered in a rough recruiting race by cavalryman John K. Robison, McFarland gathered from the county roughly forty men and transported them to Camp Curtin in Harrisburg. Upon arriving in Harrisburg, McFarland was commissioned captain, and his company was placed alongside nine other companies to comprise what would thenceforth be designated as the 151st Pennsylvania Infantry. In an election by the other company officers, McFarland was then made lieutenant colonel of the regiment. Harrison Allen, formerly major of the 10th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment, was made colonel of the regiment. The regiment went on to take part in Joseph Hooker's Chancellorsville Campaign, serving as skirmishers on the right flank of I Corps. Three months later, at the first day of fighting at Gettysburg, with Col. Allen away on furlough due to illness, McFarland capably led the 151st as his regiment covered the retreat of the battered Union Army's I Corps through the town of Gettysburg. The regiment at the time of the battle was part of Brig. Gen. Thomas Rowley's brigade, Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's division of Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds' I Corps. Having spent the night of June 30 encamped along Marsh Creek roughly six miles southwest of the town of Gettysburg, the regiment received orders to march shortly before 8:00 AM the next morning. Dreese, Michael A., The 151st Pennsylvania Volunteers at Gettysburg: Like Ripe Apples in a Storm. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009. p. 32-33. The regiment arrived at the scene of the morning's fighting northwest of town not long after 11:00 AM. McFarland and his regiment were placed at the Lutheran Theological Seminary to act as the I Corps' emergency reserve. The regiment assisted in constructing crude breastworks in front of the Seminary until roughly 3:00 PM when Gen. Rowley ordered McFarland to move his regiment forward to Herbst Woods - now known as Reynolds' Woods - to assist the Iron Brigade. The Midwesterners of the Iron Brigade, under the command of Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith, had been the first infantry engaged that morning and were being worn thin as they attempted to repel repeated attacks from Confederate Maj. Gen. William Pender's division. As the Iron Brigade fell back, 151st held off several enemy attacks along Willoughby Run, which ran through Herbst Woods. The 151st was forced to hold alone and barely supported. During their defense, the dueled with Col. Abner Perrin's South Carolina brigade and caused enormous casualties to that brigade. Eventually, the regiment was relieved and allowed to fall back. Lt. Col. McFarland had his regiment rally at the Lutheran Theological Seminary, where several other regiments were also rallying. As they gathered, McFarland was met by a Federal lieutenant on horseback who held next to him a furled regimental flag. The lieutenant asked McFarland, \\"Sir, is this your flag?\\"Dreese, Michael A., An Imperishable Fame: The Civil War Experience of George Fisher McFarland. Mifflintown, Pennsylvania: Juniata County Historical Society, 1997. McFarland, horrified at the realization that his men may have lost their colors, was about to reply when a gust of wind flung the flag out. The flag read that it belonged to the 142nd Pennsylvania Infantry. Relieved, McFarland pointed out the commander of the 142nd to the lieutenant and then proceeded to continue organizing his regiment around his own colors, which soon appeared. Once the men were rallied, McFarland had them throw up a quick barricade around the Seminary building where the men would hold against the advancing Confederates, who were then bearing down upon them. With a few other regiments, the 151st held off repeated enemy attacks. During this fighting, a thick smoke from the heavy gunfire had engulfed the area. McFarland stooped down to try to see under some of the smoke to locate the enemy when a bullet went through his left leg and into his right. A private with Company F had lifted him up off the ground and put McFarland's arm around his shoulder to support him. The private then proceeded to take McFarland into the Seminary for medical attention when a bullet came so close to them that it took the middle cuff button off of McFarland's uniform as the private supported him. The 151st Pennsylvania was the last regiment to pull back in the retreat to Cemetery Ridge. McFarland was treated in the Seminary. His left leg was amputated below the knee. Shortly after Gettysburg, McFarland and the 151st Pennsylvania Infantry were mustered out of the Union army, their nine-month term of enlistment expired. Postbellum After the war, the disabled McFarland moved his family to Harrisburg where he founded a printing company and a nursery. McFarland was the father of three children and the superintendent of an orphanage. One of his children, J. Horace McFarland, started to work in his father's printing shop at age twelve and became one of the first American publishers to sound the call for environmental and scenic protection.J.

The Group is present in 79 countries with 2,056 points of sale – 1,462 directly operated stores and 594 franchises.  History and expansion in the world  It started out in 1880 as a family-run haberdashery store situated on Calle Romanones in Madrid. Over the years, this small business would move into other areas including textile production, before finally channelling its efforts into distribution, its major activity over the last few decades. 1933 saw the creation of the La Palma shirt factory, which included the most advanced production techniques of the day. It was followed in 1945 by the tailoring factory, which in 1946 produced the first men's suits under the Cortefiel label. In 1954, and coinciding with the founding of Manufacturas del Vestido, the firm became a holding company. The Group continued to grow during the 1980s with the creation of the men's tailoring brand Milano (1984) and its casual youth fashion brand, Springfield (1988). In 1989 the firm acquired Pedro del Hierro, and in 1993 launched women'secret, its underwear and swimwear brand created by and for women. During the eighties work also got underway on the diversification of the Group's retail formats, driven by the need to provide the Group with greater capacity for growth and segmentation and the ability to meet consumers' needs. Its international expansion strategy dates back to 1993, although the period of fastest growth was registered between 2000 and 2003, when the sales surface area handled by the Group increased by more than 70%. In 2005 MEP Retail acquired a stake in the Group, bringing about a change in the share ownership and management team. This same period also saw a sharp rise in the Group's global franchise business. The women'secret online store was launched in 2000, and 2010 saw the consolidation of the Group's ecommerce area with the creation of the SPF.com online store. This will be followed in the coming months by further online stores from Pedro del Hierro, Cortefiel and Fifty Factory. The Group has a network of international buying offices in Spain, Hong Kong and India.

Robert is said to have been the son of George Munro, 5th Baron of Foulis who he succeeded in 1269. There is no longer any contemporary evidence for this Robert Munro's existence however a charter said to have been granted to him after 1309 during the reign of Robert the Bruce is recorded in \\"Robertson's Index of Charters\\" which was compiled in 1629 and published in 1798. However, the original charter can no longer be found. Furthermore to Robert Munro, 6th Baron's existence are the Calendar Munro of Fowlis Writs, a series of legal agreements, now preserved in the Register House in Edinburgh, that conclusively prove that the Munro family held land in Ross-shire in the early 14th century and earlier to 1299. The Wars of Scottish Independence began during Robert Munro's chiefship. The Munros, from early times held their land direct from the crown, but even so, until 1478 they were regarded as vassals of the Earl of Ross. This may explain the \\"obscure\\" record of them from these times. William II, Earl of Ross may well have had Munros with him when he was captured at the Battle of Dunbar (1296). It was the Earl's son \\"Sir Walter the Ros\\" who fought at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 where the Scottish army defeated the English and Robert Munro is said to have fought there with him. General Stewart later included the Munros in the list of Highland clans who fought at Bannockburn. Robert Munro is said to have survived the battle but according to tradition his son George was killed and Robert was therefore later succeeded by his grandson, also called George.

She is famed for her work with traditional Irish groups such as Skara Brae, The Bothy Band, Relativity, Touchstone, and Nightnoise. Early years Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill was raised in Kells, County Meath. Her paternal grandparents moved there from the Rann na Feirste Gaeltacht of Donegal in the 1930s. Tríona is from a prominent musical family. Her paternal aunt, Neillí, contributed nearly 300 folk songs to the folklore collection of University College Dublin. Together with her brother, Mícheál Ó Domhnaill, younger sister Maighread Ní Dhomhnaill, and multi-instrumentalist Dáithí Sproule, Ní Dhomhnaill first attracted attention with their folk group, Skara Brae, that specialised in songs sung in the Irish language, many sourced from the Rann na Feirste area where their father's family originated. The Bothy Band When bouzouki player Dónal Lunny left the Irish folk band Planxty in 1975 and launched a new record label called Mulligan, one of his first projects was to form a band to accompany accordion player Tony MacMahon on a series of shows for Irish National Radio. Along with uilleann pipe player Paddy Keenan, flute and whistle player Matt Molloy, and fiddle player Paddy Glackin, Ní Dhomhnaill and her brother became charter members. Initially named Seachtar (which is Irish for \\"seven people\\"), the group changed its name to the Bothy Band after the departure of MacMahon. As the Bothy Band, the group played its first concert on 2 February 1975, at Trinity College, Dublin. Although they were together for only three years, the Bothy Band were one of the first bands to bring the musical traditions of Ireland up to contemporary standards. While the group experienced numerous personnel changes, Ní Dhomhnaill and her brother Micheal were still members when the Bothy Band's final album, Afterhours, was recorded during a concert performance at the Palais des Arts in Paris in 1978. A second live album, Live in Concert, recorded by the BBC in London at the Paris Theatre in July 1976 and Kilburn National Theatre in July 1978, was released in 1995. Career in the United States By the time the Bothy Band disbanded in 1979, Ní Dhomhnaill had been persuaded by singer/songwriter Mike Cross to emigrate to Chapel Hill, North Carolina in the United States. Ní Dhomhnaill soon assembled a new band of North American musicians, Touchstone, that initially rehearsed in Cross's home. Touchstone's two albums, The New Land (1982) and Jealousy (1984), combined songs sung in Irish, original singer/songwriter tunes, and traditional folk songs from the United States and Nova Scotia. Relocating to Portland, Oregon, in the mid-1980s, Ní Dhomhnaill was reunited with her brother Mícheál, who had emigrated to the area from Ireland a few years before. Together with the Cunningham brothers, Johnny and Phil, formerly with the Scottish group Silly Wizard, they toured and recorded two albums as Relativity. They also collaborated with Billy Oskay and Brian Dunning, later replaced by Johnny Cunningham, in a Celtic-tinged new age group, Nightnoise.

The film features special makeup effects by Alterian, Inc. Plot summary Marty Malt (Judd Nelson) is an unhappy garbage man who moonlights as an atrociously unfunny standup comic. He lives in a dark, grimy, garbage-strewn urban netherworld, where a company named Blump's apparently owns everything. His best friend and fellow trash collector, Gus (Bill Paxton), is the only one who laughs at his jokes, and his sincerity is questionable. The obnoxiously exuberant Gus plays an accordion, which he always carries with him. Marty is seeing Rosarita (Lara Flynn Boyle), a waitress, but she doesn't seem too interested in him. One day, Gus convinces a talent agent, Jackie Chrome (Wayne Newton), to check out Marty's act. Jackie isn't impressed. Marty's luck seems to take a turn for the worse when a large lump starts growing on his back. He goes to a quack doctor (James Caan), who calls him a wimp and puts a Band-Aid on the lump. The lump continues to grow, eventually becoming a full-sized arm. While Gus uses Marty's newfound freakishness to impress his morbidly obese girlfriends, a horrified Rosarita breaks up with Marty, and he gets fired from the club where he does his act. Marty is despondent until Gus brings him to see Jackie, who, it turns out, has always dreamed of finding a real three-armed comic. Re- christened \\"Desi the Three-Armed Wonder Comic,\\" and with Gus now providing musical accompaniment, Marty gets a fresh start on his career. Marty and Gus have a few semi-successful shows and eventually meet Hollywood talent agent Dirk Delta (Rob Lowe), who offers them a job.

He goes with Gus to see Jackie, who is furious at first but calms down and decides to tell Dirk the truth upon Marty's suggestion. After calling Dirk and telling him the bad news, Dirk surprisingly asks them to send Gus to fill the spot with his accordion playing. Gus is ecstatic and leaves almost immediately. Marty is sad but gets his job back at the club and uses the story of his third arm in his act and finally gets a few laughs from the crowd.

It received a 45% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews (five positive, six negative). Janet Maslin of the New York Times criticized the film's silly story, poor acting and grotesque scenes, calling the film a confused David Lynch wanna-be that \\"concentrates only on stomach-turning trivia and on the kind of exaggeratedly stupid behavior that amounts to directorial condescension\\" and \\"the film's efforts to say something about success and its capriciousness never succeed in rising above an elbow- in-the-ribs obviousness.\\"Movie Review - The Dark Backward: A Garbage Man With Aspirations New York Times Review: The Dark Backward Scott Weinberg of eFilmCritic.com gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 saying it \\"tries way too hard to be a cult classic, which probably explains why it's not one.\\" Not all reviews were negative. Brian Webster of the Apollo Guide enjoyed the film, giving it a score of 74/100 and describing it as \\"Odd and twisted, The Dark Backward has plenty to thrill admirers of ugliness and enough food for thought to interest the rest of us too.\\" References External links  1991 films American films Films shot in California Films shot in Los Angeles English-language films American independent films American satirical films 1991 comedy films Films directed by Adam Rifkin ","title":"The Dark Backward"},{"id":"16005693","text":"King of the Jungle is a 1927 American adventure film serial directed by Webster Cullison.

Biography Born in Oklahoma City, Lamond attended the Peabody Conservatory in Philadelphia in the early 1940s, and played with Sonny Dunham and Boyd Raeburn at the outset of his career. He took over Dave Tough's spot in Woody Herman's big band First Herd in 1945, where he remained until the group disbanded at the end of 1946. In 1947 he briefly freelanced with musicians including Charlie Parker, and then returned to duty under Herman in his Second Herd, where he remained until its 1949 dissolution. In the 1950s and 1960s Lamond found work as a session musician, recording in a wide variety of styles. He performed and recorded with Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Johnny Smith, Benny Goodman, Ruby Braff, the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra, Sonny Stitt, Johnny Guarnieri, Jack Teagarden, Quincy Jones, George Russell, and Bob Crosby among others. He recorded as a bandleader in 1962 with a tentet which included Doc Severinsen. Later in the 1960s he played with George Wein's Newport Festival band. In the 1970s he worked with Red Norvo, Maxine Sullivan, and Bucky Pizzarelli, and also put together his own swing group late in the decade, which recorded in 1977 and 1982. He also recorded a quartet album in 1981 with his wife, Terry Lamond, singing. He died in 2003 in Orlando, Florida at age 83.

In the males there are two forms, a very rare phenomenon in zoology. These use different courting displays, and differ in appearance: the \\"tufted\\" morph has a black body and pedipalps (\\"palps\\"), three black tufts across its \\"head\\", and pale legs; and the \\"gray\\" morph has black and white stripes all over its body and legs, orange palps, and no tufts. However, each form accounts for 50% of the adult males, and they are equally successful in mating. A female of Maevia inclemens is long, while males are long. Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has excellent vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and are more acute than those of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are along the sides of the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods. M. inclemens is one of the eight species in genus Maevia. The species was first called Attus inclemens, and other names have been used. The two male forms look and behave so differently that they were originally considered two distinct species. In 1955 Robert Barnes chose M. inclemens, and this has become the standard name. The species is found in west southern Canada, and in the United States its distribution forms a crescent from the north mid-west through New England and south to Florida. M. inclemens has been able to establish itself in man-made structures such as outbuildings or fences.  Taxonomy  Maevia inclemens is the type species for the genus Maevia (C.L. Koch, 1850), which includes another 10 species in May 2011. The species name is derived from Latin adjective inclēmens \\"cruel, harsh\\" or \\"rough\\". The species was first called Attus inclemens, and other names including Attus vittatus, Maevia pencillata, and Maevia vittata. Also the two male forms look and behave so differently that they were originally considered two distinct species. In 1955 Robert Barnes chose M. inclemens, and this has become the standard name. Description Spiders are chelicerates, which differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen. Spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. The cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, which allows the abdomen to move while spinning silk. While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey, they use silk for other purposes, including molting and laying eggs. Jumping spiders have large forelegs and short, powerful back legs. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by increasing their blood pressure. Jumping spiders can leap several times their own length by powerfully extending the third or fourth pairs of legs, reaching up to with the forelimbs extended to grasp the prey. Spiders maintain balance when walking, so that legs 1 and 3 on one side and 2 and 4 on the other side are moving, while the other four legs are on the surface. To run faster, spiders increase their stride frequency. In spiders and other chelicerates, there is only one pair of appendages before the mouth, and in spiders these are modified into fangs that inject poison into the prey. Behind the mouth is a pair of pedipalps (\\"palps\\" for short), and those of male spiders are quite large and are used for displaying and mating. Spiders groom themselves regularly, and more often if wet or dirty. They moisten their fangs, draw the legs one at a time through the fangs, and \\"comb\\" the legs with the fangs and palps. The first and fourth pairs of legs are then used to groom other parts of the body, and the only place they appear not to reach is the dorsal surface of the carapace. The body of M. inclemens is only sparsely covered with hairs and scales. A female of Maevia inclemens is long, her carapace is light brown, her legs are pale and unmarked. The top of her abdomen is chalky or rusty colored, and along each side is a black band, often thinly covered with orange scales. Sometimes there is series of chevrons (V-shaped markings) along the middle of her abdomen. She has a prominent white stripe below the foremost eyes. There are spines on the first and second pair of her legs, but her body never has tufts of hair. Males are long, and their carapaces are light to dark brown, with a black line around the edge. There usually is a pair of large lighter areas between the last pair of eyes halfway down the back of the carapace. The eyes are surrounded by black. Males occur in two forms, a very rare phenomenon in zoology. The \\"tufted\\" morph has a totally black body, black pedipalps, white legs and three tufts of bristles on the front part of the cephalothorax. The \\"gray\\" male morph has a black and white striped body, a prominent white stripe on the foremost eyes, striped legs and bright orange pedipalps, and no tufts. Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace, and that of female Maevia inclemens average wide, while the carapaces of males average . The carapace of M. inclemens is fairly high, between 60% and 70% of the width.

Before looking for a mate, a male spider spins a small, flat web on a surface and ejaculates into it. He then loads the semen into syringe-like receptacles in both palps, and then searches for a female. After sighting a female, the tufted morph pushes himself as high as possible with the last three pair of legs, and claps with the foremost pair, while at the same time waving the palps up and down, and swinging the abdomen from side to side, usually about from the female. In contrast, the gray morph crouches down and points the foremost two pairs of legs directly forward, crosses the tips of the legs creating a triangle-like configuration, holds his orange-colored palps beneath his forward eyes, and glides back and forth in stationary or receding semi- circles in front of the female, at away. The movements of the two morphs are identical later in the sequence. When receptive, females respond similarly to both male types: approach and settle; extend the foremost pair of legs or tap with them. Both male morphs typically end their initial display and start leg- clapping and zig-zag dancing. When tufted males clap, females look towards them and display a greater number of tap displays to them than to the gray morph. Females also respond to tufted morphs' clapping more often by settling than for gray males. However, after the females look towards the males, gray males approach the female more often than the tufted male. Females often tip their abdomens from side to side. Finally the male mounts and copulates with the female. Afterward, the male generally dismounts and the two pair usually run away from each other. However, the male sometimes chases the female and tries to copulate again. In an experiment, 12 tufted (52%) and 14 gray males (54%) copulated with females after courtship. At the end of copulation, females tried to capture and eat the males, but in the same experiment only one tufted and one gray male were killed. A count of offspring showed no differences in numbers of spiderlings from the two morphs. However, gray males got females' attention more quickly within while tufted males were quicker between from the females. The continuation of two male morphs may be an example of a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy, in which both morphs are genetically determined by their fathers' morphs, and both are equally successful in their different ways. Distribution and habitat Maevia inclemens is found throughout the eastern and mid-west United States and south-west Canada, including: Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York state, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Quebec and Manitoba. A study reported in 1981 on one mature and three recently clear-cut sites in the southern Appalachian Mountains near Highlands, North Carolina. All specimens of spiders that hunt were collected on plants or webs above ground. Clear-cutting caused a marked decrease in the abundance of nine species and a marked increase in four species, while M. inclemens and six others showed no change. A few jumping spider species, including M. inclemens, have been able to establish themselves in man-made structures. Most often these spiders are found on outbuildings or structures such as fences, rather than in permanently inhabited houses.

Nickel Hazards to Fish, Wildlife, and Invertebrates: a Synoptic Review. Laurel: U.S. Geological Survey Synthesis Nickel(II) chromate can be formed in the lab by heating a mixture of chromium(III) oxide and nickel oxide at between 700 °C and 800 °C under oxygen at 1000 atm pressure. It can be produced at 535 °C and 7.3 bar oxygen, but the reaction takes days to complete. If the pressure is too low or temperature too high but above 660 °C, then the nickel chromium spinel NiCr2O4 forms instead. Karin Brandt also claimed to make nickel chromate using a hydrothermal technique. (not consulted) Precipitates of Ni2+ ions with chromate produce a brown substance that contains water. Properties The structure of nickel chromate is the same as for chromium vanadate, CrVO4. Crystals have an orthorhombic structure with unit cell sizes a = 5.482 Å, b = 8.237 Å, c = 6.147 Å. The cell volume is 277.6 Å3 with four formula per unit cell. Nickel chromate is dark in colour, unlike most other chromates which are yellow. The infrared spectrum of nickel chromate show two sets of absorption bands. The first includes lines at 925, 825, and 800 cm−1 due to Cr-O stretching, and the second has lines at 430, 395, 365 (very weak) due to Cr-O rock and bend and 310 cm−1 produced from Ni-O stretching.

To this day, he appears on a Cuban banknote cutting sugar cane with a machete in the fields.Cuba remembers Che Guevara 40 years after his fall by Rosa Tania Valdes, Reuters, October 8, 2007 The Cuban state has continued to cultivate Guevara’s appreciation, constructing numerous statues and artworks in his honor throughout the land; adorning school rooms, workplaces, public buildings, billboards, and money with his image.Cuba's Face, by Stanford University Germanic Collections His visage is also on postage stamps and the 3-peso coin beneath the words \\"Patria o Muerte\\" (Homeland or Death). Moreover, children across the country begin each school day with the chant \\"Pioneers for Communism, We will be like Che!\\". The University of Havana also possesses an academic concentration in \\"Che.\\" Guevara's mausoleum in Santa Clara has also become a site of almost religious significance to many Cubans, while the nation’s burgeoning tourist industry has benefited greatly from the ongoing international interest in Guevara's life. For example, some 205,832 people visited the mausoleum during 2004, of whom 127,597 were foreigners. However, Argentine psychoanalyst Pacho O'Donnell regrets the formal rigidity of Che's state-crafted image, opining that \\"The Cubans have excluded everything about the younger Che that is not heroic, including that which is most deliciously human about him. Personal doubts, the sexual escapades, the moments when he and (Alberto) Granado were drunk, none of that fits with the immortal warrior they want to project.\\" Despite the formal adulation, Guevara's legacy is less pronounced on a national policy front. In Cuba, Guevara's death precipitated the abandonment of guerrilla warfare as an instrument of foreign policy, ushering in a rapprochement with the Soviet Union, and the reformation of the government along Soviet lines. When Cuban troops returned to Africa in the 1970s, it was as part of a large-scale military expedition, and support for insurrection movements in Latin America and the Caribbean became logistical and organizational rather than overt. Cuba also abandoned Guevara's plans for economic diversification and rapid industrialization which had ultimately proved to be impracticable in view of the country's incorporation into the COMECON system. As early as 1965, the Yugoslav communist journal Borba observed the many half-completed or empty factories in Cuba, a legacy of Guevara's short tenure as Minister of Industries, \\"standing like sad memories of the conflict between pretension and reality\\".Hugh Thomas. Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom. p. 1,007. =In the Cuban-American community= Many Cuban exiles have spoken of Guevara in unfavorable terms, and he is remembered by some with the epithet \\"The Butcher of la Cabaña\\", a reference to Guevara’s post- revolutionary role as \\"supreme prosecutor\\" over the revolutionary tribunals at the fortress. Similar disapproval has been shared by Cuban-American actor and director Andy García, who alleged in 2004 that \\"Che has been romanticized over the years, but there is a darker side to his story. He looks like a rock star, but he executed a lot of people without trial or defense.\\"Andy Garcia Tells His Cuba Story, at Last by NewsMax.com May 5, 2006 Garcia's 2005 film The Lost City, portrays what could be perceived by some, as the brutality of pre and post revolution Cuba, including Che.Don’t Let This Movie Get Lost by Kathryn Jean Lopez, National Review In reference to such polarization, Cuban-American academic Uva de Aragon has hypothesized that \\"we'll still have to wait many years for history to deliver a definite judgement on Che, when the passions of both sides have passed.\\"Sympathizers Mark 40th anniversary of Che Guevara's Death, by the Associated Press, October 8, 2007 =In Latin America= In Bogotá, the National University of Colombia gave their \\"Santander Square\\" the nickname \\"Che Square\\".

Amongst the youth of Latin America, Guevara's memoir The Motorcycle Diaries has become a cult favorite with college students and young intellectuals.Letter from the Americas; Che Today? More Easy Rider Than Revolutionary by Larry Rohter, The New York Times, May 26, 2004 This has allowed Guevara to emerge as \\"a romantic and tragic young adventurer, who has as much in common with Jack Kerouac or James Dean as with Fidel Castro.\\" Speaking on this phenomenon, biographer Jon Lee Anderson, has theorized that Che is \\"a figure who can constantly be examined and re-examined, to the younger, post-cold-war generation of Latin Americans, Che stands up as the perennial Icarus, a self-immolating figure who represents the romantic tragedy of youth. Their Che is not just a potent figure of protest, but the idealistic, questioning kid who exists in every society and every time.\\" =Critics= The U.S. State Department was advised that his death would come as a relief to non-leftist Latin Americans, who had feared possible insurgencies in their own countries. Subsequent critical analysts have also shed light on aspects of cruelty in Guevara’s methods. Studies addressing problematic characteristics of Guevara's life have cited his unsympathetic treatment of his fellow fighters during various guerrilla campaigns, and his frequent humiliations of those deemed his intellectual inferiors.The Resurrection of Che Guevara, by Samuel Farber, Summer 1998Anderson, Jon Lee. Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 567. Though much opposition to Guevara's methods has come from the political right, critical evaluation has also come from groups such as anarchists, Trotskyists, and civil libertarians, who consider Guevara an anti-working-class Stalinist, whose legacy was the creation of a more bureaucratic, authoritarian regime.Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara, 1928–1967 at LibCom Detractors have also theorized that in much of Latin America, Che-inspired revolutions had the practical result of reinforcing brutal militarism for many years.Guevara has been heavily idolized by people in the music industry. Particularly rock and hip-hop. Despite this, some see Che as more champion of political and ideological conformity. Cuban jazz legend Paquito D'Rivera stated in interview \\"Che hated artists, so how is it possible that artists still today support the image of Che Guevara?\\" The Killing Machine: Che Guevara, from Communist Firebrand to Capitalist Brand by The Independent Institute Pop culture icon Guevara's long hair, starred beret and cigar, were all part of his personal style and popular aesthetic appeal.

Well known Bohemian writers extolled him, while West German playwright Peter Weiss has even compared him to \\"a Christ taken down from the Cross.\\" A photograph of Guevara taken by photographer Alberto KordaChe Guevara Photographer Dies by BBC News, May 26, 2001 has become one of the century's most ubiquitous images, and the portrait, transformed into a monochrome graphic by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick, is reproduced endlessly on a vast array of merchandise, such as T-shirts, posters, cigarettes, coffee mugs, and baseball caps. This fact led Argentine business analyst Martin Krauze to postulate that \\"the admiration for El Che no longer extends to his politics and ideology, it’s a romantic idea of one man going to battle against the windmills, he’s a Quixote.\\"Che Guevara: An Image that Keeps the Spirit of Revolution Alive by the Socialist Worker, Issue 2005, June 17, 2006 British journalist Sean O’Hagan has described Che as \\"more (John) Lennon than (Vladimir) Lenin.\\" Taking the opposite hypothesis, Mexican commentator and Che Biographer Jorge Castañeda Gutman has proclaimed that: \\"Che can be found just where he belongs in the niches reserved for cultural icons, for symbols of social uprisings that filter down deep into the soil of society.\\"Che Guevara: An Image that Keeps the Spirit of Revolution Alive 2005 Issue of The Socialist Worker Castañeda has further stated that \\"Che still possesses an extraordinary relevance as a symbol of a time when people died heroically for what they believed in\\", adding that in his view \\"people don't do that anymore.\\"Che Guevara: Revolutionary & Icon, by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 76 The saying \\"Viva la revolucion!\\" has also become very popular and synonymous with Guevara.Discussion about Che Guevara, by CBC Radio One In North America, Western Europe and many regions outside Latin America, the image has been likened to a global brand, long since shedding its ideological or political connotations. Conversely, the obsession with Guevara has also been dismissed by critics as merely \\"adolescent revolutionary romanticism.\\" American, Latin American and European writers, Jon Lee Anderson, Régis Debray, Jorge G. Castañeda and others contributed to demystify the image of Guevara via articles and extensive biographies, which detailed his life and legacy in less idealistic terms; and, in the case of Octavio Paz, was accompanied by a critical indictment of the Marxism espoused by many in the Latin American left. Political writer Paul Berman went further, asserting that the \\"modern- day cult of Che\\" obscures the work of dissidents and what he believes is a \\"tremendous social struggle\\" currently taking place in Cuba.The Cult of Che by Paul Berman, Slate magazine, September 2004 Author Christopher Hitchens, who was a socialist and a supporter of the Cuban revolution in the 1960s but later changed his views, summarised Guevara's legacy by surmising that \\"Che's iconic status was assured because he failed. His story was one of defeat and isolation, and that's why it is so seductive. Had he lived, the myth of Che would have long since died.\\" Taking the opposing view, Richard Gott a Guardian journalist in Vallegrande, sent a dispatch on the day of Guevara's death stating the following: References External links *BBC: Che's Spirit Burns on in Latin America by Daniel Schweimler, January 3, 2009 *Daily Observer: Che Remembered: on 80th Birthday June 12, 2008 *Der Spiegel: Photo Gallery – Latin America Commemorates Che Guevara *Harpers Magazine: Six Questions for Greg Grandin on Che’s Legacy September 30, 2007 * PBS Forum: The Legacy of Che Guevara with biographer Jon Lee Anderson November 20, 1997 * Socialist Worker: The Legacy of A Revolutionary – Who was Che?

The relatively narrow mouth of the beanpot minimizes evaporation and heat loss, while its deep, wide, thick-walled body facilitates long, slow cooking times.

This association is evident in the nickname Beantown, and the use of the name beanpot for Boston events such as the Beanpot ice hockey tournament.

Of his use of DADGAD tuning, Sproule says, it \\"just seemed to instantly gel with Irish music. The nature of the tuning meant that you didn't really produce anything that was terribly, drastically, offensively wrong to people.

United States, 390 U.S. 85 (1968), was a United States Supreme Court decision interpreting the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution's self-incrimination clause.. Haynes extended the Fifth Amendment protections elucidated in Marchetti v. United States..William F. Funk, Richard H. Seamon, Examples & explanations series: Administrative Law, Edition 3, Aspen Publishers, 2009, page 361-62. Background of the case The National Firearms Act of 1934 required the registration of certain types of firearms. Miles Edward Haynes was a convicted felon who was charged with failing to register a firearm under the Act. Haynes argued that, because he was a convicted felon and thus prohibited from owning a firearm, requiring him to register was essentially requiring him to make an open admission to the government that he was in violation of the law, which was thus a violation of his right not to incriminate himself. Majority opinion In a 7-1 decision, the Court ruled in 1968 in favor of Haynes. Earl Warren dissented in a one sentence opinion and Thurgood Marshall did not participate in the ruling. As with many other 5th amendment cases, felons and others prohibited from possessing firearms could not be compelled to incriminate themselves through registration.http://www.gunlaws.com/gunreggie.htm The National Firearms Act was amended after Haynes to make it apply only to those who could lawfully possess a firearm. This eliminated prosecution of prohibited persons, such as criminals, and cured the self-incrimination problem. In this new form, the new registration provision was upheld. The court held: \\" To eliminate the defects revealed by Haynes, Congress amended the Act so that only a possessor who lawfully makes, manufactures, or imports firearms can and must register them\\", United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601 (1971).David Fellman, Defendants Rights Today, Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1979, page 310.

Early history Cambrian was set up on 25 April 1935 as Cambrian Air Services. The airline's base was at Pengam Moors airfield located to the east of Cardiff. The first aircraft to be operated was a single de Havilland DH.60 Moth, with the main activity of training pilots, and flights for tourists. With the outbreak of World War II, Cambrian stopped its activities.March and Wright 1972, p. 100. Commencing on 1 January 1946 it was the first British airline to restart operations after the war, with a charter flight with an Auster Autocrat with a cargo of wire rope and an aircraft seat between Cardiff airport and Bristol. In 1948 Cambrian was flying in cooperation with BEA and used the de Havilland Dragon Rapide, the Autocrat and the Percival Proctor. During 1949 flights between Birmingham and Jersey were begun. During 1953, Cambrian took over Olley Air Service and Murray Chown Aviation and began services between Southampton to Dinard and Paris. This route was served with the de Havilland Dove and later with the Douglas DC-3. In 1956 the name was changed to Cambrian Airways. Later history By 1961, Cambrian was operating eight ex BEA Douglas Dakota (DC-3) airliners. The first service operated by the Vickers Viscount turboprop commenced on 20 February 1963 on the route from Cardiff via Bristol to Dublin.Merton-Jones, 2000, P. 81 From 1964 the type was used on charter flights to Rimini, Palma, Nice, Valencia and Barcelona. In 1967 BEA took over Cambrian, although it continued to operate as a separate airline. The following year the last flight with the DC-3 was flown .

Works His principal work is a mystical theology first published at Barcelona in 1662 under the title Mystica theologia D.

The work having become rare and difficult to obtain, a new edition was brought out by the Dominican Father Berthier at Turin, 1890. It contains the text of the original edition of 1662 in the body of the work, and the editions which appeared in the edition of 1665 in the form of added notes are given in an appendix. The doctrine of the book is the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas, of which the author writes in his prologue: :\\"The mystical doctrine of St. Thomas is of such great authority, precisely because it is founded on Scholastic doctrine, that it can scarcely be expressed in words. That mystic doctrine which is not repugnant to the principles of scholastic doctrine has a firm foundation, and therefore readers who study mystical theology in St. Thomas find it firm and well-established; on the contrary, those who read it in other books which treat of mystical matters alone, without any teacher or guide, under the appearance of devotion in somewhat severe words, absorb material for errors.\\" Besides his Mystical Theology Vallgornera is the author of a book on the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin, De Rosario B.

Since its foundation until the year 2004, Sapucaiense was an amateur club who excelled in the municipal championships of Sapucaia do sul rivaling traditional local amateur teams. Its main opponents were Vera Cruz, Vila Vargas, Sial and Taurus, with which the Sapucaiense played fierce derbies. Over the years the Sapucaiense was succeeding and began to compete in official competitions with its youth teams. In 1999 the FGF organized a state championship between amateur cities for under 21 teams, called Copa Sul 21. Sapucaiense represented Sapucaia and was champion. This rise of Sapucaiense culminated with its professionalism in 2005, when they started to play the Campeonato Gaúcho and Copa FGF. In 2007 the club was champion of the State Championship Second Level, named Divisão de Acesso and this established Sapucaia do Suk's red- black team in the professional level of Rio Grande do Sul and secured promotion for the first time, at the Gauchão. Sapucaiense played the Gauchão for two consecutive years. In 2008, in his rookie year, they exceeded expectations and finished the championship in a creditable 6th place. A historic campaign for the club and the city. However, in 2009 Sapucaiense was not very successful and finished the competition in the 15th place, returning to the Divisão de Acesso. Due to 3rd place finish in the 2010 Copa FGF and the fact that the end of Gauchão 2011 have been decided by the Gre-Nal duo, Sapucaiense qualified to compete in the 2012 Copa do Brasil.

Principles  Car-free walking was created to encourage walkers to use public transport rather than using cars to reach the start of a walk. This is to reduce the number of cars in the countryside, particularly in National Parks, which can cause congestion and inappropriate parking.Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority - Animated resources - Tourism issues - Too much traffic (non-Flash version) It is also to support bus and train services in rural areas. Encouraging people not to use their cars is also one of the key aspects of efforts to combat climate change caused through greenhouse gas emissions.  Benefits  Car-free walking has environmental benefits, because it encourages people not to use a car and provides information on how to do this. It also supports public transport in rural areas. The benefits for the walker include the opportunity to walk linear routes that start and finish in different places and the chance to have a drink at the end of the walk without then having to drive. Many of the walking routes suggest a pub at the end of the walk.  Supporters  Many organisations encourage their members to use public transport when walking. Prominent supporters of this approach include: * Youth Hostel Association (YHA), through their Empty Roads website Empty Roads Enjoy the View Car-Free in the UK - Home * Ramblers Association  Websites  = National websites = Car Free Walks is an internet-based project to collect car-free walking routes from around the UK.

The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature.The Impact of US Biofuel Policies on Agricultural Price Levels and Volatility, By Bruce A. Babcock, Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University, for ICTSD, Issue Paper No. 35. June 2011. There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, and what can or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different economic models and competing forms of statistical analysis. Biofuel production has increased in recent years. Some commodities like maize (corn), sugar cane or vegetable oil can be used either as food, feed, or to make biofuels. For example, since 2006, a portion of land that was also formerly used to grow other crops in the United States is now used to grow corn for biofuels, and a larger share of corn is destined to ethanol production, reaching 25% in 2007. Second generation biofuels could potentially combine farming for food and fuel and moreover, electricity could be generated simultaneously, which could be beneficial for developing countries and rural areas in developed countries. With global demand for biofuels on the increase due to the oil price increases taking place since 2003 and the desire to reduce oil dependency as well as reduce GHG emissions from transportation, there is also fear of the potential destruction of habitats by being converted into farmland. Environmental groups have raised concerns about this trade-off for several years, but the debate reached a global scale due to the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. On the other hand, several studies do show that biofuel production can be significantly increased without increased acreage. Therefore, stating that the crisis in hand relies on the food scarcity.See for example: the US (DOE and USDA) \\"Billion Ton Report\\": or an EU (Refuel) report Biofuels are not a new phenomenon. Before the industrialisation, horses were the primary (and humans probably the secondary) source of power for transportation and physical work, requiring food. The growing of crops for horses (typically oat) for carrying out physical work is of course comparable to the growing of crops for biofuels for engines, albeit on a smaller scale, because production since then has increased. Brazil has been considered to have the world's first sustainable biofuels economyFrom The Economist print edition and its government claims Brazil's sugar cane based ethanol industry has not contributed to the 2008 food crisis. A World Bank policy research working paper released in July 2008Policy Research Working Paper No. 4682. Disclaimer: This paper reflects the findings, interpretation, and conclusions of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the World Bank concluded that \\"...large increases in biofuels production in the United States and Europe are the main reason behind the steep rise in global food prices\\", and also stated that \\"Brazil's sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher\\". However, a 2010 study also by the World Bank concluded that their previous study may have overestimated the contribution of biofuel production, as \\"the effect of biofuels on food prices has not been as large as originally thought, but that the use of commodities by financial investors (the so-called \\"financialisation of commodities\\") may have been partly responsible for the 2007/08 spike.\\" A 2008 independent study by OECD also found that the impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller. Food price inflation From 1974 to 2005 real food prices (adjusted for inflation) dropped by 75%. Food commodity prices were relatively stable after reaching lows in 2000 and 2001. Therefore, recent rapid food price increases are considered extraordinary. A World Bank policy research working paper published in July 2008 found that the increase in food commodities prices was led by grains, with sharp price increases in 2005 despite record crops worldwide. From January 2005 until June 2008, maize prices almost tripled, wheat increased 127 percent, and rice rose 170 percent. The increase in grain prices was followed by increases in fats and oil prices in mid-2006. On the other hand, the study found that sugar cane production has increased rapidly, and it was large enough to keep sugar price increases small except for 2005 and early 2006. The paper concluded that biofuels produced from grains have raised food prices in combination with other related factors between 70 to 75 percent, but ethanol produced from sugar cane has not contributed significantly to the recent increase in food commodities prices. An economic assessment report published by the OECD in July 2008 Disclaimer: This work was published under the responsibility of the Secretary-General of the OECD. The views expressed and conclusions reached do not necessarily correspond to those of the governments of OECD member countries. found that \\"...the impact of current biofuel policies on world crop prices, largely through increased demand for cereals and vegetable oils, is significant but should not be overestimated. Current biofuel support measures alone are estimated to increase average wheat prices by about 5 percent, maize by around 7 percent and vegetable oil by about 19 percent over the next 10 years.\\" Corn is used to make ethanol and prices went up by a factor of three in less than 3 years (measured in US dollars). Reports in 2007 linked stories as diverse as food riots in Mexico due to rising prices of corn for tortillas,The Costs of Rising Tortilla Prices in Mexico — Enrique C. Ochoa, February 3, 2007. and reduced profits at Heineken the large international brewer, to the increasing use of corn (maize) grown in the US Midwest for ethanol production. (In the case of beer, the barley area was cut in order to increase corn production. Barley is not currently used to produce ethanol.)Financial Times, London, February 25, 2007, quoting Jean-François van Boxmeer, chief executive.For an explanation of this ripple effect that pushes up not only the price of corn, but also that of other farming products, see this excerpt from a speech by Paul Roberts at the Commonwealth Club of California (video). Wheat is up by almost a factor of 3 in 3 years, while soybeans are up by a factor of 2 in 2 years (both measured in US dollars).Why ethanol production will drive world food prices even higher in 2008 Cleantech.com As corn is commonly used as feed for livestock, higher corn prices lead to higher prices in animal source foods. Vegetable oil is used to make biodiesel and has about doubled in price in the last couple years. The price is roughly tracking crude oil prices.The other oil shock: Vegetable oil prices soar - International Herald Tribune The 2007–2008 world food price crisis is blamed partly on the increased demand for biofuels. During the same period rice prices went up by a factor of 3 even though rice is not directly used in biofuels. The USDA expects the 2008/2009 wheat season to be a record crop and 8% higher than the previous year. They also expect rice to have a record crop. Wheat prices have dropped from a high over $12/bushel in May 2008 to under $8/bushel in May. Rice has also dropped from its highs. According to a 2008 report from the World Bank the production of biofuel pushed food prices up.World Bank Document These conclusions were supported by the Union of Concerned Scientists in their September 2008 newsletter in which they remarked that the World Bank analysis \\"contradicts U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schaffer's assertion that biofuels account for only a small percentage of rising food prices\\". According to the October Consumer Price Index released Nov. 19, 2008, food prices continued to rise in October 2008 and were 6.3 percent higher than October 2007. Since July 2008 fuel costs dropped by nearly 60 percent.  Proposed causes  =Ethanol fuel as an oxygenate additive= The demand for ethanol fuel produced from field corn was spurred in the U.S. by the discovery that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was contaminating groundwater. MTBE use as an oxygenate additive was widespread due to mandates of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1992 to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation might be taken against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market for ethanol fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE. At a time when corn prices were around US$2 a bushel, corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place at a time when oil prices were already significantly rising. =Other factors= That food prices went up at the same time fuel prices went up is not surprising and should not be entirely blamed on biofuels. Energy costs are a significant cost for fertilizer, farming, and food distribution. Also, China and other countries have had significant increases in their imports as their economies have grown.‘Weak correlation' between food and fuel prices Farm and Ranch Guide: Regional NewsIt's not food, it's not fuel, it's China: Grain trends in China 1995-2008 Sugar is one of the main feedstocks for ethanol and prices are down from 2 years ago. Part of the food price increase for international food commodities measured in US dollars is due to the dollar being devalued.PINR - Soaring Commodity Prices Point Toward Dollar Devaluation Protectionism is also an important contributor to price increases.Forex Trader Top 3: G7, Worldwide Food Prices, and Consumer Sentiment: Financial News - Yahoo! Finance 36% of world grain goes as fodder to feed animals, rather than people. Over long time periods population growth and climate change could cause food prices to go up. However, these factors have been around for many years and food prices have jumped up in the last 3 years, so their contribution to the current problem is minimal. =Government regulations of food and fuel markets= France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States governments have supported biofuels with tax breaks, mandated use, and subsidies. These policies have the unintended consequence of diverting resources from food production and leading to surging food prices and the potential destruction of natural habitats. Fuel for agricultural use often does not have fuel taxes (farmers get duty-free petrol or diesel fuel). Biofuels may have subsidiesForeign Affairs - How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor - C. Ford Runge and Benjamin Senauer and low/no retail fuel taxes.Alternative Fuels & Advanced Vehicles Data Center Biofuels compete with retail gasoline and diesel prices which have substantial taxes included. The net result is that it is possible for a farmer to use more than a gallon of fuel to make a gallon of biofuel and still make a profit. There have been thousands of scholarly papers analyzing how much energy goes into making ethanol from corn and how that compares to the energy in the ethanol. A World Bank policy research working paper concluded that food prices have risen by 35 to 40 percent between 2002 and 2008, of which 70 to 75 percent is attributable to biofuels. The \\"month-by-month\\" five-year analysis disputes that increases in global grain consumption and droughts were responsible for significant price increases, reporting that this had only a marginal impact. Instead the report argues that the EU and US drive for biofuels has had by far the biggest impact on food supply and prices, as increased production of biofuels in the US and EU were supported by subsidies and tariffs on imports, and considers that without these policies, price increases would have been smaller. This research also concluded that Brazil's sugar cane based ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly, and recommends removing tariffs on ethanol imports by both the US and EU, to allow more efficient producers such as Brazil and other developing countries, including many African countries, to produce ethanol profitably for export to meet the mandates in the EU and the US. An economic assessment published by the OECD in July 2008 agrees with the World Bank report recommendations regarding the negative effects of subsidies and import tariffs, but found that the estimated impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller. The OECD study found that trade restrictions, mainly through import tariffs, protect the domestic industry from foreign competitors but impose a cost burden on domestic biofuel users and limits alternative suppliers. The report is also critical of limited reduction of GHG emissions achieved from biofuels based on feedstocks used in Europe and North America, finding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8% by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% compared to fossil fuels. The assessment calls for the need for more open markets in biofuels and feedstocks in order to improve efficiency and lower costs. =Oil price increases= Oil price increases since 2003 resulted in increased demand for biofuels. Transforming vegetable oil into biodiesel is not very hard or costly so there is a profitable arbitrage situation if vegetable oil is much cheaper than diesel. Diesel is also made from crude oil, so vegetable oil prices are partially linked to crude oil prices. Farmers can switch to growing vegetable oil crops if those are more profitable than food crops. So all food prices are linked to vegetable oil prices, and in turn to crude oil prices. A World Bank study concluded that oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise between January 2002 until June 2008. Demand for oil is outstripping the supply of oil and oil depletion is expected to cause crude oil prices to go up over the next 50 years. Record oil prices are inflating food prices worldwide, including those crops that have no relation to biofuels, such as rice and fish.Biofuels are part of the solution In Germany and Canada it is now much cheaper to heat a house by burning grain than by using fuel derived from crude oil. With oil at $120/barrel a savings of a factor of 3 on heating costs is possible. When crude oil was at $25/barrel there was no economic incentive to switch to a grain fed heater. From 1971 to 1973, around the time of the 1973 oil crisis, corn and wheat prices went up by a factor of 3.http://www.farmdoc.uiuc.edu/manage/pricehistory/PriceHistory.asp There was no significant biofuel usage at that time. =US government policy= Some argue that the US government policy of encouraging ethanol from corn is the main cause for food price increases.Economic analysis: Ethanol policy is driving up food costs 03/16/08 - Grand Island Independent: NewsIBDeditorials.com: Editorials, Political Cartoons, and Polls from Investor's Business Daily - Ethanol Lobby Is Perpetrating A Cruel Hoax Today in Investor's Business Daily stock analysis and business news US Federal government ethanol subsidies total $7 billion per year, or $1.90 per gallon. Ethanol provides only 55% as much energy as gasoline per gallon, realizing about a $3.45 per gallon gasoline trade off. Corn is used to feed chickens, cows, and pigs, so higher corn prices lead to higher prices for chicken, beef, pork, milk, cheese, etc. U.S. Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act in 2006. \\"It's time for Congress to realize what farmers in America's heartland have known all along - that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel,\\" said U.S. Senator for Illinois Barack Obama.Baltimore, Chris. \\"New U.S. Congress looks to boost alternate fuels,\\" The Boston Globe, January 5, 2007. Retrieved on August 23, 2007 Two-thirds of U.S. oil consumption is due to the transportation sector.After the Oil Runs Out, washingtonpost.com The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 has a significant impact on U.S. Energy Policy. With the high profitability of growing corn, more and more farmers switch to growing corn until the profitability of other crops goes up to match that of corn. So the ethanol/corn subsidies drive up the prices of other farm crops. The US - an important export country for food stocks - will convert 18% of its grain output to ethanol in 2008. Across the US, 25% of the whole corn crop went to ethanol in 2007. The percentage of corn going to biofuel is expected to go up. Since 2004 a US subsidy has been paid to companies that blend biofuel and regular fuel.Green Car Advisor - U.S. Taxpayers Subsidizing Biodiesel Sold in Europe The European biofuel subsidy is paid at the point of sale. Companies import biofuel to the US, blend 1% or even 0.1% regular fuel, and then ship the blended fuel to Europe, where it can get a second subsidy. These blends are called B99 or B99.9 fuel. The practice is called \\"splash and dash\\". The imported fuel may even come from Europe to the US, get 0.1% regular fuel, and then go back to Europe. For B99.9 fuel the US blender gets a subsidy of $0.999 per gallon.European Biodiesel Board warns on Argentine biodiesel; says fuel is subsidized in Argentina and US, then dumped in Europe : Biofuels Digest The European biodiesel producers have urged the EU to impose punitive duties on these subsidized imports.Trade war brewing over US biofuel subsidies « Food Crisis In 2007, US lawmakers were also looking at closing this loophole. =Freeze on first generation biofuel production= The prospects for the use of biofuels could change in a relatively dramatic way in 2014. Petroleum trade groups petitioned the EPA in August 2013 to take into consideration a reduction of renewable biofuel content in transportation fuels. On November 15, 2013 the United States EPA announced a review of the proportion of ethanol that should be required by regulation. The standards established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 could be modified significantly. The announcement allows sixty days for the submission of commentary about the proposal. Journalist George Monbiot has argued for a 5-year freeze on biofuels while their impact on poor communities and the environment is assessed. A 2007 UN report on biofuel also raises issues regarding food security and biofuel production. Jean Ziegler, then UN Special Rapporteur on food, concluded that while the argument for biofuels in terms of energy efficiency and climate change are legitimate, the effects for the world's hungry of transforming wheat and maize crops into biofuel are \\"absolutely catastrophic\\", and terms such use of arable land a \\"crime against humanity\\". Ziegler also calls for a 5-year moratorium on biofuel production. Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban was rejected by the U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon, who called for a comprehensive review of the policies on biofuels, and said that \\"just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution\\". Food surpluses exist in many developed countries. For example, the UK wheat surplus was around 2 million tonnes in 2005.Defra figures after exports, . This surplus alone could produce sufficient bioethanol to replace around 2.5% of the UK's petroleum consumption, without requiring any increase in wheat cultivation or reduction in food supply or exports. However, above a few percent,(i.e. if the UK wanted to replace more than around 5% of its fuel with biofuel). there would be direct competition between first generation biofuel production and food production. This is one reason why many view second generation biofuels as increasingly important. =Non-food crops for biofuel= There are different types of biofuels and different feedstocks for them, and it has been proposed that only non-food crops be used for biofuel. This avoids direct competition for commodities like corn and edible vegetable oil. However, as long as farmers are able to derive a greater profit by switching to biofuels, they will.Food versus fuel debate escalatesHow Food and Fuel Compete for Land by Lester Brown - The Globalist > > Global Energy The law of supply and demand predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise. Second generation biofuels use lignocellulosic raw material such as forest residues (sometimes referred to as brown waste and black liquor from Kraft process or sulfite process pulp mills). Third generation biofuels (biofuel from algae) use non-edible raw materials sources that can be used for biodiesel and bioethanol. It has long been recognized that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material commonly referred to as \\"Nature's polymer\\", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax \\"recalcitrant\\" cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower conversion rates and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of \\"mechanochemistry\\" has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder in the presence of a catalyst, a common bentonite or kaolinite clay, that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.  Biodiesel  Soybean oil, which only represents half of the domestic raw materials available for biodiesel production in the United States, is one of many raw materials that can be used to produce biodiesel. Non-food crops like Camelina, Jatropha, seashore mallow and mustard, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Camelina is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts can be used to produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, fiberboard, and glycerin. Camelina does not take away from land currently being utilized for food production. Most camelina acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall that can not sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow camelina and add to their profitability. Jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities: > Cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around > one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides > much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment > through jatropha. Moreover, villagers often find that they can grow other > crops in the shade of the trees. Their communities will avoid importing > expensive diesel and there will be some for export too. NBB’s Feedstock Development program is addressing production of arid variety crops, algae, waste greases, and other feedstocks on the horizon to expand available material for biodiesel in a sustainable manner.  Bioalcohols  Cellulosic ethanol is a type of biofuel produced from lignocellulose, a material that comprises much of the mass of plants. Corn stover, switchgrass, miscanthus and woodchip are some of the more popular non-edible cellulosic materials for ethanol production. Commercial investment in such second- generation biofuels began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is moving forward rapidly. The world's first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.REN21 (2008). Renewables 2007 Global Status Report (PDF) p. 19. Other second generation biofuels may be commercialized in the future and compete less with food. Synthetic fuel can be made from coal or biomass and may be commercialized soon.  Bioprotein  Protein rich feed for cattle/fish/poultry can be produced from biogas/natural gas which is presently used as fuel source. Cultivation of Methylococcus capsulatus bacteria culture by consuming natural gas produces high protein rich feed with tiny land and water foot print. The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can also be put to use in cheaper production of algae oil or spirulina from algaculture which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future. With these proven technologies, abundant natural gas/ biogas availability can impart full global food security by producing highly nutrient food products with out any water pollution or green house gas (GHG) emissions. =Biofuel from food byproducts and coproducts= Biofuels can also be produced from the waste byproducts of food-based agriculture (such as citrus peels or used vegetable oil) to manufacture an environmentally sustainable fuel supply, and reduce waste disposal cost. A growing percentage of U.S. biodiesel production is made from waste vegetable oil (recycled restaurant oils) and greases. Collocation of a waste generator with a waste-to-ethanol plant can reduce the waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business. This innovative collocation concept is sometimes called holistic systems engineering. Collocation disposal elimination may be one of the few cost-effective, environmentally sound, biofuel strategies, but its scalability is limited by availability of appropriate waste generation sources. For example, millions of tons of wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions of gallons of biofuels. Due to the higher cost of transporting ethanol, it is a local partial solution, at best. =Biofuel subsidies and tariffs= Some people have claimed that ending subsidies and tariffs would enable sustainable development of a global biofuels market. Taxing biofuel imports while letting petroleum in duty-free does not fit with the goal of encouraging biofuels. Ending mandates, subsidies, and tariffs would end the distortions that current policy is causing.The Biofuel Dilemma « The Global Warming Hoax The US ethanol tariff and some US ethanol subsidies are currently set to expire over the next couple years. The EU is rethinking their biofuels directive due to environmental and social concerns.EU rethinks biofuels guidelines By Roger Harrabin bbc.co.uk Monday, 14 January 2008 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7186380.stm On January 18, 2008 the UK House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee raised similar concerns, and called for a moratorium on biofuel targets.Committee calls for Moratorium on Biofuels Germany ended their subsidy of biodiesel on Jan 1 2008 and started taxing it.Subsidy loss threatens German bio-fuel industry EnerPub - Energy Publisher =Reduce farmland reserves and set asides= To avoid overproduction and to prop up farmgate prices for agricultural commodities, the EU has for a long time have had farm subsidy programs to encourage farmers not to produce and leave productive acres fallow. The 2008 crisis prompted proposals to bring some of the reserve farmland back into use, and the used area increased actually with 0.5% but today these areas are once again out of use. According to Eurostat, 18 million hectares has been abandoned since 1990, 7,4 millions hectares are currently set aside,Landuse in EU and the EU has recently decided to set aside another 5–7% in so called Ecological Focus Areas, corresponding to 10–12 million hectares. In spite of this reduction of used land, the EU is a net exporter of e.g. wheat. The American Bakers Association has proposed reducing the amount of farmland held in the US Conservation Reserve Program. Currently the US has in the program. In Europe about 8% of the farmland is in set aside programs. Farmers have proposed freeing up all of this for farming. Two-thirds of the farmers who were on these programs in the UK are not renewing when their term expires. =Sustainable production of biofuels= Second generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (such as perennial grasses), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste. Advances in the conversion processes will almost certainly improve the sustainability of biofuels, through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels, from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources.Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges p. 2. Lord Ron Oxburgh suggests that responsible production of biofuels has several advantages: > Produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not > divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also > help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society; and they > can create jobs for the poor where previously were none. Produced > irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have > detrimental social and environmental consequences. In other words, biofuels > are pretty much like any other product.Oxburgh, Ron. Fuelling hope for the > future, Courier Mail, 15 August 2007. Far from creating food shortages, responsible production and distribution of biofuels represents the best opportunity for sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and impoverished Asia. Biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and oil price moderation. Crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes. =Continuation of the status quo= An additional policy option is to continue the current trends of government incentive for these types of crops to further evaluate the effects on food prices over a longer period of time due to the relatively recent onset of the biofuel production industry. Additionally, by virtue of the newness of the industry we can assume that like other startup industries techniques and alternatives will be cultivated quickly if there is sufficient demand for the alternative fuels and biofuels. What could result from the shock to food prices is a very quick move toward some of the non-food biofuels as are listed above amongst the other policy alternatives. Impact on developing countries Demand for fuel in rich countries is now competing against demand for food in poor countries. The increase in world grain consumption in 2006 happened due to the increase in consumption for fuel, not human consumption. The grain required to fill a fuel tank with ethanol will feed one person for a year.Starving for Fuel: How Ethanol Production Contributes to Global Hunger by Lester Brown - The Globalist > > Global Briefing Several factors combine to make recent grain and oilseed price increases impact poor countries more: * Poor people buy more grains (e.g. wheat), and are more exposed to grain price changes.Family food expenditures around the world * Poor people spend a higher portion of their income on food, so increasing food prices influence them more. * Aid organizations which buy food and send it to poor countries see more need when prices go up but are able to buy less food on the same budget.The Associated Press: UN Warns About High Fuel, Food Costs The impact is not all negative. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recognizes the potential opportunities that the growing biofuel market offers to small farmers and aquaculturers around the world and has recommended small-scale financing to help farmers in poor countries produce local biofuel. On the other hand, poor countries that do substantial farming have increased profits due to biofuels. If vegetable oil prices double, the profit margin could more than double. In the past rich countries have been dumping subsidized grains at below cost prices into poor countries and hurting the local farming industries. With biofuels using grains the rich countries no longer have grain surpluses to get rid of. Farming in poor countries is seeing healthier profit margins and expanding. Interviews with local farmers in southern Ecuador provide strong anecdotal evidence that the high price of corn is encouraging the burning of tropical forests in order to grow more. The destruction of tropical forests now account for 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions.Tropical deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions Holly K Gibbs et al. 2007 Environ. Res. Lett. 2 045021 (2pp) National Corn Growers Association US government subsidies for making ethanol from corn have been attacked as the main cause of the food vs fuel problem. To defend themselves, the National Corn Growers Association has published their views on this issue. They consider the \\"food vs fuel\\" argument to be a fallacy that is \\"fraught with misguided logic, hyperbole and scare tactics.\\" Claims made by the NCGA include: * Corn growers have been and will continue to produce enough corn so that supply and demand meet and there is no shortage. Farmers make their planting decisions based on signals from the marketplace. If demand for corn is high and projected revenue-per-acre is strong relative to other crops, farmers will plant more corn. In 2007 US farmers planted with corn, 19% more acres than they did in 2006. * The U.S. has doubled corn yields over the last 40 years and expects to double them again in the next 20 years. With twice as much corn from each acre, corn can be put to new uses without taking food from the hungry or causing deforestation. * US consumers buy things like corn flakes where the cost of the corn per box is around 5 cents. Most of the cost is packaging, advertising, shipping, etc. Only about 19% of the US retail food prices can be attributed to the actual cost of food inputs like grains and oilseeds. So if the price of a bushel of corn goes up, there may be no noticeable impact on US retail food prices. The US retail food price index has gone up only a few percent per year and is expected to continue to have very small increases. * Most of the corn produced in the US is field corn, not sweet corn, and not digestible by humans in its raw form. Most corn is used for livestock feed and not human food, even the portion that is exported. * Only the starch portion of corn kernels is converted to ethanol. The rest (protein, fat, vitamins and minerals) is passed through to the feed coproducts or human food ingredients. * One of the most significant and immediate benefits of higher grain prices is a dramatic reduction in federal farm support payments. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, corn farmers received $8.8 billion in government support in 2006. Because of higher corn prices, payments are expected to drop to $2.1 billion in 2007, a 76 percent reduction. * While the EROEI and economics of corn based ethanol are a bit weak, it paves the way for cellulosic ethanol which should have much better EROEI and economics. * While basic nourishment is clearly important, fundamental societal needs of energy, mobility, and energy security are too. If farmers crops can help their country in these areas also, it seems right to do so. Since reaching record high prices in June 2008, corn prices fell 50% by October 2008, declining sharply together with other commodities, including oil. According to a Reuters article, \\"Analysts, including some in the ethanol sector, say ethanol demand adds about 75 cents to $1.00 per bushel to the price of corn, as a rule of thumb. Other analysts say it adds around 20 percent, or just under 80 cents per bushel at current prices. Those estimates hint that $4 per bushel corn might be priced at only $3 without demand for ethanol fuel.\\". These industry sources consider that a speculative bubble in the commodity markets holding positions in corn futures was the main driver behind the observed hike in corn prices affecting food supply.  Controversy within the international system  The United States and Brazil lead the industrial world in global ethanol production, with Brazil as the world's largest exporter and biofuel industry leader. In 2006 the U.S. produced 18.4 billion liters (4.86 billion gallons), closely followed by Brazil with 16.3 billion liters (4.3 billion gallons), producing together 70% of the world's ethanol market and nearly 90% of ethanol used as fuel. These countries are followed by China with 7.5%, and India with 3.7% of the global market share. Since 2007, the concerns, criticisms and controversy surrounding the food vs biofuels issue has reached the international system, mainly heads of states, and inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), such as the United Nations and several of its agencies, particularly the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP); the International Monetary Fund; the World Bank; and agencies within the European Union. = The 2007 controversy: Ethanol diplomacy in the Americas = Presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and George W. Bush during Bush's visit to Brazil, March 2007 In March 2007, \\"ethanol diplomacy\\" was the focus of President George W. Bush's Latin American tour, in which he and Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, were seeking to promote the production and use of sugar cane based ethanol throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The two countries also agreed to share technology and set international standards for biofuels. The Brazilian sugar cane technology transfer will permit various Central American countries, such as Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, several Caribbean countries, and various Andean Countries tariff-free trade with the U.S. thanks to existing concessionary trade agreements. Even though the U.S. imposes a US$0.54 tariff on every gallon of imported ethanol, the Caribbean nations and countries in the Central American Free Trade Agreement are exempt from such duties if they produce ethanol from crops grown in their own countries. The expectation is that using Brazilian technology for refining sugar cane based ethanol, such countries could become exporters to the United States in the short-term. In August 2007, Brazil's President toured Mexico and several countries in Central America and the Caribbean to promote Brazilian ethanol technology. This alliance between the U.S. and Brazil generated some negative reactions. While Bush was in São Paulo as part of the 2007 Latin American tour, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, from Buenos Aires, dismissed the ethanol plan as \\"a crazy thing\\" and accused the U.S. of trying \\"to substitute the production of foodstuffs for animals and human beings with the production of foodstuffs for vehicles, to sustain the American way of life.\\" Chavez' complaints were quickly followed by then Cuban President Fidel Castro, who wrote that \\"you will see how many people among the hungry masses of our planet will no longer consume corn.\\" \\"Or even worse,\\" he continued, \\"by offering financing to poor countries to produce ethanol from corn or any other kind of food, no tree will be left to defend humanity from climate change.\\"' Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's President, and one of the preferential recipients of Brazil technical aid, said that \\"we reject the gibberish of those who applaud Bush's totally absurd proposal, which attacks the food security rights of Latin Americans and Africans, who are major corn consumers\\", however, he voiced support for sugar cane based ethanol during Lula's visit to Nicaragua. = The 2008 controversy: Global food prices = As a result of the international community's concerns regarding the steep increase in food prices, on April 14, 2008, Jean Ziegler, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, at the Thirtieth Regional Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Brasília, called biofuels a \\"crime against humanity\\", a claim he had previously made in October 2007, when he called for a 5-year ban for the conversion of land for the production of biofuels. The previous day, at their Annual International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group meeting at Washington, D.C., the World Bank's President, Robert Zoellick, stated that \\"While many worry about filling their gas tanks, many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs. And it's getting more and more difficult every day.\\" Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva gave a strong rebuttal, calling both claims \\"fallacies resulting from commercial interests\\", and putting the blame instead on U.S. and European agricultural subsidies, and a problem restricted to U.S. ethanol produced from maize. He also said that \\"biofuels aren't the villain that threatens food security\\". In the middle of this new wave of criticism, Hugo Chavez reaffirmed his opposition and said that he is concerned that \\"so much U.S.-produced corn could be used to make biofuel, instead of feeding the world's poor\\", calling the U.S. initiative to boost ethanol production during a world food crisis a \\"crime\\". German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the rise in food prices is due to poor agricultural policies and changing eating habits in developing nations, not biofuels as some critics claim. On the other hand, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for international action and said Britain had to be \\"selective\\" in supporting biofuels, and depending on the UK's assessment of biofuels' impact on world food prices, \\"we will also push for change in EU biofuels targets\\". Stavros Dimas, European Commissioner for the Environment said through a spokeswoman that \\"there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels\\", though he acknowledged that the EU had underestimated problems caused by biofuels. On April 29, 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush declared during a press conference that \\"85 percent of the world's food prices are caused by weather, increased demand and energy prices\\", and recognized that \\"15 percent has been caused by ethanol\\". He added that \\"the high price of gasoline is going to spur more investment in ethanol as an alternative to gasoline. And the truth of the matter is it's in our national interests that our farmers grow energy, as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us.\\" Regarding the effect of agricultural subsidies on rising food prices, Bush said that \\"Congress is considering a massive, bloated farm bill that would do little to solve the problem. The bill Congress is now considering would fail to eliminate subsidy payments to multi-millionaire farmers\\", he continued, \\"this is the right time to reform our nation's farm policies by reducing unnecessary subsidies\\". Just a week before this new wave of international controversy began, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had commented that several U.N. agencies were conducting a comprehensive review of the policy on biofuels, as the world food price crisis might trigger global instability. He said \\"We need to be concerned about the possibility of taking land or replacing arable land because of these biofuels\\", then he added \\"While I am very much conscious and aware of these problems, at the same time you need to constantly look at having creative sources of energy, including biofuels. Therefore, at this time, just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution. I would urge we need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner.\\" Regarding Jean Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban, the U.N. Secretary rejected that proposal. A report released by Oxfam in June 2008 Report available in pdf criticized biofuel policies of high-income countries as neither a solution to the climate crisis nor the oil crisis, while contributing to the food price crisis. The report concluded that from all biofuels available in the market, Brazilian sugarcane ethanol is not very effective, but it is the most favorable biofuel in the world in term of cost and greenhouse gas balance. The report discusses some existing problems and potential risks, and asks the Brazilian government for caution to avoid jeopardizing its environmental and social sustainability. The report also says that: \\"Rich countries spent up to $15 billion last year supporting biofuels while blocking cheaper Brazilian ethanol, which is far less damaging for global food security.\\" A World Bank research report published in July 2008 found that from June 2002 to June 2008 \\"biofuels and the related consequences of low grain stocks, large land use shifts, speculative activity and export bans\\" pushed prices up by 70 percent to 75 percent. The study found that higher oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise. The study said that \\"...large increases in biofuels production in the United States and Europe are the main reason behind the steep rise in global food prices\\" and also stated that \\"Brazil's sugar- based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher\\". The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) published a rebuttal based on the version leaked before its formal release. The RFA critique considers that the analysis is highly subjective and that the author \\"estimates the impact of global food prices from the weak dollar and the direct and indirect effect of high petroleum prices and attributes everything else to biofuels\\". An economic assessment by the OECD also published in July 2008 agrees with the World Bank report regarding the negative effects of subsidies and trade restrictions, but found that the impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller. The OECD study is also critical of the limited reduction of GHG emissions achieved from biofuels produced in Europe and North America, concluding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8 percent by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent compared to fossil fuels. The assessment calls on governments for more open markets in biofuels and feedstocks in order to improve efficiency and lower costs. The OECD study concluded that \\"...current biofuel support measures alone are estimated to increase average wheat prices by about 5 percent, maize by around 7 percent and vegetable oil by about 19 percent over the next 10 years.\\" Another World Bank research report published in July 2010 found their previous study may have overestimated the contribution of biofuel production, as the paper concluded that \\"the effect of biofuels on food prices has not been as large as originally thought, but that the use of commodities by financial investors (the so-called \\"financialization of commodities\\") may have been partly responsible for the 2007/08 spike\\".

He is serving life imprisonment for the murder of five women who worked as sex workers in Ipswich, Suffolk. The killings took place during the final months of 2006, and Wright was found guilty in February 2008. Early life Steve Wright was born in the Norfolk village of Erpingham, the second of four children of military policeman Conrad and veterinary nurse Patricia. He has an older brother and two younger sisters. While Wright's father was on military service, the family had lived in both Malta and Singapore. Wright's mother left in 1964 when he was 6; his father divorced his mother in 1978; both remarried. Wright and his siblings lived with their father, who fathered a son and a daughter with his second wife, Valerie. He left school in 1974, and soon afterwards joined the Merchant Navy, becoming a chef on ferries sailing from Felixstowe, Suffolk. In 1978, in Milford Haven, at the age of twenty, he married Angela O'Donovan. They had a son, Michael. The couple separated in 1987, and later divorced.O'Neil, S., He was rude and aggressive, but no-one's idea of a killer; The Times, London, 22 February 2008 Wright became a steward on the QE2, a lorry driver, a barman and, just prior to his arrest, a forklift truck driver. Former sex worker Lindi St Clair said she was attacked by Wright in the 1980s. His second marriage was to 32 year old Diane Cassell at Braintree register office in August 1987. They split in July 1988 while he was a pub landlord in Norwich. It was during this time that he also managed a public house in South London. This post was lost due to his gambling and heavy drinking. He was convicted in 2001 of theft, having stolen £80 to pay off his debts. This was his only criminal conviction prior to the murders. It is known that throughout these times Wright built up large debts largely through gambling, and had recently been declared bankrupt. Wright had twice tried to commit suicide, first by carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in 1994; secondly in 2000, by an overdose of pills. Suffolk murders Wright met Pamela Wright (no relation) in 2001 in Felixstowe, and they moved to the house in Ipswich together in 2004. Wright had always admitted that he used sex workers and had done so since he was in the Merchant Navy, and continually throughout his life. In Ipswich, he admitted he went to certain massage and sauna establishments that were actually brothels. Throughout his trial, he had stated that he had used professional sex workers on many occasions, including three of the victims and when his partner began working night shifts and their sex life became almost non-existent, he returned to using professional sex workers who were based on the nearby streets, procuring a dozen in the final three months of 2006. Between 30 October and 10 December 2006, Wright murdered five sex workers in Ipswich. Forensic evidence led to his arrest on 19 December. At the time of the murders, Wright was working as a forklift truck driver. He was found guilty of all five murders on 21 February 2008. On the following day, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, and the judge recommended that he should never be released. It was announced on 19 March 2008, that Wright was to appeal his convictions, but on 2 February 2009, it was announced that Wright had decided to drop this appeal case. Prostitutes nicknamed him \\"Mondeo Man\\" and \\"Silver-Backed Gorilla\\", because of his hair colour and stocky build. Tiny flecks of blood were found on the back seats of Steve Wright's Ford Mondeo, and partially matched the DNA profile of Paula Clennell. Possible links to other crimes Wright is still being investigated in connection with other unsolved murders and disappearances. He is one of a number of high-profile murderers or sex offenders to have been identified as possible suspects in the Suzy Lamplugh case; he had worked with Lamplugh on the QE2 ocean liner during the early 1980s. Lamplugh went missing in London in July 1986, and was legally declared dead in 1994, but her body has never been found. However, the Metropolitan Police have stated that this is not a strong line of enquiry. Cleveland Police have not ruled out a link between Wright and the murder of Vicky Glass, a heroin addict who vanished from Middlesbrough in September 2000, and whose naked body was later found in a brook on the North York Moors.\\"Motive still unknown as serial killer faces rest of life in prison\\", The Guardian, 22 February 2008. In June 2012, criminologist David Wilson suggested that the killer of Norwich prostitute Michelle Bettles may have been Wright, but his theory was dismissed by the police. Bettles was strangled in March 2002, and her body was found three days later in woodland.

It is very similar to computer-adaptive testing in that items are interactively selected for each examinee by the algorithm, but rather than selecting individual items, groups of items are selected, building the test in stages. These groups are called testlets or panels.Luecht, R. M. & Nungester, R. J. (1998). \\"Some practical examples of computer-adaptive sequential testing.\\" Journal of Educational Measurement, 35, 229-249. While multistage tests could theoretically be administered by a human, the extensive computations required (often using item response theory) mean that multistage tests are administered by computer. The number of stages or testlets can vary. If the testlets are relatively small, such as five items, ten or more could easily be used in a test. Some multistage tests are designed with the minimum of two stages (one stage would be a conventional fixed-form test).Castle, R.A.

Career Vega played several years and for various teams in the lower league Primera B Metropolitana and in 2007 he played for Platense in the Primera B Nacional, both in Argentina. In Platense, he was the top goal scorer with 13 goals. Subsequently, Vega joined Ecuadorian Emelec. He scored his first goal with Emelec on his debut on the Ecuadorian League against Macara. In that game he also made the assist in fellow striker Gonzalo Ludueña’s goal. . Personal life Vega is known to be a family oriented man. When he was signed by Ecuadorian side Emelec he arrived to Guayaquil with both his parents, his sister and his soon to be wife, Lorena. In December 2007 Vega received a degree as a Public Accountant and according to him, getting that degree was the main reason why he did not leave Argentina earlier despite of all the offers from abroad he has had in his career. Playing style Because he is not a tall or strong Center Forward, Vega plays better near the opposite goal and when it comes to finishing a play he has demonstrated to be as accurate with his left foot as he is with his natural right foot. He is also a very good header. References External links *Daniel A.

According to tradition, Palatias or Palatia was an aristocratic Roman woman who was converted to Christianity by her wet nurse or slave (in Italian) Laurentia. They were executed for being Christians at Fermo, in present-day Italy, during the reign of Diocletian. The account of their lives and martyrdom was preserved in an ancient manuscript from Ancona of uncertain date and another preserved by the Biblioteca Vallicelliana at Rome. The accounts contain many legendary details, containing tropes found in the vitai of other virgin saints, such as Saint Christina, Saint Barbara, and Saint Victoria. Mario Natalucci believes that it be may possible that the two saints were natives of Ancona who were martyred during the persecutions of Diocletian, and their relics carried to that city. Their cult was diffused in the Piceno, in places such as Fermo, Osimo, and Camerino, and in Ancona the name \\"Palazia\\" appears in ancient liturgical texts and statues of her appear from the 11th century onwards. A church and a monastery were built in their honor. Their relics were collected in one small bronze urn, of Berninian imitation, donated to Ancona Cathedral by Pope Benedict XIV, who had been bishop of that city. Guercino's La Santa Palazia is preserved in the Pinacoteca Civica Francesco Podesti, in Ancona.

On 16 March 1992 it was re-designated as the 189th Fighter Flight. The flight used 190th TFS/FS aircraft for its training mission. With the retirement of the F-4Gs in 1995, the status of the unit was changed from a flight to a squadron, and it received C-130E aircraft for operational missions. The 189th supported countless deployments all over the world in support of the U.S. Southern Command, Operation Allied Force, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Its only species is Aphandra natalia, sometimes called mastodon palm or fiber palm, and is used by indigenous peoples in the construction of brooms and other products.Riffle, Robert L. and Craft, Paul (2003) An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms. Portland: Timber Press. / (Page 250) This plant is commercially exploited for its edible fruits, and for its leaf sheath and petiole fibers. This fiber is almost equal to the fiber extracted from Attalea funifera and Leopoldinia piassaba, which is called piassava. The genus name is a combination of Ammandra and Phytelephas, two closely related palm genera, and the epithet \\"natalia\\" honors Natalie Uhl, modern palm taxonomist. Description Aphandra natalia grows from single trunks, reaching over 12 m in height, being gray to tan in color. These trees usually remain covered in the bases of old leaves giving them a seeming trunk diameter of nearly 1 meter, however the actual trunk size when cleaned of the leaf bases is nearer to 30 cm. The vine-like, pendent fibers of the leaf bases resemble those of Leopoldinia piassaba from which brooms are also made. The actual leaves of A. natalia are usually 4.5 m in length but are borne on long, 2.5 m petioles giving them an overall length of 7 m. The leaflets are reduplicate, pinnately cleft and dark green in color.Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) Genera Palmarum - A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E. Moore.

The books told the stories of a little girl named Celia living in Spain during the 1930s. In this second book, Celia was sent to a convent, for her parents found her a handful, and facing numerous financial problems at home, they had trouble looking after Celia and keeping her out of mischief. The books were largely popular in the years following their publication, and were enjoyed by both children and adults. Celia's many adventures and misadventures, as well as her mischievous character appealed to children, while at the same time, older readers were able to pick up references to a changing and growing nation hidden behind Celia's childlike fantasy world. Most prints of the first books featured a large variety of black and white illustrations by Molina Gallent, some of which were later featured in the opening credits of the TV-series from Televisión Española.

In 1992, Spanish film director José Luis Borau adapted the series into a six-episode TV series simply entitled Celia.The Feminist Encyclopedia of Spanish Literature: N-Z, Janet Perez, Greenwood Publishing, 2002, page 572 In it, child actress Cristina Cruz Mínguez played the title role of Celia, while Ana Duato (Médico de familia, 1995) and Pedro Díez del Corral played her parents. The series, like the books, found great success originally, but eventually that success faded and today the series is not very well known. \\"En el colegio\\" was the title of the fourth episode in the series and the first to be adapted from the second book, Celia en el colegio.  Plot summary  A sequel to Celia, lo que dice (1929), the story narrates Celia's adventures following her father's decision to give in to her mother's wishes of sending their daughter to a convent school for girls. At the school, Celia has many difficulties adapting to the strict rules of the nuns and is often reprimanded by Madre Loreto, whom Celia describes as \\"very strict and scolds much\\". During her first days there, Celia is convinced that her father is not at all happy with the change and that he greatly misses his little girl, thus Celia tries to get herself expelled from the school by trying to make the nuns believe she suffers from a sleepwalking problem. Celia is unsuccessful, but she soon learns that though her father misses her, he is willing to allow her to stay at the school, which is good for Celia, who actually enjoys her new home. Celia is the favorite among many of her classmates, but she does have many quarrels with a few other girls who find her behaviour disruptive and inappropriate. Madre Isolina, an English nun Celia describes as \\"very intelligent and understanding\\" is Celia's favorite nun at the school because she sometimes helps her out of mischief. Celia tries desperately to be good, she even wishes to become a saint. The priest, Don Restituto, tries to guide Celia, but when the girl starts creating more trouble than usual in her attempt to become a saint, or at least a martyr, he gives up on her and forbids her from being either. Following the end of the term, the other girls leave the convent, but Celia is left there with the nuns since her parents have left the country hoping to find a better job elsewhere and earn money to stabilize themselves economically. Doña Benita, the old lady that had looked after the girl for some time before, comes to the school and takes Celia with her for some time. During those days, Celia and the old woman visit a circus, and from there Celia imagines all sorts of tales following her imaginary escape with the gypsies (tales she narrates in Celia, novelista). In the summer, en elderly woman, Doña Remedios, who is soon mocked and renamed Doña Merlucines by Celia and some of the nuns and workers at the school, arrives and she and Celia become fast enemies. Doña Remedios, who is very kind to Celia at first, is soon irritated by the girl's wild ways and wishes she had more discipline. After many quarrels between the two, Celia gets her revenge by filling the sleeping Doña Remedios' bed with cockroaches. Another schooling term begins and Celia's popularity with the other girl students begins to largely decrease. One day, an angry Tío Rodrigo, Celia's uncle, arrives at the school and demands to be allowed to take his niece away with him to her parents who currently reside in Paris. The book is told in first-person narrative from Celia's perspective, following a brief introduction in third person from the author's.  Adaptations  Celia en el colegio was adapted as part of Televisión Española's 1992 TV-series directed by José Luis Borau, Celia.Celia at the Internet Movie Database The series was a faithful adaptation of many events from the book and it often relied on very similar, if not exact, dialogue. The adapting of Celia en el colegio spanned three episodes: IV. \\"En el colegio\\", V. \\"Ni santa, ni mártir\\" and VI. \\"¡Hasta la vista!\\". Many scenes were removed and absent from the series; one example of this is a part in the novel involving Celia being punished to spend some time up in Madre Florinda's chamber, when Celia, believing the nun to have died gives her belongings to a group of homeless boys and girls. Though the entire part was not touched in the series, the character of Madre Florinda, who can be seen supported by a crutch, was included briefly in the series, if only with a few minor appearances as an extra and just one single line. Only five of the nuns were referred to by name in the series: Madre Loreto, Madre Bibiana, Madre Corazón, Madre Isolina and the Madre Superiora (the Mother Superior), all of whom appeared in the novel. Certain scenes and incidents from the novel involving the nuns were \\"traded\\" around. For example, in the novel, Madre Mercedes is the one responsible for teaching sewing to the girls, while in the series, it was Madre Bibiana who had that task and whom failed at teaching Celia how to sew properly. Another example, in the novel, Madre Consuelo had the ingenious idea of having the girls learn only the answers to the questions they would each be asked in the final examination given by the Madre Superiora, which turned out a complete disaster. In the series however, it was Madre Loreto who had the idea and who was embarrassed by Celia's explaining of the situation. The same with Celia's classmates; only Elguibia, whom differenced from the others due to her slight case of mental retardation, was given a consistent name. The other girl actresses played Celia's friends from the novel inconsistently and were never given real names, at least they were not mentioned. Celia and her father part in the last episode of Celia, \\"¡Hasta la vista!\\". The scene, which did not feature in Elena Fortún's novels, was designed to emphasize a further dramatic touch in Celia's story. The scene effectively used a recurring piece of the original soundtrack for its purpose. Other events were altered from the novel in order to give the series a more dramatic appeal. For example, in the novel, Celia does not have a good time during the end-of-the-year plays as she is excluded from participating. However, in the series Celia does have a part in the play; shortly before her performance, Doña Benita feels the need to tell Celia the truth about how her parents had closed down their house in Madrid. How they, together with Celia's brother \\"Cuchifritín\\" would leave \\"for China\\" and how she would spend the summer with the nuns instead of going to the beach with her parents. Celia, heartbroken with the news, cleverly alters her rhyming lines in the play in order to announce to the entire audience how her parents were leaving for China and leaving her behind. Then, Celia grabs the box of chocolates her father had brought for her and runs in tears to the school's vegetable gardens where she hides and cries telling Culiculá, her pet stork, about all her sorrows. Later in the series, it is Celia's father, rather than Doña Benita, who comes to take her to a small circus visiting the town. When returning home, Celia's father presents her with a small gift, a writing book in which he encourages her to write down all sorts of stories. He leaves her again under the care of Madre Loreto, and the man is startled and disappointed that Celia would walk away so happily without even saying goodbye. Celia turns around, her face flooded in tears, and tells her father that she wants to leave with him and be reunited with her family. Her father tells her that it cannot be, and the girl answers by saying that she will become a performer and travel to China, where she is convinced her parents are going, and the two part feeling very sad. Madre Loreto then tucks Celia in her bed and wishes her good night. Celia pulls out her book and begins writing a story about how she ran away with the gypsies hoping to find her parents on their way to China. Celia's story is told visually in the series, and when she, together with Culiculá the stork, catch up with her gypsy friend Coralinda and her travelling wagon, she convinces the gypsy girl's father to allow her to travel with them. In the back of the wagon, Celia asks Coralinda whether they are travelling to Pekin in China. Being answered in the affirmative, Celia replies, \\"Es que tengo que encontrar a mis papás\\", (\\"It's just that I have to find my parents\\"), where the series ends, left incomplete. Recurring tracks from the series' original soundtrack were also added to emphasize the dramatic seriousness of Celia's situation. In the novels, these events were not nearly as dramatic, and Celia had an easier time dealing with her parents leaving her behind.

Katz (born May 7, 1960) is an American educator, filmmaker, and author. He has created a gender violence prevention and education program entitled Mentors in Violence Prevention, which is used by U.S. military and various sporting organizations. Katz's work centers on violence, media, and masculinities, with an added focus on media literacy. He has made several documentaries on the representation of men and women in media. Background Katz is a former high school football player from Swampscott, Massachusetts. The first man to minor in women's studies at the University of Massachusetts- Amherst, Katz holds a master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and a Ph.D. in cultural studies and education from UCLA, where he studied with Douglas Kellner. He has collaborated with Jean Kilbourne, Sut Jhally, and Byron Hurt. Work From 1988 to 1998, Katz oversaw Real Men, a grass-roots organization against sexism in Boston. Katz co-founded Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) in 1993 at Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society.Mentors in Violence Prevention MVP has been implemented by college athletic programs, professional teams (including the New England Patriots and Boston Red Sox), NASCAR, and the United States Marine Corps.

Katz and his colleagues have also conducted trainings for the U.S. Army in Iraq, and MVP has been piloted around the world by the U.S. Navy. JacksonKatz.com Key ideas =Bystander approach= Katz advocates the bystander approach to gender violence and bullying prevention. Instead of focusing on women as victims and men as perpetrators of harassment, abuse or violence, the bystander approach concentrates on the role of peers in schools, groups, teams, workplaces and other social units. In 2009, after an alleged gang rape in Richmond, California where two dozen teenagers watched and did nothing, Newsweek online reported that, \\"a small but growing group of educators is trying to bring what's called 'bystander education' to American schools. While sexual violence prevention programs have typically focused on the victim (discouraging women from walking alone at night, for example) or the perpetrator (reiterating the fact that no means no), the bystander approach emphasizes the role witnesses can play in either supporting or challenging violence.\\" Katz and his colleagues developed one of the first bystander initiatives, the mixed-gender Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) program, in 1993 at Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society. “Most people think they only have two choices for intervention,” says Katz. “One is to intervene physically right at the point of attack, and the other is to do nothing. And that’s a false set of choices.” As part of the MVP program, students sit in a classroom and talk about the menu of options—from getting a group of friends together to calling 911—available to them. At the heart of the program is a set of scenarios that allow students to imagine what they might do in a variety of situations. Each scenario comes with a list of viable interventions for bystanders. According to Newsweek, research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of bystander-awareness programs in schools, but the initial results are promising. One study found that after the Sioux City School District in Iowa implemented the MVP program, the number of freshman boys who said they could help prevent violence against women and girls increased by 50 percent. The bystander programs that have proliferated in recent years on college and high school campuses and in the U.S. military involve both sexes and draw from various violence prevention theories and educational practices. The MVP model was influenced by basic tenets of social justice education. This approach is partly based on the premise that men's silence in the face of other men's abusive or violent behavior gives \\"implicit consent\\" to such behavior. The MVP bystander approach frames men's abuse of women as a societal problem whose roots lie in the institutional structures and cultural practices of a male-dominated society. [24] Thus, the MVP approach emphasizes changing social norms as the key to prevention. By challenging men to speak up and “[change] group dynamics in male peer culture,”this bystander model empowers men to step outside of the victim/perpetrator binary and gives men an opportunity to talk about some of the “dynamics of their interpersonal and group interaction in a safe space.” Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) Model Jackson Katz presented the Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) model hoping to put the focus on men to discontinue trends of violent masculinity through creating a model that would invite men into the critical dialogue, instead of painting them as perpetrators or potential perpetrators.Katz, Jackson, H. Alan Heisterkamp, and Wm. Michael Fleming. \\"The Social Justice Roots of the Mentors in Violence Prevention Model and Its Application in a High School Setting.\\" Violence Against Women 17.6 (2011): 684-686. Katz realized that there was a frustrating lack of inclusion of men and boys in the gender violence discussion, prompting him to create an education model that was inclusive to men and boys. The original MVP model was created as workshops for all-male student athletes; Katz hoped that by working with male student athletes, they could help to stop the spread of ‘rape-supportive’ and ‘battering-supportive’ attitudes by speaking out against the masculine binary that supports gender violence. (Recon, 166) Katz says his initial focus on working with student-athletes stems from the “apathy, defensiveness—and sometimes outright hostility—of male athletic directors, coaches, and student-athletes...men and young men in the…athletic subculture…typically occupy a privileged position in school culture, and particularly in male peer culture.” Katz, Jackson. \\"MVP Strategies.\\" MVP Strategies. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2013. . This is a step towards the bystander approach. By working with boys who typically represented the popular part of school culture, Katz was hoping that these boys would then influence the people around them and in their schools in similar manners. It was important for Katz to ensure that MVP considers male student-athletes as potential mentors for younger kids, able of providing male leadership necessary to stop gender abuse.Katz, Jackson. \\"Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project.\\" Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 166. Katz's model generally revolves around simulation and role-playing, as well as large discussion-based group meetings both consisting same-sex and different-sex students. As a part of his college initiative, his MVP model involves “holding three 90-minute sessions each year with each participating college team. A fourth session is scheduled for those student-athletes who wish to be trained further for work with younger students in middle and high school.” Katz, Jackson. \\"Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project.\\" Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 167. These workshops are designed to provide spaces for boys to discuss with each other the concept of masculinity and its definition, as well as its relation to gender abuse and violence. Additionally, Katz recognizes the role of those in positions of authority in schools and athletic teams. As his program has grown and evolved, he has included training of selected male and professional staff working in all sectors of schools and colleges.Katz, Jackson. \\"Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project.\\" Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 170.) In this, he is hoping that the top-down approach will provide role models for young and impressionable students and athletes who are looking for good representation. If these school leaders are able to use their positions of authority as positions of good influence, it will perhaps encourage a change in paradigm that will affect all of those in the school or community. The MVP model originally focused on just male student-athletes. Since, the MVP model has expanded its target audience and educational group to “boys and girls, men and women, working together and in single-sex formats…by the mid-1990s MVP had moved from a near-exclusive focus on the athletic world to general populations of high school and college students, and other institutional settings.” This expansion means that the dialogue around gender abuse and gender binaries is spreading throughout schools across the nation. More frank and honest talk about gender abuse will not only remove many of the stigmas from those who are abused, but will also encourage students to act out and speak out in defense of themselves and each other. =Media literacy and masculinities= In his writings, public lectures, and films, Katz argues that gendered understandings and behavior in every arena from interpersonal relationships to the workplace and even politics are influenced by media and popular culture. Focusing on normative portrayals of men in advertising, television, Hollywood films, the entertainment industries, sports, and politics, Katz calls for an examination of \\"the poses we strike and the images of masculinity that proliferate in media culture\\" as a way to \\"illuminate... what's going on in individual men's lives, and in our culture as a whole.\\" Katz further maintains that in spite of variability due to such categories as class, race and ethnicity, \\"violence in America is overwhelmingly a gendered phenomenon,\\" shaped by \\"cultural codes and ideals of masculinity and manhood.\\" He argues that \\"masculinity\\" and \\"femininity\\" are socially constructed categories, and thus the \\"disturbing equation of masculinity with pathological control and violence\\" that currently exists in America is not genetically predetermined and can be changed. In the \\"Tough Guise\\" study guide, co-written with the video producer Jeremy Earp of the Media Education Foundation, Katz underscores his motivation for promoting media literacy: \\"By looking critically at how institutions – from media outlets to political institutions to our schools – often play a role in reinforcing constricted, regressive notions of manhood that maintain an unacceptably violent status quo, we might begin to clear some space for individuals, male and female, to live freer lives.\\" =Presidential masculinities= Katz's work on images of masculinity in media extends to his examination of \\"a crucial but barely explored topic of cultural studies analysis: the role of media culture in the construction of presidential masculinity.\\" Katz posits that \\"media have become the single most important source of political information and persuasion,\\" and that \\"education for democracy in this era requires citizens to be media literate.\\" According to Katz, part of being politically media literate means understanding how gender functions as a sub-textual force in presidential politics. He asks questions such as \\"how does the perceived 'manliness' or 'toughness' of political candidates affect their electoral success? To what degree is the gender gap in presidential politics affected by men's gendered identities and sense of themselves as men, which itself is reinforced by media discourses and portrayals? How does paid political advertising on television – by far the biggest expenditure of funds in presidential campaigns – shape voters' perceptions of the relative 'manliness' of candidates? What are the similarities and differences between how women and men ascertain whether male political figures measure up to the 'masculine ideal' that is circulating in media culture at a given historical moment? Which mediated (white) masculine styles or archetypes have been politically successful over the past fifty years, and why?\\" In an article about the Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, Katz responded to pundits and other political observers who decried the media focus on race and gender when other crucial issues loomed. \\"Presidential elections are always about race and gender. The reason people are talking about them now is that a black man and a (white) woman are serious contenders for a major party nomination. Their success is making visible what historically has been hidden in plain sight.\\" \\"Campaigns for the U.S. presidency in the era of mass media,\\" he wrote, \\"always turn on the personality and style of candidates, their skills at televisual performance, their race and gender, and how all of these interact with questions of national identity at a given historical moment. The biggest difference this time is that the Democratic nominee will not embody and hence reinforce the dominant position of white masculinity in the race/gender system.\\" Katz further maintained that, \\"Presidential contests until now have been contests between men. Men were the gender that mattered. No matter how qualified by intelligence, leadership ability or experience, women were not seriously considered for the top job in government, and everyone knew it. Their gender prevented people from seeing them as 'presidential.' If there is one thing that truly represents 'change' in this historic election season it is the change in what it means to appear 'presidential.' In the past, whether a candidate was a Republican or Democrat, conservative, centrist or liberal, their race and gender were predetermined. They were inevitably – and invariably – white and a man.” For Katz, violence also plays an important role in shaping political discourse and in the voters' choice of whom to support for president. \\"How much of the white male vote is determined by impressions about the relative 'manliness' or 'toughness' of candidates or political parties hasn’t been quantified,\\" Katz writes. \\"But there is no doubt that for several decades violence—both our individual and collective vulnerability to it, and questions about when and how to use the violent power of the state to protect the 'national interest' — has been an ominous and omnipresent factor in numerous foreign policy and domestic political issues (e.g. the Cold War, Vietnam, the 'War on Terror,' and the invasion of Iraq, as well as gun control, and executive, legislative and judicial responses to violent crime).\\" In several articles, Katz analyzes and comments on \\"the pervasive use of sports metaphors in presidential discourse and how the language of sport functions to construct a masculine ideal for leadership at the heights of political power.\\" He points out that \\"the two most 'metaphorically influential' sports in presidential campaign rhetoric are boxing and football... not coincidentally, both are violent sports that attract a disproportionate percentage of male participants and fans.\\" \\"The frequent use of boxing and football metaphors in political discourse did not cause violence to become an important force in our politics, but this usage is one measure of how presidential campaigns in the mass media era are less about policy differences and complex political agendas than they are about the selling of a certain kind of executive masculinity, embodied until the historic 2008 election in a particular white man whom the public comes to know largely through television and other technologies of mass communication.\\" Katz also comments on implications for female candidates. He writes, \\"One of 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin's most-quoted lines on the campaign trail in the fall of 2008 was 'The heels are on, the gloves are off,' which she typically delivered to wild cheers of approval. In coming years, when this historic campaign and those yet to come are analyzed, it will be particularly interesting to see how female and male voters respond to language where a woman throws the 'knockout punch.' Does this masculinize and thus help to make them more credible as potential commanders-in-chief? Or do women who are seen as 'too-aggressive' – even if only in a metaphorical sense – turn voters off? What are the differences between how the sexes view a woman 'throwing punches' if she's a conservative (like Palin) or a liberal feminist (like Hillary Clinton?).\\" Documentaries Katz is the creator of educational videos for high school and college students produced and distributed through the Media Education Foundation: * Tough Guise: Men, Violence and the Crisis in MasculinityTough Guise: Men, Violence and the Crisis in Masculinity (trailer) (1999) (with Sut Jhally).

It was first published in 1956 as part of the collection Vesna v Fialte. After its translation into English by the author and his son it was first published in Esquire in 1971 and then in the collection A Russian Beauty and Other Stories in 1971.  Plot summary  The Russian émigré writer Ilya Borisovich Tal is struggling with his love story Lips to Lips about an elderly man and a young woman. He gets advice from his friend Euphratski who suggests to send \\"your thing\\" as a serial to Arion, an émigré magazine. The editor lavishes Tal with praise and indicates they \\"would have been\\" happy to publish it. Euphratski explains that some money needs to be supplied to support further publications of the magazine, and Tal obliges. The first chapter gets published as a \\"prologue to a novel\\" under the pen name \\"A. Ilyin\\" although Tal had requested the pen name \\"I(lya) Annenski\\" (not being aware that Annensky was a famous Russian writer). Nevertheless, he is extremely proud and happy about his success, although behind his back, people snicker. When he has a chance to meet the editor, he overhears a conversation where the editor defends accepting the article; it is of \\"hopeless mediocrity\\" and was only accepted because of the money. Tal is shattered at first, but recovers in the hope that he might publish more, and will be \\"fully recognized after his death\\".  Comments  In an ironical twist Nabobov's satire about the trials of the émigré writer was - while accepted for publication in 1931 or 32 - not printed at that time because the magazine went out of business. Thus, it had to wait a quarter century for its appearance. Nabokov remarked that by then everybody who might have resembled anybody in the story was \\"safely and heirlessly dead\\".

The squadron also engaged in counter-air patrols, fighter sweeps, and strafing and dive-bombing missions. Attacked such targets as airdromes, marshalling yards, missile sites, industrial areas, ordnance depots, oil refineries, trains, and highways. During its operations, the unit participated in the assault against the Luftwaffe and aircraft industry during the Big Week, 20–25 February 1944, and the attack on transportation facilities prior to the Normandy invasion and support of the invasion forces thereafter, including the Saint-Lô breakthrough in July.

It is dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The construction is dated between years 1488 and 1491 and the church was consecrated in 1500. Fifty years later it was promoted to the status of a parish church. The year 1491 is stated also as the year when the church was established. Older resources indicate that the construction began in 1443 or 1444, what corresponds to time, when citizens of Banska Stiavnica moved to the area of nowadays town, after the old town was destroyed. From 1580 to 1675, during the period of the Reformation, it belonged to the Lutheran church. In 1658 mass began to be preached in Slovak language, that is why it is called \\"the Slovak church“.  Investors  Wealthy families of mining entrepreneurs, owners of the houses located on the main St. Trinity Square were the most probable investors of the St. Catherinas' church.  Position  The church is located on the quite steep slope of the brink on the lower part of the St. Trinity Square at the intersection of the main roads of Banska Stiavnica. It is North-West – South-East oriented. It has a dominant location directly in the city center, at the crossroads of two most significant medieval roads - nowadays there is a conjunction of Holy Trinity Square and Andrej Kmet street.  Disposition  The church is a Late Gothic single nave space. The polygonal chapel is merging with the aisle and western chorus. Characteristic Late Gothic buttress pillars incorporate inside the composition. Between the pillars, on the northern side of the nave, are embedded three Gothic chapels. From the main space, next to the presbytery, exite a sacristy. Storeyed space in the South-Western corner of the nave was in the lower part also used as a chapel. Upstairs it extends chorus itself, allowing access directly from the outside. It has barrel vaults ended with lunettes. Beneath the church, there is a crypt, where majors and important burgesses where buried. An original entrance portal is located on the western facade of the church. In the upper corners are figural cantilevers. There is a painted town blazon above the portal with the year 1555 (when the church was turned into parish). In the last quarter of the 18th century the Baroque chapel of St. John of Nepomucene was added to the church. Its pastel violet colour sets the chapel off like a little jewel against the monumental grey walls of the church. File:Pôdorys sv. Katarína BŠ.jpg|Floor plan of St. Catherina's Church File:Rez sv. Katarína BŠ.jpg|Section of St. Catherina's Church  Interior  The nave is fully covered by the star-shaped vaults. These grid vaults extend to figural cantilevers in the main space. It is very similar to the nave vault of the St. Cross church in Kezmarok. Due to this similarity and the similarity of interior figural decoration it is assumed, that the same masons worked on both of the churches. Side chapels are opened into the nave by pointed arches and are vaulted by mainly star-shaped grid vaults. File:Interier sv. Katarína BŠ3.jpg|Net vault of St. Catherina's Church File:Interier sv.

Finely worked out details of portals, figural cantilevers and especially rich decorated baptistery. In the main frontage, there are three high windows filled with stained glass. The lower part is aligned with a half 3-pointed leaf tracery. Windows in the chapels are filled with colourful stained glass traceries. The lower part is separated into 4 sections filled with stained glass with Christian scenes. Merging with the upper part of the window, we can see the 3-pointed half leafed tracery. In the middle there is a 4-pointed leaf tracery with the flame traceries by the sides. Some parts of the windows are dated to year 1894 and the colourful stained glass from the chapels from year 1907. File:Interier sv. Katarína BŠ4.jpg|Side chapels of St. Catherina's Church File:Banská Štiavnica Kostol sv Kataríny 01.jpg|Windows of St. Catherina's Church  Exterior  The present-day facades have been reconstructed according to their original appearance. From exterior, the church has clearly recognizable Late Gothic elements. Bearing system stands out from the nave by the 6 bear retreat pillars on each side. The single chapels have been built between these pillars. Facades are partly made from stone and partly covered with plaster. The roof was covered with copper sheet in year 1656.

Kataríny, Banská Štiavnica - pohľad od námestia.JPG|Exterior of St. Catherina's Church = Inventory = From the original Gothic inventory a valuable rich decorated stone baptistery from the 16th century and a cross from the 15th century were maintained. The statue of Mary, that has been preserved until today, is very valuable wooden statue from year 1506 that comes from the original main altar. The wall painting depicting the Last Judgement located on the South wall of the presbytery is the most precious part of this church. It is a combination of two different painting techniques: a fresco painting and a painting \\"a la secco\\". The scene begins in the vault where the Christ is displayed as the Savior of the world. In the space defined by the vault ribs, the appearance of the Christ repeats, here he is sitting on the rainbow with legs laid on the globe. Next to him there is Virgin Mary and St. John Evangelist painted. Below them, there is a crowd of standing and sitting people next to each other. It anticipates to be 12 apostles but since the painting is in a bad state, it is not possible to define the persons specifically. Under the painting the sorting of the souls is shown with the main character of Archangel Michael who is fighting against the Devil. On the left side, there are saviored people walking towards the Heaven gates, accompanied by an angelic chorus. On the right side, a crowd of people driven by devils, walking most likely into the Leviatan stomach is shown. Devils carry the flags with the pictures of animals representing the seven deadly sins. The painting was discovered during the last reconstruction of the church in years 1971-1973. It is assumed, that originally it also covered the other walls. It is the largest of its type in Slovakia. The church's original furnishing has changed in the 18th century. The main, the columned altar of St. Catherine from year 1727 (and restored in 1887) has been preserved from the original seven Baroque altars installed at that time. Along with the altar, the painting of St. Catherine's betrothal with Christ has been preserved until today, which is attributed to painter J.G. Grossmayr. The altar paintings were originally changed according to the liturgic periods of the year. By the side of cantilevers we can find statues of St. Barbara and St. Margita.

This division also supervises dubbings for Disney theme parks and derived games. An office of the division is present in several countries around the world.  History  Headquarters of DCVI at the old Animation Building at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California The first dubbing issued for a Disney movie was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, supervised by Walt Disney himself. The movie was originally distributed in 1938 in 10 languages: Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin American Spanish, Polish and Swedish. Disney expressed his appreciation for this latter dubbing, revealing to Tatiana Angelini, Swedish voice of Snow White, she was his personal favorite international voice for the character. Despite the fascist regime ruling Italy at the time, the movie premiered at the 6th Venice International Film Festival, winning the Grand Art Trophy special award. Otherwise happened with the German version, for which the Walt Disney Company and Nazi Germany couldn’t find an agreement, so the German dubbing meant to be distributed in Austria and German-speaking Switzerland was made in Amsterdam, voiced by German refugees fled from their country. The real turning point for Disney dubbings occurred in the 40s, especially with the movie Fantasia, when Jimmy Johnson named Jack Cutting, Disney animator since 1930, responsible for the dubbing of Disney movies mainly in Danish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. In 1948, Disney received a Special Achievement Award at the 5th Golden Globe Awards for succeeding in producing a Hindustani dubbing of Bambi right after the end of the Indian independence movement, for \\"furthering the (American) influence of the screen\\". While Bambi was the first movie to be dubbed in Hindustani, it is unknown whether more movies followed, or if the next dubbings produced by Disney India had to wait for Aladdin to be released in 1994 in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. The DCVI affiliate branch itself was founded in January 1988, while Michael Eisner was in Paris for preparations to build Disneyland Paris (known at the time as Euro Disney Resort). On that occasion, he got to listen to the French dubbing of the series The Golden Girls and discovered several flaws and mistakes both in the translation and the dubbing. This realization, combined with Roy Disney’s disappointment with the French voice of Mickey Mouse, led Eisner to set up a dubbing department, directed by Roy Disney.  Cast selection  Phil Collins was selected to sing songs from the soundtrack of Tarzan also in French, German, Italian and Spanish for marketing reasons. To keep the whole production under control, Disney has established a centralized system that allows to gather on the same platform auditions by actors all over the world, which gained the Walt Disney Company the 2017 Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards. Rick Dempsey, Senior Vice President of DCVI, said that the decision process to cast voices for Disney products works so that he specifically makes the decision on the cast from countries that make the top 14 percent of the box office, which sets the blueprint of the character’s voice with the director of the particular language hub. Local offices placed in countries whose voices are directly selected by DCVI will have competence over a specific geographical area, and they will cast the rest of the region in comparison to the selected voices. According to Dempsey, the voices do not have to be identical to the original English voices, but they must rather match the character, letting them shine through. Especially since 00s, local celebrities can sometimes be chosen for their appeal to their respective market more than their ability to match or accentuate the character, to make the movie more appealing to the specific audience.  Languages  Disney movies are usually released in theaters in a set of languages, which varies depending on the product. Most languages covered by DCVI are fixed and all Disney animated movies are systematically dubbed and distributed in these idioms. However, there are languages covered by the departement on an irregular base, which varies depending on the movie. = Dubbings systematically released = Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, first Disney animated movie to be distributed to other markets, was originally dubbed into 10 languages, besides English. Over the years, the set of languages covered by DCVI has expanded, with a typical animated tentpole being nowadays distributed in theaters in 39 to 43 territories, an average live- action movie numbering 12 to 15 languages, and a four-quadrant live-action film like Pirates of the Caribbean being dubbed into about 27 tongues. The number of languages involved in the dubbing process varies in accordance with the kind of product, with animation movies covering the largest number, and it has expanded throughout the years. = Dubbings irregularly or occasionally released = Some languages are usually released on an irregular base, which sees dubbings in the same language being issued sometimes together with the rest of systematic dubbings, and some other times at a later date, usually not for theaters, but directly on TV or streaming services. That's the case with Malay, Indonesian, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. For instance, when the movie Frozen was released in 2013, it numbered a Malay dubbing among the 42 originally issued, while a Hindi and an Indonesian versions were released only two years later. When the sequel had its theatrical release in 2019, a Hindi, Tamil and Telugu versions were made, while an Indonesian dubbing was released one year later, with the launch of Disney+ in Indonesia, but no Malay version exists yet. Some other languages number only one or few dubbings, due to attempts to expand the market to new languages, like in the case of Austrian German, Bengali or Marathi dubbings. Finally, there's a group of one-time special dubbing languages, usually dedicated to the culture who served as a source of inspiration for the movie. The first instance of such a case was The Lion King, which received a special Zulu dubbing. The next case had to wait until the movie Moana was released in 2016, which received a total of three special dubbings in Polynesian languages in the space of two years from its original release date. Following upon the success of these three productions, a special Northern Sami dubbing was also made for the movie Frozen II, while no dubbing in this language was made for the first chapter of the series. A peculiar case in one-time dubbings was the Navajo version of Finding Nemo released in 2016, in collaboration with the Navajo Nation Museum. Differently from the rest of special dubbings, the movie is not linked in any way to the Navajo culture, and yet it was chosen as a means to preserve Navajo language, teaching it to kids through a popular Disney movie.

State - 80% Special education In December 2011, the Western Wayne School District administration reported that 355 pupils or 15.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 49.9% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the District administration reported that 324 pupils or 14.3% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 51.2% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2011, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.United States Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Western Wayne School District received a $1,153,996 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the State provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= Western Wayne School District Administration reported that 71 or 3.09% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy Western Wayne School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006.Western Wayne School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, 2006 The District has limited classroom parties in terms of number of times and kinds of foods that can be provided. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Western Wayne School District offers both a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children, in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2012, Western Wayne School Board voted unanimously to sell the vacant Hamlin Elementary School Building to VSG Real Estate LLC for the consideration of $750,000.Western Wayne School Board, Board meeting minutes, April 2, 2012 In 2011, the average teacher salary in Western Wayne School District was $61,303.40 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $20,944.29 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $82,247.69.

Western Wayne School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $722.27 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 The Pennsylvania School Boards Association collects and maintains statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007-08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. According to PSBA, the median Superintendent salary rose to over $130,000 in 2011. Per pupil spending In 2008, the Western Wayne School District administration reported that per pupil spending was $13,651 which ranked 126th among Pennsylvania's then 501 school districts. In 2010, the per pupil spending had increased to $15,430.55 ranking 115th in Pennsylvania. Among the 50 states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year 2000-01. Reserves In 2008, Western Wayne School District reported a balance of $1,178,555 in its unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $2,749,962.

By 2012, Western Wayne School District reported $4,558,726 in reserves. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. By law the state limits the total unreserved-undesignated fund balance at 8% of the annual budget for school districts that have budgets over $19 million a year. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, Centre Daily Times, September 22, 2010 By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion. Audit In December 2012, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the District. The findings were reported to the Western Wayne School Board and the District's administration. Tuition Students who live in the District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Western Wayne School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $9,540.85, High School - $10,233.43. Western Wayne School District is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the District. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. =State basic education funding= For the 2012-13 school year, the Western Wayne School District received $4,678,253. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012-2013 included $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which was an increase of $49 million over the 2011-12 budget.

Race to the Top grant Western Wayne School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided nearly one million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2013-14 were set by the Western Wayne School Board at 14.915 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2012-13 - 14.6659 mills. *2011-12 - 14.4208 mills. *2010-11 - 14.3157 mills. *2009-10 - 13.8450 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 13.8450 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 13.1670 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 12.5169 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 12.5170 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Wayne County residents amounts to about 3.78% of their yearly income. Wayne County ranked 287th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009 Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each public school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum at an election or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district's Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 or 2006 included 10 exceptions: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For the exception for pension costs, 89 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. Eleven districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2013-2014, April 2013 For the 2012-13 budget year, Western Wayne School Board also did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the Western Wayne School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Western Wayne School Board has the option of adopting either: 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Property tax relief In 2012, Western Wayne School District approved homestead residents received $196 for 4,462 approved homesteads/farmsteads. The amount of property tax relief each public school district receives is announced by the PDE in May each year. It is dependent on the amount of tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Western Wayne School District was also $200 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,384 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Wayne County, the highest tax relief went to Wayne Highlands School District which was set at $209.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2009. The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Wayne County, just 23.45% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. This was among the lowest participation rates in Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, 2-23-2010.

Aurélio Miguel then won the Paulista tournament many times, and by the year 1980, he was recognized as the best judoka in the state. Afterwards, Miguel started to compete internationally, winning the silver medal at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He won the gold medal in the 1987 Pan American Games, again fighting in the under 95 kg category. In 1987 he also won a bronze medal at the World Judo Championships.

Trompies' influences  Kwaito groups such as Trompies routinely rap vernacular forms of the major indigenous languages, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, and Zulu. Their use of the vernacular is a conscious attempt to address the social, political, and economic issues that impact marginalized communities in ways that hold particular meaning for them. Language is critical for not only celebrating the uniqueness and legitimacy of local communities, but also for maintaining ties between artists and their audiences.Magubane, Zine. \\"Globalization and Gangster Rap: Hip Hop in the Post-Apartheid City.\\" In The Vinyl Ain’t Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J.

Among the concerns regarding kwaito that Mthethwa has expressed are that \\"kwaito (is) not being fully supported by the government\\" of South Africa, that \\"kwaito artists are being treated unfairly\\" by the recording industry of South Africa, and that the artists have to pay large taxes even when they work without a basic salary.Ratshilumela, Phathu. \\"Eugene Mthethwa: The Visionary\\".

Before its dissolution a decade later, the Council provided both the first national arena for discussion of critical issues for African Americans and a training ground for some of the nation's most famous civil rights leaders in the 1910s, 1920s, and beyond. Led by A.M.E. Zion Bishop Alexander Walters, who was president for most of the Council's existence, the Council attracted a wide range of African-American journalists, lawyers, educators, politicians, and community activists to its annual meetings. The Council was the brainchild of New York journalist Timothy Thomas Fortune, whose earlier attempt—the National Afro-American League—had failed to generate momentum, and disappeared in the early 1890s.Emma Lou Thornbrough, “The National Afro-American League, 1887-1908,” in Journal of Southern History 27, No. 4 (November 1961), 494-512. The Council was formed against a backdrop of violent lynchings and of increasing disfranchisement of African-American voters in the South. Alarmed by the lynchings and racial discrimination against African Americans, Bishop Walters circulated a national letter of appeal in the spring of 1898, just weeks after the brutal murder of African-American postmaster Frazier B. Baker in Lake City, South Carolina by an armed mob of whites. “It becomes absolutely necessary that we organize to protect ourselves,” Walters wrote, and more than 150 leaders from across the country signed the letter, which was published in Fortune's New York Age.Alexander Walters, My Life and Work (New York: Fleming H. Revell, 1917), 98-102. Some of them attended the organizational meeting in September 1898 in Rochester, following the dedication of a statue to the late abolitionist leader, Frederick Douglass.Justesen 2008, p9-10 The meeting endorsed creation of a non-partisan Council, to be supported by annual dues payments and based on the ideals expressed by the earlier League. Bishop Walters was elected as president, after Fortune declined to serve; other officers included journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett of Chicago, secretary, and federal customs official John C. Dancy of North Carolina, first vice president.Justesen 2008, p10 The annual meetings began three months later in Washington, D.C., and were held each year thereafter in a large American city, attracting a vibrant cross-section of African-American leaders. Although the overwhelming majority of its members were Republicans, the Council also boasted an active minority of black Democrats, in an unusual arrangement facilitated by the group's constitution, which mandated the nonpartisan nature of its proceedings and activities.Justesen 2008 p3-4 It was among the first national organizations to welcome women members and treat them equally with men; many of the national officers were women, and at least one woman from every state served on the national executive committee.Justesen 2008, p43-44 The Council lobbied actively for the passage of a federal anti-lynching law and raised funds to finance a court test against the new Louisiana constitution's provision effectively disfranchising most of that state's black voters, under the terms of its so-called “grandfather clause.” Men judged to be illiterate were deprived of suffrage rights, but white voters with ancestors who had been registered to vote before a certain date were exempted form the literacy requirement. African Americans were unable to qualify for the exemption. The court test, known as Ryanes v. Gleason, was expected to be taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but was eventually dropped, after an unfavorable ruling in the Louisiana Supreme Court.Cyrus Field Adams, The National Afro-American Council, organized 1898, A history, etc. (Washington, D.C.: Cyrus F. Adams, 1902), 26-29. The Council was designed as an umbrella group, with membership based on organizational affiliation—either in a local or state branch of the Council or through an affiliated organization, school, or newspaper. Officers were elected annually at the meetings, and consisted of a president, nine vice presidents, several secretaries, a treasurer, and a national organizer, among others. In addition, a large national executive committee was composed of three members from each U.S. state or territory, including one female member from each. The Council was considered the nation's premier organization of African Americans, and met regularly with U.S. President William McKinley until his death in 1901. Its meetings were given extensive coverage by local newspapers, both mainstream dailies and African- American weeklies, in each host city. The Council met in Chicago (1899), Indianapolis (1900), Philadelphia (1901), and Saint Paul, Minnesota (1902). In 1903, the Council convened in Louisville, Kentucky, followed by St. Louis (1904), Detroit (1905), and New York City (1906). Its final meeting was held in 1907 at Baltimore, Maryland.  Leaders and other officials  Walters, who served as president until 1902, was succeeded that year by Fortune. Fortune then served until his resignation in 1904, although William A. Pledger served as acting president in 1903. Fortune was followed by first vice president William Henry Steward of Kentucky, who served until Walters's reelection in 1905. Bishop Walters was then reelected in 1906 and 1907.Justesen 2008, p82 Early officers in the Council included the nation's only black congressman, Rep. George Henry White (R-N.C.), who served several terms as vice president and sought twice, unsuccessfully, to be elected president; Bishop Benjamin W. Arnett of Ohio and attorney William H. Lewis of Boston, both vice presidents; attorney Fredrick L. McGhee of Minnesota, who held several offices; Ida B. Wells-Barnett, first secretary and national organizer; journalists William A. Pledger, Harry Clay Smith, and Christopher Perry, all vice presidents; future U.S. minister to Liberia Ernest Lyon of Maryland, Washington, D.C., orator and activist Mary Church Terrell, and Philadelphia activist Gertrude Mossell, all vice presidents.Adams, The National Afro-American Council, 30-31. The Council's functional bureaus conducted much of its ongoing work between annual meetings, including work in education, business, anti-lynching activities, and legislation. Among many bureau directors during the Council's existence were Professor W. E. B. Du Bois, who chaired the business bureau from 1899 to 1901; former Louisiana Gov. P. B. S. Pinchback, literary bureau (1899); Archibald H. Grimké, literary (1907); Wells-Barnett, Mrs. Terrell, and newspaper publisher George L. Knox, each of whom chaired the anti-lynching bureau; and William T. Vernon, a future U.S. Treasury Register who chaired the education bureau in 1902. Among notable members of the national executive committee were Booker T. Washington of Alabama (1902); federal official John P. Green (1898) and professor William S.

Washington in 1902, after Washington engineered the selection of Fortune as president, but quickly lost its earlier effectiveness and grew dormant. After the emergence of the Niagara Movement in 1905, Walters attempted to rejuvenate the Council and distance it from the Tuskegee orbit, hoping to attract new members and bring back older members who had grown disenchanted, such as Du Bois, McGhee, and others.  Collapse in 1907  Despite well-publicized meetings in New York in 1906 and Baltimore in 1907, however, the Council failed to stabilize and soon collapsed, due to internal friction and lack of revenue. After a proposed merger between the Council and three other groups—the Negro Academy, the Niagara Movement, and the National Negro American Political League—failed to materialize, the Council faded away. Walters became president of yet another new grouping, the National Independent Political League, and eventually joined the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), formed by 1910. Many other former leaders of the Council, including Du Bois, George White, Mary Church Terrell, and Archibald Grimké, also helped form the core of the new NAACP, while others joined the new National Urban League.

The current head teacher is Fiona Mullen. The school opened in 2007, and as of October 2020, had a roll of 1,523 pupils. The new buildings are adjacent to St Bride's Roman Catholic church, built in 1964 by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. History The school was formed by the merger of two earlier schools, St Brides RC High School originally located at the Platthorn Drive site, and St Andrews RC High School located at Scholar's Gate in the Greenhills area of East Kilbride. Opened in 1956 as a junior secondary and primary school, St Bride's was located close to the town centre consisting of one main building, with a separate Art block and three technical blocks. The advent of Comprehensive Education in 1967, meant that Catholic pupils would attend the school, as there would be no qualifying examination for senior secondary schools and so a further Science block and a Technical Block were built in 1970 and a large \\"New Block\\" with a Business studies block were opened in 1971. Later, in 1975/6 a large P.E.Block was built to complete the campus. At its largest, around 1977, the school was second largest in Scotland, with 2,220 pupils, but the opening of St. Andrew's High in 1978 reduced this. It was a state comprehensive mixed gender school with 893 pupils aged 12–18 years (1999 data). In 1975 St Brides RC High School exceeded the capacity of its Platthorn Drive campus and as an interim measure took over the buildings of the then closed Old High School located at Old Mill Road in the East Mains area approximately one mile from the Platthorn Drive campus. This annex site was used to house the first-year intake for 1975, 1976 & 1977\\\\. The Old Mill Road site is now part of the South Lanarkshire College. South Lanarkshire Council were accused of threatening academic standards by choosing to merge two academically very different schools. In 2002 St Bride's came 24th for Higher results in the national league table of 350 schools, while St Andrew's came in 227th place.http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/education/Councils-snob-jibe-angers- parents.2413931.jp Catchments There are currently 6 primary schools who are associated with St Andrew's and St Bride's: *St Hilary's Primary School in St Leonards, East Kilbride *St Leonard's Primary School in St Leonard's *St Kenneth's Primary School in West Mains *Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School in Westwood *St Louise's Primary School in The Murray *St Vincent's Primary School In Greenhills References External links *St Andrew's And St Bride's High School's page on Scottish Schools Online *School Website Catholic secondary schools in South Lanarkshire Secondary schools in South Lanarkshire East Kilbride 2007 establishments in Scotland Educational institutions established in 2007 ","title":"St Andrew's and St Bride's High School"},{"id":"16007079","text":" Heinz Golinski (11 July 1919 – 16 October 1942) was a German fighter pilot in the Luftwaffe during World War II and a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.

Life He received his primary and academic education in the schools of Schmalkalden, Eisenach, and Halle, and then spent two years at the University of Erfurt, and seven months at the University of Wittenberg. Following the wishes of his father, he was ordained a priest in 1520, and was appointed Vicar of Vacha. In 1524, however, the teachings of Martin Luther attracted him. Abandoning the Catholic faith, he married, and the following year was appointed to the pastorate of Wenigenlupnitz by James Strauss, and a little later to that of Niemeck by Luther himself. He then began a thorough study of the Scriptures and the Church Fathers, and soon became convinced that the Church of Luther was not the true Church and that Lutheran morals did not make for the betterment of the people. To express his dissatisfaction with the new teaching, he wrote in 1527 two works which he sent to the theologians of Wittenberg without, however, receiving any satisfaction from them. To give more emphatic expression to his conviction of the error of the new religion, he resigned his charge in 1531 and returned with his family to Vacha. Here he spent two years in extreme poverty. In 1532 he published, under the pseudonym Agricola Phaqus, his Pro defensione bonorum operum, a work which aroused all the bitterness of his enemies. Among his works published at this time his Apologia (Leipzig, 1533) deserves special mention, since in it he gives his reasons for returning to the Church of Rome. Owing to Witzel's opposition to the doctrinal novelties of the age, he was forced to leave Vacha. He proceeded to Eisleben, and in 1538 was called to Dresden. Here he conceived a plan of reunion, which took the form of a public disputation in Leipzig in 1539. He had already (1537) published his Methodus concordiae ecclesiasticae, and for the new disputation he prepared Typus prioris Ecclesiae in which he proposed the Church of the first centuries as the ideal to be sought for. His endeavours for reunion, however, were without result. Opposition forced him to flee to Bohemia, thence to Berlin. The rapid progress of Protestantism soon convinced him that here too his efforts would be fruitless, and he forthwith proceeded to Fulda, where he directed his efforts towards defending the Church; but in 1554 he was again forced to flee, now to Mainz, where he spent the remainder of his life in literary work and probably as professor at the university of Mainz. Works The number of Witzel's works is extraordinarily large. Rass in his Convertiten enumerates ninety-four, but this is far from complete. He contributed to Michael Vehe's hymnbook (1537). He supported using the German vernacular for hymns, psalms, and liturgy. References *Hugo von Hurter, Nomenclator, I, 8; *Rass, Die Convertiten, I (Freiburg, 1886-80), 123 sqq.; *Holzhausen, G.

Biography Trammell was born on a cotton farm near Jonesboro, Arkansas to Wiley and Mae Trammell, who were cotton farmers.[ Bobby Lee Trammell] at Allmusic Wiley played fiddle and Mae was an organist at a local church; in addition to these influences, Trammell also listened to the Grand Ole Opry and attended services at the local Pentecostal church, where gospel music was sung. As a high schooler, Trammell played country music, and when Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash toured in Trammell's area in the middle of the 1950s, Perkins invited him to sing a song and told him to talk to Sam Phillips, owner of Sun Records. The meeting came to nothing, but Trammell moved to Long Beach, California soon after in hopes of landing a recording contract. While in California, he took a job in a Ford manufacturing plant. He saw Bobby Bare play at a carnival and convinced Bare to let him come on stage for a few songs. Lefty Frizzell, who was in attendance at the fair, asked him to open for a show at the Jubilee Ballroom, a venue in Baldwin Park, California. Trammell soon was performing there regularly, and won a reputation for Elvis Presley-like spastic gyrations and wildness on stage that occasionally caused controversy.Rockabilly Performer, Politician Bobby Lee Trammell Dies . WMC-TV, February 22, 2008. Trammell said: \\"I was much wilder than Jerry Lee Lewis or Little Richard\\". Manager/record label owner Fabor Robison signed Trammell to a contract, and he released his first single, containing the self-penned tunes \\"Shirley Lee\\" and \\"I Sure Do Love You, Baby\\". The recordings included session musicians James Burton on guitar and James Kirkland on bass. The single sold well and was picked up for national distribution by ABC/Paramount. The song never hit the national charts, but may have sold as many as 250,000 copies. Ricky Nelson covered \\"Shirley Lee\\" soon after. Trammell's career then went through a series of mishaps. He auditioned for The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet, but was not offered a spot. Ricky Nelson had expressed interest in looking at more of Trammell's work, but Trammell did not take the offer seriously. During the recording of his second single, \\"You Mostest Girl\\", he was backed by an orchestra and chorus, and he nearly quit his contract over the difficult recording session. Both this single and its follow-up, \\"My Susie J - My Susie Jane\\", failed to chart, and by the end of the 1950s, Trammell was performing strictly local dates in California. He staged a protest on the top of a broadcast tower in Los Angeles, against a radio station's refusal to play his record, but when the structure began to collapse, he had to be rescued by local authorities, and was barred from performing in the state. After returning to Arkansas, Trammell sparred with Jerry Lee Lewis before a gig and destroyed Lewis's piano. After stories of Trammell's misbehavior made the rounds among promoters, he was effectively blackballed as a public performer everywhere. Trammell continued recording for small local labels, but his reputation prevented him from getting much radio airplay. He self-distributed the records from his car in the 1960s. He was offered licensing contracts with Warner Bros. Records and others, but he refused them; he recorded for Sims Records through the end of the 1960s. In the 1970s, he played country music, and in the 1980s, he found some success in Europe during the rockabilly revival there. However, at the Rockhouse festival in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, he tried to jump onto his piano but fell, breaking his wrist in the process. In 1997, Trammell was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives, where he served until 2002. He unsuccessfully sought a State Senate seat in 2002, losing to Jerry Bookout. He died on February 20, 2008, in his birthplace of Jonesboro.

The documentary analyzes the development of some global events since the beginning of the century (especially after the 9/11 terrorist attacks) from the perspective of oil and oil-abundant regions. The documentary aspires to bring an untraditional point of view over the reasons, aspects and motives of this war and the direction of current US foreign policy. Interviews Respondents, featuring in the Oil Factor, include: *Zbigniew Brzezinski, former US DoD adviser *Noam Chomsky, professor at MIT *Gary Schmitt, executive director of the Project for a New American Century *Paul Bremer, temporary (Iraqi) coalition leader *Karen Kwiatkowski, retired military adviser in The Pentagon *Azees Al-Hakim, member of current Iraqi government *Michael C. Ruppert, author of From the Wilderness, studying the peak oil issue (among others) *Randa Habib, director of the French press agency in Jordan *Gen. Piérre-Marie Gallois, energy-strategy analyst *David Mulholland, editor of magazine focused on military technology *Ahmed Rashid, author of The Taliban book Locations The filmmakers were shooting in several locations of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq (besides the United States), interviewing local people or local authorities mostly on the influences and ramifications of the Operation Enduring Freedom and president Bush's 'spreading of democracy' in the respective regions. Introductory presupposition During the film, the spectator is given some prepositions and axioms that become a basis for film authors' argumentation, such as: *Oil is indispensable in every aspect of our modern-way lives. *World food production is 95% dependent on hydro-carbon energy. *Demand for oil is and will be growing as new markets (e.g. India and China) gains in strength and local consumers start to demand higher life standard. *75% of the world's oil discoveries are located in the Middle East, as well as the ratio of the volume of oil needed to be imported to the United States. *From 2010 on, economies of some continents or world regions will run out of oil and that will make them utterly dependent on foreign oil supply. The film says: \\"The reality is, however, that major conflicts are likely to erupt before any of these players actually runs out of oil.\\" Argumentation On the basis of these presuppositions, the film tries to examine the steps taken in the name of US foreign policy from this point of view. It refers to the motives of the United States in 2000 to build new military bases in the Middle East in order to increase their strategic power. It comes to the conclusion that the best candidate to this was Iraq as the country with the world's second biggest oil reserves, as well as its military being weakened by a dozen years of bombing on a weekly basis. According to David Mulholland, political power in the region is determined by the control of oil exports from this country. Oil Factor is also sceptical about consequences of all current wars both on local populations and American soldiers. Iraq The documentary first analyzes the development of support of Iraqi citizens that showed exacerbation approximately year and half after the invasion. It also touches the issue of 320+ tons of American munition made of depleted uranium since the first Gulf War and its consequences to local inhabitants, as well as the discrepancy of Paul Bremer's pledge to provide truly democratic elections with choosing representatives with pro-American who represent neither the Shiite majority nor Islamists as such. According to Shiites (present in neighboring Iran, current economic US enemy) it mentions the Iran–Contra affair of 1979 and Shiite support of the Hezbollah as an aspect the United States \\"will not tolerate\\". Afghanistan 315px The part dedicated to the invasion to Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom), introduced by the film as a \\"war virtually forgotten by media\\" begins with a rhetoric question of why the coalition units invaded the \\"extremely poor and desolated country\\" and why this military operation, allegedly waged for capturing Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda members, involves such vast concentration of American military technologies and building big permanent military bases, supposing this search and destroy mission would last for decades. The documentary answers this question via Ahmed Rashid - according to his reasoning the clandestine reason is upcoming struggle for dwindling energy sources like oil and natural gas, abundantly present in the area of Central-Asian states - Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan a Kazakhstan. The players of this struggle are Russia, China and the United States of America. While both China and Russia neighbors with at least some of the mentioned countries, USA do not and if they want to import Central-Asian oil or gas, they have to establish a pipeline to the Indian ocean. Such pipeline would have to run over Pakistan and Afghanistan. While Pakistani authorities would not object the construction, Afghan Taliban members and local warlords embody a peril of the intact existence of the pipeline. American presence in oil-rich regions In the last part of Oil Factor, the filmmakers go in for coalition (and especially US) soldiers, negatively acknowledge media campaigns to aid to recruit another young American men to join US Army and object that clandestine agents are best known and verified way to fight terrorism, instead of huge conventional waging of war. Karen Kwiatkowski concludes: \\"If you draw a map that connects the dots between all of the bases that we have done since the Cold War ended, what You see is American military hegemony - covering 90 per cent of global energy resources.\\" See also *Michael Klare *Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline Books *Chossudovsky, M.: War and Globalisation: The truth about September 11, *Brzezinski, Z.: The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geo strategic Imperatives, Basic Books, 1998, , External links *Official site *The Oil Factor: Behind the War on Terror on IMDb *Oil Factor on Google Video *Short review on Democracy Now! * 2005 films Films about terrorism Petroleum politics Documentary films about petroleum ","title":"The Oil Factor"},{"id":"16007107","text":"Rugby union in China is a growing sport; however, it is still not overly popular. China became affiliated to the International Rugby Board in 1997 and as of 1 July 2019, its women's XV side was ranked 24th and its men's XV side 80th in the world. Neither the women's team nor the men's team has yet qualified for a Women's Rugby World Cup or a men's Rugby World Cup. However, China has hopes of one day hosting the men's event, and World Rugby has indicated it supports taking the event there.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2019/06/12/exclusive-world-cup- chiefs-target-united-states-china-future/ History Early rugby union in China was often played by expatriates of various rugby playing nations, and colonials. For example, there was a rugby club in Shanghai,Cotton, Fran (Ed.) (1984) The Book of Rugby Disasters & Bizarre Records. Compiled by Chris Rhys. London. Century Publishing. where many of these could be found, and there was also a significant presence in Hong Kong, due to the strong connections with the British Commonwealth. The Shanghai club folded in 1952, and the surplus funds were presented to the English RFU for a \\"Royal Retiring Room\\", at Twickenham near London. In the 1930s and 1940s, rugby is said to have been adopted by Chinese military commanders to instil aggression into troops during the war with Japan. Later, for a period under Communism, rugby was banned in China, with the national Sports Council stating that \\"the meeting of sullied bodies in physical contact cannot be approved.\\" In post-Cultural Revolution days, the relative strength of rugby in Hong Kong has helped reintroduce the sport into the PRC, and the head of the HKRFU George Simkin introduced a development programme there.Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p65 Chinese delegates were amongst those who went to the centenary congress of the International Rugby Football Board in 1986.Starmer-Smith, p186 Rugby re-emerged in the PRC in 1990, with a club forming at the Beijing Agricultural University (now merged into China Agricultural University) at Beijing. A professor there, Chao Xihuang was introduced to the sport by a Japanese businessman, and set up a couple of sides. Professor Zheng Hongjun is also credited with the early development of rugby in the 1990s. The growth of the sport has been massive. For example, in 1991, there were a mere 30 registered players in China. By 1996, there were over a thousand instructors alone. Today, one segment of Chinese society where rugby is particularly popular is the military. Rugby is an official sport of the People's Liberation Army, with the PLA Sports Institute participating in the highly competitive Hong Kong leagues. Notable Chinese rugby players include Zhang Zhiqiang (\\"Johnny Zhang\\"), who had a stint with the famous Leicester Tigers club in England, and promising young speedster Li Yang, who boasts a time of 10.6 seconds in the 100-metre sprint. In June 2006, a delegation from Leicester rugby club led by Martin Johnson went on a week-long visit to China to promote the game. Since the beginning of 2000s, China has concerned more of the rugby sevens instead of the 15-men rugby, due to the Olympic strategy. Popularity =By participation= In January 2017, it was reported that China had 76,000 registered rugby players, up 40% on 2014. =By interest= According to World Rugby, in 2018 China and the US are tied for the countries with the most people either \\"interested\\" or \\"very interested\\" in rugby union, with 30 million fans in each. This compares to 25 million in India and 15 million in Japan. This interest has been particularly piqued by rugby sevens. For example, it has been reported that 44 million people in China watched sevens at the Rio Olympics — double the number in the UK and second only to the United States worldwide.44 million people in China watched sevens at the Rio Olympics — double the number in the UK and second only to the United States worldwide This contrasts with 2015, when Repucom released survey figures suggesting that only 1% of Chinese people were looking forward to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, down from 4% ahead of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Rugby Sevens =Within China= Annual Beginning in 2010, two national championships - two-day sevens' tournaments held in different locations - were held every year. However, in 2015, to help the game gain consistent exposure, the China Rugby Football Association divided the annual Sevens National Championships into four legs held in different cities. As a result, according to Cui Weihong, secretary-general of the China Rugby Football Association, \\"[t]he sevens' action will keep going from April to November with a series of scheduled events. We hope this intensive exposure will attract interest from sponsors and sports marketing agencies to help establish a professional league in the near future.\\" Since 2013, the National University Rugby Sevens Championship has been organized annually, with 2015's event attracting 12 male and eight female university teams from across the country. Quadrennial In a big boost for the sport, Rugby Sevens debuted in the National Games of China in 2013, at the 12th edition of the event, held in 2013 in Liaoning. The coach of the Chinese women's national team, Ben Gollings, said in 2016 that \\"[t]he biggest [rugby sevens] competition [in China] is the China Games which is played by all the provinces. This has helped start the development of rugby but when it gets into schools we will see the biggest growth.\\" During the Liaoning tournament, the women's final between Shandong and Beijing proved controversial when, at the insistence of their coach, Beijing players refused to continue playing, after a try was awarded to Shandong by the Spanish referee. The Beijing team was subsequently fined and later issued an apology. The most recent National Games of China was held in Tianjin in 2017. =China at international level= Women's Sevens Since 2019, the current coach of the Chinese Women's Sevens team is New Zealander Sean Horan, who previously coached the New Zealand Women's Sevens team at the 2016 Rio Olympics. =Olympics= Rio 2016 DNQ In November 2015, China qualified for the Final 2016 Women's Olympic Qualification Tournament, an event which would determine the 12th and last team to play at Rio 2016. The tournament took place on 25–26 June 2016 in Ireland. China finished second in its pool, but then lost to Spain in the first play-off match, ending its chance of winning the tournament. It nevertheless went on to beat Samoa and Argentina, to clinch the Plate Final. A video report on the team's preparations for the tournament is available at http://www.worldrugby.org/video/171952 Tokyo 2020 China beat Hong Kong 33-0 in the final of the 2019 Asia Rugby Women's Sevens Olympic Qualifying Tournament to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They will be coached by Sean Horan, New Zealand women's silver medal-winning coach at Rio 2016. =World Cup= UAE 2009 In October 2008, China finished third (behind Japan and Thailand) in the Asian qualification tournament to book a place in the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens. At the UAE tournament in March 2009, China won the Bowl final, beating the Netherlands, Japan, Italy and Brazil. Moscow 2013 In October 2012, China finished second (behind Fiji) in the Asian qualification tournament to book a place in the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens. At the Moscow tournament in June 2013, China lost all its pool games but beat Brazil in the Bowl play-offs before losing in the Bowl semi-finals to the Netherlands. San Francisco 2018 In October 2017, China finished second (behind Japan) in the Asian qualification tournament to book a place in the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens. At the tournament in July 2018, China finished 12th of 16 teams. =HSBC World Rugby Women's Sevens Series= After winning the qualifying tournament in Hong Kong in September 2014, China became one of the core teams in the 2014-2015 season. However, it won no pool matches in any of the five events, and finished 11th out of 13 teams, failing to secure automatic core team status for the following season. In the qualifying tournament in Dublin in August 2015, China lost 27-5 to Ireland in the quarterfinals, so did not gain a place in the main Sevens Series. In the qualifying tournament in Dublin in June 2016, which doubled as the Final 2016 Women's Olympic Qualification Tournament, China lost to Spain (the eventual winner) in the quarterfinal, so did not gain a place in the main Sevens Series. In the qualifying tournament in Hong Kong in April 2017, China lost 28-14 to Japan (the eventual winner) in the quarterfinal, so did not gain a place in the main Sevens Series. After winning the qualifying tournament in Hong Kong in April 2018, China became one of the core teams again in the 2018–19 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series. However, after finishing last, they were relegated for the 2019–20 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series (in which they nevertheless feature occasionally as an invitational team). =Asia Rugby Women's Sevens Series= China participates in the Asian Women's Sevens Championship. It has won the Series five times, most recently in 2014. In September 2017, it lost the final to Japan 19-14. =Asian Games= Rugby Sevens has been contested by women at the Asian Games since 2010. China finished runners-up (to Kazakhstan) in 2010, winners (over Japan) in 2014, and runners-up (to Japan) in 2018. =East Asian Games= Rugby Sevens was included in the East Asian Games in 2009 in Hong Kong, and China won the tournament. However, the sport was not retained for the Games in 2013 in Tianjin, reportedly due to budgetary issues, and, in any event, the East Asian Games has now been replaced by an under-18s event. Men's Sevens =Silicon Valley Sevens Tournament= The Silicon Valley Sevens was a one-off tournament held a month before the World Rugby Sevens Series season began in December 2017 in Dubai. It was held on 4–5 November 2017 in San Jose, California, USA. China was one of the featured teams, alongside a number of heavyweights like Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, and England. China finished 11 out of 12 teams, beating Tonga 34-10 in the play-off for last place. =Shanghai Champions Tournament= A Champion of Champions tournament is planned at some stage in the future by Alisports, in conjunction with World Rugby and the Chinese Rugby Football Association. The first edition was to be played in Shanghai's Yangpu District in late October 2017 with the top eight teams from World Rugby Sevens Series invited to compete, alongside the national team of , for the highest ever prize money seen in rugby sevens. However, the first edition was then pushed back to 2018, and recent delays in the roll-out of the Alisports rugby funding suggest a further postponement is possible. =Olympics= Rio 2016 DNQ In November 2015, China attempted to qualify Rio 2016, at the 2015 ARFU Men's Sevens Championships held in Hong Kong. However, it finished fifth, behind Japan (which qualified directly for Rio), and Hong Kong, South Korea and Sri Lanka (which went through to the Final 2016 Men's Olympic Qualification Tournament, which would determine the 12th and last team to play at Rio 2016). Tokyo 2020 The 2019 Asia Men's Sevens Championship will likely double as the qualifying tournament. China was eliminated after losing (after extra time) in the semi-final against eventual winners South Korea. However, because it finished in the top 4 it has qualified for the 2020 Men's Rugby Sevens Final Olympic Qualification Tournament, to be held in June 2020, from which it could qualify for Tokyo 2020. Paris 2024 The CRFU has as an official objective for the men's sevens team to qualify for the 2024 Olympics. =HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series= China has not yet qualified for the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series. =Asian Sevens Series= China has competed in the Asian Sevens Series since it began in 2009. A video of a 2015 match against Thailand is available online. China finished 4th in 2016, 5th in 2017, and 5th in 2018. In some years, the tournaments in the Series include a China Sevens event. China made the final of the 2019 China event, having beaten favourites Japan in the semi-finals, but lost out to Hong Kong by 7-14. =Asian Games= Rugby Sevens has been contested by men at the Asian Games since 1998. China's best placing was third in 2006. In the 2018 edition, China finished 6th out of 12 teams. Rugby XVs =Within China= Women's and Men's XVs Rugby XVs does not attract the same level of support as rugby sevens. For example, while the provinces that compete in the National Games of China all have sevens teams, there are no regional XVs sides and no national rugby XV competition. According to the UK newspaper the Daily Telegraph, the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2009 to introduce rugby sevens to the Olympic Games “has effectively halted the development of 15-a-side rugby in China. Beijing reacted by immediately gearing its national rugby system towards sevens, instructing the universities to focus on the format.” Zhang Zhiqiang, the former China national side captain, added in 2015 that “[o]ur national system is geared towards an Olympic strategy, and sevens, as one of the Olympic events, gets more attention.” Youth XVs In June 2016, the inaugural National Youth 15's tournament was held in Qingdao in association with the Qingdao Sharks Rugby Club, one of the first non-university, non-expat rugby clubs formed in China (in 1998). The event was won by Jinan. The president of the China Rugby Football Union stated that the tournament \\"bodes well for the development of the 15’s game in China as the event has created a lot of interest in other Provinces to host future 15’s tournaments\\". Clubs There is currently no professional XV rugby competition within the Chinese mainland. However, it has been reported that a number of east coast clubs are likely to be part of a proposed league run by the Chinese Rugby Football Association beginning in 2018. There are a number of amateur clubs which compete domestically for the annual All China Rugby Cup. Teams compete in one of four divisions, based on their location (e.g. the North China division or the South China division). At the end of the season, the top finisher in every division qualifies for the All China Rugby Cup. Meanwhile, the second-place team from each division lands in the four-team China Plate Final. The 2017 All China Rugby Cup was won by the Shanghai Silver Dragons (of the Shanghai Rugby Football Club) against the Guangzhou Rams, 46-16. The social clubs are dominated by expatriates, including the Shanghai Rugby Football Club, the Beijing Devils, and the Hangzhou Harlequins. The Shanghai and Beijing teams play domestically but also in the Yellow Sea Cup against a team from Seoul, South Korea. Some clubs have a native-Chinese base (such as Nongda aka the China Agricultural University and the Beijing Flying Horses Rugby Club) or have made significant efforts to reach out to native Chinese (such as the Qingdao Sharks Rugby Club). More than 10 universities in China, including the China Agricultural University, Beijing Normal University and South China Agriculture University, have introduced majors in athletic training with rugby as a specialty. =China at international level= Women's XVs The China women's national rugby union team first played in 2006 and continued regularly until 2012. They began playing again in 2019, when they won the Asia Rugby Women’s Division 1 title with victory over both Singapore and the Philippines. Although they later lost a two-match playoff against Kazakhstan, they “may have done enough” to gain a spot in the 2020 Asian Women's Rugby Championship (which they won in 2006 and 2011), and so have a chance to qualify for the 2021 Women's World Cup. As of 20 May 2019, China's women's XV side was ranked 24th in the world. Men's XVs =Ranking= The China national rugby union team first played in 1997. As of 28 May 2018, China's men's XV side was ranked 87th in the world, down from 68th on 14 November 2016. Its highest ranking was 37th, which was achieved in the early 2000s. Under the points system used by World Rugby to rank rugby nations, China regularly scored between 46 and 49 points in the period 2003-2009. Since 2010, it has typically scored between 39 and 41 points. Because they play so seldom, and with little media coverage, it is difficult to judge the standard of the men's XV team. In 2018, an opponent with experience in club rugby in Dunedin, New Zealand, compared the standard to \\"Dunedin premier two grade\\" and stated: \\"The Chinese side was huge but they were pretty robotic. They just did a lot of pods and it was all pretty slow. Not very expansive.\\" A pod is a group of players who attack the same space together. When it is used correctly, defenders don’t know which attacker will get the ball. =Asian Rugby Championship= China has been as high as Division 1 of the Asia Rugby Championship, most recently in 2008 when it was grouped with Singapore, Chinese Taipei and Sri Lanka. However, between 2015 and 2019, the team was in Division 3 East of the Asian Rugby Championship, alongside countries like Guam, Brunei and Laos. In the 2019 Asia Rugby Championship division tournaments, China went unbeaten against India and Indonesia, with 137 points for and only 27 against, gaining promotion to Division 2 in the process. Participation in Division 2 will enable the team to attempt qualification for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. =Bilateral Matches= China plays in what was intended to be an annual Kublai Khan Cup against Mongolia. In the inaugural match in May 2015, China won 46-19. No further contests for the Cup have been recorded. =World Cup= In its attempt to qualify for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, China participated in the 2015 Rugby World Cup – Asia qualification, as part of the 2012 Asian Five Nations Division 2. It lost its first match to Malaysia 89-0, and so was eliminated from the qualification process. China was not eligible to attempt to qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, because only teams in the Top Three (generally Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea), Division 1, and Division 2 of the Asian Rugby Championship can participate in the qualification process. =Military= The People’s Liberation Army XV team represents China in the International Defence Rugby Competition, which is held alongside the Rugby World Cup. It participated in the inaugural 2011 edition, held in New Zealand and Australia. Results included a 59-12 loss to the Tongan Defence Services. However, it did not appear in the 2015 edition held in England or in the 2019 edition held in Japan. According to Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford, \\"[t]he Chinese armed forces have been playing rugby [XVs] for a number of years. They have believed that rugby is one of the best ways to develop the skills of their personnel, involving as it does strength, teamwork and decision-making.” The People’s Liberation Army XV team, which is stationed at the army’s sports institute in Guangzhou, also competes in an annual match against the Hong Kong Disciplined Services team in the TK Lai Cup, named after Hong Kong's Secretary for Security. The match has traditionally been played in December but in 2016 was played during Taipan Day in April, with the PLA replaced by a new Hong Kong team, the Tin Shui Wai Pandas. The team has also been a part of the second-tier rugby competition in Hong Kong. Youth XVs China did not participate in the Asian Under-19 Rugby Championship held in Malaysia in December 2016 nor in the Asian Under-19 Rugby Championship held in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka in December 2017. China's national youth team toured New Zealand between 18–26 June 2017 to play against Hamilton Boys' High School in Hamilton and to visit the Rotorua Boys' High School Academy and the Bay of Plenty Steamers in Tauranga. Efforts to develop rugby =Positive developments= Team China Initiative In October 2016, World Rugby announced its Team China initiative, signed in partnership with company Alisports and China's rugby football association. Alisports committed to invest $100m over the 2016-2026 period, in an effort to further popularise both formats of the game. According to World Rugby, the project was to initially focus on four main goals: (i) Establishment of first- ever professional men's and women's 15s leagues and national sevens programmes (ii) World Rugby's Get Into Rugby mass participation programme (see below) to be run in 10,000 universities and schools in 20 provinces with the target of attracting and retaining one million new players over the next five years (iii) Development programmes to achieve the recruitment and training of 30,000 coaches and 15,000 match officials by 2020 (iv) A major rugby marketing and promotion initiative that would see Alisports invest in nationwide marketing and promotional programmes while carrying rugby content on its TV and digital platforms and Alibaba, the world's biggest e-commerce platform Progress with the Team China Initiative was slow, however, notably due to \\"governance changes\\" within Chinese rugby. World Rugby CEO Breet Gosper stated in April 2018: \\"I’d have to say it's been slow progress, the partnership. It's slower than we would have liked. Things aren’t [as] easy and rapid in China as we would have liked in the areas we are dealing with. It's been slowed down recently by a change in the government's administrative approach in China and what we have done is put [this programme] on hold for a month or two until we get clarity on who is leading rugby in China.\\" Alisports CEO and founder Zhang Dazhong stated in September 2018: \\"First we want to cultivate the popularity of rugby in China so we will start with that first, and then once we've started then we will think about the goals, like this $100m promise. We will start with campus rugby first... We will not be involved with any club, federations or national level regarding the sport.\\" In April 2019, World Rugby announced that the Team China Initiative had finally been abandoned. Get Into Rugby (GIR) Programme In 2017, 140,986 Chinese boys and girls took the GIR programme, learning basic rugby skills. This was the fourth highest GIR figure in the world, behind Colombia (216,341), South Africa (170,919), and India (160,378). IMPACT Beyond RWC 2019 IMPACT Beyond is a World Rugby initiative which has been in place since 2013, and has previously included IMPACT Beyond RWC 2015 and IMPACT Beyond Rio 2016. In May 2017, the IMPACT Beyond RWC 2019 project was launched. It is a partnership between World Rugby, Asia Rugby and the Japan Rugby Football Union and is the official 'legacy' programme for Rugby World Cup 2019. One of its four 'pillars' is 'growing the game across Asia', and as such it appears to have subsumed Asia Rugby's Asia Rugby One Million Project, which uses Get Into Rugby programmes and aims to achieve 1 million new players across Asia (making a total of 2 million) by the start of the 2019 Rugby World Cup (in China, this is being run in 4 locations: Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning & Shandong). Bilateral Agreements In October 2017, the Chinese rugby football association signed a memorandum of understanding with the Fijian rugby football union, under which Fiji will supply coaches to help develop Chinese sevens and fifteens rugby. In December 2017, the Chinese rugby football association signed a memorandum of understanding with the Samoa Rugby Union, under which the Samoa Rugby Union will \\"promote the sport in China and also provide an environment for C.F.R.A. teams to visit and learn from local teams and competitions on [the] island\\". In this regard, China will take part in Samoa's Marist International Sevens tournament in February 2018. Search for China- eligible players In late 2017, it was reported that advertisements had appeared on social media targeting people of Chinese descent living abroad who may wish to represent China in rugby. Already the search has been successful, as \\"Peter Wong will become the first Fijian to represent China in rugby sevens\\". Rapid Rugby Championship Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest is launching the Rapid Rugby Championship in 2019, featuring women's and men's 7s and XVs teams from Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Fiji, Samoa and Japan, who will play in a round-robin format from February–June. According to Business Insider Australia, \\"Forrest is hoping to expand the competition further in the next two years with teams from China, India, the UAE, Sri Lanka and Korea\\". New CRFA Leadership In April 2019, Chen Yingbiao was elected as the new president of the Chinese Rugby Football Association (CRFA) and — unlike many of his predecessors — he actually has a rugby background through his athletic association with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Chen’s is ambitious: In his opening statement he said he would resign if the Chinese women’s sevens team did not qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. =Challenges= In 2012, ARFU secretary-general Ross Mitchell was reported as saying that China's rugby administration \\"find it difficult to field their best team in international sevens competitions because their PLA players are not allowed permission to go overseas\\". In 2016, Jin Mengwei, wife of Johnny Zhang and director of a youth rugby camp based at CAU which offers students from nearby primary schools training in sevens rugby, stated that \\"[t]he biggest challenge is the strong perception among parents and school principals generally that rugby is a dangerous game, even at the junior level, which features the safer touch version and uses protective gear.\\" In 2016, Xu Fangjie, coach of the Liaoning provincial men's team, said that \\"[t]he biggest problem is that we don't have enough games to play. If people can't see us play on a regular basis throughout the year, how can we promote the sport?\\" Also in 2016, women's sevens coach Ben Gollings referred to \\"red tape\\" and also noted, non-judgmentally, that many of the players representing the country grew up playing other sports, and therefore do not necessarily have a personal passion for playing rugby. Similarly, the club captain of the expatriate side Beijing Devils, Steven Lynch, said in 2015 that “[t]here really needs to be deeper roots of rugby at grass roots level for it to succeed in China.” In 2017, World Rugby decided that, from 2020, the residency requirement to qualify for a national team would be extended from three to five years. One commentator has questioned whether this might make it more difficult for developing nations like China to compete internationally. In 2018, an ex-pat player at the Wuhan Baiji team in China, Martin Sullivan, was quoted as saying: \\"The main thing which is actually holding back Chinese rugby is the lack of facilities, lack of grass pitches, lack of trained coaches and lack of understanding of rugby.\\" In 2019, a Shanghai-based lawyer who played for the PLA team in the early 2000s, Liu Kai, was quoted in the online news magazine Sixth Tone as saying that poor decision-making by China’s sports authorities was to blame, in particular the decision to focus on just one version of the sport (rugby sevens). The magazine noted that, in 2002, \\"the Olympic Council of Asia decided that only the seven-a-side version of rugby, rugby sevens, rather than the traditional 15-a-side game, rugby union, would be played at future editions of the Asian Games — a decision that convinced the Chinese authorities to halt support for rugby union [XVs], according to Liu. 'This caused most of China’s 15s teams to fade away,' says Liu ... 'The CRFA should be promoting the sport, but they’re not,' says Liu. 'So, us diehard rugby fans are left to do it ourselves' ... China’s sports organizations, meanwhile, should be run by people with real experience and knowledge of the games they are promoting, rather than by bureaucrats, according to Liu.\\" Related regions =Hong Kong and Macau= Rugby union has an uninterrupted history in Hong Kong, where arguably the most successful sevens tournament is held. The national team of Hong Kong also participates in the Asian Five Nations. However, Rugby union has a much smaller presence in Macau. =Taiwan= Rugby union has an unbroken history in Taiwan, but the Chinese Civil War and souring of relations with the mainland has meant that it was effectively cut off. Nonetheless, Taiwan, playing as Chinese Taipei, has a very successful rugby sevens side, and it is ranked in fourth position in East Asia, after Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea.

However, those had no lasting impact upon the constitution itself, and may, in hindsight, be regarded as \\"votes which required 3/5 majorities\\". For instance, the Provisional Senate of 1992 was \\"constituted in a manner defined by a Constitutional Act\\",Constitution of the Czech Republic, Art. 106 but that act is not binding upon the Senate today. Specific acts , only six constitutional acts have been passed which have truly changed the nature of the constitution. They have mostly been the result of implications in the original wording of the constitution that Parliament should pass constitutional acts on various subjects. =Number 347/1997= Article 100 of the constitution provided that \\"higher self-governing regions may be created or dissolved only by a constitutional act\\". Parliament thus moved on 3 December 1997 to create 14 such regions. This required the act to rewrite Article 99 and repeal Article 103 of the constitution, so as to set the regions as being of higher authority than municipalities. Given the administrative burden of complying with the act, however, it did not come into effect until 1 January 2000. =Number 110/1998= On 22 April 1998, Parliament opted to pass a constitutional act that was not directly implied or obliged by language in the constitution. The \\"Constitutional Act on the Security of the Czech Republic\\" defined the ways in which the Republic would respond to imminent threat. It defined the obligations the constituent parts of the Republic, and even its citizenry, had towards national defense. It allowed for compulsory military service to be instituted by further statute, required regional governments to offer material aid to the national defense, and defined the response to a non-military state of emergency, such as an ecological or industrial disaster. It also set up a State Security Council, headed by the Prime Minister. Furthermore, it required, during times of imminent military threat or war, that legislative debate be shortened to just 72 hours from the time of a bill's introduction, and that the president's veto power be temporarily suspended. Finally, it allowed for up to a six-month extension of electoral terms during the time of a declared state of emergency. =Number 300/2000= =Number 395/2001= =Number 448/2001= =Number 515/2002= On 14 November 2002, Parliament undertook to define the nature of a public referendum on the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union. Such an act was implied in Article 10a of the original wording of the constitution, which says that the Republic may surrender a part of its powers under international treaty \\"unless a constitutional act provides that such ratification requires the approval obtained in a referendum.\\" Since the constitution later specifically required the president to \\"call a referendum on the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union\\", Parliament exercised its right under Article 10 to not only formalize that there would be such a referendum, but to define the terms under which it would be held.

The programme reveals how Brambell and Corbett were highly dissimilar to their on-screen characters. Corbett felt he had a promising career as a serious actor, but was trapped by his role as Harold and forced to keep returning to the series after typecasting limited his choice of work.

The name also refers to the wider parkland in which the main oval is located. The ground is the administrative and primary central playing base of the Victorian Amateur Football Association. History =Cricket= The cricket ground was built on part of the site of the former Elsternwick Racecourse by the Elsternwick Cricket Club, a club which had been established in 1901 through an amalgamation of three local cricket teams. The original cost of the development was more than £500, and the ground was formally opened on 9 November 1903 by former Premier Sir George Turner. The Elsternwick Football Club, which was playing in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (later known as the Victorian Amateur Football Association), began playing football on the ground during winter from 1908. =VFA Football= In 1927, the Brighton Football Club, which was playing in the Victorian Football Association, began playing its senior home matches at the venue. The Brighton Council, which owned the ground, erected fences around the venue, and improvements were paid for jointly by the Elsternwick Cricket Club and the Brighton Football Club. Brighton had an arrangement under which it shared winter tenancy of the ground with incumbent Elsternwick Football Club, such that the clubs used the ground on alternate Saturdays, while the Brighton seconds team continued to use Brighton Beach Oval as its home ground; this arrangement was unique in the VFA, as all other clubs were required to provide the same ground for their firsts and seconds teams to use on alternate weeks. The ground was of good quality and was sought after by other clubs. On two occasions the St Kilda Football Club, which played in the Victorian Football League and often endured a disharmonious relationship with its landlord, the St Kilda Cricket Club, considered a move to the ground: once in 1933, when its committee recommended it but the club did not proceed; and again in 1959, when a request to the council for a 50-year lease was rejected. Prahran played its VFA home games at the venue in 1948 when its home ground at Toorak Park was unavailable. In 1954, the Elsternwick Amateur Football Club was evicted from the main ground, and the Brighton Soccer Club leased the ground in its place, sharing it on alternate weekends with the Brighton Football Club; it was the first time a VFA team had shared a ground with a soccer team, which caused great concern within the VFA at the time. The venue was unavailable for football in 1961 due to re-surfacing works, and upon completion of the works, the Brighton Football Club, which by this time was struggling to survive, was not offered a new lease. Brighton merged with South Caulfield and moved to Princes Park, Caulfield. =VASA Soccer= The Victorian Amateur Soccer Association became the venue's winter tenant, turning the main Elsternwick Park oval into a dedicated soccer venue during winter. =VAFA Football= The Victorian Amateur Football Association has been the main tenant at Elsternwick Park since 1967, and it is now the Association's primary home base; it serves as the Association's administrative headquarters, the training base of its umpires, and is a venue for finals matches. Since 2003, the venue has had floodlights suitable for night football and has been known as Sportscover Arena as part of Sportscover's sponsorship deal with the VAFA. Sportscover Arena remains the home of the Elsternwick Cricket Club in the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association. The Elsternwick Football Club, which still plays in the VAFA, now uses the park's No. 2 oval, located to the immediate west of Sportscover Arena, as its home ground. Since 2009, the Community Cup, an annual charity match played between a team of Melbourne musicians and a team of community radio personalities, has been held at the ground. Wider Elsternwick Park The main oval is located in the north- western corner of the wider Elsternwick Park reserve, which covers 90 acres between Glenhuntly Rd, Head St, New St and St Kilda St. The wider reserve served as the Elsternwick Racecourse from 1880 until 1891, but after its closure it fell into disuse and disrepair – to the point that it was known colloquially as \\"no-man's land\\" in the district. The main oval was opened on approximately five acres of the reserve in 1903, and the rest of the reserve was leased by the Elsternwick Golf Club in 1910, which invested £13,000 pounds developing it from a swamp to a private golf course. When its lease expired in 1925, the Brighton Council did not renew it and instead made the area a public reserve, which included a municipal nine-hole golf links, a tennis club, a bowls club and more football and cricket ovals, all of which remain today except the golf course, which closed in 2018. After losing occupancy of Elsternwick Park in 1925, the golf club moved to Cheltenham and became the Kingston Heath Golf Club.

Afghan Star was directed by Havana Marking and is distributed by Zeitgeist Films. The film was acclaimed by critics.  Filming/Production  Director and co-producer Havana Marking received funding from the Channel 4 BritDoc Foundation (now known as Doc Society) on the basis of her idea for the film. After spending a month gathering footage for a taster tape and planning the project, the documentary was commissioned by British channel More4. Marking spent four months in Afghanistan filming, following the development of the four focal characters competing in the show. Producers worked with Afghanistan-based television station Tolo TV. Filming primarily took place in Kabul, where the competition for Afghan Star is held and the show is produced, but also features the cities of Herat and Kandahar when documenting the stories of Setara and Lema, two of the competitors. Much of the film's decision-making was quite reactive and adapted to the circumstances faced by the filmmakers. Marking notes the mounting tensions and unpredictability of her own situation in the filming process in an interview, stating that while she wasn't threatened directly, a \\"general protocol had to be followed.\\" She remarked about the danger presented by accompanying a contestant to her hometown of Kandahar and, instead, opted to give the contestant a camera to film in Kandahar on her own. Marking also described the postponing of a shoot due to aggressive militia activity, incited by a governing official and former warlord. Additionally, interviews with the people seen in the documentary were difficult to plan in ahead of time, and they often depended on people agreeing to film on the spot, after some conversation. Plot Afghan Star follows the story of Hameed Sakhizada, Setara Hussainzada, Rafi Naabzada, and Lema Sahar, four contestants appearing in the third season of the Afghan reality show Afghan Star. The show's director and host Daoud Sediqi explains that it provides an opportunity for Afghans to enjoy music again after the Taliban's ban. The contestants become national celebrities with people campaigning for votes which are cast via SMS. The show is popular among ordinary Afghan people and fans vote for their favorite contestants even across ethnic lines. Contestant Setara Hussainzada is the first of the four to be eliminated. During her farewell performance she dances with free body movements without her hijab, as opposed to the more constrained dancing considered socially appropriate. After Daoud Sediqi decides to air the footage, there is outrage in the conservative Muslim community and Setara receives death threats and is evicted from her apartment. She explains that she is open-minded and that she wants other Afghans to be as well. She then returns home to her family. The other female contestant Lema Sahar, a Pashtun, is eliminated in the last round leaving Naabzada and Sakhizada. While one-third of Afghanistan watches, Rafi Naabzada wins the final round, becoming the Afghan Star. Afghan Star uses each contestant as a lens through which to view various aspects of Afghan society. Setara’s elimination and the reasons behind it are focused on at the film’s midpoint. Her dancing was viewed as sacrilegious by many Afghan people, and this likely led to her early elimination. When she was eliminated, she was allowed to perform a final song to be broadcast across Afghanistan. She chose to dance more openly and passionately than in any previous performance, sending a message to the many viewers who opposed it. Ismail Khan, a prominent member of government and warlord who gained prominence in the Soviet-Afghan War denounced her dancing. One of the strongest undertones in the film is the rampant sexism in Islamic Afghanistan, as seen by the only two female finalists being eliminated before the last round. Lema Sahar chose to perform conservatively in a bid to gain favor from the Afghan population. She was ultimately voted off right before the last round, leaving Rafi Naabzada and Hameed Sakhizada to compete in the finale. Rafi hails from northern Afghanistan, and is competing to give his countrymen a distraction from the constant war in the region. The film did not spend much time on Rafi, focusing more on the female finalists. Hameed is an ethnic Hazara, hailing from central Afghanistan. His performance in the finale is a cry for ethnic unity among Afghan’s, a point the film drives. Ultimately, Rafi is the winner.

He is the former Executive Vice-President and Creative Director of The Jim Henson Company. His contributions to Muppet projects have been extensive and varied.The Bermudian magazine, October, 2001, Page 13. Profile, by Rosemary Jones: READING BETWEEN THE LIONS. Bermudian Michael Frith takes his passion for learning to TV. Biography Frith was born in Bermuda and educated at Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1963. He and Christopher Cerf co-wrote Alligator, the 1962 Harvard Lampoon parody of James Bond novels.\\"Alligator (A Harvard Lampoon Parody)\\". Bookseller product display. Amazon.com. Retrieved 2015-09-23. Later he illustrated the front cover of Bored of the Rings, the 1969 Lampoon parody of The Lord of the Rings. Frith began his career at Random House in 1963 as a children's book illustrator and editor. He was Editor-in-Chief of the Beginner Books series, the line of books created by Theodor Seuss Geisel, Dr. Seuss. He was also Dr. Seuss's book editor and close personal friend. In 1971, when Random House began publishing Sesame Street books, Frith was named editor and art director of the Sesame series. He produced a series of five annual large-format Sesame Street Storybooks, and contributed artwork for four of them: The Sesame Street Storybook (1971), The Sesame Street 1, 2, 3 Storybook (1973), The Sesame Street ABC Storybook (1974), and Big Bird's Busy Book (1975). Appreciating Frith's talents as a designer, Jim Henson brought him on board his creative team. One of Frith's early projects was designing characters for The Land of Gorch, a segment of Saturday Night Live. Frith recalled his beginnings with the Muppets in The Saturday Evening Post (December 1980): \\"The first drawings I ever worked on were characters for Saturday Night Live. The Muppets did regular segments for a season featuring characters about as far removed from Sesame Street as you could get. Jim asked me to come over one day to talk about creating Muppet personalities—specifically, strange, mossy, warty creatures. Instead of traditional ones with cartoon eyes—round, white and black—he had become fascinated with taxidermist eyes: cow, camel and tiger eyes. Around this simple concept of a different eye evolved a whole new concept which led to the creation of the crazy-eyed loonies we enjoy today.\\" He joined Henson Associates full-time as Art Director in 1975. He was named Vice-President in 1978, and Executive Vice-President and Director of Creative Services in 1985. After the success of \\"The Muppet Show\\" series Henson wanted Frith, along with two other Muppet Show stalwarts Jerry Juhl, Jocelyn Stevenson (both writers) and newcomer to the Henson productions Duncan Kenworthy (producer), to create a new children's show which would appeal to a much wider international audience.\\"Fraggle Rock\\" is the new show which emerged and subsequently ran for 4 seasons totaling 96 episodes between January 10, 1983 and March 30, 1987. This new show centered on \\"Muppet\\" creatures known as Fraggles, who live underground along with several other species of creature such as Doozers and Gorgs. He designed many of the creatures and settings which existed in this universe. He explains that he drew on two major parts of his background when creating the \\"look\\" of the show, the first his many years in working with Ted Geisel (Dr. Seuss) on several children's books and the second being his growing up in Bermuda.Documentary Segment (2007) Video Interview: 00:34; retrieved 10 October 2012. In October 1995, Frith left Henson Productions to start a new company, Sirius Thinking, Ltd., with John Sculley, Christopher Cerf and Norman Stiles. Sirius is the multi-media children's education company that created Between the Lions, an award-winning educational puppet show on PBS, in 2000. Frith served as the Executive Producer, Creative Director, Conceptual Designer and Co-Creator of the show. Michael K. Frith, along with his wife, Muppet performer Kathryn Mullen, founded \\"No Strings\\" along with emergency aid worker Johnie McGlade. The company originally created a film for children in Afghanistan, warning of the dangers of land mines. In the film, \\"The Story of the Little Carpet Boy\\", one puppet loses several limbs before he learns to avoid land mines completely. Since the first film, No Strings has gone on to create films for children in need in areas including Africa, Haiti, Madagascar, Sudan, and Syria.

Agriculture in Ghana consists of a variety of agricultural products and is an established economic sector, and provides employment on a formal and informal basis. Ghana produces a variety of crops in various climatic zones which range from dry savanna to wet forest and which run in east–west bands across Ghana. Agricultural crops, including yams, grains, cocoa, oil palms, kola nuts, and timber, form the base of agriculture in Ghana's economy. In 2013 agriculture employed 53.6% of the total labor force in Ghana.Clark, Nancy L. \\"Agriculture\\" (and subchapters). A Country Study: Ghana (La Verle Berry, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (November 1994). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Because such a larger part of the economy is dependent on rainfed agriculture, it is expected that climate change in Ghana will have serious consequences for both cash crops and staples. Production Ghana produced in 2018: * 20.8 million tons of cassava (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria, Thailand and Congo); * 7.8 million tonnes of yam (2nd largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria); * 4.1 million tons of plantain (2nd largest producer in the world, just behind Congo); * 2.6 million tons of palm oil (8th largest producer in the world); * 2.3 million tons of maize; * 1.4 million tons of taro (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria, China and Cameroon); * 947 thousand tons of cocoa (2nd largest producer in the world, second only to Ivory Coast); * 769 thousand tons of rice; * 753 thousand tons of orange (19th largest producer in the world); * 713 thousand tons of pineapple (11th largest producer in the world); * 521 thousand tons of peanut; In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like sweet potato (151 thousand tons), natural rubber (23 thousand tons) and tobacco (2.3 thousand tons). Ghana production in 2018, by FAO History Plant physiologist and his assistant examine a Cacao tree in Ghana in 1957. Under British colonial rule, Ghanaian farmers seized the opportunity to efficiently grow and export cocoa for the large British market, given that they had a safe food supply. The labor force needed for the labor- intensive production of cocoa in Ghana's fertile south was mainly constituted of migrant workers from the savannah of northern Ghana. This development was facilitated by the traditional Ghanaian system of communal purchase of land, which gave individual farmers the security of planting a cocoa tree that would take several years until being ready to harvest. Among other factors, this enabled Ghana to grow from zero in 1891 to the world's largest cocoa exporter in the world by 1911. The first president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah attempted to use agricultural wealth as a springboard for the country's overall economic development, Ghanaian agricultural output has consistently fallen since the 1960s. Beginning with the drop in commodity prices in the late 1960s, farmers were faced with fewer incentives to produce as well as with a general deterioration of necessary infrastructure and services. Farmers have also had to deal with increasingly expensive inputs, such as fertilizer, because of overvaluation of the cedi. Food production has fallen as well, with a decline in the food self-sufficiency ratio from 83 percent in 1965–66 to 71 percent in 1900–80, coupled with a fourfold increase in food imports in the decade prior to 1982. By 1983, when drought hit the region, food shortages were widespread, and export crop production reached an all-time low. When the Rawlings government initiated the first phase of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1984, agriculture was identified as the economic sector that could rescue Ghana from a financial ruin. Accordingly, since that time, the government has invested significant funds in the rehabilitation of agriculture. The government had directed capital toward repairing and improving the transportation and distribution infrastructure serving export crops. In addition, specific projects aimed at increasing cocoa yields and at developing the timber industry had been initiated. Except for specific development programs, however, the government had tried to allow the free market to promote higher producer prices and to increase efficiency. Harvesting and agriculture in Ghana in the 20th century Although the government was criticized for focusing on exports rather than on food crops under the [ ERP], by the early 1990s the Provisional National Defence Council had begun to address the need to increase local production of food. In early 1991, the government announced that one goal of the Medium Term agricultural Development Program 1991–2000 was to attain food self-sufficiency and security by the year 2000. To this end, the government sought to improve extension services for farmers and to improve crop-disease research. Despite the statements concerning the importance of food crops, however, the plan was still heavily oriented toward market production, improvement of Ghana's balance-of-payments position, and provision of materials for local industrial production. Furthermore, the government planned to rely more heavily on the private sector for needed services and to reduce the role of the public sector, a clear disadvantage for subsistence producers. In particular, industrial tree crops such as cocoa, coffee, and oil palm seedlings were singled out for assistance. Clearly, agricultural sectors that could not produce foreign exchange earnings were assigned a lower priority under the ERP. The people of the north attempted to reduce its role in marketing and assistance to farmers in several ways. In particular, the Cocoa Marketing Board steadily relinquished its powers over pricing and marketing. The government, furthermore, established a new farmers' organization, the Ghana National Association of Farmers and Fishermen, in early 1991 to replace the Ghana Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives. The new organization was to be funded by the farmers themselves to operate as a cooperative venture at the district, regional, and national levels. Although the government argued that it did not want to be accused of manipulating farmers, the lack of government financial support again put subsistence producers at a disadvantage.  Agricultural products  =Cocoa= Harvest processing of Cocoa beans in Ghana in the 20th century For over 81 years Agriculture in Ghana has been regulated by one of its highest yielding exports-Cocoa.https://cocobod.gh/the_ghana_cocostory.php Cocoa is Ghana's principal agricultural export. Cocoa production occurs in the forested areas of Ghana: Ashanti Region, Brong-Ahafo Region, Central Region, Eastern Region, Western Region, and Volta Region. The crop year begins in October while the smaller mid-crop cycle starts in July. All cocoa, except that which is smuggled out of the country, is sold at fixed prices. Although most cocoa production is carried out by peasant farmers, a small number of farmers appear to dominate the trade. The government controls the industry through the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod). , Ghana's cocoa bean exports were valued at $2,219.5 million (US). As of 2017 Ghana is ranked number two for Cocoa exports behind Côte d'Ivoire bringing in a $1,914 per metric ton (2204.6 lbs. • ~$.868/lbs) received; Cocoa is slated to exceed the national average supply by 97,500 metric tons. This massive increase, in turn, will cause \\"supply and demand\\" issues for larger and smaller farmers sharing a 1.3-billion-dollar syndicated loan disbursed by the government for the 2017–2018 season.http://cocobod.gh/ = Sweet Potato = The sweet potato is a viable resource, because it can be used for many things. The very roots of the sweet potato can be used to help mothers wean their children off of mother's milk. Even though the sweet potato is a good food source for humans, it can be also used in the feeding of livestock. Ghana is considered the leader in research of root crop. The sweet Potato is considered a prime crop. It is mostly grown in the northern parts of Ghana, as well as nationally. When the sweet potato is brought to market it is processed into things like flour, bread, and beverages are made. Northern Ghana has not been able to take full advantage of this food source, in every part of the country, because some of the land is not fertile, and a complex socioeconomic limitation such as many farm owners not being able to come together. This causes a disruption in the market. There is this mistrust among the local farmers because most of the farmers have different opinions on how the product should be marketed. There are five groups of people that help get the Sweet potato to market, the Farmers, traders, commission agents the processors and final the consumers. They all deal with each other in a private and individuals basis. Transportation of the sweet potato is mostly done by outside source such as hired transportation. =Commercial crops= A Maize farmer in Ghana The main industrial crops are oil palm, cotton, rubber, sugar cane, tobacco, and kenaf, the latter used in the production of fiber bags. None is of strategic economic importance, and all, apart from oil palms. Despite claims that such crops could assist local industrialization efforts, the government has not focused the same attention on this sector as on export crops. For example, sugar cane output has diminished with the closure of the country's two sugar mills, which produced 237,000 tons per year in 1974–76, but only 110,000 tons in 1989. The government has actually encouraged the export rather than the local processing of rubber, rehabilitating more than 3,000 hectares of plantations specifically for export production rather than revitalizing the local Bonsa Tire Company, which could produce only 400 tires per day in 1988 despite its installed capacity for 1,500 per day. By the 1990s, the tobacco sector was expanding and moving toward higher export production. Ghana's dark-fired leaf probably grew too fast and required rich soil to compete effectively with rival crops, but the potential for flue-cured and Burley varieties is good. Pricing difficulties had reduced tobacco production from 3,400 tons in the early 1970s to an estimated 1,433 tons in 1989. Output began to improve in 1990, reaching 2,080 tons. In 2006–2007 BAT (British America Tobacco) shut down their Torikawa plant amid a social movement against tobacco smoking which resulted from high taxes caused by heavy tobacco smuggling. The Leaf Development Company was established in 1988 to produce tobacco leaf for the local market and to lay the basis for a future export industry. In 1991, the company's first commercial crop amounted to 300 tons of flue-cured, 50 tons of Burley, and 50 tons of dark-fired tobacco (all green leaf weights), of which 250 tons were exported, earning US$380,000. In 1991 Rothmans, the British tobacco company, acquired a 49.5 percent stake in the company and took over management of the Meridian Tobacco Company in partnership with the state-owned Social Security and National Insurance Trust. Another firm, the Pioneer Tobacco Company, announced a 92 percent increase in post-tax profits of more than ¢1 billion for 1991. The company declared dividends worth ¢360 million, double the amount paid out in 1990. Cotton production expanded rapidly in the early and mid-1970s, reaching 24,000 tons in 1977, but it fell back to one-third of this figure in 1989. Since the reorganization of the Ghana Cotton Development Board into the Ghana Cotton Company, cotton production steadily increased from 4 percent of the country's national requirement to 50 percent in 1990. Between 1986 and 1989, Ghana saved US$6 million through local lint cotton production. The company expected that between 1991 and 1995, about 20,000 hectares of land would be put under cotton cultivation, enabling Ghana to produce 95 percent of the national requirement. =Food crops and livestock= The main food crops are corn, yams, cassava and other root crops. Despite government efforts to encourage farmers to switch to production of staples, total food production fell by an average of 2.7 percent per year between 1971–73 and 1981–83. By 1983 Ghana was self-sufficient in only one staple food crop—plantains. Food imports rose from 43,000 tons in 1973 to 152,000 tons in 1981. Those were various reasons for the declined performance, including growing urbanization and a shift in consumer preference from starchy home-grown staples to rice and corn. However, farmers also had to deal with shortages of production inputs, difficulties in transporting produce to market, and competition from imported foods that were underpriced because of the vastly overvalued Cedi. Weather also played a major part, particularly in 1983, when drought cut cereal production from 518,000 tons in 1982 to only 450,000 tons. Food imports in 1982–83 amounted to 115,000 tons, with the 1983–84 shortfall estimated at 370,000 tons.Livestock herding Bovinae (cattle) in Ashanti. There was a spectacular improvement beginning in 1984, mainly because of recovery from the prior year's drought. By 1988 the agricultural sector had vastly expanded, with food crops responsible for the bulk of the increase. Drought conditions returned in 1990, bringing massive falls in the production of all food crops apart from rice, but better weather and improved production brought prices down in 1991. In August 1990, the government moved to liberalize the agricultural sector, announcing the end of minimum crop prices. The measure's impact was difficult to gauge because higher production meant more food was available at better prices anyway. The government's medium-term plan, outlined in 1990, sought to raise average crop yields and to increase food security, with special attention to improved producer incentives and storage facilities. Livestock production was limited by the incidence of tsetse fly in Ghana's forested regions and by low grazing vegetation elsewhere and it was of major importance only in the relatively arid north and was not earmarked for special treatment. In 1989 there were an estimated 1.2 million cattle, 2.2 million sheep, 2 million goats, 550,000 pigs and 8 million chickens in Ghana. = Climate change and food production = Climate change affects food production, especially in the Dry Guinea Savannah spanning the three northern regions. Farmers continuously adapt their practices with the pursuit of weather and climate information for informed decision-making.  Transportation  Zebu cattle being transported by road in the Northern Region One of the challenges to Ghana's agricultural economy is its lack of transportation. Transportation is fundamental to the distribution of crops and livestock. Ghana has seen its economic growth slow down in recent years, particularly its agricultural market. Transportation helps farmers link their products to local consumers. It helps link rural communities to the marketplace, and increases economic productivity. It would help expand the market to the entire country, instead of local communities. As of 2009, Ghana has a road network stretching 67,448 km. 41% of the road network considered to be in decent condition, which is a major hindrance for the transport of agricultural products. Farmers in Ghana have complained about the country's lack of transportation. The World Bank strongly advised Ghana to drastically improve its transportation to improve its agriculture and economy. According to David Asare Asiamah (Founder and CEO of AgroMindest), \\"Most of the farm produce just go to waste in the remote areas because farmers find it difficult transporting their farm produce to the market to sell. The roads don’t exist and most remote areas find themselves cut off from the rest of the country. And because there are no proper storage facilities in these areas, a lot of the produce just rot away\\". There have been recent attempts to improve the transportation of agriculture in Ghana. In 2018, a Ghanaian startup, Agrocenta, won a 500,000 investment from Seedstars World. The role of Agrocenta is to use its online platform to connect local farmers to an online market. Trucks are then available to any farmer in small village with the click of a button. Agrocenta connects local farmers to buyers that purchase the goods at fair market prices.

It has in its present incarnation been in existence since 2004. History UYUC Crest Attempts had been made in the 1920s to create a youth movement linked to that of the Conservative Party (the Junior Imperial and Constitutional League) without much success. A second attempt was made before the outbreak of the Second World War, which also failed. The UYUC was formed by the Standing Committee of the Ulster Unionist Council in 1946 and quickly became a successful movement in South & West Belfast, Fermanagh and Down.Faulkner, Brian, Memoirs of a Statesman, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1978 The body's first Chairman was future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Brian FaulknerIn the Land of King Canute: the Influence of Border Unionism on Ulster Unionist Politics, 1945–63 H Patterson - Contemporary British History, 2006 In 1959, Brian Maginess, Q.C., and Sir Clarence Graham, Bt., spoke to the Young Unionists advocating an increase in Roman Catholic membership of the UUP. This was regarded as controversial at the time. The body created many prominent figures in Northern Ireland politics throughout the 1960s and 1970s such as Bill Craig and John D. Taylor; however, disagreements over Government policy and other factors left the body in disarray by the early 1970s, and it disbanded following the collapse of the Stormont Parliament. The body re- emerged under the Chairmanship of David McNarry and continued to thrive throughout the 1980s, producing figures such as Edgar Graham, Jeffrey Donaldson, Peter Weir and Arlene Foster with the latter 3 defecting to the DUP. 1990s to present The body's membership was strongly opposed to the Belfast Agreement in 1998, and many campaigned against it. At the 2004 AGM the officers voted to disband the group. The organisation reconstituted shortly after it disbanded and has since enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The UYUC has branches at Queen's University, Belfast, the University of Ulster and branches at constituency level in the City of Belfast, Mid-Ulster/West Tyrone, Lagan Valley and also Newry and Armagh/South Down, as well as Fermanagh & South Tyrone. The youth wing has produced many current and former senior faces in the party including The Lord Laird, The Lord Rogan, Jeffrey Donaldson MP MLA and David McNarry MLA, all of whom are former Chairmen, as well as Sir Reg Empey MLA, who served as Vice Chairman. Current activities In recent years the Young Unionists have continued to function as an active political youth wing. In the 2014 local government elections 11 members of the Young Unionists were returned as councillors. This represents over 10% of the UUP's total councillors.

The United States Air Force (USAF) had ordered 179 KC-45As in the first stage of replacing the aging Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker tankers currently in service. However, the contest was reopened in July 2008, after Boeing's protest of the award was upheld. In response to the new contest, on 8 March 2010, Northrop Grumman announced it was abandoning its bid for the new contract, with its CEO stating that the revised bid requirement favoured Boeing. On 20 April 2010, EADS (now known as Airbus SE) announced it was re-entering the competition and entered a bid with the KC-45. Eventually, the USAF selected the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus. Development =Background= From the late 1990s the USAF decided to replace its fleet of KC-135s. Initially the first batch of replacements was to be an air tanker version of the Boeing 767-200, which was selected over the Airbus 330-based tanker. Instead of outright purchase, as is the usual practice, the Air Force would lease the 767 tankers from Boeing. In January 2006, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the cancellation of the KC-767 contract. Rumsfeld stated that this move would in no way impair the Air Force's ability to deliver the mission of the KC-767, which was to be accomplished by continuing upgrades to the KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender fleets.U.S. plans expedited rerun of aerial tanker contest Retrieved 9 July 2008. =KC-X program= In 2006, the USAF released a request for proposal (RFP) for a new tanker aircraft, known as the KC-X RFP, which was updated in January 2007 and was to be selected by 2007.\\"The USAF’s KC-X Aerial Tanker RFP\\". Defense Industry Daily, 12 July 2010. KC-X is the first phase of three acquisition programs to replace the KC-135 fleet. On 29 February 2008, the Department of Defense announced that it had selected the Northrop Grumman \\"KC-30\\" (designated the KC-45A by the USAF) over the Boeing KC-767 for the first stage of the program. On 11 March 2008, Boeing filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for the award of the contract to Northrop Grumman; Following the protest filing, Northrop Grumman and Boeing engaged in media campaigns in support of their tanker aircraft. On 18 June 2008, the Government Accountability Office upheld the protest by Boeing on the decision to award the contract to Northrop Grumman, indicating that the USAF had not properly evaluated the Boeing and Northrop Grumman bids. On 9 July 2008 Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced the contract for the KC-45 as an \\"expedited recompetition\\". Defense Undersecretary John Young was placed in charge of the review process, the Air Force having been removed from the award process. On 10 September 2008, the US Defense Department canceled the KC-X solicitation. Funding for KC-X is to be requested for FY10-FY15. In September 2009, the USAF began the first steps toward accepting new bids. In March 2010, Northrop Grumman announced that it would pull out of the bidding process. EADS and Boeing submitted their final KC-X tanker bids on 10 February 2011. On 24 February 2011, the USAF announced the Boeing's bid had won the KC-X contract. =Production plans= The first four units would have been converted from passenger versions at EADS EFW in Dresden, Germany. Airbus planned to assemble the aircraft in Mobile, Alabama, after which they would have been modified by Northrop Grumman. EADS had also announced plans to shift A330 commercial freighter assembly to Alabama. As the winner of the Air Force contract, Northrop Grumman and EADS (the airframe subcontractor) were expected to invest approximately US$600 million in new assembly plants in the United States adjacent to one another in the Brookley Complex in Mobile. EADS's failure to win the contract meant that the Alabama production line for the Airbus A330 was never set up. However, on 30 June 2012, EADS announced a new factory at Mobile, Alabama to manufacture the narrow-body Airbus A320, which began operations on 14 September 2015. Design The A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) is a military derivative of the Airbus A330 airliner. It is designed as a dual-role air refueling tanker and cargo transport aircraft. The wing air refueling pods are supplied by the British company Cobham. The cargo hold has been modified by Telair to be able to transport military pallets in addition to civilian ULD. The A330 MRTT has a fuel capacity of 245,000 lb (111,000 kg) in the wings and underfloor tanks. The underfloor tanks do not compromise main deck cargo capacity or seating in the strategic transport role. Standard fuel capacity allows the carriage of an additional 43,000 kg of cargo. The A330 MRTT's wing has common structure as the four-engine A340-200/-300 with reinforced mounting locations for the A340's outboard engines. The A330 MRTT's wing therefore requires little modification for use of these hardpoints for the wing refueling pods.A330-200 Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) – Multi-Role Tanker Transporter (MRTT), Europe.

In 1982 the yield was 234,100 tons, composed of 199,100 tons of marine varieties and 35,000 tons of freshwater fish from Lake Volta. The industry was hit by fuel shortages, inadequate storage facilities, and the general economic difficulties of the 1970s and the 1980s. In 1988 the fish catch was 302,900 tons.

Library of Congress Federal Research Division (November 1994). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Large-scale poaching by foreign vessels has severely depleted fish stocks in Ghana's maritime Exclusive Economic Zone, causing major government concern. The most affected stocks are sea bottom-feeding fish. Tuna stocks reportedly remain unaffected. A 1992 Ministry of Food and Agriculture report recommended that the government accelerate mobilization of surveillance and enforcement units and step up regulation of trawler fleets. In 1992 the government passed a fisheries law to curb overfishing and to help protect the marine environment. Fishermen were banned from catching specified shellfish, and all fishing vessel operators were required to obtain licenses. The law provided for a regulatory body—the Fisheries Monitoring, Control, Surveillance, and Enforcement Unit—as well as a fisheries advisory council. These organizations, however, both of which are underfunded and undermanned, are unlikely to stop illegal fishing activities anytime soon.

The sector is estimated to contribute 3% of the total GDP and 5% of the GDP in agriculture. About 10% of the country's population is engaged in various aspects of the fishing industry.  Future Plans For the Ghanaian Fishing Industry  The current president of Ghana, Nana Akuffo Addo, created a ministry of fisheries and agricultural development in Ghana.

Forests cover about one-third of Ghana's total area, with commercial forestry concentrated in the southern parts of Ghana. History The forestry sector of Ghana accounted for 4.2 percent of GDP in 1990; timber was the country's third largest foreign exchange earner. Since 1983 forestry has benefited from more than US$120 million in investments and has undergone substantial changes, resulting in doubled earnings between 1985 and 1990. In 1993 timber and wood products earnings totaled US$140 million against a targeted level of US$130 million. Between January and November 1994, exports amounted to 919,000 tons and earned US$212 million.Clark, Nancy L. \\"Forestry in Ghana\\". A Country Study: Ghana (La Verle Berry, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (November 1994). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Until the 1980s, forestry production suffered because of the overvalued cedi and deterioration of the transportation infrastructure. Log production declined by 66 percent during 1970- 81 and sawed timber by 47 percent. Exports fell from US$130 million in 1973 to US$15 million in 1983, and four nationalized firms went bankrupt during that period. The forestry sector was given a large boost in 1986, with a US$24 million timber rehabilitation credit, which financed imports of logging equipment. As a consequence, log production rose 65 percent in 1984-87, and export revenues rose 665 percent in 1983-88. Furthermore, the old Ghana Timber Marketing Board was disbanded and replaced by two bodies, the Timber Export Development Board—responsible for marketing and pricing, and the Forest Products Inspection Bureau—responsible for monitoring contracts, maintaining quality standards, grading products, and acting as a watchdog for illegal transactions. Some of the external financing underwrote these institutional changes, while much of the rest financed forestry management and research as well as equipment for logging, saw milling, and manufacturing. Timber logs and Timber rafting at Takoradi Harbour in Ghana in the 20th Century. The sector, however, faced several problems. The most important was severe deforestation. A century ago, Ghana's tropical hardwood forest extended from about the middle of the country southward to the sea. Moreover, nearly half the country was covered with forests, which included 680 species of trees and several varieties of mahoganies. Most of this wood has been cut. By the early 1990s, only about one-third of the country was still forested, and not all of this was of commercial value. This situation has forced the government to make difficult choices between desperately needed hard currency earnings and conservation. The Forest Resource Management Project, part of the economic recovery program (ERP), was initiated in 1988, and in 1989 the government banned log exports of eighteen species. The government later extended the list and imposed high duties on other species, planning to phase out log and air- dried timber exports altogether by 1994. Instead, the government hoped to increase sales of wood products to replace earnings from logs. Government figures showed that one cubic meter of lumber and plywood was worth more than twice as much as the same amount of logs; veneers earned five times as much; and other products, such as furniture and floorings, earned six times the price of an equivalent volume of logs. Improvements in the processing sector caused wood products (excluding lumber) to rise to about 20 percent of export earnings in 1991, accounting for 6.9 percent of volume exports. By comparison, wood products represented 11 percent of earnings and 5.5 percent of volume in 1985. The fall in the proportion of volume sales accounted for by logs was accompanied by a dramatic fall in their share in earnings, from 50-60 percent in the mid-1980s to 23 percent in 1990. Overview Processed timber By the early 1990s, there were approximately 220 lumber processors in Ghana, but the industry operated under several constraints. Most overseas demand is for kiln- dried products, and Ghanaian manufacturers lacked sufficient kilns to meet that demand. The cheap air-dried processing method was not satisfactory because air-dried wood tends to destabilize over time. Foreign investment incentives were not so attractive in this sector as in others, for example, mining. Furthermore, infrastructure in the Western Region where lumber processing is located continued to be relatively neglected compared with mining and cocoa production regions. Other difficulties include lack of expertise at technological and managerial levels. Scandals have been reported in Ghana's forestry industry since 1986, and they erupted again in early 1992. The most notable case involved African Timber and Plywood, once Ghana's largest exporter of round logs. In the mid-1980s, the government embarked on a US$36 million rehabilitation project to boost the company's production. In 1992 as much as US$2.3 million was alleged to have been siphoned off from the project through various malpractices, and a number of officials were arrested. Furthermore, the environmental group, Friends of the Earth, alleged that there had been additional thefts by foreign companies totaling almost US$50 million in hard currency during the 1980s. In 1992 the government began investigating the activities of hundreds of companies, both foreign and local, that were alleged to have entered into a range of illegal dealings including smuggling, fraudulent invoicing, violation of local currency regulations, corruption, bribery, and nonpayment of royalties. The corruption is so widespread, however, that it remains to be seen on whether the Ghanahian authorities will stop timber-related crimes anytime soon.

The line is off the Midland Main Line at Duffield railway station, the first being Hazelwood. Shottle Railway station was reopened on 9 August 2014, by the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. Location The station is located just off the A517 road, which is the main route from Belper to Ashbourne. New access has been created, and passengers can now access the station from the step entrance off the A517 Belper - Ashbourne Road, near to the cross-roads with the B5023. Disabled access is currently still under construction at this time. The road to the east of the line is private, belonging to the company which owns the station buildings. It is a request-only stop. The nearest settlement to the station is the group of dwellings and public house at the road junction, known as Cowers Lane. However, the station is more or less equidistant from the two slightly larger settlements of Turnditch to the west, and Shottlegate to the east. History Opened with other stations on the branch line to Wirksworth on 1 October 1867, it was designed by the Midland Railway company architect John Holloway Sanders. Shottle remained open until 16 June 1947, when the Wirksworth branch passenger service was withdrawn on a temporary basis in response to postwar fuel shortages. This was made permanent with effect from May 1949, when the line was removed from the summer timetable. Freight facilities remained rail-served at Shottle until 2 March 1964, while the branch continued to be used for mineral traffic until December 1989. The station buildings, platform and former railway cottages remain, the former and part of the station yard being owned by a local oil distribution company who use the building as their headquarters and have repaired its structure in a sympathetic manner. Public access to the site is limited. The Branch is owned by WyvernRail plc and forms part of the Heritage Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. The section of the line through Shottle is now in use by passenger services (as is the station itself that has now recently reopened to passengers for the very first time in 65 years since 1947). However, the platform is open (but the station building remains within privacy). Principal traffic on this section comprises road/rail plant that uses the line as part of a formal acceptance procedure for the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB). To support these operations, siding space has been reinstated at the site. During the 2012 season, a passing loop was constructed at Shottle, allowing train services to continue while the platform was being rebuilt, and the pointwork at the southern end having slewed into a Y-shape over the winter months. A temporary speed limit is in place. As of March 2016, two-train running is now possible following completion of rebuilding work, increasing train services to approximately seven round-trip services a day.

The Mining industry of Ghana accounts for 5% of the country's GDP and minerals make up 37% of total exports, of which gold contributes over 90% of the total mineral exports. Thus, the main focus of Ghana's mining and minerals development industry remains focused on gold. Ghana is Africa's largest gold producer, producing 80.5 t in 2008. Ghana is also a major producer of bauxite, manganese and diamonds. Ghana has 23 large-scale mining companies producing gold, diamonds, bauxite and manganese, and, there are also over 300 registered small scale mining groups and 90 mine support service companies. Other mineral commodities produced in the country are natural gas, petroleum, salt, and silver.Bermúdez- Lugo, Omayra. \\"The Mineral Industry of Ghana\\" (PDF). 2006 Minerals Yearbook. United States Geological Survey (May 2008).

The Chamber also provides information on Ghana's mining laws to the public negotiates with the mine labor unions on behalf of its member companies. The overall legislative framework for the mining sector in Ghana is provided by the Minerals and Mining Act of 2006 (Act 703). Under the Law, mining companies must pay royalties; companies may also pay corporate taxes at standard rates. Other legislation that affects mining and mineral exploration in Ghana includes the Minerals Commission Law of 1986 (PNDC Law 154); the Small-Scale Gold Mining Law of 1989; the Investment Promotion Act, 1994 (Act 478); the Additional Profits Tax Law, 1985 (PNDC Law 122); the Minerals (Royalties) Regulations, 1987 (LI 1349); the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1994 (Act 490); and the Environmental Assessment Regulations, 1999, and as amended, 2002.

Industry structure In the gold sector, Gold Fields Limited of South Africa held a 71.1% interest in the Tarkwa and the Damang gold mines in a joint venture with Toronto-based IAMGOLD Corp. (18.9%), and the Government of Ghana (10%) (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2005, p. 41). AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. of South Africa operated the Bibiani and the Iduapriem open pit gold mines and the Obuasi underground gold mine. The Bibiani and the Obuasi mines were 100% owned by AngloGold Ashanti and the Iduapriem mine was 80% owned by AngloGold Ashanti and 20% by the International Finance Corporation (AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., 2006a-c). Golden Star Resources Ltd. held a 90% interest in the Bogoso/Prestea and the Wassa open pit mines and a 90% interest in the idled Prestea underground mine. Newmont Mining Corporation of the United States held a 100% interest in the Ahafo gold property and an 85% interest in the Akyem gold property. Companies exploring for gold in Ghana included Adamus Resources Ltd., African Gold plc, Asante Gold Corporation, Moydow Mines International Inc., Pelangio Mines Inc., Perseus Mining Limited, and Xtra Gold Resources In the bauxite and alumina sector, Alcoa Inc. of the United States held a 10% interest in Volta Aluminum Company Ltd. (Valco); the remaining equity was owned by the Government. Alcan Aluminum Ltd. of Canada held an 80% interest in Ghana Bauxite Company Ltd.; the Government held the remaining 20% interest. Commodities =Aluminum, bauxite, and alumina= In January 2005, Alcoa signed a memorandum of understanding with the government to develop an integrated aluminum industry in Ghana that would include bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminum production, and rail transportation infrastructure upgrades. The MOU called for the restart of three of the five existing potlines at the idled Valco smelter, which would produce about 120,000 metric tonnes per year (t/yr) of aluminum; the designed capacity of the plant is 200,000 t/yr. The government and Alcoa planned to restart the Valco smelter as soon as an interim power rate agreement is reached with the Volta River Authority. The government (90%) was to be the managing owner of the smelter and Alcoa (10%), through its subsidiary, Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals [a joint venture between Alcoa Inc. (60%) and Alcoa Limited of Australia (40%)] was to supply alumina and serve as the distributor of export sales of aluminum. The government had acquired Kaiser Aluminum Corp.’s 90% interest in Valco in 2004. Kaiser closed the Valco plant in 2003 after struggling with fluctuating operating levels for several years and dealing with restricted power allocations from the Volta River Authority. Canada-based Alcan Inc. and the United States' Alcoa Inc. were the two companies that mined bauxite and alumina. During 2006, Alcoa continued to study the possibility of developing an integrated aluminum industry in Ghana that would include bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminum production, and rail transportation infrastructure upgrades. Alcan, on the other hand, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government for the creation of a joint venture to explore the feasibility of developing a bauxite mine and a 1.5–2.0 million metric tonnes per year (Mt/yr) alumina refinery in Ghana. =Gold= More than 21% of gold production in the early 1990s came from underground mines in western and Ashanti Region, with the remainder coming from river beds in Ashanti Region and Central Region. During the early 1990s, AGC (Ghana's largest gold producer) saw its overall share of the domestic gold market decline from 80% to 60% as other operators entered the industry. In 1992 Ghana's gold production surpassed 1 million fine ounces, up from 327,000 fine ounces in 1987. In March 1994, the Ghanaian government announced that it would sell half of its 55% stake in AGC for an estimated US$250 million, which would then be spent on development projects. The authorities also plan to use some of the capital from the stock sale to promote local business and to boost national reserves. The minister of mines and energy dispelled fears that the stock sale would result in foreign ownership of the country's gold mines by saying that the government would have final say in all major stock acquisitions. In the gold sector, Red Back Mining Inc. of Canada, [through its subsidiary Chirano Gold Mines Ltd. (CGML)] operated the Chirano gold mine; AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. of South Africa operated the Bibiani, the Iduapriem, and the Obuasi gold mines; Golden Star Resources Ltd. of Canada operated the Bogoso/Prestea, the Prestea Underground, and the Wassa gold mines; Gold Fields Ltd. of South Africa operated the Damang gold mine; and Denver-based Newmont Mining Corp. held interest in the Ahafo and the Akyem gold properties. In October 2005, Red Back Mining. of Canada [through its subsidiary Chirano Gold Mines Limited (CGML)] commissioned a new mine in Ghana. The mine, known as the Chirano gold mine, was an open pit operation located about 21 kilometers (km) to the south of AngloGold Ashanti's Bibiani gold mine in western Ghana. The Chirano gold mine produced 941 kilograms (kg) (reported as 30,247 troy ounces) in 2005 and was 100% owned by Red Back; the government had the option to exercise its right to back into a 10% ownership in CGML. Chirano was scheduled to produce an average of about 3,800 kg (reported as 123,000 troy ounces) per year during a period of 8½ years. The designed capacity of the processing plant was 2.1 million metric tons per year (Mt/yr). A revised resource and reserve estimate for the Chirano Mine was underway in 2005. The economic potential of the Akwaaba deposit, a high-grade deposit within the Chirano mining concession, was being evaluated in 2005, and a resource estimate of the deposit was scheduled for completion in October 2006. In 2005 gold production at the Bibiani Mine came from the processing of ore from the mine's remaining pits, stockpiled ore, and tailings. Satellite pits were depleted in December 2005, and AngloGold Ashanti expected stockpiled ore to be depleted by January 2006. Beginning in February, the mill was to process only old tailings. The Bibiani Mine, which had operated between 1903 and 1968 as an underground mine, was reopened in 1998 as an open pit mine with a carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant. The mine included old tailings dumps, which were reclaimed in December 2004. These tailings were expected to yield about 3.9 million metric tons (Mt) of ore at an estimated recovery grade of 0.60 gram per metric ton (g/t) gold during a period of 18 months. The company was studying the viability of restarting production from its main pit to a depth of about 60 meters below. the current pit floor. Underground exploration was suspended in July 2005 and the underground mine continued to be on care-and-maintenance status. Gold production was expected to decrease to 1 1,700 kg in 2006 from 3,580 kg (reported as 11 115,000 troy ounces) in 2005. Gold production at the Iduapriem open pit mine increased to 6,380 kg in 2005 (reported as 205,000 troy ounces) from 4,570 kg in 2004 owing to an increase in throughput at the processing plant. AngloGold Ashanti held an 80% interest in the Iduapriem Mine; the remaining 20% was held by the International Finance Corporation. The company also held a 90% interest in the Teberebie Mine, which is adjacent to the Iduapriem Mine; the government held the remaining 10% interest. In 2005, gold production at the Obuasi underground mine was hindered by a breakdown at the main processing plant during the first quarter of 2005 and the failure of a primary crusher during the third quarter; production, however, increased to 12,200 kg (reported as 391,000 troy ounces) from 7,930 kg in 2004 mostly owing to the start of mining from the Kubi surface oxide deposit. In terms of growth prospects, the company planned to develop the deep-level ore deposits at Obuasi known as the Obuasi Deeps, which were expected to extend the project's mine life to 2040. The development of Obuasi Deeps will require an initial investment of $44 million during the next 4 years to conduct further exploration and feasibility studies. The total capital expenditure for the development of the Obuasi Deeps was estimated to be about $570 million. AngloGold Ashanti held a 100% interest in the Obuasi Mine. The Wassa open pit gold mine produced 2,149 kg of gold in 2005. The mine, which is located about 150 km west of Accra, was owned by Golden Star (90%) and the government (10%). The mine had been in operation as an open pit heap-leach mine in the 1990s but was closed in 2001. Golden Star acquired the mine in 2002 after determining that conventional CIL processing was economically feasible. Plant feed in 2005 was a mixture of newly mined ore from the Wassa pit blended with material from the heap-leach pads left by the previous operation. Golden Star's planned to increase production at Wassa to about 3,700 kg (reported as 120,000 troy ounces) in 2006 and to produce about 4,000 kg (reported as 130,000 troy ounces) in 2007 as higher-grade ores are reached at deeper levels. As of December 31, 2005, total probable mineral reserves at Wassa were reported to be 21.9 Mt at a grade of 1.34 g/t gold. In addition to the Wassa Mine, Golden Star operated the Bogoso/Prestea open pit mine, which is located about 300 km west of Accra. Bogoso/Prestea produced 4,103 kg of gold in 2005. Golden Star held a 90% interest in the property, and the government of Ghana held the remaining 10%. About 75% of the remaining ore reserve at Bogoso/Prestea is sulfide. Because this type of ore cannot be processed using the company's existing CIL plant, the company decided in June 2005 to build a new 3.5-Mt/yr processing plant which will use biooxidation to treat the remaining sulfide ore. The new processing plant was scheduled to be completed in late 2006. The Prestea Underground gold mine, which is also 90% owned by Golden Star, remained idle during the year. Prestea Underground was closed in early 2002 owing to low gold prices. During 2005, a total of 8,096 meters of underground exploration drilling was completed at the mine; drilling was to continue in 2006. Golden Star planned to complete a prefeasibility study by the end of 2006 to evaluate the economic potential of restarting production at Prestea Underground. As of December 31, 2005, inferred mineral resources at the mine were estimated to be 6.1 Mt at an average grade of 8.1 g/t. In 2005, N Newmont announced the company was advancing the Ahafo and the Akyem gold properties to production. The Ahafo property, which is located about 300 km northwest of Accra between the towns of Kenyase and Ntotoroso, was expected to begin production during the second half of 2006. Production of gold was expected to be about 17,100 kilograms per year (kg/yr) (reported as 550,000 troy ounces), with a mine life estimated to be more than 20 years. The company was awaiting the issuance of a mining license for the development of the Akyem property, which is located in Ghana's eastern region, about 130 km northwest of Accra between the towns of New Abirem and Ntronang. Newmont expected to begin production at Akyem in 2008 and to produce about 15,500 kg/yr of gold (reported as 500,000 troy ounces). About 19.6 Mt of ore was processed at Tarkwa in 2005 from which 21,051 kg of gold was produced (Gold Fields Limited, 2006§). In November 2005, a new semiautogenous grinding (SAG) mill and CIL plant were commissioned at the Tarkwa Mine. The Tarkwa Mine, which is located in southwestern Ghana about 300 km west of Accra, consists of several open pit operations, one CIL plant, and two heap-leach facilities. Some underground mining had been conducted in the past, but underground operations ended in 1999. As of June 30, 2005, proven and probable reserves at Tarkwa were estimated to be about 417,000 kg of gold (reported as 13.4 million troy ounces) and to last until 2025 at current production rates. The Damang Mine, which is located in the Wassa West District in southwestern Ghana about 360 km west of Accra and 30 km northeast of Tarkwa Mine, consists of an open pit operation, a SAG mill, and a CIL plant. The mine processed about 5.2 Mt of ore in 2005 and produced about 7,700 kg of gold. Owing to the depletion of the high-grade ore in the main Damang pit, an exploration program to seek for alternative ore sources was launched during the year. The exploration program resulted in the establishment of the Amoanda, the Rex, and the Tomento pits, and the extension of an old pit at Kwesie-Lima. Gold Fields and its partners reported that production from the new pits was to be processed along with stockpiles of lower grade ore. Mining of the Tomento pit began in July 2005 and mining of the Amoanda pit began during the fourth quarter of 2005; production from the Rex pit was scheduled to begin in 2007. As of June 30, 2005, proven and probable reserves at Damang were estimated to be about 40,000 kg of gold (reported as 1.3 million troy ounces) and were projected to last until 2010 at current production rates. =Manganese= Of the 1.6 million metric tons (Mt) of manganese ore produced in 2006, about 52%, or 832,000 t, was shipped to Ukraine; 37%, or 584,000 t, was shipped to China; and the remaining 184,000 t was shipped to Norway. Manganese carbonate ore exported from Ghana has traditionally been used in China as raw material in the production of silicomanganese. Less than 100,000 metric tons per year (t/yr) of this ore material was used to produce electrolytic manganese metal in China, but China's demand for manganese metal was projected to increase to 300,000 t in 2007. China's other supplier of manganese ore was Mexico. Privat Group of Ukraine, which also used manganese ore from Ghana, imported about 832,000 t in 2006. Privat Group acquired the right to manage Ghana Manganese Co. and, as its first order of business, indicated that it intended to amend all existing manganese contracts. Ghana is one of the world's leading exporters of manganese; however, only 279,000 tons were produced in 1992, compared with the all-time high of 638,000 tons in 1974–75. Ghana has reserves exceeding 60 million tons, and considerable rehabilitation of the sector took place in the 1980s. Ghana National Manganese Corporation's mine and the surrounding infrastructure were repaired, helping to raise production from a low of 159,000 tons in 1983 to 284,000 tons in 1989 and 247,000 tons in 1990. The corporation earned US$20 million from its exports in 1991, up from US$11.6 million in 1989 and US$14.2 million in 1990. Approximately US$85 million was also invested by private investors at the newly explored Kwesikrom deposit. contact Golden Eagle limited the main manganese mining company in 2010, =Diamond= Diamond was recovered by artisanal miners from alluvial and in situ diamond deposits near A Akwatia in the Birim Valley. The only formal commercial production came from a diamond placer mine in Akwatia, which was operated by Government-owned Ghana Consolidated Diamonds Ltd. (GCD). At least one company, Paramount Mining Corporation Ltd., explored for diamond at two properties in Ghana in 2006. In February 2006, the company entered into a joint-venture agreement with Leo Shield Exploration Ghana Ltd. to earn interest in the Osenase project, which covers an area of 330 square kilometers (km²) located about 25 kilometers (km) south of the Akwatia Diamond Project. Field work began in March 2006. A number of pits were dug in both alluvial and hard rock deposits. A total of 83 diamonds, which together weighed more than and the largest of which was , were recovered from the gravel of alluvial deposits. The project area also contained gold and columbite-tantalite minerals in the alluvial material. The other property, which was known as Ochinso, covers an area of 37 km² within the Birim Diamond Field of southern Ghana. Paramount, through a farm-in arrangement with Aurion Resources Ltd. of Ghana, would be entitled to acquire 85% of the equity interest in the concession. At least 72 diamonds and 325 small gold grains from 20 small test pits were recovered from the property in 2006. The pits were situated in a number of different river systems throughout the Ochinso project area. Most of the diamonds recovered were reportedly of commercial size ranging between 1 and 2 millimeters (mm), with an average stone size of . The government also is trying to expand Ghana's diamond-mining industry, which has produced primarily industrial grade gems from alluvial gravels since the 1920s. More than of proven and probable reserves are located about seventy miles northwest of Accra. The main producer is the state-owned Ghana Consolidated Diamonds (GCD), which operates in the Birim River Basin. In the 1960s, the company mined of diamonds a year, but annual production in 1991 amounted to only . This downturn resulted from technical problems and GCD's weak financial position. Production from all mines came to in 1991 and to in 1992. Diamond production was recovered by artisanal miners from alluvial and in situ diamond deposits near Akwatia in the Birim Valley. The only formal commercial production came from a diamond placer mine in Akwatia, which was operated by Government-owned Ghana Consolidated Diamonds Ltd. (GCD). According to a 2004 report by Partnership Africa Canada and Global Witness Publishing Inc.,2004, p. 3–4 prior to the creation of the PMMC in 1989, as much as 70% of Ghana's diamond was smuggled out of the country. Following the creation of PMMC, diamond was initially shipped to a PMMC office in Antwerp, Belgium, for sale; currently, an open market has been established in Ghana in which registered buyers can operate from offices within the country and in which licensed diamond traders are allowed to operate. All buyers (exclusively Ghanaian nationals) must transfer U.S. dollars through the Central Bank in advance for the purchase of diamond. Only about 200 of the 1,000 registered buyers were thought to be active during 2004. Purchased diamond was kept under lock in the custody of the PMMC and subject to inspection before being exported. According to the report, Ghana was fully implementing the Kimberley Process but the country lacked the resources to monitor and control illicit diamond mining and buying, especially from the artisanal mining areas. In Akwatia, for example, an informal diamond market existed where no paperwork was required to buy or sell diamond; this market was known locally as the \\"Belgian market\\". The report also indicated the possibility of diamond being smuggled from Côte d'Ivoire, especially following the sanctions on diamond exports imposed on this country in 2004 (Partnership Africa Canada and Global Witness Publishing Inc., 2004, p. 3–5). It was reported that while annual diamond production from GCD continued to decline, diamond production from artisanal miners was increasing and that there was a possibility for the privatization of GCD. Foreign companies (not identified) were said to be interested in the Akwatia alluvial diamond field in the upper Birim River catchment area. =Cement= The Building and Road Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research of Ghana was conducting laboratory tests to evaluate the possibility of producing pozzolana cement from bauxite mining waste (known as red mud or clay). The two companies that produced cement in Ghana, Ghana Cement Works Ltd. and Diamond Cement Ghana Limited used imported clinker, gypsum, and limestone for the manufacturing of cement. About 2 Mt of clinker was imported in 2003 for the production of Portland cement. =Petroleum= Petroleum exploration activities have been conducted in Ghana since the late nineteenth century; and commercially sustainable deposits of petroleum or natural gas was discovered in 2008 by Kosmos. The total crude oil found is estimated to be about 6.5 million barrels. Production started in early 2010 in the Jubilee Field and as at 21 April 2011, Kosmos alone has lifted 1.9 million barrels from the Jubilee Field. The Saltpond oilfield, which produced a total of 294,430 barrels when it reopened in 2002 to its closing in 2004. Gas flared at Saltpond averaged 2 million cubic feet per day. The Tema Oil Refinery refined all the crude petroleum imported into the country, with the exception of consignments going to the Takoradi thermal powerplant. At least two companies were exploring for petroleum in the country in 2006. These included Dallas- based Kosmos Energy LLC, which was conducting exploration offshore at West Cape Three Points Block, and Vanco Energy Co. of the United States, which explored for petroleum at the Cape Three Points Deepwater Block (CTPD) in the Tano-Ivorian Basin. Dallas-based Kosmos Energy LLC held an 86.5% working interest in the West Cape Three Points (WCTP) Block in the Gulf of Guinea’s Tano Basin. In 2005, the company conducted a 1,075-km2 three-dimensional (3-D) survey to evaluate the potential of the block. The WCTP Block is located about 8 km from the Ghanaian coastline and 95 km southwest of the city of Takoradi. The remaining interest in WCTP was held by GNPC (10%) and E.O. Group of Ghana (3.5%). Final environmental impact assessment permits were granted in Benin, Ghana, and Togo for the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) between March and April 2005. The West Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAGPCo) was granted a license to construct the pipeline in April, and the first shipload of about 8,000 pipes was delivered to the Tema Port in May. In September, Chevron Corporation, the WAGP project manager, announced that WAGPCo had begun the installation of the 569 km main offshore segment of the pipeline. The WAGP was expected to be operational by December 2006 and to deliver gas to powerplants and industries in Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo. Vanco Energy Company explored for petroleum at the Cape Three Points Deepwater Block (CTPD), which is located in the Tano-Ivorian Basin. The company had signed an exploration agreement with the Government in 2002 at which time it conducted a two- dimensional (2-D) seismic program to evaluate the block. In 2005, the company carried out a 1,500-km2 3-D seismic program to further define the structural and stratigraphic prospects in the block. The first well in the CTPD Block was planned for 2007. Environmental impact Land disturbances at ASGM site at Talensi District The Ghanaian Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was the Government entity responsible for the formulation of policies on all aspects of the environment. The agency's functions included acting in liaison and cooperating with other Government agencies; collaborating with foreign and international agencies, as necessary; conducting investigations into environmental issues; coordinating the activities of bodies concerned with the technical aspects of the environment for the purpose of controlling the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of industrial waste; ensuring compliance with environmental impact assessment procedures; issuing environmental permits and pollution abatement notices; making recommendations to the Government for the protection of the environment; prescribing standards and guidelines related to the pollution of air, water, and land; protecting and improving the quality of the environment; and securing the control and prevention of discharge waste into the environment among several other functions. In 2005, the Center for Public Interest Law and the Center for Environmental Law, two Accra-based nongovernmental organizations, sued Bonte Gold Mines Ltd. (an 85% owned subsidiary of Akrokeri-Ashanti Gold Mines Inc. of Canada), Ghana's Minerals Commission, and the EPA for the reclamation of the environment after the cessation of Bonte's gold mining operations along the Jeni River. Bonte closed its operations at Bonteso in the Ashanti region in March 2004, citing problems concerning low- grade ore, equipment unavailability, and a default of its financial obligations during 2003. The company allegedly did not follow the due process for mine decommissioning, such as by failing to post bonds to the EPA for the reclamation of lands, failing to notify workers of its intention to liquidate, not paying up-to-date wages to workers, and leaving a debt of about $18 million owed to various state institutions and private companies. The EPA and the Minerals Commission were accused of failing to ensure Bonte's compliance to operate in a sustainable manner. Ghana's Obuasi region is known to host arsenopyritic goldbearing ore bodies. According to company reports, during the 1990s, an arsenic precipitation plant was installed at the Pompora Treatment Plant for the commercial recovery of arsenic from the roaster flue gases. At the time, the recovered arsenic trioxide was sold to Europe for commercial applications. As the market for arsenic declined, the treatment plant was shut down in 2000 and about 10,000 metric tons (t) of arsenic was stockpiled in bags at Obuasi. After the introduction of the Biox treatment process, the arsenic trioxide was converted to arsenic pentoxide and deposited in tailings dams. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (the company that was formed through the merger of Ashanti Goldfields Ltd. and AngloGold Ltd.) reported that inadequate storage of the stockpiled bags allegedly caused arsenic contamination to the Pompora stream. The problem was identified during the company's due diligence study prior to the merger. AngloGold Ashanti constructed a lined storage dam at the old heap leach site. The company planned to move the arsenic to a new facility where it will be stored and gradually disposed of by blending it into the Biox process circuit where it will be chemically stabilized and deposited as a component of the tailings residue in the new Sansu Tailings Storage Facility. The company estimates that it will take about 6 years to dispose of the arsenic. History Ghana has produced and exported gold for centuries. In precolonial times, present-day Ghana was one source of the gold that reached Europe via trans-Saharan trade routes. In the fifteenth century, Portuguese sailors tried to locate and to control gold mining from the coast but soon turned to more easily obtained slaves for the Atlantic slave trade. Most gold mining before the mid-nineteenth century was alluvial, wherein miners recovered gold from streams. Modern gold mining that plumbs the rich ore deposits below the Earth's surface began about 1860, when a Fante man of mixed-race by name Thomas Hughes, imported heavy machinery to begin mining in the western areas of present-day Ghana. His machinery was however sabotaged and could not start. Actual mining began in the late 1870s to early 1880s. The richest deposit, the Obuasi mine, was discovered by two Fante men by name Joseph Ellis and Joseph Biney who were later joined by another Fante man Joseph Brown. They sold the rights to the deposit cheaply to E A Cade because of British government's duplicitous behaviour. E.A. Cade, the founder of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (AGC). Since the beginning of the twentieth century, modern mining in the Gold Coast has been pursued as a large-scale venture, necessitating significant capital investment from European investors. Under British colonial rule, the government controlled gold mining to protect the profits of European companies. The colonial government also restricted possession of gold as well as of mercury, essential in recovering gold from the ore in which it is embedded. Following independence, foreign control of the sector was tempered by increasing government involvement under the Nkrumah regime; however, production began to decline in the late 1960s and did not recover for almost twenty years. In the mid-1960s, many mines began to hit poorer gold reefs. Despite the floating of the international gold price in the late 1960s, few investors were willing to invest, and the government failed to provide the capital necessary to expand production into new reefs. Of the two major gold mining enterprises, neither the State Gold Mining Corporation nor AGC (40% controlled by the government) expanded or even maintained production. Under the ERP, the mining sector was targeted as a potential source of foreign exchange, and since 1984, the government has successfully encouraged the rejuvenation of gold mining. To offer incentives to the mining industry, the Minerals and Mining Law was passed in 1986. Among its provisions were generous capital allowances and reduced income taxes. The corporate tax rate was set at 45%, and mining companies could write off 75% of capital investment against taxes in the first year and 50% of the remainder thereafter. The government permitted companies to use offshore bank accounts for service of loans, dividend payments, and expatriate staff remuneration. Ghana's mineral sector had started to recover by the early 1990s after its severe decline throughout the 1970s. One indicator of the scale of decline was that by 1987, only four gold mines were operating in Ghana, compared with eighty in 1938. Throughout the 1970s, the output of gold, as well as bauxite, manganese, and diamonds, fell steadily. Foreign exchange shortages inhibited mine maintenance, new exploration, and development investment. The overvalued cedi and spiraling inflation exacerbated mining companies' problems, as did smuggling and the deteriorating infrastructure. Energy supplies failed to meet the industry's growing needs; foreign exchange shortages constrained oil imports, and domestically generated hydroelectricity was unable to make up the shortfall.Clark, Nancy L. \\"Mining and Petroleum Industries\\" (and subchapters). A Country Study: Ghana (La Verle Berry, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (November 1994). . After 1983, however, the government implemented a series of measures to enhance the sector's appeal. In 1986 new mining legislation for the gold and diamond sectors replaced the previous complex and obsolete regulations, and a generous incentives system was established that allowed for external foreign exchange retention accounts, capital allowances, and a flexible royalties payment system. Since then the sector has benefited from a wave of fresh investment totaling US$540 million since 1986, and by the early 1990s mining was the country's second highest foreign exchange earner. Under legislation passed after 1983, the government liberalized and regularized the mining industry. For the first time, the government made small claim-holding feasible, with the result that individual miners sold increasing amounts of gold and diamonds to the state-operated Precious Minerals Marketing Company. In 1990 the company bought of diamonds and 20,000 ounces of gold and earned a total of US$20.4 million through sales, 70% of it from diamond sales and 30% from gold bought from smallscale operators. Diamond output totaled in 1991 and in 1992, while gold production amounted to 843,000 fine ounces in 1991 and 1,004,000 fine ounces in 1992. Furthermore, the government succeeded in attracting significant foreign investment into the sector and, by early 1991, had signed over sixty mining licenses granting prospecting rights to international companies. To forestall domestic criticism of large-scale foreign control of the sector, the government announced in mid-1991 the establishment of a state-controlled holding company to buy shares in mines on behalf of private, that is, foreign, investors. In the early 1990s, the government announced plans to privatize its diamond-mining operations and to expand production. At Accra's invitation, De Beers of South Africa agreed to undertake an eighteen-month feasibility study to determine the extent of the Birim River Basin diamond reserves. The survey was to cost US$1 million. A De Beers subsidiary will be the operator and manager of GCD, while Lazare Kaplan International, a New York-based diamond polishing and trading company, will produce and market the diamonds. In 1989 the government established the Precious Minerals Marketing Corporation (PMMC) to purchase minerals from small producers in an effort to stem diamond smuggling. Estimates suggested that as much as 70% of Ghana's diamonds were being smuggled out of the country in the mid-1980s. In its first sixteen months of operation, the PMMC bought of diamonds and 20,365 ounces of gold and sold of diamonds worth US$8 million. The corporation also earned ¢130 million in 1991 on its jewelry operations, up 48% from the previous year, and it planned to establish joint marketing ventures with foreign firms to boost sales abroad. Nevertheless, because of new complaints over raw gem sales, the government in March 1992 ordered an investigation into the operations of the state agency and suspended its managing director. =Accidents= In April 2013, at least 17 people were killed while mining illegally at a disused gold mine in Ghana's central region. The ground reportedly caved in on the miners as they searched for gold deposits, and authorities were unclear as to how many miners originally went in. Sixteen bodies were excavated, with one man dying in hospital from his injuries.

In 1989, CN¥184 million or GH₵64.9 million (US$30 million) was spent drilling wells in the Tano basin, and on 21 June 1992, an offshore Tano basin well produced about of crude oil daily. 1990s In the early 1990s, GNPC reviewed all earlier crude oil and natural gas discoveries to determine whether a predominantly local operation might make exploitation more commercially viable. GNPC wanted to set up a floating system for production, storage, off-loading, processing, and gas- turbine electricity generation, hoping to produce per day, from which 135 megawatts of power could be generated and fed into the national and regional grid. GNPC also signed a contract in 1992 with Angola's state oil company, Sonangol Group, that provides for drilling and, ultimately, production at two of Sonangol's offshore oilfields. GNPC was paid with a share of the crude oil. The Tema Oil Refinery in Ghana underwent the first phase of a major rehabilitation in 1989. The second phase began in April 1990 at an estimated cost of CN¥220.8 million or GH₵77.8 million (US$36 million). Once rehabilitation was completed, distribution of liquified petroleum gas was to be improved, and the quantity supplied was to rise from 28,000 to 34,000 barrels per day. Construction on the new Tema-Akosombo oil products pipeline, designed to improve the distribution system further, began in January 1992. The pipeline was to carry refined products from Tema to Akosombo Port, where they will be transported across Lake Volta to northern regions. Distribution continued to be uneven. Other measures to improve the situation included a CN¥171.7 million or GH₵60.5 million (US$28 million) project to set up a national network of storage depots in all regions. The Tema Lube Oil Company commissioned its new oil blending plant, designed to produce 25,000 tons of oil per year, in 1992. The plant was to satisfy both North Ghana and Ghana's requirements for motor and gear lubricants and 60% of the country's need for industrial lubricants, or, in all, 90% of Ghana's demand for lubricant products. Shareholders per equity included state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, and the 100% state-owned national insurance company, Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT). 2000s Ghana's Jubilee Oilfield which contains up to of sweet crude oil was discovered in 2007, among the many other oilfields in Ghana. Oil and gas exploration in Ghana is ongoing, and the amount of both crude oil and natural gas continues to increase. 2010s The Ghanaian government, indicated that the country could expand its reserves up to of oil in reserves within a few years.McLure, Jason. Ghana Oil Reserves to Be in 5 years as fields develop. Bloomberg Television. Wednesday, 1 December 2010. The expected annual tremendous inflow of capital from crude oil and natural gas production into the Ghana economy began from the first quarter of 2011 when Ghana started producing crude oil and natural gas in commercial quantities in 2011. At the end of 2012, declining productivity at one of the country’s largest oil projects, the Jubilee oil field, led to a decline in revenues for the government, who had budgeted for oil revenue of more than $650 million. The corresponding shortfall was more than $410 million. The oil firm blamed the decline on “sand contamination of the flowlines that carry the oil from the underwater wells” into the storage facility on the surface. In the first and second financial quarters of 2013, Ghana produced 115,000-200,000 barrels of crude oil per day and 140 million-200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The 100% Iranian state-owned oil companies National Iranian Oil Company and Iranian Offshore Oil Company, and Singapore Petroleum Company with Vetro Energy and PetroSeraya of Singapore have declared interests to provide assistance in construction of offshore platforms and drilling rigs for Ghana's state-owned oil company, Ghana National Petroleum Company on rapidly developing Ghana's oil and gas infrastructure and industry as Ghana aims to further increase output of oil to 2 million barrels per day and gas to 1.2 billion cubic feet per day with an expected annual generating revenue of GH₵140.7 billion (US$65 billion) in 2014. Ghana is believed to have up to to of petroleum in reserves, which is the sixth largest in Africa and the 25th largest proven reserves in the world and Ghana has up to 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in reserves.

The earliest aircraft in the series were basically landplane versions of the Delphin flying boat, and although the Delphin and Komet/Merkur series diverged from each other, design changes and refinements from one family were often incorporated into the other. All variants were braced high-winged single-engine monoplanes with conventional landing gear. Design and development The first Komets (Do C III Komet I) utilised the same rectangular plan, span wing, tail, and even upper fuselage, as well as the BMW IIIa engine of the Delphin I, but replaced the lower fuselage and sponsons with a simple sheet-metal bottom that incorporated fixed tailskid undercarriage. The engine installation was also relocated from its peculiar position above the Delphin's nose to a conventional location in the Komet's fuselage nose. Accommodation was provided for a single pilot and four passengers. An improved version, the Do Komet II, was first flown on 9 October 1922 and was widely exported to countries including Colombia, Spain, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union.

Power was greatly increased from the Komet I, with a Napier Lion engine. This version was exported to Denmark and Sweden, but was also produced under licence in Japan by Kawasaki. In 1925, the Komet III was replaced in production by the Do B Merkur I, which featured a revised fin and longer-span wings. When fitted with the BMW VI engine, it became known as the Do B Bal Merkur II, as did indeed any Komets thus re-engined. The type was widely used by Deutsche Luft Hansa, which had some 30 Merkurs operating at one time, and was also exported to Brazil, China, Colombia, Japan, and Switzerland. The Do C and Do D were follow-on military designs, the former a trainer exported to Chile and Colombia, the latter a floatplane torpedo-bomber built for the Yugoslav Royal Navy.

The British have been very important in the formation of the Chilean nation. They include Chileans of English, Scottish, Ulster Scots, Irish and Welsh ancestry. The numbers of Scottish and Welsh are higher in Patagonia, in Aysén and Magallanes regions. The highest percentage of British Chileans is found in Punta Arenas, followed by Santiago, Valparaiso, Concepcion, Viña del Mar and Antofagasta.  History  The main British communities in Chile, or La Colonia Britanica, were located in Valparaíso, Punta Arenas, and Concepción. A key moment in British immigration to Chile occurred in 1811, when free trade was decreed, followed by laws in 1824 and 1845 encouraging immigration. Chile, facing the Pacific Ocean, has for many years had an important British presence.Inmigrantes británicos. Over 50,000Noticias LA EMIGRACIÓN DE CHILENOS AL EXTERIOR E INMIGRACIÓN A CHILE. British immigrants settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes in Province, especially the city of Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing the Strait of Magellan from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe. In Valparaíso they created their largest and most important colony, bringing with them neighbourhoods of British character, schools, social clubs, sports clubs, business organizations and periodicals. Even today their influence is apparent in specific areas, such as the banks and the navy, as well as in certain social activities, such as football (soccer), horse racing, and the custom of drinking tea. During the movement for independence (1818), it was mainly the British who formed the Chilean Navy, under the command of Lord Cochrane. British investment helped Chile become prosperous and British seamen helped the Chilean navy become a strong force in the South Pacific. Chile won two wars, the first against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the second, the War of the Pacific, in 1878-79, against an alliance between Peru and Bolivia. The liberal-socialist \\"Revolution of 1891\\" introduced political reforms modeled on British parliamentary practice and lawmaking. British immigrants were also important in the northern zone of the country during the saltpetre boom, in the ports of Iquique and Pisagua. The King of Saltpetre, John Thomas North, was the principal tycoons of nitrate mining. The British legacy is reflected in the streets of the historic district of the city of Iquique, with the foundation of various institutions, such as the Club Hípico (Racing Club). Nevertheless, the British active presence came to an end with the saltpetre crisis during the 1930s. An important contingent of British (principally Scottish and Irish) immigrants arrived between 1914 and 1950, settling in the present-day region of Magallanes. British families were established in other areas of the country, such as Santiago, Coquimbo, the Araucanía, and Chiloé.  Cultural and technological legacy  The cultural legacy of the British in Chile is notable and has spread beyond the British Chilean community onto society at large. One custom taken from the British is afternoon tea, called \\"onces\\" by Chileans. Another interesting, although peculiar, legacy is the sheer amount of use of British first surname by Chileans. British technology in mining, railway, maritime infrastructure, and other industrial applications predominated in Chile in the latter half of the 19th century, continuing through the 1930s. Manuel A. Fernández' book, \\"Technology and British Nitrate Enterprises in Chile, 1880-1914\\" (Issue 34 of Occasional Papers- Institute of Latin American Studies Glasgow University, ISSN 0305-8646) details some of the British technology contributions to the development of the Chilean mining industry. Similar benefits were seen in the railway and meat-processing industries. Many of the British engineers and technicians, who came to Chile to support British equipment, remained in the country. Even Chile's modern system of lighthouses was largely the result of British expertise and technology: towards the end of the 19th century, Scottish engineer George Slight designed and constructed 70 lighthouses, most of which are still in operation. Chile currently has the largest population who can claim to be descendants of the British in Latin America. Over 700,000 Chileans may have British (English, Scottish and Welsh) or Irish origin, amounting to about 4% of Chile's population.

Ahmad was then held in military custody at the detention facility at the United States Air Base in Bagram, Afghanistan for 11 months without access to a lawyer. As a result of advocacy by his friends and family, and a habeas corpus petition filed by the International Justice Network, Jojo was released on September 21, 2008 after almost a year of being held in U.S. custody.https://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dd34r4x_14fzrvv6f2 Early life Jawed started working as a tailor's apprentice at twelve years old. Jawed earned 75 cents a day. He used the money he earned to pay for schooling. His education, and language skills, allowed him to start working as a translator for United States forces shortly after the overthrow of the Taliban. Jawed was later to work for independent security firms. In 2006 Jawad started working as a translator and \\"fixer\\" for Canadian journalists. Capture Jawed was captured on October 26, 2007. Jawed reported on his release that he was captured after receiving a request to come to Kandahar Air Field to complete a survey on opinion survey of Afghan journalists from a GI who represented himself as a Public Affairs Officer. American officials claimed the 22-year- old native of Kandahar was carrying phone numbers and videos of Taliban officials. He appeared before a military review, which determined there was \\"credible information\\" and is held at Bagram Airbase. His brother, Siddique, has been in contact with him during his detention, due to the efforts of the International Red Cross. According to his brother, he has been beaten since being detained. Captives in the Bagram Theater Detention Facility do not have Combatant Status Review Tribunals convened to confirm their combatant status.

Release Jawad Ahmad was released, without explanation, on September 22, 2008. He credited the help of friends and supporters for his relatively early release, and said guards had told him that many people were lobbying on his behalf. Jawad said he had seen the documentary film The Road to Guantanamo and said he was subjected to the same kind of treatment as the captives whose homicides in US custody were described in the film. He described being hooded, bound, slammed into walls and beaten. One of the beatings broke two of his ribs. Jawad said he was subjected to sleep deprivation. In an interview with the BBC he states \\"When I landed first of all they stood me in snow for six hours, it was too cold - I had no socks, no shoes, nothing. I became unconscious two times.\\". Jawad said his interrogators insisted he was a spy for the Taliban, Iran and Pakistan, that his family had all been captured and had already confessed, and that he was being held because his Canadian employers had insisted on it. After his release, Jawad told journalists that he was told he was going to be sent to Guantanamo. Jawad reported that Koran desecration remained routine at Bagram. Death On March 10, 2009, Reporters Without Borders (RWB) issued a statement http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2009/10/c7622.html saying Jawad was killed by being \\"gunned down .... by two men in a vehicle as he was getting out of his own car in the centre of the southern city of Kandahar.\\" The statement said, \\"Several Afghan journalists told Reporters Without Borders they suspected the murder may have been ordered by the Taliban,\\" but a Kandahar provincial government spokesman \\"offered no details.\\" The statement also said Ahmad's brother \\"did not rule out any hypothesis\\" regarding a motive for the shooting.

CIA World Factbook CIA (October 2008) However, Ghana's industrial production is rising at a 7.8% rate, giving it the 38th fastest growing industrial production in the worldCIA World Factbook - Rate Order - Industrial production growth rate. CIA World Factbook CIA (October 2008) due to government industrialization policies. Ghana's most important manufacturing industries include electronics manufacturing, car manufacturing, electric car manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, light manufacturing, aluminum smelting, food processing, cement, and small commercial ship building. A relatively small glass-making industry has also developed due to the high- quality sand available from the Tarkwa mining area. The foreign capital has increased in recent years. Most products are for local consumption and exportation. Other industries include the production of food and beverages, textiles, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and the processing of metals and wood products. History In 1957, after Ghana gained independence, the Nkrumah government launched an industrialization drive that increased manufacturing's share of GDP from 10 percent in 1960 to 14 percent in 1970. This expansion resulted in the creation of a relatively wide range of industrial enterprises, the largest including the Volta Aluminum Company (Valco) smelter, saw mills and timber processing plants, cocoa processing plants, breweries, cement manufacturing, oil refining, textile manufacturing operations, and vehicle assembly plants. Many of these enterprises, however, survived only through protection. The overvalued cedi, shortages of hard-currency for raw materials and spare parts, and poor management in the state sector led to stagnation from 1970 to 1977 and then to a decline from 1977 to 1982.Clark, Nancy L. \\"Manufacturing\\". A Country Study: Ghana (La Verle Berry, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (November 1994). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Thereafter, the manufacturing sector never fully recovered, and performance remained weak into the 1990s. Underutilization of industrial capacity, which had been endemic since the 1960s, increased alarmingly in the 1970s, with average capacity utilization in large- and medium-scale factories falling to 21 percent in 1982. Once the ERP began, the supply of foreign exchange for imported machinery and fuel substantially improved, and capacity utilization climbed steadily to about 40 percent in 1989. Nevertheless, by 1987 production from the manufacturing sector was 35 percent lower than in 1975 and 26 percent lower than in 1980. Ghana's record with industrialization projects since independence is exemplified by its experience with aluminum, the country's most conspicuous effort to promote capital-intensive industry. This venture began in the mid-1960s with the construction of a 1,186-megawatt hydroelectric dam on the lower Volta River at Akosombo. The Akosombo Dam was the centerpiece of the Volta River Project (VRP), which the Nkrumah government envisioned as the key to developing an integrated aluminum industry based on the exploitation of Ghana's vast bauxite reserves and its hydroelectric potential. Valco became the principal consumer of VRP hydroelectricity, using 60 percent of VRP-generated power and producing up to 200,000 tons of aluminum annually during the 1970s. Changing global economic conditions and severe drought dramatically affected the Ghanaian aluminum industry during the 1980s. The discovery of vast bauxite reserves in Australia and Brazil created a global oversupply of the mineral and induced a prolonged recession in the aluminum trade. Under these conditions, Valco found it far more economical to import semi-processed alumina from Jamaica and South Korea than to rely on local supplies, despite the discovery in the early 1970s of sizable new deposits at Kibi. Valco's refusal to build an aluminum production facility brought Kaiser and Reynolds into bitter conflict with the government. Severe drought compounded the effects of unfavorable market conditions by reducing the electricity generating capacity of the Akosombo Dam and by forcing a temporary shutdown of the smelter from 1983 to 1985. Aluminum production was slow to recover in the wake of the shutdown. In the early 1990s, aluminum production and exports continued to be negligible. Drastic currency devaluation after 1983 made it exceptionally expensive to purchase inputs, which hurt businessmen in the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, the ERP's tight monetary policies created liquidity crises for manufacturers, while liberalization of trade meant that some enterprises could not compete with cheaper imports. These policies hurt industries beset by long recession, hyperinflation, outmoded equipment, weak demand, and requirements that they pay 100 percent advances for their own inputs. Local press reports have estimated the closure of at least 120 factories since 1988, mainly because of competitive imports. The garment, leather, electrical, electronics, and pharmaceuticals sectors had been particularly hard hit. In 1990, even the New Match Company, the only safety match company in the country, closed. ERP strategies made it difficult for the government to assist local enterprises. Committed to privatization and the rule of free market forces, the government was constrained from offering direct assistance or even from moderating some policies that had a detrimental impact on local manufacturers. Nevertheless, the Rawlings government initiated programs to promote local manufacturing. In 1986, the government established the Ghana Investment Center to assist in creating new enterprises. Between 1986 and 1990, the vast majority of projects approved—444 of 621—were in the manufacturing sector. Projected investment for the approved ventures was estimated at US$138 million in 1989 and at US$136 million in 1990. In the initial phase, timber was the leading sector, giving way in 1990 to chemicals. In 1991 the government established an office to deal with industrial distress in response to complaints that \\"unrestrained imports\\" of foreign products were undermining local enterprises. The 1992 budget included assistance for local industrialists; ¢2 billion was set aside as financial support for \\"deserving enterprises.\\" The dominant trends in manufacturing, nonetheless, were the involvement of foreign capital and the initiation of joint ventures. Significant new enterprises included a US$8 million Taiwanese-owned factory, capable of turning out ten tons of iron and steel products per hour, which began trials at Tema in 1989. Although approximately 500 projects had been approved since the investment code came into force in 1985, almost half had still not been launched by the end of 1989. Between 90 and 95 percent of the approved projects were joint ventures between foreign and local partners, 80 percent of which were in the wood industry. Restructuring of the sector was proceeding through divestiture, import liberalization, and promotion of small- scale industries. Ghana textile manufacturers As of 2012 there were four major companies in this sector. Akosombo Textiles Limited (ATL), Tex Style Ghana Limited (GTP), Printex Ghana and Ghana Textile Manufacturing Company (GTMC).

In 2012, Mahindra featured in the Forbes Global 2000, a listing of the biggest and most powerful companies in the world. In 2013, the Mahindra Group received the Financial Times Boldness in Business Award in the Emerging Markets category. The Apostle Safo Suaye Technology Research Centre (ASSTRC), headed by Dr. Kwadwo Safo, is currently manufacturing 2 vehicles per year. Yet, by 2015, if things work as planned, Kwadwo Safo and his team should be able to manufacture about 500 cars per year. This will be made possible thanks to the construction of a new automobile assembly plant that will manufacture the various brands of Kantanka vehicles. The Apostle Safo Suaye Technology Research Centre (ASSTRC), confirmed that the local automobile assembly plant, will be ready in May, 2014. When completed, the project, which is an initiative of Ghanaian industrialist, Apostle Dr Kwadwo Safo, would see the production of between 120 and 240 cars daily. As of 2015 Kantanka vehicles are assembled upon order in small numbers from imported Chinese parts.

Background The Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia was created by Missouri Governor Hamilton Rowan Gamble in 1863 when it was determined that the mixed sympathy part-time Enrolled Missouri Militia was not an effective garrison force against guerrilla activity. Reliable Unionists were selected from the EMM regiments and the enrolled militia were disbanded. The new provisional regiments were paid by the state, but were outfitted and supplied by the Federal government.Ross, Kirby, \\"Federal Militia in Missouri\\", http://www.civilwarstlouis.com/militia/federalmilitia.htm History The life of these regiments was short. They began organizing in May 1863. Several regiments were involved in opposing Shelby's 1863 Raid. Primarily they opposed guerrillas and served as local garrisons. While the PEMM regiments were loyal, they were also composed largely of Radical Unionists opposed to Governor Gamble's Conservative Unionist administration. To prevent the Radical PEMM militia from influencing the November 1863 judicial elections the governor disbanded most of the PEMM regiments.

Ghana generates electric power from hydropower, fossil-fuel (thermal energy), and renewable energy sources. Electricity generation is one of the key factors in order to achieve the development of the Ghanaian national economy, with aggressive and rapid industrialisation; Ghana's national electric energy consumption was 265 kilowatt hours per capita in 2009. Ghana exports some of its generated energy and fossil fuels to other countries. Electricity transmission is under the operations of Ghana Grid Company. The distribution of electricity is under Northern Electricity Distribution Company and Electricity Company of Ghana. History The first Ghana government-sponsored public electricity supply in Ghana commenced in the year 1914 at Sekondi-Takoradi, operated by the Ghana Railway Administration (Ghana Railway Corporation). Power supply was extended to Sekondi-Takoradi in 1928. The Ghana Public Works Department had commenced a limited direct current (DC) supply in Accra during 1922. A large alternating current (AC) project started on 1 November 1924, and a small plant consisting of three horizontal single cylinder oil-powered engines was installed in Koforidua in 1925. In 1926, work started on electrical distribution to Kumasi. A restricted evening supply commenced in May 1927, and a power station was brought into full operation on 1 October 1927. In the same year DC supply was installed at Winneba but this was subsequently changed to AC by extending an existing supply from Swedru and during the period 1929-30, a limited electricity supply was extended to Tamale until a new AC plant was installed in 1938. The next power station to be established was Cape Coast in 1932. This was taken over by the Ghana Electricity Department in 1947. A Ghanaian power station at Swedru was commissioned in 1948 and this was followed by the installation of generating plants at Akim Oda, Dunkwa-on-Offin and Bolgatanga in 1948. On 27 May 1949, an electricity supply was made available at Nsawam through the building of an 11 kV overhead transmission line from Accra. The Keta electricity supply which was included in the programme was delayed by staff difficulties and was not commissioned until 1955. The Tema power station was commissioned in 1956 with a 3 x diesel generating set. The Ho power station followed in 1957 and from 1961-64. The Tema power station was extended to a maximum capacity of , thus, making it probably the biggest single diesel- powered generating station in Africa. In 1963 the Ghana Electricity Division brought into operation the first 161 kV transmission system in Ghana, which was used to carry power from the Tema Power Station. At its peak in 1965, about 75 percent of the power was used in Accra. In 1994, Ghana's total generating capacity was about 1.187GW, and annual production totaled approximately 4.49GW. The main source of supply was the Volta River Authority with six 127MW turbines installed at the Akosombo Hydroelectric Project. At this time, this project provided the bulk of all electricity consumed in Ghana, some 60 percent of which was purchased by Volta Aluminum Company (Valco) for its smelter. The power plant export amounted to an estimated equivalent of 180,000 tons of oil in 1991. The balance of Ghana's electricity was produced by diesel units owned by the Electricity Corporation of Ghana, by mining companies, and by a 160MW hydroelectric plant at Kpong, about 40 kilometers downstream from Akosombo. A third dam at Bui on the Black Volta River had been studied, and was completed in 2013. Other sites with the potential for power generation, on the Pra River (Ghana), the Tano River, the White Volta River, and the Ankobra River, would also require substantial investment.Clark, Nancy L. \\"Electrical Power\\". A Country Study: Ghana (La Verle Berry, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (November 1994). \\"This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain\\". Ghana has attempted to increase distribution of its electricity throughout the country. One program Ghana has initiated will provide reliable and widespread electricity in the urban and southern parts of the country. In addition, the extension of the national grid to the Northern Region was commissioned in 1989. The extension links northern Ghana to the power generated from the Akosombo Dam. The Akosombo Dam was built on the Volta river in 1965 and is spilling water through six floodgates because of the all- time high water level in the Akosombo Dam. The second phase of the extension will connect major towns in Upper East Region with the regional capital, Bolgatanga, at a cost of US$100 million. The final phase will see exports of electricity across the northern national border of Ghana to Burkina-Faso. In early 1991 the Electricity Corporation of Ghana began the expansion of electricity networks in the northwestern areas of Accra and the Ghanaian corporation aimed to extend the supply of electricity to all isolated centers in Ghana where diesel is the main source of power. Plans were also afoot to increase the supply of electricity by utilisation of thermal energy and construction was anticipated by late 1994 on the country's first thermal power generating plant near Sekondi-Takoradi and scheduled for completion in 1997, the plant contributed 300MW of electricity to the Ghana national grid. Since 2007, Ghana has become an electricity exporter and since 2011 an exporter of crude oil, and natural gas, and a generator of electricity by thermal energy, hydropower, solar energy and renewable energies since 2012. Fossil fuel =Crude oil and Natural gas production= Oil platform off the Sekondi- Takoradi Coast Western Region of Ghana Ghana produces 140–200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and in which natural gas production in Ghana has been restrained from full production capacity since December 2012, due to delays in construction of a Ghanaian gas refinery in Sekondi-Takoradi that was scheduled to be completed by December 2012 and now scheduled to be completed by December 2013, and due to which in turn has led to gas flaring and Ghana losing hundreds of millions a day since December 2012 in revenues from natural gas production. Since December 2012 billions of dollars a year have been lost from the Ghanaian GDP due to the delays in construction of a gas refinery in Sekondi-Takoradi. A Ghanaian oilfield which is reported to contain up to of crude oil was discovered in 2007, and according to the Ghanaian government, the country could expand its petroleum reserves up to of crude oil in reserves within a few years.McLure, Jason. Ghana Oil Reserves to Be in 5 years as fields develop. Bloomberg Television. Wednesday, 1 December 2010. Ghana produces 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day on average from an expected 1–2 million barrels of crude oil per day, and an expected crude oil production revenue of US$ 30 billion a year; as with Angola, also a crude oil producer, has an expected 2 million barrels of crude oil production per day and receives an expected $33.7 billion a year in crude oil revenues. Tremendous inflow of economic capital from fossil fuel into the Ghanaian economy began from the first quarter of 2011 when Ghana started producing crude oil and natural gas in commercial quantities and the Ghana crude oil industry accounted for 6% of the Ghanaian economic revenue for 2011. Oil and Gas exploration in Ghana continues and the amount of both crude oil and natural gas in Ghana continues to increase. Solar energy  The biggest photovoltaic (PV) and the largest solar energy plant in Africa, the Nzema project, based in Ghana, will be able to provide electricity to more than 100,000 homes., The 155MW plant will increase Ghana's electricity generating capacity by 6%. Construction work on the GH¢ 740 million (GB£ 248 million) and the 4th largest solar power plant in the world, is being developed by Blue Energy, a UK-based renewable energy investment company, majority owned and funded by members of the, Stadium Group, a large European private asset and development company with GB£ 2.5 billion under management. Project director is Douglas Coleman, from Mere Power Nzema Ltd, Ghana. Unlike many other solar projects in Africa that use concentrated solar power, solar plants will use photovoltaic (PV) technology to convert sunlight directly into electricity. Installation of more than 630,000 solar PV modules will begin by the end of 2017. As of August 2015, the project is still under development. Wind energy Wind turbines (eco park) Wind farm. In addition to hydropower and solar energy, Ghana also produces a lot of other renewable energy, other forms of energy that produce electricity in Ghana are wind power, geothermal and biomass. It is the official goal of Ghana energy industry to have 10% of Ghana's energy mix come from renewable sources (not counting large-scale hydropower) by 2015, or at the very latest by 2020. Ghana has Class 4-6 wind resources and locations of the high wind areas – such as Nkwanta, the Accra Plains, and Kwahu and Gambaga mountains. The maximum energy that could be tapped from Ghana's available wind resource for electricity is estimated to be about 500 – 600 GWh/year. To give perspective – In 2011, from the same Energy Commission, the largest Akosombo hydroelectric dam in Ghana alone produced 6,495 GWhrs of electric power and, counting all Ghana's geothermal energy production in addition, total energy generated was 11,200 GWhrs in the same year. These assessments do not take into consideration further limiting factors such as land-use restrictions, the existing grid (or how far the wind resource may be from the grid) and accessibility. Wind energy has the potential to contribute significantly to the country's energy industry – 10% can certainly be attained in terms of installed capacity, and about 5% of total electric generation potential from wind alone. Bio energy A hybrid Sorghum plantation field. Ghana has put in place mechanisms to attract investments into its biomass and bio-energy sectors to stimulate rural development, create jobs and save foreign exchange., , The vast arable and degraded land mass of Ghana has the potential for the cultivation of crops and plants that could be converted into a wide range of solid and liquid bio-fuels, as the development of alternative transportation fuels could help Ghana to diversify and secure its future energy supplies. Main investments in the bio-energy subsector existed in the areas of production, are transportation, storage, distribution, sale, marketing and exportation. The goal of Ghana regarding bio-energy, as articulated its energy sector policy, is to modernise and examine the benefits of bio-energy on a sustainable basis. Biomass is Ghana's dominant energy resource in terms of endowment and consumption, with the two primary bio-fuels consumed being ethanol and biodiesel. To that effect, the Ghana ministry of Energy in 2010 developed the energy sector strategy and development plan. Highlights of the key policy objectives strategy for the renewable energy subsector include sustaining the supply and efficient use of wood-fuels while ensuring that their utilisation does not lead to deforestation. The plan would support private sector investments in the cultivation of bio-fuel feedstock, extraction of bio-oil and its refining into secondary products, thereby creating appropriate financial and tax incentives. The Ghana Renewal Energy Act provides the necessary fiscal incentives for renewable energy development by the private sector, and also details the control and management of bio-fuel and wood- fuel projects in Ghana. The Ghana National Petroleum Authority (NPA) was tasked by the Renewable Energy Act 2011 to price Ghana's bio-fuel blend in accordance with the prescribed petroleum pricing formula. The combined effects of climate change and global economic turbulence, had triggered a sense of urgency among Ghanaian policymakers, industry and development practitioners to find sustainable and viable solutions in the area of bio-fuels. Currently, Brazil, which makes ethanol from maize and sugarcane, is the world's largest bio-fuel market.

History =Settlement= Bolivians have been migrating to London since the 1960s. Their emigration from Bolivia is driven by political and economic instability there. The United Kingdom traditionally has not been one of the more popular destinations for emigrant Bolivians; most instead headed for the United States or for other South American countries, especially Argentina. However, since around 2002, there has been a sharp increase in Bolivian migration to the United Kingdom, making it the second most popular European destination after Spain. Spain has come to be seen as a mere stepping-stone and the United Kingdom as the final destination; despite the common language, Bolivians in Spain perceive the United Kingdom as being more tolerant and welcoming, as well as having higher-paying jobs. Demographics =Population= According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, 1,143 people were born in Bolivia, making it the 140th most common birthplace for British residents. The 2011 census recorded 3,618 Bolivian-born residents in England, 24 in Wales, 113 in Scotland and 10 in Northern Ireland. =Distribution= The overwhelming majority of all Bolivians in the United Kingdom reside in London. Boroughs with high concentrations of Bolivians include Southwark (6,000-8,000, mainly in Elephant and Castle, Old Kent Road and Peckham Rye), Haringey (3,000-4,000, mainly in Seven Sisters and Finsbury Park), Camden, Lewisham (2,000-3,000 each), and Lambeth (1,000-2,000, mainly in Vauxhall and Brixton). Another 500-2,000 are believed to reside in Newcastle, with another 200-1,000 in Edinburgh. More affluent Bolivians tend to gravitate towards North London, while the less affluent live in Southeast London. Employment Work in the cleaning industry is a common entry-level jobs for new Bolivian arrivals; others find employment as private nannies or in restaurants. Many Bolivians on student visas report working as many as 60 hours per week, or three times the legal limit. Many Bolivian migrants reside and work in the United Kingdom without authorisation. However, instead of making use of the services of people smugglers or other similar means to effect illegal entry into the country, many Bolivians enter the United Kingdom visa-free as tourists, and then simply overstay their entry period and find a job. Others enter on student visas which allow them to work up to 20 hours per week. Long- term legal Bolivian residents of the United Kingdom do not necessarily have a negative attitude towards the recently arrived irregular migrants; in contrast, they often do what they can to help them out in finding accommodation and employment, regardless of legality. False documents are said to be fairly easy to acquire, and are becoming of increasing importance as employers become less willing to knowingly hire illegal migrants. A plan by the UK government to offer an amnesty to Bolivians residing in the country illegally was discarded in September 2007. Culture =Community= Long- term Bolivian residents of the United Kingdom have set up a number of community associations, such as the Anglo-Bolivian Society and the Friends of Bolivia. However, most recent migrants surveyed state that they have never heard anything about those organisations. However, many migrants have organised themselves into football teams which play against each other and even against Bolivian teams from Spain. The Bolivian community in the United Kingdom is divided along lines of ethnicity and social class. According to community leaders, divisions between kollas (highlanders from the west side of the country) and cambas (Guarany indigenous descendants from the east side of the country) remain salient, although less important among youth. Furthermore, what social class one actually belongs to in the UK on the basis of one's income and lifestyle is often less relevant than the perception by other Bolivians of what social class one belonged to in Bolivia; migration to a new country means that both lower-class and upper-class Bolivians find themselves working in the same low-level jobs. One interviewee who came from an affluent family in Bolivia, but worked as a cleaner after arriving in the United Kingdom, described a situation where her supervisor, who was from a working- class family, still addressed her as señora and using the formal 2nd-person pronoun usted, whereas he used the informal 2nd-person pronoun tú with his other subordinates and colleagues. =Media= The United Kingdom has no publications either in Spanish or English aimed specifically at Bolivians. Bolivians, even those who do not have a good grasp of English, almost all report that they read the free English-language dailies, such as the Metro or thelondonpaper, as well as the weekly Spanish-language daily Express News. 60% also read newspapers from Bolivia online, mainly El Deber, La Razón, and Los Tiempos.

The programme was a pioneering precursor to the better-remembered BBC music programme The Old Grey Whistle Test (1971–87).

There is a common misconception that The Mothers of Invention appeared on the show. This is because a MOI studio session (consisting of 'Oh in the Sky' and 'King Kong') recorded for Colour Me Pop's parent programme Late-Night Line-Up on 23 October 1968 was incorrectly billed as being from Colour Me Pop when an excerpt was reused in the 1991 BBC 2 series Sounds of the Sixties. Since it was never originally broadcast as a Colour Me Pop and used a different director and studio, this performance cannot be considered part of the series.

He was the son of Gawen Hamilton (1729–1805) of Killyleagh Castle, County Down, modern-day Northern Ireland, and Lady Jane Rowan Hamilton.  Early life  The surname Rowan is Irish from Ó Ruadháin meaning Little red one. Archibald Hamilton Rowan was born in the home of his grandfather, William Rowan, in London, and lived there with his mother and sister for much of his early life. When his grandfather died in 1767, he inherited a large sum of money under the stipulation that he would add the maternal name Rowan, receive an Oxbridge education, and not visit Ireland before his 25th birthday. He was admitted to Queens' College, Cambridge in 1768, but was expelled from the college and rusticated for an attempt to throw a tutor into the River Cam. He was sent for a period in 1769 to Warrington Academy, though he absented himself from the care of John Seddon of Warrington. Upon his return he obeyed his grandfather's wishes by staying out of Ireland and returning to Jesus College.Matthew, H. C. G., and Brian Howard Harrison. 2004. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: In association with the British Academy : From the earliest times to the year 2000. Oxford: Oxford University Press. vol. 47 p. 982Henry Arthur Bright, A historical sketch of Warrington Academy (1859), online at Google Books, p. 19. Hamilton Rowan travelled throughout the 1770s and 1780s, visiting parts of Europe, the Americas, and Northern Africa. During his travels, he witnessed early signs of revolutionary sentiment in America that may have planted the seeds of revolutionary inclinations that would flower later in his life. While serving as private secretary to Lord Charles Montague, the governor of South Carolina, he witnessed the South Carolina legislature's vote to repaint the railings around the statue of Pitt the Elder, an affront to the ministry of Lord North under which Montague served. Montague dissolved the legislature, only to see all the members re-elected.The Autobiography of Archibald Hamilton Rowan, p. 32 In 1781 Hamilton Rowan married Sarah Dawson in Paris, France. Dawson was the daughter of a former neighbour and did not have any fortune of her own. She was brought into the family by Mrs. Hamilton, who took her on as a ward. Mrs. Hamilton thought to make a match for Sarah with the Reverend Benjamin Beresford, but the plan went awry when Beresford eloped with Hamilton Rowan's younger sister. Meanwhile, Hamilton Rowan fell in love with Dawson and married her. The marriage proved to be an enduring love match; Sarah stood by her husband through all his later struggles and was the most important advocate for his pardon during his exile. The couple had ten children. He was the godfather of the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865).Rowan Hamilton(1805–1865) by T.D. Spearman, School of Mathematics, Trinity College Dublin, proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.(1995) Society of The United Irishman Hamilton Rowan returned to Ireland in his thirties, in 1784, to live at Rathcoffey near Clane in north County Kildare. He became a celebrity and, despite his wealth and privilege, a strong advocate for Irish liberty. He joined the Killyleagh Volunteers (a militia group later associated with radical reform) under his father's command, also in 1784. Hamilton Rowan first gained public attention by championing the cause of fourteen-year-old Mary Neal in 1788.Autobiography of Archibald Hamilton Rowan Neal had been lured into a Dublin brothel and then assaulted by Henry Luttrell (who, as Earl of Carhampton, later commanded Crown forces in the suppression of the 1798 Rebellion). Hamilton Rowan publicly denounced Luttrell and published a pamphlet A Brief Investigation of the Sufferings of John, Anne, and Mary Neal in the same year. An imposing figure at more than six feet tall, Hamilton Rowan's notoriety grew when he entered a Dublin dining club threatening several of Mary Neal's detractors, with his massive Newfoundland at his side, and a shillelagh in hand. The incident won him public applause and celebrity as a champion of the poor.Nicolson, Harold. The Desire to Please: a story of Hamilton Rowan and the United Irishmen (1943) p 80-82Memoir of Hamilton Rowan by Jonah Barrington. In 1790 Hamilton Rowan joined the Northern Whig Club, and by October had become a founding member of the Dublin Society of United Irishmen, working alongside famous radicals such as William Drennan, and Theobald Wolfe Tone.Wilson, David A. 1998. United Irishmen, United States: Immigrant Radicals in the Early Republic. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. p. 17 Hamilton Rowan was arrested in 1792 for seditious libel –a political charge –when caught handing out \\"An Address to the Volunteers of Ireland\\", a piece of United Irish propaganda. Unknown to him, from 1791 the Dublin administration had a spy in the Dublin Society, Thomas Collins, whose activity was never discovered.\\"Proceedings of the Dublin Society of the United Irishmen\\" by Robert McDowell (Irish Manuscripts Commission, Dublin 1998, pp.7 – 136). From February 1793 Britain and Ireland joined the War of the First Coalition against France, and the United Irish movement was outlawed in 1794. Hamilton Rowan's reputation for radicalism and bluster grew during this time when he left Ireland to confront the Lord Advocate of Scotland about negative comments made in respect to his character and that of members of the Society of United Irishmen. As a prominent member of the Irish gentry, Hamilton Rowan was an important figure in the United Irishmen and became the contact for the Scottish radical societies as a result of his visit. Upon his return to Dublin, he was charged and was found guilty of seditious libel, even though he was excellently defended by the famous John Philpot Curran. Hamilton Rowan was sentenced to two years imprisonment, received a fine of £500, and was forced to pay two assurities for good behaviour of £1,000 each. In January 1794 Hamilton Rowan retired to his apartments in Dublin's Newgate Prison. Treason and exile While imprisoned, Hamilton Rowan met the Reverend William Jackson, an Irish-born Anglican clergyman who was working as a spy for the French Committee of Public Safety. Jackson's mission was to assess Ireland's readiness for revolution and French invasion. Jackson, Tone, and others met in Hamilton Rowan's Newgate cell to discuss the state of Ireland and the population's willingness to overthrow British rule. But Jackson was betrayed by a friend acting as a spy for the British Government, was arrested and charged with high treason. Immediately following Jackson's arrest, Hamilton Rowan fled to escape being tried for high treason. He convinced his jailer to allow him to visit his wife on the pretense of signing legal documents. While the jailer sat in the dining room of their home in Dublin, Hamilton Rowan excused himself to the bedroom, where he climbed down a rope made of knotted bed sheets to a waiting horse. Unwilling to be taken alive, he kept a razor blade in his sleeve and fled south to the coast. A reward of £1000 was offered by Royal Proclamation for his capture. There he hired a boat to sail to France, and upon his arrival he was immediately arrested as a British spy. While in prison he was interrogated by Robespierre, who found him innocent of the charges raised against him and had Hamilton Rowan freed. In Paris, Hamilton Rowan became close friends with Mary Wollstonecraft and kept a faithful correspondence with her for many years. Hamilton Rowan soon found himself in the middle of the Thermidor Revolution. He recalled: > In two days after the execution of Robespierre, the whole commune of Paris, > consisting of about sixty persons, were guillotined in less than one hour > and a half, in the Place de la Revolution; and though I was standing above a > hundred paces from the place of execution, the blood of the victims streamed > under my feet.The Autobiography of Archibald Hamilton Rowan p. 237-238 Deciding that France was too dangerous, Hamilton Rowan moved next to Philadelphia, then the capital of the United States. He reached Philadelphia on 4 July 1795, reuniting with fellow United Irishmen in exile. To his dismay, he discovered Philadelphia to be as full of backstabbing and partisanship as France (albeit of a less bloody nature). His more radical Irish friends were already inserting themselves into the dispute between Thomas Jefferson's Republican faction against John Adams' Federalists. He chose to leave Philadelphia for the more peaceful and less expensive shores of the Brandywine River in Delaware. After fleeing Ireland, Hamilton Rowan was unable to access his fortune and was reduced to supporting himself by his own labour. He was able to borrow money from William Poole, a prominent Quaker in Wilmington, Delaware, and purchase a calico mill.The Autobiography of Archibald Hamilton Rowan p 308-309 In Wilmington, Hamilton Rowan led a very public life, enjoying the company of prominent Wilmingtonians such as Poole, John Dickinson, and Caesar A. Rodney, who later became Secretary of State under Jefferson. Living in constant fear of summary deportation under the Alien and Sedition Acts, Hamilton Rowan took pains to socialise with both Federalists and Republicans, and he studiously avoided American politics. On Christmas Day 1797 his cottage on the Brandywine burned to the ground killing his two dogs, destroying most of his library, and leaving him homeless. The next year his business partner refused to make up the accounts for the calico mill, so Hamilton Rowan was forced to pay the bills out of pocket, and take over the entire operation himself. But with little knowledge of the operations or business, the press was sold at a loss of $500. Hamilton Rowan then worked for the flour mills hauling grain and flour by wheelbarrow to and from Wilmington. During his time in America, Hamilton Rowan began writing his Memoirs, fearing he would never return to Ireland. He begins with an address to his family, > My dear Children, Whilst residing at Wilmington on the Delaware, in the > United States of America, not expecting to return to Europe, and unwilling > to solicit my family to rejoin me there, I was anxious to leave you some > memorial of a parent whom in all probability you would never know > personally.Introduction to Autobiography However, thanks to the persistence of his wife, in 1799 he received permission to travel to a neutral European country without being arrested and he moved from Wilmington to Hamburg, Germany, where he was reunited with his wife and children. He continued to seek a pardon and was permitted to live in England from 1803. Writing to his father from Hamburg, Hamilton Rowan delighted in the prospect of Ireland's legislative union with Great Britain.: > I congratulate you upon the report that speads here that Union is intended. > In that I see the downfall of one of the most corrupt assembles that ever > existed . . . [It will be] the wreck of feudal aristocracy. It was a view not popular among his fellow Irish exiles. His father Gawen died in 1805 and Hamilton Rowan was allowed to return to Ireland in 1806. Later life Hamilton Rowan returned to the ancestral home of Killyleagh Castle, County Down, receiving a hero's welcome. He was a respected figure, spending time in both Killyleagh and Dublin. While he had agreed to be a model citizen under the conditions of his return to Ireland, he remained active in politics and retained his youthful radicalism. Following his last public appearance at a meeting in the Rotunda in Dublin \\"organized by the Friends of Civil and Religious Liberty\\" on 20 January 1829, he was lifted up by a mob and paraded through the streets.Nicolson, Harold. The Desire to Please p. 188 After the deaths of his wife in February 1834 and his eldest son, Gawen William Rowan Hamilton, in August, Hamilton Rowan died in his home on 1 November 1834, an old man. While radical acquaintances like Tone and Jackson died as a result of their political activities, Rowan lived to age of 84. He was buried in the vaults of St Mary's Church, Dublin. Hamilton Rowan was unable to finish his memoirs, and after his death, his family handed his papers and the task off to his friend, Thomas Kennedy Lowrey, who was also unable to finish them. Lowrey in turn passed them off to William Hamilton Drummond who published Hamilton Rowan's Autobiography in 1840, Hamilton would have been a member of Rev. Drummonds Strand Street Presbyterian (Unitarian) Church. According to Harold Nicolson (his great-great-grandson), none of Hamilton Rowan's working papers exist, and some of them were burned by either his great-aunt Fanny or his great-aunt Jane.Nicolson, Harold. The Desire to Please p. 58 Hamilton Rowan produced in fact several versions of his memoirs (in varying degrees of completion) at his own lithographic press in Dublin. These can be found in libraries in Ireland (Royal Irish Academy, National Library) and in Wilmington, Delaware (The Historical Society of Delaware). Manuscript versions of the memoirs by various hands (again, in varying degrees of completion) are preserved in the Royal Irish Academy, The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, and The Delaware Historical Society.

The church dates from the 12th century, with additions up to the 19th. There is a 12th-century canonical sundial on the south wall. The church has an Early English chancel with lancet windows and a 17th-century north funerary chapel, and a nave with a Perpendicular clerestory, including six tracery panelled windows. It has Decorated north and south aisles with evidence at the roof line of earlier aisles, four arcades, a south porch, and a Decorated west tower with pinnacles, crenellations, and a Perpendicular recessed spire. The church was probably gifted by Geoffrey de Saxe, prebendary of Heydour from 1325 to 1380, to whom the chancel holds a tomb and a sedilia.Cox, J. Charles (1916) Lincolnshire, Methuen & Co.

Its members broke away from the MEK to support Marxism Leninism, rather than the Leftist Islamist modernism of the People's Mujahedin. Originating in 1972 and officially founded in 1975, by the early 1980s Peykar was no longer considered active.

Vahid Afrakhteh This led to Marxist members joining the organization, including Majid Sharif Vaquefi in 1972, and Taghi Sahram in 1973. Other Peykar leaders included Bahram Aram, Torab Hghshenas, Aireza Sepasi Ashtiani, Rahman Vahid Afrakhteh, Foad Rohani, Hasan Alapoush, and Mahboobeh Mottahedin. Reforms within the MEK started at this time, with Taghi Shahram, Hossein Rohani, and Torab Haqshenas playing key roles in creating the Marxist–Leninist MEK that would later become Peykar. By 1973, the members of the Marxist–Leninist MEK launched an \\"internal ideological struggle\\". Members that did not convert to Marxism were expelled or reported to SAVAK, and Majid Sharif Vaqefi, the only Muslim left in the Central Committee, was executed. Muslim MEK members that did not convert to Marxism were expelled or reported to SAVAK. Between 1973 and 1975, the Marxist–Leninist MEK increased their armed operations in Iran. In 1973 they engaged in two street battles with Tehran police. Also in 1973 they bombed ten buildings including Plan Organization, Pan-American Airlines, Shell Oil Company, Hotel International, Radio City Cinema, and an export company owned by a Baha'i businessman. Schism Mojahedin (Marxist–Leninist) became an official organization in October 1975. At this time the group continued to call itself People's Mujahedin.Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press, (1999), p.151 Their position was laid out in a pamphlet entitled Manifesto on Ideological Issues, where the group's central leadership declared \\"that after ten years of secret existence, four years of armed struggle, and two years of intense ideological rethinking, they had reached the conclusion that Marxism, not Islam, was the true revolutionary philosophy.\\" This meant two rival Mujahedins, each with its own publication, its own organization, and its own activities. This continued just before the 1979 Iranian Revolution when the Marxist Mojahedin changed its name to Peykar (Organization of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class) on December 7, 1978. This name later became the \\"St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class\\", which was a left wing group in St. Petersburg, Russia. It was founded by Lenin in the autumn of 1895.Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian, Princeton University Press, 1982, p.493-4 Mujtabi Taleqani, son of Ayatollah Taleqani, was an MEK member who \\"converted\\" to Marxism. Hossein Ruhani was another prominent Peykar member. He ran for Majles candidate in Tehran, and caused a major scandal in 1980 by divulging for the first time secret PMoI negotiations with Ayatollah Khomeini. Ruhani also made Peykar \\"the first left-wing organization to personally criticize Khomeini\\", when he called Khomeini a \\"mediaeval obscurantist\\" and his regime \\"reactionary\\" and \\"fascistic.\\" Later Ruhani was arrested and imprisoned. In May 1982 he appeared on television as one of the first of numerous opponents of the regime to recant their opposition in what is widely thought to have been the work of prison torture. Ruhani denounced his membership in Peykar, praised \\"the Imam\\" Khomeini and proclaimed that he felt freer in prison than \\"in the outside world.\\"Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press, (1999), p.151-2 After 1980's Peykar was operationally active in the early 1980s, mostly conducting small-scale insurgency-style raids in Northern Iran, though the group was also responsible for one hostage situation at the Iranian consulate in Geneva in 1982.MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base.

History of EML The OASIS Election and Voter Services Technical Committee, which met for the first time in May 2001, was chartered \\"To develop a standard for the structured interchange of data among hardware, software, and service providers who engage in any aspect of providing election or voter services to public or private organizations. The services performed for such elections include but are not limited to voter role[sic]/membership maintenance (new voter registration, membership and dues collection, change of address tracking, etc.), citizen/membership credentialing, redistricting, requests for absentee/expatriate ballots, election calendaring, logistics management (polling place management), election notification, ballot delivery and tabulation, election results reporting and demographics.\\"Charter of OASIS EML Work To help establish context for the specifics contained in the XML schemas that make up EML, the Committee also developed a generic end-to-end election process model, initially based on work by election.com, whose CTO chaired the first meetings.Government and ICT Standards: An Electronic Voting Case Study by Jason Kitcat in Info, Comm & Ethics in Society (2004) 2: 1 This model identifies the significant components and processes common to elections and electoral systems, and describes how EML can be used to standardize the information exchanged between those components. The specification describes two complementary high-level process models of an election exercise, based on the human and technical views. The goal is to identify all the major steps involved in the process and the areas where data is to be exchanged or referenced. Then the messages and data formats detailed in the EML specifications themselves can be used to achieve the goals of open interoperability between system components around those processes. Overview of EML Voting is one of the foundations of democratic processes. In addition to providing for the orderly transfer of power, it also cements the citizen's trust and confidence in an organization or government when it operates efficiently. Access to standardized information in the voting process for voters as well as standardized data interchange can better facilitate verification and oversight for election procedures. Standards for clear, robust and precisely understood processes help promote confidence in the results. Election data interchange standardization fosters an open marketplace that stimulates cost effective delivery and adoption of new technology without obsolescing existing investments. However, traditional verification methods and oversight will continue to be vital, and in fact these things become more critical with the use of technology. A healthy democracy requires participation from citizens and continuous independent monitoring of processes, procedures and outcomes. The OASIS EML standard seeks to help facilitate transparency, access and involvement for citizens to the election process. The primary function of an electronic voting system is to capture voter preferences reliably and securely and then report results accurately, while meeting legal requirements for privacy. The process of vote capture occurs between 'a voter' (individual person) and 'an e-voting system' (machine). It is critical that any election system be able to prove that a voter's choice is captured correctly and anonymously, and that the vote is not subject to tampering, manipulation or other sources of undue influence. These universal democratic principles can be summarized as a list of fundamental requirements, or 'six commandments', for electronic voting systems: # Keep each voter's choice an inviolable secret. # Allow each eligible voter to vote only once, and only for those offices for which he/she is authorized to cast a vote. # Do not permit tampering with the voting systems operations, nor allow voters to sell their votes. # Report all votes accurately # The voting system shall remain operable throughout each election. # Keep an audit trail to detect any breach of [2] and [4] but without violating [1]. EML was developed following these guidelines. =Design of EML= The goal of the committee is to develop an Election Markup Language (EML) for end-to-end use within the election process. This is a set of data and message definitions described as a set of XML schemas and covering a wide range of transactions that occurs during various phases and stages of the life cycle of an election. To achieve this, the committee decided that it required a common terminology and definition of election processes that could be understood internationally. The committee therefore started by defining the generic election process models described here. These processes are illustrative, covering the vast majority of election types and forming a basis for defining the Election Markup Language itself. EML has been designed such that elections that do not follow this process model should still be able to use EML as a basis for the exchange of election-related messages. EML is focused on defining open, secure, standardised and interoperable interfaces between components of election systems and thereby providing transparent and secure interfaces between various parts of an election system. The scope of election security, integrity and audit included in these interface descriptions and the related discussions are intended to cover security issues pertinent only to the standardised interfaces and not to the internal or external security requirements of the various components of election systems. The security requirement for the election system design, implementation or evaluation must be placed within the context of the vulnerabilities and threats analysis of a particular election scenario. As such the references to security within EML are not to be taken as comprehensive requirements for all election systems in all election scenarios, nor as recommendations of sufficiency of approach when addressing all the security aspects of election system design, implementation or evaluation. In fact, the data security mechanisms described in EML documentation are all optional, enabling compliance with EML without regard for system security at all. It is anticipated that implementers may develop a complementary document for a specific election scenario, which refines the security issues defined in this document and determines their specific strategy and approach by leveraging what EML provides. EML is meant to assist and enable the election process and does not require any changes to traditional methods of conducting elections. The extensibility of EML makes it possible to adjust to various e-democracy processes without affecting the process. Conceptually EML simply enables the exchange of data between the various end-to-end election stages and processes in a standardized way. The solution outlined in EML is non- proprietary and will work as a template for any election scenario using electronic systems for all or part of the process. The objective is to introduce a uniform and reliable way to allow election systems to interact with each other. The OASIS EML standard is intended to reinforce public confidence in the election process and to facilitate the job of democracy builders by introducing guidelines for the selection or evaluation of future election systems.

He was also a powerful figure within the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), an umbrella organization bringing together right- wing paramilitary groups from all over the country. He was well known for being a ruthless fighter against guerrilla groups, and for being able to evict these rebel groups and take control of their territories. The Centaurs bloc was one of the largest and most powerful groups within the AUC, and was very well organized, to the point that they even had a running web page that is no longer in service (www.bloquecentauros.org). Arroyave was a member of the AUC's team of negotiators when talks began with the government on demobilizing the paramilitary organizations which had proliferated over the previous decades. These paramilitary organizations were created first to fight against the left-wing guerrilla armies which controlled large parts of rural Colombia since the 1960s. Arroyave was very close to the Castaño family, founders of different paramilitary organizations, and he also had control over the Capital bloc (\\"Bloque Capital\\") which controlled the paramilitary militia in Bogotá. Early years José Miguel Arroyave was born in Amalfi, Antioquia. He was very close to the Castaño family, small landowners from northern Colombia who founded the first paramilitary group in the early 1980s. Miguel Arroyave was from a humble rural background, and claims to have been a childhood friend of Carlos Castaño's older brother, Vicente Castaño, with whom he went to school in a small village near Amalfi, in the 1960s. He said that he completed his education at one of Bogotá's leading schools, and later became involved in a gold-mining venture, from which he made some money.  Paramilitary Leader  While he was from the Antioquia department, it was in the Eastern Plains regions where he made a name as a criminal. Apparently, he moved to the department of Meta around 1990 where he became a trafficker of chemical products necessary for the processing of cocaine. Arroyave was arrested in 1999, and spent two years in detention, while he tried to convince the authorities that his wealth had not come from illegal activities. He appears to have been involved in the processing and shipping of cocaine to the United States, though he always denied it, as well as in cattle-rustling and in smuggling rackets, but nothing was ever proved against him. It was after he was released from prison that he supposedly contacted the Castaño brothers so that he could \\"buy a franchise\\" from the powerful AUC paramilitary organization, which allowed him to exert control over a large extension of lands in the Eastern Plains. Arroyave apparently acquired the leadership of the Centaurs Bloc by paying a fee of U$6 million, although some of his men have questioned the veracity of this claim. The Centaurs Bloc of the AUC was mostly a gang of thugs involved in crime and blackmailing, which collected money from traders and farm owners in the Eastern Plains in Colombia. It has been said that at some point he managed to rule over 6.000 men in the departments of Meta, Casanare, Boyacá, Cundinamarca, and Guaviare. He also extended his criminal emporium to Bogotá, where by way of the Capital Bloc of the AUC, which he founded and commanded, he controlled a portion of the trade occurring in the traditional “sanandresitos” (old shopping malls where smuggled items and appliances can be bought). Arroyave also started at some point a bloody war against the Autodefensas Campesinas de Casanare (ACC), a powerful paramilitary group commanded by Héctor Germán Buitrago (aka Martín Llanos) operating on the same territory. Following this bloody feud, which left about 3,000 fatalities, Arroyave became paranoid and suspicious of everyone and began spying on his own men and even ordered some killed, which brought fear and hatred among his troops and has been mentioned as the reason why he was later murdered. Arroyave was close to Carlos Castaño, one of three Castaño brothers, who had founded the AUC and exerted a degree of influence over most of the 20,000 or so paramilitaries operating in Colombia. However, Castaño's influence and power had been waning within the organization in his last few years, particularly as many paramilitary groups became involved in drug trafficking, and earlier in 2004 the AUC split over the conduct of negotiations with the government of President Álvaro Uribe, whose crackdown on the left-wing guerrillas had impressed some paramilitary commanders. In April, 2004, Castaño disappeared before the talks could begin, following an assault on his headquarters by gunmen apparently dispatched by rival commanders. He has not been seen since, and some human remains were recently discovered, apparently proving that he was in fact assassinated. Whatever the case, with Castaño's disappearance Arroyave lost his main supporter and ally within the AUC. Death Following Castaño's disappearance, the remaining AUC leaders subsequently appointed a panel of negotiators, including Arroyave, who now appears to have suffered the same fate as Castaño. Arroyave was killed on September 19, 2004 near Puerto Lleras, Department of Meta in the heart of his home territory, during a break in the talks with the government, which had been going on since May in a safe haven in Córdoba, far to the north. The vehicle in which he was traveling along with four other men was hit by rocket- propelled grenades. El Universal (Bogota) Fiscalía confirmó asesinato de importante jefe de las Auc The government's chief negotiator, High Commissioner for Peace Luis Carlos Restrepo Ramírez, explained that Arroyave had gone back to the department of Meta to organize the immediate demobilization of his forces. There are plenty of possible candidates for the murder of Arroyave, who had a great deal of blood on his hands. Perhaps the most likely culprit is \\"Martin Llanos\\", leader of the Autodefensas Campesinas de Casanare (ACC) (Farmer Self-Defense Forces of Casanare), the paramilitary group with which Arroyave had been involved in a protracted and bloody feud for more than a year in the eastern plains region. He had been in conflict, too, with other paramilitary chiefs over control of territory, drug- trafficking routes and protection rackets, which continued even while the peace talks were going on. Another possibility, favored by army intelligence, is that Arroyave was assassinated by a hit squad from the main left-wing guerrilla organization, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The AUC leadership, however, laid the blame on a rival within Arroyave's very own Centauros organization: they named Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero Castillo (aka \\"Cuchillo\\") as the killer, and described him and his associates as \\"enemies of peace and opponents of the demobilization process in the eastern plains\\". It has been recently uncovered that Guerrero was working under the orders of Daniel Barrera (aka \\"El loco\\"), a notorious drug lord in Colombia who is in jail in the United States government on charges of drug smuggling into this country. Arroyave, along with Carlos Castaño remains one the most powerful and important assassinated members from the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia organization.

His brothers Eddy De Bie and Rudy De Bie also competed professionally. Career Born in Beersel, De Bie achieved several successes on the road but started to focus on cyclo-cross full-time after taking the silver medal at the 1987 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. He went to Switzerland which was at that time the main place for cyclo-cross races. Two years later he achieved that. The World Cyclo-Cross Championships parcours at Pont-Château in 1989, was a course that was suited to him. De Bie was able to cycle up a tough climb of almost 100 metres where his opponents such as Adri van der Poel had to walk and as a result De Bie was able to make a gap every time he went over the climb. After winning the rainbow jersey, De Bie became one of the best cyclo crossers of the world with a win in the Superprestige classification and increased popularity for the sport in Belgium. In 1991 De Bie was suspected of possible tampering with a doping control after a Superprestige race in Zillebeke and he was not allowed to take part in the World Championships that year in Gieten. De Bie was Belgium cyclo-cross champion for three years in a row and then beaten by Paul Herijgers. De Bie in his career won 11 Superprestige races. After his career he worked as directeur sportif for the team between 2000 and 2014, and in 2015.

Together they collectively make up The Pretty Committee, an Alpha clique at the fictional, all-girls middle school, Octavian Country Day. Claire Lyons is a misfit girl from Orlando, Florida who shops at GAP and tries to fit into the Pretty Committee. Massie is the head of the group, while Claire, a newcomer to the area, is initially considered an outcast due to her financial and fashion status. As the series progresses, she slowly develops a friendship with Massie, and eventually becomes a member of the group. The first novel, The Clique, was released on May 5, 2004. As of March 2010, the series spans fourteen full-length novels, and a five novella sub-series called the \\"Clique Summer Collection.\\" Characters = Massie Block = Massie Block is a popular girl at Octavian Country Day (OCD), is alpha of the Pretty Committee, and is used to being the Top Alpha and idol of all the students, until Claire, a new girl from Orlando, moves to Westchester. Massie has brown hair, amber eyes, and expensive wardrobe. She is described as wearing (the fictional) Chanel No. 9 every day and people often mistake her signature scent for Chanel No. 19. On special occasions, she wears No. 5., while Chanel No. 19 is listed as her signature scent in \\"The Cliquetionary\\". At first, Massie cannot stand Claire and decides to make her life miserable, and Claire doesn't understand why Massie doesn't like her, but Claire doesn't exactly think the best of Massie's friends, the PC (Pretty Committee). Massie sees Claire as a threat and is determined to stop her. Her lifelong struggle was to be the Top Alpha, or the Ruler. Claire responds by turning Massie's friends against her, thinking it was the only way to \\"fit in\\" and be the \\"popular girl\\" at school, to make everyone like and envy her. At the end of the second book, they finally become friends. Throughout tough times, Massie and Claire start to rely on each other. In the first book Massie falls for Chris Abeley but discovers that he already has a girlfriend named Fawn. In the second book Massie and Claire throw a Halloween party and they both really like a Briarwood boy named Cam Fisher. In the third book Massie finds out that Alicia started her own Clique and discovers Cam likes Claire, not her. While dealing with Alicia, Massie starts liking Derrick Harrington, or Derrington, as the girls secretly call him. Her life is pure interesting, with Nina the Spanish boy-charming slut, getting expelled from OCD in Lake Placid thanks to Dylan's mom and their teacher, losing the lead role in 'Dial L for Loser' to Claire, searching for the key to a secret room and not finding it first, getting Chris to fall for Skye Hamilton even though they were falling for each other, and designing the overflow trailers. Massie also falls for Dempsey, and finally, her perfect match, Landon Crane, who sort of becomes her boyfriend. Although Massie is known as the alpha, she is the one whom her friends have turned against the most often of the five girls. It has been stated throughout the series that Alicia Rivera is prettier than Massie, but Massie is known as being over-thinking, and overall \\"leader\\" of the Pretty Committee, making her the true alpha. In the book My Little Phony, Massie finds out that her parents have gone broke.Then Claire finds out. But in the book \\"A Tale of Two Pretties\\" her dad gets a new job but she has to move away from the Pretty Committee to England. When this happens, Alicia becomes the Alpha & Queen Bee, and Massie meets a new hottie, James, a brown-haired, British \\"Bawttie\\". Massie also loves making nicknames for LBRs (Losers Beyond Repair). Massie is played by Elizabeth McLaughlin in the Clique film. = Alicia Rivera = Alicia is a half Spanish beauty with black, glossy hair, and chocolate eyes. She and Massie have different positions in the group; While Massie is the Top Alpha/Ruler, Alicia is portrayed as the beta. Massie is secretly envious of Alicia's good looks. Even though she is prettier than Massie, Massie holds supreme alpha status, which frustrates Alicia. In 'Revenge of the Wannabes',she breaks free from the alpha's hold and decides to start her own clique with her light blonde haired, light blue eyed friend, Olivia Ryan. They are known as the Twenty by the Briarwood Boys, because the pair are perfect tens. However, their progress is slow, and they can only clasp hold on Strawberry, a pink haired, soccer playing, slightly chubby girl, and dirty- blonde haired, bad postured girl, Kori. At the end of the book, at a Teen Vogue photo shoot, she and Massie make up, and Alicia dumps the LBRs (Loser Beyond Repair.) She also had a very large crush on Cam Fisher's sixteen-year- old brother, Harris. Alicia develops a serious crush on a new Briarwood boy named Josh, right in time for her sexy cousin Nina to convince Alicia that he likes her, even though Josh is downright in love with Alicia. When problems circulate throughout the whole Pretty Committee, the whole group is dumped by their boyfriends, except Alicia, who sees her hot boyfriend Josh Hotz behind Massie's back after she calls on a boy-fast. The whole crew deals with maintaining their alpha status when the Briarwood boys move into OCD, their girls-only private school. Alicia and Josh then start openly dating, and he ruins the atmosphere at her adult(ish) Couple's Dinner party in Boys R us. Alicia Rivera is played by Samantha Boscarino in the Clique film. Alicia wants to be a famous news reporter, or famous gossip anchor when she's an adult. In 'A tale of Two Pretties' Massie's father loses his job, and the family becomes broke. The Block family moves to England, which make Alicia the: 'Top Alpha; Queen Bee'. =Dylan Marvil= Dylan Marvil has thick red hair, green eyes and is self-conscious about her weight. Her crush is Chris Plovert. She has a famous mother named Merri-lee Marvil, who is the host of a fictional show, The Daily Grind. She also has 2 older sisters named Ryan and Jamie. In Best Friends Fornever, she and Kristen were fighting over Derrington. In Invasion of the Boy Snatchers, she and Kristen started kissing up to Nina Callas and she and Kristen were in a contest to see who ever kisses their crush first they'll get a pair of Nina's boots. In The Pretty Committee Strikes Back, her mom is a chaperone for their class field trip and her mom starts liking her teacher, Mr. Myner which was embarrassing. In Dial L for Loser, she doesn't get to go to Hollywood because someone over heard her spill one of the movie star's secret. In Sealed with a Diss, she is known for being the boyish one of The Pretty Committee from The Briarwood Boys and gains a few pounds for them to love her. = Kristen Gregory = Kristen Michelle Gregory is the athlete and the genius of the Pretty Committee. She is good at making comebacks to mean comments. In books 1–3, she is obsessed with crossword puzzles, but switches to word jumbles in book 4. While she is part of the Pretty Committee, she hardly has any main plotlines revolving around her. She is very smart and attends Octavian Country Day school on a scholarship. It is revealed about halfway through the first book that Kristen is \\"poor\\", but she is really middle class. The only way she was able to go to OCD was through a scholarship. She stands as the reason to the Pretty Committee, always at hand with a witticism or moral. While she has a tendency to switch to the winning side during fights, she proves to be a very loyal friend to the entire Pretty Committee. She loves to play soccer and is mistaken for a boy in the fourth book when her mom cuts all her hair off and she is forced to wear hats. It is revealed in the Kristen summer series book that she is the alpha of the \\"Witty Committee\\" which includes LBRs like Layne Abeley. She has a crush on Dune, a cute surfer, but later develops a crush on Dempsey Solomon, her new neighbor, who is being fought over by Layne and Massie. In Boys R Us, they develop a relationship, which irritates both Massie and Layne. That was the first real fight between Massie and Kristen. She is described as having blonde hair and aqua blue eyes. Kristen is played by Bridgit Mendler in the Clique film. In a pull out poster in the last book her plans for the future would be a soccer player. Bridget also plays on \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" as Teddy Duncan. =Claire Lyons= Claire Stacey Lyons is the “New Girl” of the Pretty Committee in the series. At the beginning of the series, Claire was teased constantly by the Pretty Committee, but survived months and is now a new member. Claire moved from Orlando, Florida. In Invasion of the Boy Snatchers, it was announced that she and her family would be moving to Chicago, but they end up staying in the guest house. Also in the book, it was revealed that Claire's full name is Claire Stacey Lyons. Now she lives in the Block's guesthouse and over the course of the series, has become very close friends with Massie. In the beginning of the series she is somewhat innocent and naïve, but is forced to mature as the cruel treatment from the Pretty Committee causes her to become more aware of what people think of her. She is obsessed with her boyfriend, Cam Fisher (and his green eye) (no offence blue eye), despite their on/off relationship. In Dial L For Loser, Claire becomes a celebrity and must mature even more because of hateful treatment from Massie, Alicia, and her so-called celebrity friends at the end of the book. In the 9th book Claire becomes jealous of her ex-boyfriend's relationship with Olivia Ryan. Claire's parents are Jay and Judi Lyons, and her little brother is Todd. Claire has said in the past that she was ashamed of her parents for being slightly overweight and not dressing like the rest of the parents in Westchester, but she enjoys the fact that they don't make fun of her for eating junk food. In It's Not Easy Being Mean Claire must choose between pursuing an acting career or staying in Westchester, and she then realizes how much Layne Abeley's friendship, Cam's admiration, and the Pretty Committee's membership means to her, so she decides to stay. Claire's first friend in Westchester is Layne Abeley, who becomes her best and only friend at school. As the year progresses, Claire forms friendships with Massie, Alicia, Dylan, and Kristen. Claire's appearance is described as pretty but in a plain sort of way, with blonde hair with bangs and blue-gray eyes. Claire is played by Ellen Marlow in the Clique film. In a pull out poster in the last book her plans for the future would be a wife to Cam and a mother to their children. Supporting characters =Layne Abeley= Layne Jane Abeley is one of Claire's friends outside of the Pretty Committee and the sister of Chris Abeley. Mostly known for her quirky habits, she has peculiar food obsessions and wears headgear to school adorned with light-up magnets and picking outfits that do not match. Rather than wearing designer clothing like most OCD girls do, she shops at the men's department at the Salvation Army. She is often the butt of the PC's jokes, much to Claire's dismay. When Claire is fighting with Massie, Layne always helps her laugh. Layne's other friends are Meena and Heather, two girls that share Layne's interests. In P.S. I Loathe you she has a huge crush on Dempsey Soloman, who Massie also likes. Layne is always having fun and doesn't care what other people think about her. She is also known to be Claire's go to friend when she is having boy or PC (Pretty Committee) trouble. She is also described as a LBR or called \\"Layme\\", \\"Slow Layne\\", and \\"Layne the Stain\\" by the Pretty Committee. Layne Abeley is very brave, and does not care what other people think about her. In two of the books, Layne and Massie become BFFs. = Todd Lyons = Todd Lyons is Claire's ten-year-old brother. He has curly red hair, but in the movie he has black hair. He likes spying and once put a camera in Massie's shower. He was Massie's first lip kiss, much to her dismay. Massie may also like Todd a bit, because of the way she talked to Todd at the end of Revenge of the Wannabes. Todd has also been kissed by Alicia on the cheek, but he likes Massie better, because he thinks Massie is perfect. Todd is played by Dylan Minnette in the Clique film. = Cam Fisher = Cam first appears in the second novel, and is Claire Lyons' on again off again boyfriend. In the first few books, he is said to have black hair and two different colored eyes (one blue and one green). Massie initially had a crush on Cam, but after she learned he liked Claire she gave up on him. Initially Cam and Claire \\"date\\" by exchanging emails and Cam sending her gifts through her younger brother. When Cam begins avoiding her unexpectedly for weeks, Claire kisses Josh Hotz thinking Cam has broken up with her. Cam forgives her, only after sharing a kiss with Alicia Rivera. Later Claire begins spying on him when she suspects he is cheating. Innocent of the charge, and annoyed by her actions, he breaks up with her and begins dating Olivia. He later breaks up with Olivia, asks Claire to forgive him, and they begin dating again. It is also known that Dylan and Alicia met him before meeting each other at the New Year's Eve Party hosted by Dylan Marvil's mom Merri-Lee Marvil, in Charmed and Dangerous, the rise of the Pretty Committee. Cam is described as having dark hair and one blue eye and one green eye. Cam is also described to be Derrick Harrington's best friend and not quite as rich as his friends. Cam's brother is Harris. = Derrick Harrington = More often referred to as \\"Derrington' throughout the novels, Derrick appears prominently in Invasion of the Boy Snatchers, The Pretty Committee Strikes Back, Sealed with a Diss, Revenge of the Wannabes, P.S. I Loathe You, Best Friends for Never and Bratfest at Tiffany's. Derrick is described to have shaggy blonde hair, big caramel eyes and to overall remind people of a golden lab. He's said to be the boy alpha as well as best friend to Cam Fisher. Derrick acts as a dramatic foil for Massie, starting out as her friends' crush, then her crush, then her boyfriend and, eventually, her ex-boyfriend. Derrick seems to be the only boy that Massie gets nervous around. He is described as having various quirks, including wearing shorts all the time, even in winter, wiggling and flashing his butt after scoring a goal and referring to most people, even Massie, by their last names. Massie and Derrick's relationship is foreshadowed in the third book, but it is fully revealed in the fourth one. After Nina Callas convinces Massie that Derrick likes her (Nina) and not Massie, Massie ignores him. After Nina is thrown out of OCD, Massie and Derrick talk and they make up. Massie gives Derrick her \\"M\\" brooch, which he continues to wear well into the fifth book. In The Pretty Committee Strikes Back Massie, through a series of lies to the other girls she is \\"tutoring\\" to kiss, unintentionally leads Derrick to believe that she has been seeing someone else. He confronts her and she apologizes. They kiss and make up once again and it seems as if their relationship is good and well. However, he breaks up with Massie in book 8, because he has an \\"issue\\" with her. He later tells her he's into older girls because they're more \\"mature\\". He also thinks Massie is dating Chris Abeley, Layne's older brother because she spends a lot of time with Chris. This is because for the key to the secret room (bomb shelter where alpha eighth graders hang out) from 8th grade alpha Skye Hamilton, Massie has to get Chris to like Skye. If Massie doesn't hook up Skye with Chris, the PC doesn't get access to the bomb shelter at all, thus destroying their hopes of their 8th grade alpha status. In the ninth book, Derrick changes his style, (i.e. wearing jeans for the first time) but Massie becomes interested in Dempsey Solomon, a once LBR. In P.S. I Loathe You, Derrick confesses to Dylan, to whom he has taken a slight interest, that he only wore shorts because he had lost a bet & that he didn't like the nickname \\"Derrington\\". In the same book, he starts dating Dylan. Also he was mentioned along with Cam Fisher in Charmed and Dangerous: The Rise of the Pretty Committee. Derrick and Cam are implied to be best friends. In These Boots Are Made For Stalking, Dylan and Derrick (sort of) break up, because she was disgusted that he lost a bet and had to wear all his clothes backward for the rest of the year. In A Tale of Two Pretties', Derrick is mentioned many times throughout all the girls POV's even though he's only briefly in the beginning of the book. He also wants to crush Massie's status in Bratfest at Tiffany's but he was not ever really showed to do any anything to do threaten her. = Josh Hotz = Josh Hotz first appears in the fourth novel. Alicia sees him as a potential crush and begins to gather information on him. She learns that he is not an exchange student from Hotchkiss Academy as the principal told everyone, but, rather, he was expelled after pulling a fire alarm before a major test. He is on the soccer team, as many of the Pretty Committee's crushes are, and is described to be a preppy Ralph Lauren lover and enjoys gossip, like Alicia. He remains relatively unseen in Invasion of the Boy Snatchers, only appears three times in the entire book, but he is featured more prominently in Bratfest at Tiffany's. At the end of Invasion of the Boy Snatchers Claire Lyons kisses him because Cam Fisher was ignoring her. He is led to believe that Claire genuinely likes him and seems somewhat hurt when Claire gets back together with Cam. In Dial L For Loser, Josh shows that he likes Alicia back by giving her daisies. Little is seen of him in It's Not Easy Being Mean and he reappears at the end of Sealed with a Diss after attending Skye Hamilton's Famous Couples party with Alicia as Ralph and Ricky Lauren. In Bratfest at Tiffany's Josh and Alicia secretly begin dating even though Massie's boy-fast prohibits the Pretty Committee girls from dating. When Massie finds out that they are still dating, Alicia gets mad, saying he was the first boy who liked her who she actually was, not because they simply thought she was really hot. At the end of \\"Bratfest at Tiffany's\\" Massie calls off the boy-fast. They are still going strong in Boys R Us. In These Boots Are Made For Stalking, they (sort of) break up again(because Alicia was disgusted that Josh had the same, if not smaller, clothing size as her.) It is unknown if they get back together again, but in 'A Tale of Two Pretties' there was a brief mention of him in Alicia's POV, implying that they still like each other. =Dempsey Solomon= Dempsey Solomon is a friend and crush of Layne's. When he was considered a \\"loser\\", he was called \\"Humpty Dempsey\\" by Massie because he was overweight. Over the summer, he and his parents went to Africa to help rebuild houses, during which he lost weight and got a tan. Massie crushes on him in book 9, despite the rules of her own \\"boyfast\\". Claire uses him to \\"jealousy-flirt\\" so she can get Cam Fisher back, again despite the boyfast. He was the role model for the LBR guys in the overflow trailers when Massie was giving them make-overs. At the end, Massie ends up liking him so much that she ends her own \\"boyfast\\". In P.S I Loathe You, both Layne (Kristen's Secret Best Friend) and Massie ask Kristen to find out who he likes, as they are neighbors. Dempsey reveals that he likes Kristen, and in Boys R Us, they begin to date. He ends up joining the soccer team and befriends his team members. In These Boots Are Made For Stalking they (sort of) break up, though in 'A Tale Of Two Pretties', Dempsey visits Kristen at Christmas, in which she is very glad to see him, implying they still like each other. =Landon Crane= Landon Crane is a 9th-grade high schooler who goes to ADD, the local public school. He has messy black wavy hair, blue-green eyes that seem to change color, one dimple, and a puppy named Bark Obama. He and Massie met in Boys R Us at her Ho Ho Homeless Charity Drive/ Fashion Show. They immediately like each other. At first, Massie is unsure how much she likes him, as she had bad experiences with boys, having had Derrington and Dempsey taken away from her. In \\"These Boots Are Made For Stalking\\", she seems to be almost obsessed with him, stalking and spying on him. Massie's dog, Bean, likes Bark Obama a lot too, licking his picture and such. His mom, Celia Crane, is the pet boutique owner of 'Bark Jacobs'. His family is very rich, about the same as Massie's. Massie later says that Landon was probably the first boy she ever actually liked for him, not his status or his looks(even though he was pretty popular and very good looking). She also says that he had everything she had ever wanted in a guy, good fashion sense, in high school, a puppy, etc. In A Tale of Two Pretties, Hermia, the psychic tells Massie that even though he is really great, he is not the guy for her. When Massie moves to England, they have a heart-to-heart conversation about whether it would be realistic having a transnational relationship. They decide to stay as friends, as Massie later puts, she thinks they will always be, only just friends. =Skye Hamilton = Skye Hamilton is an 8th grade alpha who first appears in It's Not Easy Being Mean with her own clique, the DSL Daters, so named for their rapid connecting with boys. Her parents, including her famous-dancer mother, own the Body Alive Dance Studio. She herself adores dancing - and performing. She has bangle bracelets on her wrist, one for each boy she has kissed. She is beautiful with wavy blonde hair and turquoise eyes. Skye Hamilton becomes one of the main characters in Harrison's spin-off series, \\"Alphas\\". =Olivia Ryan= Olivia Ryan is Alicia's friend from dance class, and is often referred to as \\"Duh-Livia\\" for her ditzy nature, and \\"Faux-Livia\\" because she likes to buy cheap knock-offs like fake Louis Vuitton scarves. Everyone finds Alicia prettier than Olivia but in a less obvious way. When Olivia and Alicia attempt to form their own clique, it is she who recruits Kori and Strawberry. She later steals Cam from Claire, but Cam soon dumps Olivia because of her ditziness. She also constantly gets nose jobs. She is beautiful with her buttery blonde waves, navy eyes and a perfect body, and would be a no-brainer for Massie's clique if they didn't have a \\"No air head\\" policy. =Nina Callas= She came into the book Invasion of the Boy Snatchers. A year older than the Pretty Committee (13), she grabbed the sight of many Briarwood boys with her D-cups, boots, and body. She led Claire, Alicia, and Massie to think their crushes were in love with her and not them. In Invasion Of The Boy Snatchers, Nina told Cam Fisher, Derrington, and Josh Hotz about a \\"Spanish Spell\\" that would help them win their soccer finals, that meant if they stayed away from the girls (Claire, Massie, and Alicia) they would win their soccer match. The OCD girls loved Nina's fashion, but it turned out she was a thief and had stolen her looks (clothes) from her sisters, Celia and Isobel, as well as various items from the girls at OCD. She is only in two of the books: Invasion of the Boy Snatchers and The Clique Summer Collection: Alicia. Nina is pitied upon by Alicia. It is said that as a punishment for stealing her sister's boots they made her dye her hair platinum gold and cut it to match Dora's hairstyle. =James= James is a British boy, about the same age as Landon, with wavy black hair, dimples, and penny brown eyes. Massie and James met on the airplane to England. He is probably the boy the psychic Hermia predicted would end up with Massie (she said that she sees changes with a boy named James, not Landon). He is said to be going to KISS school in England, the same school Massie is going to attend.

Atlassian wrote Confluence in the Java programming language and first published it in 2004. Confluence Standalone comes with a built-in Tomcat web server and hsql database, and also supports other databases.https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-a-datasource- connection-937166084.html The company markets Confluence as enterprise software, licensed as either on-premises software or software as a service running on AWS.https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/atlassian- standard-infrastructure/ History Atlassian released Confluence 1.0 on March 25, 2004, saying its purpose was to build \\"an application that was built to the requirements of an enterprise knowledge management system, without losing the essential, powerful simplicity of the wiki in the process.\\" In recent versions, Confluence has evolved into part of an integrated collaboration platform and has been adapted to work in conjunction with Jira and other Atlassian software products, including Bamboo, Clover, Crowd, Crucible, and FishEye. In 2014, Atlassian released Confluence Data Center to add high availability with load balancing across nodes in a clustered setup. Analysis The book Social Media Marketing for Dummies in 2007 considered Confluence an \\"emergent enterprise social software\\" that was \\"becoming an established player.\\" Wikis for Dummies described it as \\"one of the most popular wikis in corporate environments,\\" \\"easy to set up and use,\\" and \\"an exception to the rule\\" that wiki software search capabilities don't work well. eWeek cited in 2011 such new features in version 4 as the auto-formatting and auto-complete, unified wiki and WYSIWYG, social network notifications and drag and drop integration of multimedia files. Use cases include basic enterprise communication, collaboration workspaces for knowledge exchange, social networking, Personal Information Management and project management. German newspaper Computerwoche from IDG Business Media compares it to Microsoft SharePoint and finds it \\"a good starting point\\" as a platform for social business collaboration, while SharePoint is better suited to companies with more structured processes. Confluence includes set up CSS templates for styles and formatting for all pages, including those imported from Word documents. Built in search allows queries by date, the page's author, and content type such as graphics. The tool has add-ons for integration with standard formats, with a flexible programmable API allowing expansion. The software is relevant as an outline tool for requirements that can be linked to tasks in the Jira issue tracker by the same company. Discontinuation of wiki markup As of version 4.0, in 2011,https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-4-0-release- notes-228622806.html Confluence ended support for wiki markup language. This led to a sometimes-heated discussion by some previous versions' users who objected to the change. In response, Atlassian provided a source code editor as a plugin, which allows advanced users the ability to edit the underlying XHTML-based document source. However, although the new source markup is XHTML- based, it is not XHTML compliant. Additionally, wiki markup can be typed into the editor and Confluence's autocomplete and auto-format function converts the wiki markup to the new format. After the real-time conversion, content can not be edited as wiki markup again.  Security  Confluence Cloud data is encrypted in transit and at rest.https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/security- practices?_ga=2.85233360.890195763.1562477558-1980951556.1561525377#faq-5fd9f2cf-d7c7-40fa- af1f-854e2d9f3f48  Limitations  There is no standard way of adding captions to images, there are only workarounds.

He came to public attention when a BBC documentary was broadcast about the search for him in 1994, after he had failed to claim an inheritance which included Fir Hill Manor. Inheritance dispute John Figg-Hoblyn came to public attention in 1994, when the BBC broadcast a documentary about him. In 1965 his father had bequeathed him a 1000-acre estate and the ruins of a manor house, Fir Hill Manor, in Cornwall, England. According to the Official Solicitor, John failed to take up the inheritance. The Official Solicitor was appointed in 1972 to manage the estate for John Figg-Hoblyn in the 1970s when they lost contact with him. The BBC documentary discovered Figg-Hoblyn was living in a caravan park in California, United States, where he and his sister, Peggy, were following a low-key lifestyle trading in organic produce. John was something of a naturalist and lived a simple life. He worked for the government as a marine biologist as well as taught at Stanford University and San Jose State University. The BBC subsequently lost contact with him. In 2007 the next-in- line to inherit the estate as the eldest male, John Westropp Figg-Hoblyn, put out a call to find John Paget Figg-Hoblyn before the inheritance which included Fir Hill Manor was lost.Heir refuses to claim £5m estate, Daily Telegraph, 22 February 2007. Retrieved 6 May 2013. John Paget Figg-Hoblyn died in a nursing home on 12 June 2011 at the age of 85. The estate was reportedly divided between his surviving sisters, with John Westropp Figg-Hoblyn receiving a much smaller sum. The Fir Hill Woods were sold to Charles Hoblyn, a distant cousin[4], and the Figg-Hoblyn's are retaining an historical cottage. Academic career Figg-Hoblyn was educated at Stanford University, California, United States. His doctorate dissertation in entomology was titled Morphology of the Head and Foregut of Neomachilis Halophilus which was published in 1977 by the Dept. of Biological Sciences. In 1953, he described a unique species of jewel beetle that he had discovered, which was given the name Acmaeodera nanbrownae. This name is now classified as a junior synonym for Acmaeodera vanduzeei. Dr. Figg-Hoblyn used to have a lab at Stanford University, and taught at San Jose State University.

Its original name was Durgarazpatnam (Dugarazpatam) or Duraspatam. It was chiefly inhabited by salt manufacturers. A small port 36 miles North of Pulicat it was the first place occupied by the British who erected a factory here in February 1626. It was hastily abandoned in 1641 in favour of Fort St. George. East India Company pioneer Streynsham Master (1640-1724) described the factory house as having \\"walls two Storeys high of one part of it, and a round Bulwart built single by itself\\". History In the time of Gurava Naidu, the great great grandfather of Raja Gopal Naidu, some Englishmen came to the port and sent for the chief men of the place, Gurava Naidu and the accountant, Patnaswamula Armogam Mudaliar, and said they wished to build a fort there. They landed a cannon and fired a shot in a westerly direction and asked for as much as land the shot had traversed. The land belonged to Venkatagiri Raja, who was induced by Gurava Naidu and Armogam to allow the strangers to occupy the spot called Chenva Kuppam. Accordingly, they built a fort there and called the place in the honour of Armogam Mudaliar.

Jem and the Holograms Jem and the Holograms from left to right: Aja Leith, Shana Elmsford, Jerrica 'Jem' Benton, Kimber Benton, and Carmen 'Raya' Alonso * Jem/Jerrica Benton (voiced by Samantha Newark / singing voice recorded by Britta Phillips) – Jem is the leader of the Holograms where she provides the lead vocals. She is the alter-ego of Jerrica Benton, owner of Starlight Music and a foster home for girls known as \\"Starlight House\\" (later called \\"Starlight Mansion\\"). Jerrica was inherited both Starlight Music and Starlight House from her late father, Emmett Benton. Using the power of Synergy, a powerful computer with holographic capabilities, Jerrica can become Jem by touching her special star-shaped earrings (the \\"Jemstar earrings\\"). Most stories of the series consist of Jerrica hiding her identity from others, especially Rio Pacheco, her long-time boyfriend. Synergy's holograms are integral to maintaining the illusion that Jerrica and Jem are two different people. Jerrica tends to compartmentalize her life in some respects and even occasionally shows jealousy toward the alter-ego of Jem she created, as she is able to indulge in her inhibitions far more freely than she can as Jerrica. * Kimber Benton (voiced by Cathianne Blore, singing voice recorded by Florence Warner) – Kimber is Jerrica's younger sister and the primary songwriter of the Holograms. Kimber is also the keyboards, synthesizers, and backup vocals for the band. Episodes in which Kimber is the main focus often involve romance and rebellion, such as her jealousy towards the media attention that Jem gets. She has extreme emotions and is very sensitive, often shown by her tantrums, which appear from time to time. These emotional outbursts are due largely in part to the impact of the death of Kimber and Jerrica's father, Emmett had on her—something, as seen in \\"Father's Day\\", Kimber still grieves over to this day. Kimber also has a close friendship with Mary \\"Stormer\\" Phillips, one of the Misfits. A hopeless romantic, Kimber has many boyfriends and love interests on the show but is not very serious about any of them (except for the British teen idol Sean Harrison). In the \\"Hollywood Jem\\" two-parter, Kimber nearly marries Jeff Wright, a stuntman who makes appearances from time to time on the show as one of her many boyfriends, but both of them agree to call off the ceremony and remain friends after she realizes she is truly in love with Sean. Kimber becomes an equal partner in Starlight Music after the Misfits lose the Battle of the Bands to Jem and Eric Raymond was forced to relinquish his ownership of half of the company to Jerrica, who in turn gives it to Kimber. * Aja Leith (voiced by Cathianne Blore) – Aja is a foster girl who grew up with the other Holograms at Starlight House. She is the lead guitarist and backup vocals for the Holograms. Aja was the first foster child adopted by Jacqui and Emmett Benton, Jerrica and Kimber's parents. She is romantically involved with Craig Phillips, the brother of the Misfit's keytarist, Stormer. Aja is almost always the driver of the Rockin' Roadster, the primary vehicle of the group. In the series, Aja is described as being a tomboy and the second in the command of the group and also has considerable knowledge of electronics. In \\"Out of the Past\\", it is revealed that she had a friendship with Rio when they were younger, mainly due to her interest in tinkering with mechanics and technology. This caused some mild feelings of jealousy in Jerrica, but this didn't last very long. Aja is the only one of the Holograms who has some experience with the inner workings of Synergy, and using her knowledge, she helps retrieve her foster mother's song tracks in \\"Out of the Past\\". * Shana Elmsford (voiced by Cindy McGee) – Shana is a foster girl who grew up with Kimber, Jerrica and Aja at Starlight House and was the second child to be adopted by the Bentons. Shana provides the synth drums, bass guitar, and backup vocals for the group. Despite Shana's shy demeanor she eventually became good friends with the other girls. Shana's boyfriend is music producer Anthony Julian; she also designs many of the Holograms' clothes. Shana briefly left the group to pursue a career in fashion as a designer for actress Liz Stratton, wrongly assuming she was not wanted. Shana later walked off the production when she decided she'd had enough of Stratton's ego. She returns to the band and switches instruments playing the bass guitar while Raya takes over on drums. Shana sometimes expresses doubts in her talents as a designer, particularly in \\"In Stitches\\" when she is needled over this by Roxy and the other Misfits. She has great respect for Danielle DuVoison, who has taken a personal interest in Shana's work and often gives her helpful advice. * Carmen 'Raya' Alonso (voiced by Linda Dangcil) – Raya is the Mexican American drummer of the Holograms and one of the back-up singers. Quiet, kind and unassuming, Raya won the position of drummer for the Holograms during a nationwide talent search, beating close competitor Craig Phillips (Stormer's brother) in a drum duel. Raya inadvertently learned Jem's identity and was pursued by Eric Raymond and the Misfits to reveal Jerrica; however, Raya never gave in. After Shana returns to the group, Raya continues on as the Holograms' drummer while Shana takes up the bass guitar. Raya is the only member of the Holograms who comes from a family and whose parents are still alive and has three brothers. She is also the only Hologram who doesn't have a romantic interest. The Misfits The Misfits from left to right: Roxanne \\"Roxy\\" Pelligrini, Mary \\"Stormer\\" Phillips, Phyllis \\"Pizzazz\\" Gabor, and Sheila \\"Jetta\\" Burns * Phyllis \\"Pizzazz\\" Gabor (voiced by Patricia Alice Albrecht, singing voice recorded by Ellen Bernfeld) – Pizzazz is an archetypal spoiled rich girl who is the lead vocals and guitarist of the Misfits. Pizzazz was raised by her tycoon father Harvey Gabor and spoiled as a child. Pizzazz is the primary antagonist of the show, constantly trying to upstage Jem and the Holograms, she has been shown to be attracted to Rio (Jem/Jerrica's boyfriend), Sean Harrison (British teen idol and Kimber's on-and-off boyfriend), and Riot (of The Stingers). Pizzazz despises her real name \\"Phyllis\\" and is prone to fits of rage if things don't go her way. Although Pizzazz has been raised in the presence of wealth and privilege her entire life and does enjoy the comforts it affords, she doesn't truly crave them as one would expect and instead desires to be famous and the object of adoration. Pizzazz's anger issues and obsession with fame/attention could be linked to her relationship with her parents. In \\"Father's Day\\", Pizzazz's father, Harvey, explains that she was never the same emotionally after her mother left them when Pizzazz was young. In addition, in the same episode, Pizzazz tries to plan an outing with her father on Father's Day, which he declines (saying that she can, \\"buy him something for 'Father's Day' if she wants,\\" but not to spend too much on a gift, because the money being spent was \\"his\\" money.) This action/response from Harvey shows the pattern of parental neglect and emotional detachment and shows that he does not acknowledge Pizzazz's own earned success/fortune/career. The episode ends with Harvey borrowing a friend's jet to fly Jem and the Holograms (a band he knows that his daughter does not get along with) to play at an event The Misfits are attending, going as far as to exit the jet with Hologram, Kimber, in arm. In \\"The Day the Music Died\\", she and Eric Raymond succeeded in wresting control of Starlight Music away from Jerrica and Kimber, but it proved to be a short-lived and hollow victory as Pizzazz found herself struggling heavily with the company's debts and business demands. That, coupled with the Starlight Girls deliberately harassing them so much, forced them to relinquish control back to Jerrica. She is Hungarian-American. * Roxanne \\"Roxy\\" Pelligrini (voiced by Samantha Paris, aka Bobbie Block) – Roxy is the Misfits' Italian-American tough-as-nails bassist who also provides the backup vocals. A high school dropout from Philadelphia, she was almost completely illiterate until one of the Starlight girls, Ba Nee, gave her a children's book to learn to read. She takes an instant dislike to new Misfit Jetta, and the two are often at odds with each other. * Mary \\"Stormer\\" Phillips (voiced by Susan Blu, singing voice recorded by Lani Groves) – Stormer is the primary songwriter of the Misfits, Keytarist for the band, and overall creative force behind the group (though she is almost never given credit for it). While Stormer does seem to enjoy causing mostly harmless mischief, she has never done anything truly malicious to Jem and the Holograms and often expressed concern over some of the Misfits' more ambitious attempts to upstage them. Sweet-natured and compassionate, Stormer is often pushed around by the other Misfits. In the episode, \\"The Bands Break Up\\", she and Kimber forge a friendship when both women, feeling unappreciated by their bandmates, strike out on their own, join forces, and record an album together. Though Stormer eventually returns to The Misfits (and Kimber to The Holograms), she does so with new-found self-assurance, and remains friends with Kimber. She also has a sweet tooth and is good with children. * Sheila \\"Jetta\\" Burns (voiced by Louise Dorsey) – Jetta became the newest Misfit when Stormer hears Jetta playing the saxophone in a seedy dance club during a search for new talent. Jetta is originally from England and comes from a poor family; despite this, she likes telling people her family has close ties with the British Royal Family. Jetta is also a skilled pickpocket. Extremely perceptive and calculating, Jetta almost immediately begins a rivalry with Roxy for status in the band. Jetta's parents, Bertie and Flo, made an appearance in the episode \\"Britrock\\" and, like their daughter, are always looking to make a quick buck. The Stingers The Stingers from left to right: Phoebe \\"Rapture\\" Ashe, Rory \\"Riot\\" Llewelyn, and Ingrid \\"Minx\\" Kruger * Rory \\"Riot\\" Llewelyn (voiced by Townsend Coleman, singing voice recorded by Gordon Grody) – The lead singer of the Stingers. Riot grew up in a strict household with his mother and army officer father who tried to force his values onto him. Riot displayed natural musical talent at a young age but was discouraged by his father who saw it as a sign of weakness. To escape his father's stronghold Riot joined the army but went AWOL in West Germany where he met Minx and began to play in a band. Upon realizing his own skill, Riot leaves the band to form his own with Minx joining him. Rapture soon joined and the Stingers were born. Riot is charming but aloof and arrogant. He is confident with his looks, believing he is the perfect man. Riot commands respect and demands devotion from his band-mates and fans alike, he is aware of the power he has over people and uses it for his own advantage. Riot's romantic interest in the show is Jem, he believes she is the perfect woman for him and pursues her relentlessly. Riot's relationship with his father was deeply strained over the years but, due to his mother's temporary illness and the efforts of Jem to reconcile them in the episode, \\"Riot's Hope\\", their relationship greatly improved. The two help the Holograms look for Ba Nee's long-lost father in the episode \\"A Father Should Be\\". Riot's image and appearance were allegedly based on David Coverdale from Whitesnake. * Phoebe \\"Rapture\\" Ashe (voiced by Ellen Gerstell, singing voice recorded by Vicki Sue Robinson) – Joining Riot and Minx in West Germany, Rapture makes up the third of the Golden Triumverate where she was the guitarist and backup vocals. Rapture is a skilled con artist and is quite knowledgeable in matters of the occult and uses that knowledge to further her own agenda, and often that of the Stingers, as well. She persuaded Mrs. Farnsworth to let the Stingers play a charity concert by pretending to channel the spirit of Houdini (\\"That Old Houdini Magic\\"). She milked several Greek townspeople out of their money pretending to be an Oracle (\\"Midsummer Night's Madness\\"). Rapture even maneuvered herself into a position to exchange a \\"chunk of crummy quartz\\" that she got from Pizzazz for a bracelet made of gold and diamonds (\\"The Stingers Hit Town\\"). While self-centered and arrogant, Rapture is intelligent, quick- thinking and has a great deal of performance ability to pull off her scams. She cares greatly for her bandmates and willingly takes orders from Riot on a business level—she knows all too well that his charm and charisma will take him places where she wants to go too. She has no romantic interest on the show. * Ingrid \\"Minx\\" Kruger (voiced by Kath Soucie, singing voice recorded by Vicki Sue Robinson) – The German synthesizers and backup vocals for the Stingers. Like the other members of The Stingers, Minx is arrogant and only interested in herself, but will take orders and advice from the charismatic Riot, as she knows he is a man with a future and she wants to be there when it happens. She is cunning and manipulative, and prides herself on being able to have her pick of men, only to toss them away once she gets bored, which happens with alarming regularity. Minx is also very technologically minded and can work wonders with any computer or synthesizer. The only character in the show that she shows any genuine affiliation towards is Techrat, due to his similar interest in computers. Her romantic interest in the show is Rio, whom she seduces, teases and flirts with despite his constant rejections, she sees him as a challenge because she can usually have any man she wants and relishes the prospect of stealing him from both Jerrica and Jem. Rio Pacheco Voiced by Michael Sheehan – Jerrica's boyfriend, who plays a Mal Evans-like role as a road manager and engineer for the Holograms. He loves Jerrica, but has a crush on Jem, which evolves into something more as the series progresses. Despite his own apparent issues with dishonesty showcased in the form of his fling with Jem despite being in a relationship with Jerrica, Rio is portrayed as having some anger management issues, and feels the need to enforce what he feels is right and wrong. This leads to occasional aggressive outbursts or even tantrums throughout the course of the show (Example, while shooting for the Jem movie, Rio punches Jem's Co-Star at the end of 'Jealousy' for kissing her as the movie's script calls for.) Rio's actions make Jerrica reluctant to reveal herself as Jem to him in fear that Rio will feel deceived by her (this is shown clearly through the song 'Deception'.) Throughout the series, the dynamic of the relationship between Rio, Jerrica, and her persona Jem change and a classic Love Triangle develops. He also had a bond with Aja growing up due to a shared interest in technology. Eric Raymond Voiced by Charlie Adler – Eric Raymond is the main villain in the series, a greedy and manipulative music executive who initially runs Starlight Music at the time of Emmett Benton's death. Shortly afterwards, his main focus is to gain back full control of the company, half of which was left to him, and the other half left to Jerrica. Eric is not a member of the Misfits but created the group in an attempt to oust Jerrica. Eric is their manager. Eric loses his half of Starlight Music to Jerrica and forms Misfits Music (financed by Harvey Gabor, Pizzazz's father) which is later renamed Stingers Sound when he signs a new band the Stingers. Handsome and extremely devious, he is a very smart and savvy (albeit dishonest) businessman and will resort to almost anything to sabotage Jem and the Holograms ranging from fraud to hiring goons. Eric also desires to know Jem's true identity. Eric also has some limited knowledge of Synergy's existence through a private detective he hired, but is largely in the dark about what her true origins are. In his final appearance, \\"The Day the Music Died\\", he and Pizzazz were so stressed out by the Starlight Girls, they had to surrender Starlight Music back to Jerrica when she returned. Additional characters * Synergy (voiced by Marlene Aragon) – An extraordinarily sophisticated holographic computer possessing a highly advanced artificial intelligence and designed to be the ultimate audio/visual entertainment synthesizer. Synergy was created by Emmett Benton, and is in many ways considered to be his life's work. Synergy can generate holographic images that are extremely lifelike and synched to accompanying sound-effects; rendering them flawlessly convincing, despite the fact that they aren't solid. As such, they often serve as Jem's secret weapon in times of distress. Synergy's images can be generated over vast distances, with Jem having utilized them even when in other countries/continents. Synergy's artificial intelligence, appearance, and voice are all based on the likeness of Emmett's late wife Jacqui. Synergy was intended to be a surrogate mentor, friend, and maternal figure to Jerrica and Kimber. She manifests herself physically as a hologram in the form of a light purple-skinned woman with dark purple hair and eyes, when she chooses to physically interact; and communicates with Jem remotely via a pair of star-shaped earrings. While she normally follows Jerrica's instructions, Synergy is fully capable of independent thought and action. * Mrs. Bailey (voiced by Hazel Shermet) – The caretaker of Starlight House. * Emmett Benton (voiced by Jack Angel) – The late father of Jerrica and Kimber Benton. He was the co-founder of Starlight House and Starlight Music with his wife Jacqui, created Synergy, and provided the initial equipment for the Holograms which they discovered after his death. * Constance \\"Clash\\" Montgomery (voiced by Cathy Cavadini) – The Misfits' groupie and biggest fan and henchwoman, she gets her nickname due to the miniature cymbals she wears around her wrists to get attention.

She also does charity work and volunteers at \\"Haven House\\", a home for troubled teens. She relates to the teens in that she was raised in a foster home shortly after her mother disappeared. In the episode, \\"Homeland, Heartland\\", Danse travels to Zagreb with the Holograms to search for her missing mother and meets her long-lost father, she also finds out that her mother's dance teacher, Victor Krosach, was obsessed with her and went to extreme measures to drive her parents apart. * Harvey Gabor (voiced by Walker Edmiston) – Pizzazz's rich father who spoils her to make up for the fact that he is usually more concerned with his business interests than with her. This may be due to the resentment he harbors for having his own wife leave him and Pizzazz behind that lead to this. Helping Kimber cope with her father's loss, Harvey finally realizes what he has done and tries to reconcile with Pizzazz, only to find that she is uninterested in doing the same for him. * Sean Harrison (voiced by Dan Gilvezan) – A British teen idol who is one of Kimber's many boyfriends. He seems to be the only one who truly has genuine affections toward Kimber, but he is a bit weak physically compared to Jeff Wright, her other boyfriend. Although he is an on-and-off boyfriend, Kimber seems to be most serious about him as far as her love life is concerned. It is hinted in the episode \\"The World Hunger Shindig\\" that Sean had a wild past with Pizzazz of the Misfits. * Joanie (voiced by Marlene Aragon) – Starlight Music's business manager and longtime friend of the Benton Family. * Anthony Julian (voiced by T. K. Carter) – One of the industry's most talented directors he and Shana quickly develop a romantic relationship and remain the most stable romance in the series. Anthony supports Shana in her pursuit becoming a fashion designer. When he is put in charge of a mini-series and the original designer is fired by star/producer Liz Stratton, Anthony brings Shana in to meet Stratton, earning her a position. Shana quits the project due to Stratton's inflated ego and rejoins the Holograms. Anthony remains at Shana's side throughout the series. * Lindsey Pierce/Lin-Z (voiced by Susan Blu) – The popular host of Lin-Z TV, a music video/news/talk show which regularly features the Holograms and Misfits videos and interviews. While Lindsey is usually impartial to the rivalry between the two groups while on the air, she is a good friend and ally to Jem. * Craig Phillips (voiced by Michael Horton) – Stormer's older brother, who resides overseas in Europe. He is a professional drummer who meets Aja while she is searching for a new drummer to replace Shana in the two part episode \\"The Talent Search\\". Eric and the Misfits learned of this when Stormer introduced him to them. They immediately tried to influence Craig into using his budding relationship with Aja to find out Jem's secret identity, only to be later threatened by Craig into paying restitution to the Alonso Family when Jetta used Eric's money to hire a group of thugs to vandalize the Alonso's plant nursery, pressure Raya into revealing Jem's secret identity and not to kick Stormer out of the Misfits when Pizzazz threatened to do so. Craig made another appearance in the episode \\"Britrock\\" when Jem and the Holograms were appearing at a benefit concert in London. At this time Aja learned that Stormer was Craig's sister. * Howard Sands (voiced by Neil Ross) – One of Hollywood's foremost producers, and a close friend of Jem. Sands sweetens the rivalry between Jem and the Holograms and the Misfits by offering a movie contract and a mansion to the winner of the contest. Even-tempered and firm on fair-play he does his best not to favor either band. However, when the Starlight House burns down and Jerrica appeals to him for a place to house her foster girls, he bends the rules enough to allow the Starlight Girls to stay in the mansion that is part of the prize. Throughout the series he involves himself in many projects with Jem and the Holograms. * Techrat (voiced by Charlie Adler) – An anti-social technical genius, he is Eric Raymond's secret weapon. Techrat invents various gadgets that could be used against Jem and the Holograms. He's noted for not wanting to be physically touched by anyone; although in later appearances, he doesn't seem to mind so much. * Vivian \\"Video\\" Montgomery (voiced by Noelle North) – A talented young filmmaker from Florida who makes and produces The Holograms' music videos. She is Clash's cousin. *Jeff Wright (voiced by Michael Horton) – A stuntman, another of Kimber's boyfriends and one of the most prominent in the series besides Sean. He is hot-headed, very athletic and carefree, and he proposes marriage to Kimber in the \\"Hollywood Jem\\" two-parter, but the wedding is called off during the ceremony when Kimber realizes it is Sean that she truly loves. He first appears in the \\"Starbright\\" arc. Kimber rejects his advances at first, but comes to like him after he saves her life from explosions on the set of the film that Jem and the Holograms starred in. * Zipper (voiced by Charlie Adler) – A henchman of Eric Raymond who performs his dirty work during the first season of the show.

She is introduced as a troublemaker, having trouble adjusting to her new life and is a bit greedy (stealing from a homemade bank from which the various Starlight Girl contribute their own money in order to help Jerrica pay for their upkeep). She eventually tries to leave the group in order to live with the Misfits, while becoming close friends with Stormer, Ashley quickly becomes disgusted with the Misfits' vendetta against Jem and returns to Starlight House, having seen the error of her ways. While she retains her feisty streak throughout the series, Ashley becomes one of the most trusted members of the household. She also dreams of being a fashion designer like Shana and a rock singer like Jem, even going as far as to start a fledgling band called Ashley and the Starlights with fellow Starlight Girls Deirdre, Becky, and Lela. * Ba Nee O'Carolan (voiced by Samantha Paris and singing voice recorded by Ari Gold): A young Vietnamese American girl who would be the focus of many episodes of the series, most notably her quest to locate her American soldier father named Martin O'Carolan, who went missing in action after he secured her then-pregnant mother, Kieu Chinh, a Vietnamese villager he met and fell in love with, safe passage to America. Kieu Chinh died under unknown circumstances (presumably complications from childbirth) before she reached America, leaving Ba Nee orphaned. Ba Nee is a major source of the plot for \\"Starbright\\", as she develops a degenerative eye condition that threatens to leave her blind, causing Jem and the Holograms to continue with the making of the movie in order to raise the funds to give Ba Nee the operation needed to save her eyesight. She becomes a major supporter of Jem's literacy campaign and ultimately convinces Roxy to learn how to read at the end of \\"Roxy Rumbles\\".

Krissie is close friends with Ba Nee and is protective of her. * Terri (voiced by Patricia Alice Albrecht) – One of the Starlight Girls, identified by her signature hat and blonde pigtails. She was heavily featured in \\"Trick or Techrat\\", which revealed that she was very superstitious and hated Halloween, due to the fact that she was easily scared. She ultimately overcomes her fear by the end of the episode, when she is forced to engage in battle with Eric Raymond and Techrat, rescuing Frederick Vincent from the basement of an abandoned opera house, and exposing their latest scheme to hurt Jem and the Holograms. * Lela (voiced by Cindy McGee) – The oldest of the Starlight Girls, and the first girl to arrive at Starlight House, after Aja and Shana.

She became a foster child herself at a very young age, having grown-up without any parents her hardships of being an orphan inspired her help to other homeless children from suffering the same fate. Just like her daughters, she was a famous pop singer but then she decided to give up singing so she that she can focus more on her family. With her husband's, she and Emmett decided to start adopting orphans to give them a home and a family.

The drugs that he has are severely debilitating to the victim, causing hallucinations and even heightening existing emotional problems. Bobby then encounters Ashley at school just after she had accidentally dropped her papers down the stairs. After hearing her complain, he gives her the same introductory spell he gives all his victims, which is overheard by a tearful Laura. Like with all his clients, Bobby offers Ashley the drugs, which she accepts. However, this is discovered to be a ruse, as Ashley's acceptance was just to get Bobby to verbally admit his crimes in front of Laura, who is wearing a wire. After giving the drugs to Ashley, he is then arrested by undercover police officers. Because of his crimes, he is possibly serving jail time.

It was a busy port with connections to the Near East that continued into historic periods; the rich finds and elaborate buildings reflect the importance of foreign trade for the Cretan economy.Shaw, Kommos. Its ancient name was probably Amyklaion (), which would reflect a link with Amyclae; Robin Lane Fox speculates that it is referred to in Odyssey 3.296: \\"a small rock holds back the great waves.\\"Robin Lane Fox, Travelling Heroes: Greeks and Their Myths in the Epic Age of Homer (London: Allen Lane, 2008, ), p. 323. That small rock is likely to have been the natural reef of Papadoplaka and a submerged sandy shore stretching to the coast would have formed a natural harbor. Amnisos - Harbour town of Minos? by Jorg Schafer, p. 4. This breakwater was partially degraded by aerial bombing during the Second World War as part of a campaign to deny safe harbours for the Nazis' enemies. Kommos was the harbour for the nearby larger ruined Minoan settlement and palace of Phaistos, which was one of the principal cultural centres of Minoan Crete.C.Michael Hogan, Phaistos Fieldnotes, The Modern Antiquarian (2007) Archaeology The site The site first attracted the attention of archaeologists in 1924, when Arthur Evans heard about large storage vessels found there and speculated about the existence of a Bronze Age \\"customs house\\"; excavations have been carried on by J.W. and Maria Shaw since 1976.Kommos Excavation Crete . The site does not conform to the traditional \\"Palatial\\" style of the Minoans. Built atop the ruins of a smaller stone age settlement, the structure the site contains a single upscale (though far from royal) dwelling attached to the site, six respectably sized dwellings on the hillside to the North and a warren of stone rooms atop the hill of a community of farmers/fishermen. Though its original use is debated, the site was abandoned several times over its lifetime. During such periods, parts of the site were used as a pottery studio with a large kiln still in evidence.Shaw, Kommos. This is a (so far) unique survival of an abandoned Minoan kiln complete with its \\"wasters\\" (malformed pots), and is developing understanding of the details of production of Minoan pottery.A LM IA Ceramic Kiln in South- Central Crete, Joseph W. Shaw et al., Hesperia Supplement 30, 2001. The \\"Palace's\\" final incarnation saw the main courtyard converted into \\"ship sheds\\" by knocking down the seaside wall and building long narrow rooms open on one end.Shaw, Kommos. A paved section of road passing through the site, roads being difficult and expensive propositions at the time, along with the conversion to ship sheds suggests the use of the site as a harbour and customs house by a larger settlement. This is further supported by the relatively large scale of the project when compared to the supply of labour from the small village adjacent. The Bronze Age use of the site corresponds roughly with the power fluctuations of the important nearby Palace of Phaistos, though it may merely represent the fluctuations in the population of the Mesara Plain as a whole.

The high school has about 950 students in grades 9-12. Students originate from the Evergreen Park Elementary School District 124. History The school's first superintendent, Marshall G. Batho, announced the opening of Evergreen Park Community High School (EPCHS) on September 6, 1955. The school's overall construction consisted of three phases that expanded through 1953–1963, with the completions of each phase in 1955, 1957, and 1963. After opening its doors in 1955, the school quickly reached capacity as the small suburb experienced a major unexpected population boom during the decade. In a span for only two years, and during the initial planning and construction phase, the population spiked 3,985 people (between 1954–1956). In 1950, according to the census, the town's population was listed as 10,400, but by the spring of 1956, Evergreen Park's population ballooned to nearly 20,000 residents.> On May 5, 1963 at the cost of $1,285,000, the board of education of district 231 announced an open house for the new 2-story wing addition to the original buildings. The wrap-around architectural design, created by Perkins and Willis, preserved the athletic fields to the east of the school, saved available parking, eliminated noise from Kedzie Ave, shielded the classrooms from the afternoon sun, and created a hexagon cafeteria positioned in the center of the building with a court yard view. Upon completion, the project unified the building and doubled the size of the school by expanding the lay out to 193,830 square feet of usable space with a capacity to serve 1,400 students. In 1965, Evergreen Park voters approved a $495,000 bond issue to build a year-round swimming pool addition to be built on the southeast corner of the high school. However, the construction was contingent on a proposed 21-cent tax hike that was initially defeated. The pool was eventually built and opened in 1969. On April 6, 1962, the school hosted a talk on genetics by Nobel Laureate and President of the University of Chicago, George W. Beadle.

Colquitt. Colquitt was well known in Atlanta near the end of the 19th century for his representation of the Georgia Railway and Electric Company, which would later become the Georgia Power Company. In 1930, Colquitt formed a partnership with two brothers, Henry and Robert Troutman, both lawyers with clients such as Gulf Refining Company, the Georgia Real Estate Commission and the National Surety Company. Additionally, Colquitt had two other attorneys, Robert S. Parker and Preston Stanley Arkwright Jr., join the firm creating Colquitt, Parker, Troutman and Arkwright. For the next 30 years, the firm grew in size, reputation, and client base, and went through a few name changes as partnerships were formed and broken. By the late 1960s, the firm was known as Troutman Sams Schroder & Lockerman. In 1971, then-president of Georgia Power, Ed Hatch, suggested the merger of Troutman Sams Schroder & Lockerman with former Governor Carl Sanders' firm, Sanders Ashmore & Boozer. Hatch believed the merger would keep intact the decades of utility expertise of the Troutman firm, while merging the fresh talent and energy of Sanders’ young firm. The new firm would operate as Troutman Sanders Lockerman & Ashmore, until shortened to Troutman Sanders in 1992 when the firm moved from downtown Atlanta's Candler Building to Midtown Atlanta's new 55-story Bank of America Plaza. From 1993-2015, Robert W. Webb Jr. served as managing partner, while the firm experienced growth in the United States and internationally. In 2001, Troutman Sanders merged with Mays & Valentine LLP, which added 150 attorneys to the firm and offices in Richmond, Tysons Corner, and Virginia Beach, Virginia. This spurred further growth and the subsequent opening of offices in Raleigh, NC (2003) and New York City with the acquisition of the New York office of Jenkens & Gilchrist Parker Chapin LLP in 2005. In 2006, Carl Sanders retired and Webb became the firm's Chairman and Managing Partner. In 2009, the firm merged with D.C.-based Ross Dixon & Bell. Troutman Sanders' size grew to 15 offices after the merger, adding Chicago, Orange County, San Diego, and doubling its D.C. presence. This brought the total number of attorneys to over 650. In 2011, Stephen E. Lewis became the managing partner. In 2015, Webb retired and Lewis became Chairman as well.Maestro: The Life and Times of a Law Firm (Troutman, Sanders, Lockerman and Ashmore) by Doris Lockerman (The Harrison Company, 1982)The History of Troutman Sanders by Lea Agnew (2007)Hoover's Profile http://www.answers.com/topic/troutman-sanders- llp?cat=biz-fin The firm continued to expand, with offices opened in 2014 in Charlotte and in 2015 in San Francisco.

His views in relation to the Lambeth Articles cost him his position as Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. He was a forerunner of views, to be called Arminian or Laudian, more common a generation later in England. Life He was son of Stephen Baro and Philippa Petit, his wife, and was born December 1534 at Étampes. Destined for the study of civil law, he entered the University of Bourges, where he took his degree as bachelor in the faculty of civil law 9 April 1556. In the following year he was admitted and sworn an advocate in the court of the Parliament of Paris. In December 1560 he moved to Geneva, and was admitted to the ministry by Calvin. Returning to France he married, at Gien. Guillemette, the daughter of Stephen Bourgoin, and Lopsa Dozival, his wife. He emigrated to England, where he was befriended by Lord Burghley, who as chancellor of the university of Cambridge, exercised his influence on Baro's behalf. He was admitted a member of Trinity College where John Whitgift was then master. The Provost of King's College, Roger Goad, engaged him to read lectures in divinity and Hebrew. In 1574, through the influence mainly of Burghley and Andrew Perne, he was chosen Lady Margaret professor of divinity. In 1576 he was created D.D., and was incorporated in the same degree at Oxford on 11 July. A series of complaints against him in 1581 show that he was already inclining to anti-Calvinism, and was prepared to advocate tolerance even of Catholicism. Between Laurence Chaderton there arose a controversy; and by Chaderton's biographer William Dillingham, Baro is accused of having imported new doctrines into England. Whitgift warned Baro not to attack the Lambeth Articles (possibly too late); but Baro did that on 12 January 1596 in Great St. Mary's. Baro was cited before the vice-chancellor and heads, required to produce the manuscript of his sermon, and forbidden further discussion of the doctrine involved in the Lambeth Articles. Burghley supported Baro, as did John Overall, Lancelot Andrewes, and Samuel Harsnett; but Baro was not renewed in his chair in November. He went to London, and John Jegon failed to have him return to teach Hebrew; Baro made it clear in writing to Niels Hemmingsen in April 1596 that he felt he had little leeway in expressing his own theological views. He died in April 1599, and Richard Bancroft, bishop of London, gave him an imposing funeral. Works Baro's principal published writings were: *'Praelectiones' on the Prophet Jonas, edited by Osmund Lake, of King's College, London, 1579; this volume also contains 'Conciones ad Clerum' and 'Theses' maintained in the public schools. *'De Fide ejusque Ortu et Natura plana ac dilucida Explicatio,' also edited by Osmund Lake, and by him dedicated to Sir Francis Walsingham, London, 1580. *'De Praestantia et Dignitate Divinae Legis libri duo,' London, n. d. * 'A speciall Treatise of God's Prouidence,' &c.;, together with certain sermons ad clerum and 'Quaestiones' disputed in the schools; Englished by I.

Western medical missionaries established the first modern clinics and hospitals, provided the first training for nurses, and opened the first medical schools in China.Choa, \\"Heal the Sick\\". Work was also done in opposition to the abuse of opium. Medical treatment and care came to many Chinese who were addicted, and eventually public and official opinion was influenced in favor of bringing an end to the destructive trade.Lodwick, Crusaders Against Opium. By 1901, China was the most popular destination for medical missionaries. The 150 foreign physicians operated 128 hospitals and 245 dispensaries, treating 1.7 million patients. In 1894, male medical missionaries comprised 14 percent of all missionaries; women doctors were four percent. Modern medical education in China started in the early 20th century at hospitals run by international missionaries. Henry Otis Dwight et al. eds., The Encyclopedia of Missions (2nd ed. 1904) p 446 Online Background Traditional medicine in China has an ancient history. Daoists developed breathing exercises, and some vegetable and mineral remedies, but their efforts were made in hopes of gaining immortality rather than for providing therapy. Buddhism brought new ideas on the cause of disease to China, emphasizing the part played by the mind. Buddha himself is reported to have said to Chi Po \\"You go and heal his body first, I will come later to treat his mental suffering.\\" An early Yuan Dynasty portrait of Su Shi, by Zhao Mengfu 趙孟頫. The first hospital in China was reportedly founded by the poet Su Shi in Hangzhou during the Song Dynasty about the same time that St Bartholomew's Hospital and St Thomas' Hospitals were founded in London. Su Shi's hospital employed Buddhist monks. Records from Mongolia mention a man named Aisie (Isaiah) who was a linguist, astrologer, and a chief physician to Kublai Khan under the Yuan Dynasty. He opened a Hospital in Peking in 1271. Aisie may have been of either French or Jewish ethnicity. A record of 1273 describes him as a Muslim, but an earlier record as a Christian.Parker (1905), p.181. There is no evidence that the Nestorian Christian mission of 635 A.D. or its later mission under the Yuan Dynasty, or the Franciscan Mission of 1294 under John of Montecorvino, engaged in any medical missionary work. In 1569 the Roman Catholics founded the \\"Santa Casa de Misericordia\\" in Macau. In 1667 the Hospital de St. Raphael was founded there as well. The latter is still under the auspices of the Santa Casa, as is also the Lara Reis Cancer Clinic, Praia Grande, Macau. Jesuit Missions took part in medical work in the 17th and 18th centuries. Xu Guangqi, a Chinese minister, was converted by Matteo Ricci, and baptized with the name of Paul. Jesuit missionaries used a pound of cinchona bark obtained from India to successfully treat the Kangxi Emperor and members of the court for malaria. Brother Bernard Rhodes arrived in China in 1699 and operated a dispensary from his house. The Court officials remarked about him: \\"He talks little, promises little and performs much ... his charity extends to everybody, to poor as well as rich. The only thing that discomforts us is that we cannot induce him to accept the least reward\\". Protestant medical missions The first western medical effort in China was the foundation of a public dispensary for Chinese at Macau in 1820 by the Rev Robert Morrison and Dr. John Livingstone, who was a surgeon to the East India Company. Although Morrison was not a medical practitioner, he had studied briefly at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. One of the objects of Morrison's dispensary was to discover whether the Chinese Pharmacopoeia \\"might not supply something in addition to the means now possessed of lessening human suffering in the West.\\" Morrison stealthily purchased a collection of over 800 volumes of Chinese medical books, along with a collection of Chinese medicines. A Chinese physician, Dr. Lee, directed the dispensing of medicines, with a herbalist in attendance to explain the properties of articles supplied by him. Peter Parker A significant moment occurred in 1828, when Dr. Thomas Richardson Colledge, a Christian surgeon of the East India Company, opened a hospital in Canton (the Canton Hospital). Colledge believed that Christians had a duty to help the sick in China, but he was never able to devote his time fully to medical missionary work. He corresponded with the existing Protestant mission societies, and in 1834 Dr. Peter Parker, the first full-time Protestant medical missionary, who Colledge mentored, was able to open a hospital at Canton in connection with the mission of the American Board. Parker quickly realized the need for trained Chinese help, and trained his first medical student Kwan Ato in 1836. Parker introduced both ether and chloroform anesthesia to China. His medical school is most remembered because of Dr. Sun Yat Sen, who studied there in 1886 for one year before returning to resume his studies in Hong Kong. In 1835-36 Parker and Colledge and a few Christian foreign residents formed the Medical Missionary Society of China. In a little time the news of Parker's mission spread. Public preaching was not permitted in China, and foreigners were restricted to residence at the Thirteen Factories at Canton. But the new hospital appealed to the Chinese in spite of their suspicions. In a Chinese village, married women would sit all night in the streets in order to get a chance in the line of patients crowding upon the doctor the next morning. When the First Opium War closed Parker's hospital in 1840, 9,000 severe cases had been relieved besides uncounted minor ones.Ch 6, \\"Opium and the Approach of War,\\" Gulick, Peter Parker. In 1839 there were only two missionary physicians in China; by 1842 more reinforcements had arrived. 50 years later there were 61 hospitals and 44 dispensaries, 100 male and twenty-six female physicians, with a corps of trained native assistants connected to the missionary endeavor. Before the spread of Western methods in China, the Chinese generally had had little knowledge of surgery, but demand for surgical treatment soon far exceeded the capacity of the mission hospitals. In the annual reports of the hospitals in 1895 it was reported that annually no fewer than 500,000 individuals were treated and about 70,000 operations performed, of which about 8,000 were for serious conditions. At first the Chinese had to learn to have confidence in the surgeons, and submit calmly to the severest operations. A patient's relatives were consulted, and usually there were no resentments expressed if a dangerous operation failed.Estes (1895), p.143 The motives that brought physicians to China to work in mission hospitals were often a puzzle to the Chinese in the beginning. According to an 1895 dissertation by Charles Estes Sumner, the patients, who were being treated with gentleness and skill that seemed almost miraculous to them, often felt that the religion that had inspired such work must be good. He explained that a few showed no gratitude, thinking that they have rendered a service in allowing a foreigner to treat them, and that many had no desire to accept the religion of their doctors, though some did. It was his belief that many patients converted to Christianity after they returned to their distant homes. This account paints an Orientalist picture of the Chinese and their ingratitude to an assumed noble Christianity, which is indicative of early Western paternalism in regards to the treatment of Asians. Western medical literature in the Chinese language was first provided by the medical missionaries, and native physicians were trained in Western methods for the first time by them as well. Western medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the London Missionary Society (Britain), the Wesleyan Methodist Ministry (Britain), Methodist Church (Britain)Methodism and the Presbyterian Church (USA).Presbyterian Church in the United States Benjamin Hobson (1816–1873), a medical missionary sent by the London Missionary Society in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) in Guangzhou, China. The Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the London Missionary Society, with its first graduate (in 1892) being Sun Yat-sen (孫中山). A contemporary of Sun Yat-sen was Dr Harry Chung (b. 1872) who had returned from Johns Hopkins University to serve the Manchu Dynasty. Sun later led the Chinese Revolution (1911), which changed China from an empire to a republic. The Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, which started in 1911. Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western Medicine. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors of Western Medicine in China. The Women's Foreign Missionary Society hoped alleviate the suffering of Chinese women by sending Dr. Lucinda L. Combs the first female missionary to Peking (Beijing) China in 1873. Dr. Combs also established the first hospital for women and children in 1875. The first Women's Hospital in Shanghai, Margaret Williamson Hospital, was opened in 1884 by Elizabeth Reifsnyder. Subsequently, female medical missionary Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854–1927) was sent by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (USA) to found the first medical college for women in China. Known as the Hackett Medical College for Women (夏葛女子醫學院), this College was located in Guangzhou, China, and was enabled by a large donation from Mr. Edward A.K. Hackett (1851–1916) of Indiana, USA. The College was dedicated in 1902 and offered a four-year curriculum. By 1915, there were more than 60 students, mostly in residence. Most students became Christians, due to the influence of Dr. Fulton. The College was officially recognized, with its diplomas marked with the official stamp of the Guangdong provincial government. The College was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status. The David Gregg Hospital for Women and Children (also known as Yuji Hospital 柔濟醫院 was affiliated with this College. The graduates of this College included Lee Sun Chau (周理信, 1890–1979) and WONG Yuen-hing (黃婉卿), both of whom graduated in the late 1910sRebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, \\"Piloted to Serve\\", 2012Deborah Chung and then practiced medicine in the hospitals in Guangdong province. There were peculiar dangers even in this humanitarian work. In times of trouble, stories were circulated that the foreign doctors plucked out human eyes to make charms. The Yangzhou riot of 1868 was caused by this kind of misunderstanding.Taylor (2005), page needed When the Bubonic plague broke out in Canton and Hong Kong in summer 1894, a rumor was started that foreign doctors were killing the people by scattering scent-bags, one whiff of which would cause death, and at one point a general uprising was being planned to kill the foreigners. Most of the early mission hospitals began with often only one medical missionary, and no other trained staff. One of the first mission hospitals was the \\"Chinese Hospital\\" operated by the London Missionary Society in Shanghai, founded by Dr. William Lockhart in 1844 (who had opened his first Chinese missionary hospital in Dinghai in 1840, while the island of Zhoushan was occupied by British troops).Chusan: the opium wars, and the forgotten story of Britain's first Chinese island, D'Arcy-Brown, L (2012) It was later known as the \\"Shantung Road Hospital\\" and the \\"Lester Chinese Hospital\\". The Taiping Rebellion interrupted the progress of medical missions until 1865, when mission hospitals and medical schools began to be established and organized more permanently. The Tung Wah Hospital was established at Hong Kong, and the medical services of the Chinese Maritime Customs with their valuable medical reports began during this period. The Customs Medical Service's doctors did not normally treat native patients. Fuzhounese Hü King Eng on graduation from the Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia in 1894. Sir Patrick Menson was on the staff of the \\"Amoy Missionary Hospital\\". He discovered Paragonimiasis during his service there. In 1866 the Revs. Hong Neok Woo and E. H. Thompson, D.D., of the American Episcopal Church Mission, founded the early St. Luke's Hospital. In 1871 Dr. James Gait of the Church Missionary Society arrived in Hangzhou to found a hospital, later known as the Kwang-Chi Hospital, which was greatly developed under the later Dr. David Durean Main, and before World War II, with its associated leprosarium and tuberculosis sanatorium, had a total of 459 beds. In 1875, Sigourney Trask received funding from the Methodist Episcopal Church mission to build a woman's hospital in Fuzhou, which had 1,208 registered patients by the end of its first year. Trask taught a local Fuzhounese student Hü King Eng, who she later arranged for to study medicine in the US. Hü then returned to practise in Fuzhou in 1895 and trained local Chinese women in western medicine. In 1880 the London Missionary Society constructed the Tientsin Mission Hospital and Dispensary, under the direction of Dr. John Kenneth Mackenzie. Dr. Fred C. Roberts brought succeeded Mackenzie and brought the hospital to regional prominence. Hudson Taylor at age 21. Another notable medical missionary to China during this period was Hudson Taylor MRCS, founder of the China Inland Mission, who was trained at the Royal London Hospital. Although initially the CIM had few trained physicians, it later brought in numbers of highly trained missionaries such as R. Harold A. Schofield and A. J. Broomhall.Taylor, (2005). In north Eastern China (Manchuria) a hospital (now known, again, as the Sheng Jing Hospital was founded in 1883 by Dugald Christie. Christie later founded the adjacent and closely connected Mukden Medical College in 1912. Taiwan Medical mission work in Taiwan was begun by the Dr. James Laidlaw Maxwell in 1865. Maxwell was the father of two notable medical missionaries to China, Profs. James Preston Maxwell and James Laidlaw Maxwell, Junior. Preston worked as professor of gynecology at the Peking Union Medical College, and James Junior worked in the former China Medical Association and as Far East Secretary of the Mission to Lepers. James Junior finally returned to China early in 1949 to serve as a leprosy specialist at Hangzhou, as well as acting as professor of medicine in the Zhejiang Medical College. He died there in 1951, and had earned the respect of the Government of the People's Republic, which was represented at his funeral. The \\"Maxwell Memorial Centre\\" at Hay Ling Chau, Hong Kong, is named after him. 20th century Of the 500 hospitals in China in 1931, 235 were run by Protestant missions and 10 by Catholic missions. The mission hospitals accounted for 61 percent of Western trained doctors, 32 percent of nurses and 50 percent of medical schools. Already by 1923 China had half of the world's missionary hospital beds and half the world's missionary doctors. By 1937 there were 254 mission hospitals in China, but more than half of these were eventually destroyed by Japanese bombing during World War II or otherwise due to the Second Sino-Japanese War or the Chinese Civil War. After World War II most of these hospitals were at least partially rehabilitated, and eventually passed to the control of the Government of the People's Republic of China, but are still functioning as hospitals.

Listed in the Domesday Book as Ramshorn, this ancient hamlet is a typical example of the depopulation of the countryside. Very little now remains of this village apart from a few farms and cottages. The Primitive Methodist Chapel is the only surviving public building. Ramsor, spelling the name as it was pronounced, is the usual spelling in Primitive Methodist documents while Ramshorn is still the official spelling. The variant spellings will be used here to distinguish these. Because of the importance of Ramsor in Primitive Methodism, this article a) Sets out some background information on Ramshorn, and b) Illustrates the place of Ramsor in Primitive Methodist history. Ramsor =Ramshorn= Signpost to Ramshorn from a junction near Cotton on the route to Alton Towers Ramshorn is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and this gives the official standard spelling used in maps, road signs, censuses, etc. Only a few farms and houses are left, but the fact of being in the Domesday Book means that Ramshorn is shown on maps when larger places are not. Ramshorn is in the Parish of Ellastone, about 3 miles west of Ellastone village, about 2 miles north of the more famous landmark, Alton Towers, and south of the Weaver Hills. It lies in the border between the gentler lower valley of the River Dove, Derbyshire-Stafffordshire border, and the more rugged Staffordshire Moorlands. A substantial area of the village is now within the J C Bamford estate. This includes the site of the school, which is now completely demolished. The falling population of Ramshorn illustrates well the general move from the countryside to towns and cities. A factor in the urbanisation of Britain was increasing demand for manpower in mills and factories, coupled with changes in agriculture requiring reduced manpower. Some once thriving villages like Ramshorn are reduced to almost nothing. This decline in rural population may be traced from census records. =Ramsor in Primitive Methodist history= Though often backstage to the Potteries (Stoke on Trent), Ramsor and its people played a major part in the origins of Primitive Methodism. This includes * First Ramsor Camp Meetings held in 1808 * William Clowes expelled from the Wesleyan Methodists after attending a Camp Meeting at Ramsor. * Hugh Bourne's first funeral sermon for a Ramsor young woman in 1810. * The first Primitive Methodist Class Ticket paid for by a Ramsor farmer in 1811. * Ramsor became a \\"Head of Circuit\\" in 1822 having been a \\"Head of Section\\" in the Tunstall Primitive Methodist Circuit. The Cheadle and Leek (in 1838) Primitive Methodist Circuits were largely carved out of the Ramsor Circuit. (Some members of the Ramsor Primitive Methodist Society lived in surrounding hamlets, such as Wooton, but are for convenience included in this article as Ramsor people.) In later years, however, the Ramsor Circuit required financial support from the District Home Missions Fund.The Tunstall District Home Missions Committee Minutes Book, To a large extent, this was a result of the depopulation of the countryside. Even so, the influence of Ramsor people in Primitive Methodism is remarkable for so small a place. Following the Methodist Union of 1932, the name of Ramsor was included in the Methodist Circuit name, The Ramsor And Uttoxeter Circuit until the 1970s when the Circuit name was changed to The Dove Valley Circuit. Ramsor Primitive Methodist Chapel Ramsor Jubilee Chapel after restorationRamsor Jubilee Chapel from the main entrance, showing the pulpit The Primitive Methodist Chapel is the main if not the only building other than farms and dwellings to survive from the 19th century. It is now in private ownership, and has been lovingly restored as a place of worship where services are occasionally held. This writer was present for services on 3 December 2006 and 31 May 2007. The second occasion was the conclusion of a walk from Mow Cop to Ramsor on the bicentenary of the first Primitive Methodist Camp Meeting. The present pulpit is not the original, but one rescued from a similar chapel at Gun End, near The Roaches to the north of Leek, Staffordshire. This looks as if it had been purpose built for Ramsor Chapel. The lighter panels are wood carvings. The present Chapel is the Jubilee Chapel, built to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887. It stands across the road from Chapel Farm, in the grounds of which stood the first Chapel . Hugh Bourne Ramsor is frequently mentioned in Hugh Bourne's writings, and it is obvious from these that he frequently visited the village. His first visit was in May 1808Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall, \\"The Origin and History of the Primitive Methodist Church\\", (1906 for the 1907 Camp Meeting Centenary), p. 93 (EAN-13 format) He uses examples of Ramsor people quite frequently in his articles in the Primitive Methodist Magazine to illustrate both doctrine and general Christian life. For example, he gives an example from Ramsor of the healing of Elizabeth Wain from 6 years using crutches amongst several examples of miraculous healing.Hugh Bourne, \\"Anecdotes of Healing\\", in the \\"Primitive Methodist Magazine\\" December 1824, Ramsor was the place of Hugh Bourne's first funeral sermon. This is described in his article \\"Anecdote of a Present SalvationHugh Bourne, \\"The Primitive Methodist Magazine\\", November 1824 in which he writes of the teaching of John Wesley on this subject. As an example, he relates the experience of Elizabeth Warrington, whose conversion in March 1810 was due to her meeting with Bourne. She died in November 1810, having shown very clear evidence of her faith in spite of a long illness. In the summer of 1810, Bourne had been persuaded to doubt the reality of \\"present salvation\\", but was persuaded by Elizabeth's life that what Wesley had taught was true. William Clowes Following his conversion in January 1805, William Clowes's preaching was testimony and \\"exhortation\\". The Ramsor Camp Meeting of 9 October 1808 was the first time he \\"preached from a text\\".Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall, op. cit. p.38Joseph Ritson, \\"The Romance of Primitive Methodism\\", (1909), p.62 When in September 1810 he was put out of membership of the Burslem Wesleyan Circuit for \\"attending Camp Meetings\\", it followed his attendance on an impulse of the June 1810 Ramsor Camp Meeting. Ironically, Clowes attended only 5 of the 17 Camp Meetings from the first at Mow Cop on 31 May 1807 to the establishment of Primitive Methodism in 1811.Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall, \\"The Origin and History of the Primitive Methodist Church\\", (1906 for the 1907 Camp Meeting Centenary), p. 89 Richard Jukes Richard Jukes was one of the most popular of all the Primitive Methodist Travelling Preachers, and a prolific hymn writer. At a time when most Travelling Preachers stayed only one or two years in any one place, Jukes spent 4 years at Ramsor, summer 1834 to 1838.Rev. William Leary, \\"Directory of Primitive Methodist Ministers and their Circuits\\", (1990), entry for Richard Jukes, Perhaps his best known hymn is “My Heart is fixed Eternal God” Camp meetings and other events Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall says that there were five Ramsor Camp Meetings up to 1811, these being on 4 September and 9 October 1808, 21 May 1809, 3 June 1810, and 26 May 1811.Kendal, op. cit. Ch. III. (The first two dated as 1809 is obviously a misprint, at odds with all other sources, including Kendall's other works, and the date of the 3rd Camp Meeting) In 1808 Francis Horrobin guided Hugh Bourne to villages which were \\"spiritually destitute\\".Kendal, op.cit. p. 93 Later, Horrobin paid for the printing of the first primitive Methodist Class Tickets, issued 30 May 1811. Places named on the Preaching Plans of the Ramsor Circuit include Mixon and Ecton. These are example of the \\"industrial mission\\" activities of the Primitive Methodists. Both were mines, Mixon being south east of Leek, and Ecton being in the Manifold Valley. As well as a famous copper mine, Ecton also had a creamery and cheese factory, and a lead mine, and was an important station on the Leek and Manifold Light Railway. Postcards from around 1900 – 1910 show the Chapel.Lindsey Porter, \\"Leek and Manifold Light Railway\\", (2000), Landmark Publications / Ashbourne Editions, pp. 72–77, At this time this was a Primitive Methodist chapel, but during the 19th century both the Primitive and the Wesleyan Methodists (from nearby Wetton) had regular preaching there. Hugh Bourne's first evangelism had been amongst coal miners around Harriseahead, and this interest in working people was characteristic of the Primitive Methodists.

It is mainly used to make vinylpyridine and the agrichemical nitrapyrin.Eric F. V. Scriven, Ramiah Murugan. 'Pyridine and Pyridine Derivatives', Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, (2005). Synthesis 2-Picoline was the first pyridine compound reported to be isolated in pure form. It was isolated from coal tar in 1846 by T. Anderson. This chemistry was practiced by Reilly Industries in Indianapolis. It is now mainly produced by two principal routes, the condensation of acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and ammonia and the cyclization of nitriles and acetylene. One example of such reaction is the combination of acetaldehyde and ammonia: :450px Approximately 8000 t/a was produced worldwide in 1989. Reactions Most of the reactions of picoline are centered on the methyl group. For example, the principal use of 2-picoline is as a precursor of 2-vinylpyridine. The conversion is achieved by condensation with formaldehyde: :420px The copolymer of 2-vinylpyridine, butadiene and styrene is used as an adhesive for textile tire cord. 2-Picoline is also a precursor to the agrichemical, nitrapyrin, which prevents loss of ammonia from fertilizers. Oxidation by potassium permanganate affords picolinic acid: :350px Deprotonation with butyllithium affords C5H4NCH2Li, a versatile nucleophile. =Biodegradation= Like other pyridine derivatives, 2-methylpyridine is often reported as an environmental contaminant associated with facilities processing oil shale or coal, and has also been found at legacy wood treatment sites. The compound is readily degradable by certain microorganisms, such as Arthrobacter sp. strain R1 (ATTC strain number 49987), which was isolated from an aquifer contaminated with a complex mixture of pyridine derivatives.O'Loughlin, E. J., G.K. Sims, and S.J. Traina. 1999. Biodegradation of 2-methyl, 2-ethyl, and 2-hydroxypyridine by an Arthrobacter sp. isolated from subsurface sediment. Biodegradation 10:93-104. Arthrobacter and closely related Actinobacteria are often found associated with degradation of pyridine derivatives and other nitrogen heterocyclic compounds. 2-methypyridine and 4-methypyridine are more readily degraded and exhibit less volatilization loss from environmental samples than does 3-methypyridine. Uses 2-Methylpyridine is an intermediate used in the production of some pharmaceutical drugs including amprolium, picoplatin, dimethindene, and encainide.

In 2006 approximately 80% of Chad's labor force was employed in the agricultural sector.CIA World Factbook: Chad. [accessed 08/07/2014]. This sector of the economy accounted for almost half of the GDP. With the exception of cotton production, some small-scale sugar cane production, and a portion of the peanut crop, Chad's agriculture consisted of subsistence food production. The types of crops that were grown and the locations of herds were determined by considerable variations in Chad's climate. Overview =Sudanian zone= The sudanian zone comprises those areas with an average annual rainfall of 800 millimeters or more. This region, which accounts for about 10% of the total land area, contains the nation's most fertile croplands. Settled agricultural communities growing a wide variety of food crops are its main features. Fishing is important in the rivers, and families raise goats, chickens, and, in some cases, oxen for plowing. In 1983 about 72% of all land under cultivation in Chad was in the sudanian zone. Crop rotation Crop rotation in the soudanian zone traditionally begins with sorghum or millet in the first year. Mixed crops of sorghum and-or millet, with peanuts, legumes, or tubers, are then cultivated for approximately three years. Farmers then return the land to fallow for periods up to fifteen years, turning to different fields for the next cycle. Preparation of a field begins with cutting heavy bush and unwanted low trees or branches that are then laid on the ground. Collectively owned lands are parceled out during the dry season, and the fields are burned just before the onset of the first rains, usually around March. Farmers work most intensively during the rains between May and October, planting, weeding and protecting the crops from birds and animals. Harvesting begins in September and October with the early varieties of sorghum. The main harvest occurs in November and December. Farmers harvest crops of rice and berebere, the hardiest of Chad's varieties of millet, grown along receding water courses, as late as February. =Central zone= The central zone, or the sahelian zone, comprises the area with average annual rainfall of between 350 and 800 millimeters. The minimum rainfall needed for berebere, is 350 millimeters. The western area of the zone is dominated by the Chari and Logone rivers, which flow north from their sources in southern Chad and neighboring countries (see fig. 3). The courses of these rivers, joining at N'Djamena to flow on to Lake Chad, create an ecological subregion. Fishing is important for the peoples along the rivers and along the shores of Lake Chad. Flood recession cropping is practiced along the edges of the riverbeds and lakeshore, areas that have held the most promise for irrigation in the zone. International donor attention focused on this potential beginning in the mid-1960s. Particular attention has been paid to the traditional construction of polders (see Glossary) along the shores of Lake Chad. Land reclaimed by the use of such methods is extremely fertile. Chad's only wheat crop is cultivated in these polders. In the rest of the sahelian zone, the hardier varieties of millet, along with peanuts and dry beans, are grown. Crop yields are far lower than they are in the south or near rivers and lakes. Farmers take every advantage of seasonal flooding to grow recession crops before the waters dry away, a practice particularly popular around Lake Fitri. The sahelian zone is ideal for pasturage. Herding includes large cattle herds for commercial sale, and goats, sheep, donkeys, and some horses are common in all villages. Crop rotation The cropping cycle for most of the sahelian zone is similar to that in the soudanian zone, although the variety of crops planted is more limited because of dryness. In the polders of Lake Chad, farmers grow a wide range of crops; two harvests per year for corn, sorghum, and legumes are possible from February or March to September. Rice ripens in February, and wheat ripens in May. =Saharan zone= The saharan zone encompasses roughly the northern half of Chad. Except for some dates and legumes grown in the scattered oases, the area is not productive. Annual rainfall averages less than 350 millimeters (13.8\\"), and the land is sparsely populated by nomadic tribes. Many of Chad's camel herds are found in the region, but there are few cattle or horses. =Subsistence farming= Chad's subsistence farmers practice traditional slash-and-burn agriculture in tandem with crop rotation, which is typical throughout much of Africa. Sorghum is the most important food crop, followed by berebere. Less prevalent grains are corn, rice, and wheat. Other secondary crops include peanuts, sesame, legumes, and tubers, as well as a variety of garden vegetables. =Land tenure= As with most Third World countries, control of the land determines agricultural practices. There are three basic types of land tenure in Chad. Collective ownership The first is collective ownership by villages of croplands in their environs. In principle, such lands belong to a village collectively under the management of the village chief or the traditional chef des terres (chief of the lands). Individual farmers hold inalienable and transmittable use rights to village lands, so long as they, their heirs, or recognized representatives cultivate the land. Outsiders can farm village lands only with the authorization of the village chiefs or chef des terres. Renting village farmlands is possible in some local areas but is not traditional practice. Private ownership Private ownership is the second type of tenure, applied traditionally to the small plots cultivated in wadis or oases. Wells belong to individuals or groups with rights to the land. Ownership of fruit trees and date palms in the oases is often separate from ownership of the land; those farmers who plant and care for trees own them. State ownership State ownership is the third type, primarily for large enterprises such as irrigation projects. Under the management of parastatal or government employees, farmers enter into contractual arrangements, including paying fees, for the use of state lands and the benefits of improved farming methods. =Agricultural statistics= Detailed and reliable statistical information on Chad's agriculture was scarce in the late 1980s; most researchers viewed available statistics only as indicators of general trends. The one region for which figures were kept was the soudanian zone through survey coverage by officials of the National Office of Rural Development (Chad) (Office National de Dévelopment Rural)(ONDR), who monitored cotton production. These officials also gathered information on food production, but this effort was not carried out systematically. Survey coverage of the sahelian zone was first hampered, then prevented, by civil conflict from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Moreover, figures from international and regional organizations often conflicted or differed in formulation. For example, total area devoted to food production was difficult to estimate because sources combined the area of fields in production with those lying fallow to give a total for arable lands. The arable land figure has shown a gradual increase since 1961. Estimated then at 29,000 square kilometres (11,325 sq. mls), it rose to almost 32,000 square kilometres (12,500 sq. mls.) in 1984. In 1983 there were about 12,000 square kilometres (4,686 sq. mls.) in food production and in 1984 slightly more than 9,000 square kilometres (3,515 sq. mls). Therefore, perhaps a third of Chad's farmlands were in production in a given year, with the balance lying fallow. Cotton Cotton is an indigenous crop to southern Chad. Most of the production occurs in the five soudanian prefectures of Mayo-Kebbi, Tandjilé, Logone Occidental, Logone Oriental, and Moyen-Chari, plus the Bousso region of Chari-Baguirmi Prefecture. Few other areas have enough water and population to sustain its production. Commonly, the cotton cultivation has occurred next to food crops. Subsistence farming Since the 1950s, Chad's food production has declined. Even so, despite pockets of malnutrition remaining in areas where rains failed or locusts damaged local crops, the overall picture for Chad's food production was good in the 1985-87 period. The rebound of food production in this period was the result of good rains, the return of political stability, and the absence of major conflict in the sahelian and soudanian zones. The downturn in cotton production and added restrictions on its cultivation also released lands and labor for farmers to put into food production. Production was so high in these years that, for the first time in a decade, it was estimated that Chad had returned to food sufficiency. This followed a cereal shortfall in the drought years of 1984 and 1985 of around 325,000 tons. Total cereal production rose thereafter to the 700,000-ton level, well above the estimated 615,000 tons of grains needed for food sufficiency. Yet the overall food sufficiency registered by Chad in these years served to underscore the problem of regional imbalances in cereal production. The sahelian zone experienced a chronic shortfall in cereal production, whereas the soudanian zone traditionally had a cereal surplus. The soudanian zone was also the biggest producer of all subsistence food crops and of cash crops. It was estimated that the soudanian zone produced between 53 and 77% of Chad's total cereal production from 1976 to 1985, with the average falling in the 60- to 70-% range. But because the populations of the two regions were approximately equal, the lack of a good transport system and marketing mechanisms to allow the rapid transfer of the southern surplus to the northern zones was a constant problem. This danger was especially threatening during times of drought affecting the sahelian zone. =Sorghum and millet= Chad's most important subsistence crops were sorghum, millet, and berebere. Areas under production for these grains showed a downward trend after the mid-1950s, dropping from an average of 15,000 square kilometres to around 10,000 square kilometres in the 1960s and 1970s and falling to levels averaging 7,500 square kilometres between 1981 and 1986. Taking an average for all lands devoted to grain production during the years from 1981 to 1985, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sorghum and millet cultivation accounted for 85% of the total area. Between 1980 and 1985, these coarse grains accounted for 80 to 95% of all grain production. =Wheat= In 1987 wheat was Chad's least important cereal grain. Farmers planted the crop in polders around the shores of Lake Chad, and some small planting also was done in the oases and wadis of northern Chad. Replacing an earlier state operation, the Organization for the Development of the Lake (Société pour le Développement du Lac—SODELAC) was founded in 1967 to organize cultivation and provide wheat for the state- owned flour mill at N'Djamena, the Grands Moulins du Tchad. The flour mill began operations in 1964 but closed in 1980; as of 1987, operations had not resumed. In the late 1970s, plans to plant some 200 square kilometres of wheat in polders failed because warfare around Lake Chad affected the infrastructure of SODELAC and the construction of new polders and because farmers resisted SODELAC-controlled production. Wheat production generally followed trends similar to the production of other cereals, remaining low in the 1960s and 1970s but reaching a high in 1983. In 1984, however, production fell sharply. The bulk of wheat was traded through traditional channels to those herders in the northern regions of Chad who preferred wheat to millet or sorghum. Wheat and other matierials such as BereBere, Rice, Corn, Peanuts, and yams were grown by farmers, it could be to supply food for a village or just to feed themselves. =Rice and corn= At the time of the French conquest, rice was grown on a small scale. Before World War I, the Germans on the Cameroon side of the Logone River encouraged the spread of rice cultivation. By World War II, the French imposed cultivation in the areas of southern Chad near Laï and Kélo, along the Logone River. Although production was destined originally for colonial troops, the taste for rice spread in some localities. What was originally intended by the French as a commercial cash crop had become a local subsistence crop by the 1980s. The Development Office for Sategui Deressia (Office de Mise en Valeur de Sategui-Deressia--OMVSD), founded in 1976, replaced Experimental Sectors for Agricultural Modernization (Secteurs Expérimentaux de Modernisation Agricole—SEMAA), originally responsible for the organization, improvement, transformation, and commercialization of rice. Efforts by these organizations to extend commercial rice cultivation had mixed results. The area under rice cultivation has increased since the 1950s. Yet even in the 1980s, the greater part of this area was cultivated by traditional means. Schemes for controlled paddies at Bongor and Laï put only 35 square kilometres and 18 square kilometres, respectively, into cultivation before political events of the late 1970s and early 1980s disrupted efforts and international donor funding ceased. The bulk of rice production from traditional floodwater paddies was traded to the towns and cities or was consumed locally. Corn was a crop of minor importance, grown in and around village gardens for local consumption. Production from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s remained in the 20,000- to 30,000-ton range. By 1987 no efforts at commercialization had been made, nor had the government tried to improve and extend corn production. =Peanuts= Peanuts have become an important food crop in Chad. Peanuts were eaten roasted or dry, and their oil was used in cooking. Peanuts were cultivated in both the soudanian and the sahelian zones. Production of peanuts was more stable than that of any other major crop, staying in the 90,000- to 100,000-ton range from the 1950s through 1987, with dips in drought years. The area under peanut production also remained stable, although kilograms-per-hectare yields declined slightly. The droughtresistant nature of peanuts made their production particularly important for the peoples of the sahelian zone, where peanuts were planted alone or in combination with millet in the first year of rotation; in the soudanian region, peanuts were traditionally planted in the third year of crop rotation. Although considerable efforts were made to commercialize peanut production, most efforts failed. Through the 1960s and 1970s, about 97% of the annual crop went to local consumption. What remained was sold to various edible oil manufacturing concerns, none of which succeeded. For example, a Chinese-built peanut oil mill at Abéché, finished in 1969, never operated. Local farmers sold surplus peanuts through traditional channels, rather than to the state monopoly set up in 1965, the National Trading Company of Chad (Société Nationale de Commercialisation du Tchad—SONACOT). This parastatal bought local produce for sale abroad or domestically to state-run commercial operations. Unlike Cotontchad, SONACOT was never given the means to compel farmers to sell their crops, and it did not have the resources to compete with prices offered by traditional traders. With the collapse of central authority in 1979, SONACOT disappeared. The only commercial sales of peanuts were then limited to Cotontchad purchases in the south, but by 1987 these had been halted to reduce costs. =Tubers= The importance of tubers has grown dramatically over the years. Cassava and yams were the most important crops in this category, with much smaller production of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and coco yams (taro). Grown only in the soudanian zone, tubers were once neglected, although such cultivation is widespread in other parts of subtropical West Africa. Estimates in the 1950s put tuber production at 50,000 tons annually. Production rose and by 1961 it exceeded 200,000 tons. From 1961 to 1984, the proportion of roots and tubers in the national diet rose from 6 to 17%. The reason for this important shift in eating habits among people of the soudanian zone was the hedge these crops provided against famine in years when drought reduced millet and sorghum production. Livestock Livestock raising, and in particular cattle herding, is a major economic activity. Animal husbandry was the main source of livelihood for perhaps a third of Chad's people. The growing importance of cattle and meat exports underscored this point. In the 1960s and 1970s, these exports were estimated at between 25 and 30% of all merchandise exports. The proportion of these exports grew in the 1980s as the value of cotton exports declined. It was impossible, however, to know with certainty the actual values of cattle exports. For processed meat exports, less uncertainty existed because these exports were controlled from the slaughterhouse to the point of export; in 1985 processed meat exports represented less than 1% of all merchandise exports. The real value of Chad's cattle herds was in the export by traditional traders to markets in Cameroon and Nigeria. These \\"on the hoof\\" exports passed largely outside the control of customs services. Therefore, these exports were neither counted nor taxed. Perhaps one-fourth of cattle's estimated 30-percent share of total exports, was officially recorded. The size of Chad's herds was also difficult to determine. Considered to have declined in the mid-1970s and again in the early 1980s because of drought and warfare across the sahelian zone, estimated to be growing at a rate of 4% annually, reached some 4 million head of cattle, 4.5 million sheep and goats, 500,000 camels, and 420,000 horses and donkeys by the mid-1980s. Sheep and goats were found in all regions of Chad. Before the drought of the 1980s, the sahelian zone held the largest herds, with about 80% of the total cattle herd. Smaller numbers of cattle were found in the soudanian zone, along with about 100,000 buffaloes used in plowing cotton fields. Camel herds were concentrated in the dry northern regions. Herders practiced transhumance—seasonal migrations along fairly well set patterns. With the 1984-85 drought, transhumance patterns changed. Camels were brought farther south into the sahelian zone in search of water. Cattle were herded even farther south, sometimes through Salamat Prefecture into Central African Republic. The government and international donor community had contemplated considerable improvements for Chad's livestock management, but these plans were undermined by the Chadian Civil War, political instability, and an inadequate infrastructure. The most successful programs have been animal vaccination campaigns, such as an emergency project carried out in 1983 to halt the spread of rinderpest. The campaign reached some 4.7 million head of cattle across the nation and demonstrated the capabilities of Chad's animal health service when given external support. The Livestock and Veterinary Medicine Institute of Chad (Institut d'Elevage et de Médecine Vétérinaire du Tchad--IEMVT), which was financed by foreign aid, was capable of producing vaccines for Chad as well as for neighboring countries. Despite plant capacity, by 1984 a lack of a trained staff limited production to vaccines for anthrax and pasteurellosis. Two institutional efforts to manage cattle marketing were attempted in the 1970s and 1980s. The Chadian Animal Resources Improvement Company (Société Tchadienne d'Exploitation des Ressources Animales—SOTERA), a mixed enterprise formed as a livestock company with participation by some traditional livestock traders, began operations in 1978. Its aim was to control live animal exports through a license system and to have a monopoly on exports of chilled meat and hides. It was hoped at the time that the association of traders to SOTERA would increase the effective collection of export taxes on livestock by 50 to 75%. By 1984, however, SOTERA handled only a small portion of the domestic market and less than 30% of the export trade. A second institution, the Center for the Modernization of Animal Production (Centre de Modernisation des Productions Animales—CMPA), was engaged in marketing dairy products, supplying chicks to farmers, and overseeing the sale of eggs and the processing of feed. But, among other problems, the CMPA was unable to compete with local traders for milk needed to produce cheese for sale. Although highly subsidized, this venture also was unsuccessful and demonstrated the resilience of the traditional private network for marketing produce. Despite these institutional difficulties, the international community continued to support efforts to expand animal health services to Chad's herders. Some estimates suggest that the nation's herds could be increased by 35% if the distribution of water were improved, extension services were made more available, and animal health services were expanded.

In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, total production of fish was estimated at between 60,000 and 120,000 tons per year. But because these figures represent production for the Logone River and Lake Chad, which are shared with Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria, Chad's fish production amounted to an estimated 70 percent of the total. The largest part of the catch – perhaps two-thirds – was consumed locally. In areas adjacent to urban centers, some portion - usually the best of the catch, such as large Nile perch (called capitaine in Chad) – was marketed fresh. Along Lake Chad and the river borders with Cameroon, the surplus catch was dried, salted, or smoked before being sold. Between 1976 and 1985, production of dried, salted, or smoked fish was estimated at 20,000 tons annually, representing from 20 to 25 percent of Chad's total annual catch. A large share of the commerce in preserved fish was carried on with markets in Cameroon and Nigeria. Small dried or salted fish called salanga were most popular on the markets of Cameroon. Larger smoked fish called banda were generally exported to the major Nigerian market of Maiduguri. Through the mid-1980s, Chad had taken few steps to control or modernize fishing or to promote fish conservation, although some plans had been made in the 1960s and 1970s. Perhaps the most significant innovation applied by Chadian fishermen has been their use of nylon netting, which began in the 1960s. During the periods of conflict, no government plans could be carried out to control fishing. Although considerable potential existed for the development of the Chadian fishing industry, because of insufficient government interest traditional production and marketing of freshwater fish was likely to remain unchanged for the near term.

It may be considered a first attempt in finding the metric of a spinning black hole. It is sometimes also used in homogeneous but anisotropic cosmological models formulated in the framework of general relativity. The underlying Taub space was found by , and extended to a larger manifold by , whose initials form the \\"NUT\\" of \\"Taub–NUT\\". Taub's solution is an empty space solution of Einstein's equations with topology R×S3 and metric (or equivalently line element) :g =-dt^2/U(t) + 4l^2U(t)(d\\\\psi+ \\\\cos\\\\theta d\\\\phi)^2+(t^2+l^2)(d\\\\theta^2+(\\\\sin\\\\theta)^2d\\\\phi^2) where :U(t)=\\\\frac{2mt+l^2-t^2}{t^2+l^2} and m and l are positive constants. Taub's metric has coordinate singularities at U=0, t=m+(m^2+l^2)^{1/2}, and Newman, Tamburino and Unti showed how to extend the metric across these surfaces. When Roy Kerr developed the Kerr metric for spinning black holes in 1963, he ended up with a 4 parameter solution, one of which was the mass and another the angular momentum of the central body. One of the two other parameters was the NUT-parameter, which he threw out of his solution because he found it to be nonphysical since it caused the metric to be not asymptotically flat,Roy Kerr: Spinning Black Holes (Lecture at the University of Canterbury, 25.

Desertification of this large African nation has contributed to the demise of a viable forestry industry.Like most states of the African Sahel, Chad has suffered desertification—the encroachment of the desert. Traditional herding practices and the need for firewood and wood for construction have exacerbated the problem. In the early 1980s, the country possessed between 135,000 and 160,000 square kilometres of forest and woodlands, representing a decline of almost 14% from the early 1960s. To what extent this decline was caused by climatic changes and to what extent by herding and cutting practices is unknown. Regulation was difficult because some people traditionally made their living selling wood and charcoal for fuel and wood for construction to people in the urban center. Although the government attempted to limit wood brought into the capital, the attempts have not been well managed, and unrestricted cutting of woodlands remained a problem.

History The building was built in 1922 to replace a smaller building and accommodate a larger enrollment. It was designed by Frederick Heath of Heath, Gove and Bell. Because Washington had laws preventing aliens from owning land, the lot was paid for by a school corporation that was made up of three Americans, and two Issei Japanese Americans. Two lots were bought for a total cost of $1,600, and the building was built at a cost of $9,000. An addition to the building was added in 1926. The school taught classes on the English language, the Japanese language, and Japanese culture. During World War II the building was used to gather Japanese residents during World War II, before sending them to internment camps. The University of Washington bought the building in 1993 after it established a campus in Tacoma. By this point, the decades of vacancy had left the building quite dilapidated. The same year, the university had made a request to the Tacoma Landmarks Preservation Commission for permission to demolish the building and replace it with a commemorative garden, but failed to act on their approval. In 2001, the City of Tacoma told the university that the building was a safety hazard and the following year the Preservation Commission renewed their approval of the plan for demolition. The university received an estimate of $3 million to rehabilitate the building, and decided that the cost was not feasible. Despite being listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as being a City of Tacoma Landmark, the building was demolished in 2004 after having stood vacant since the 1940s. Prior to its demolishing, the school was one of only two Japanese language schools left, of around four dozen that existed in the Western United States and Hawaii.

October 2, 1658 - died July 30, 1742) was a Dutch-American politician. He was an early member of the Roosevelt family and a prominent Dutch-American citizen of New Amsterdam (later New York City), and was the 4th great-grandfather to Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945). He was the first Roosevelt to hold an elected office in North America, as an alderman. Early life Roosevelt was born in New Amsterdam and baptized on October 2, 1658. He was the son of Claes Maartenszen van Rosenvelt (c. 1626–1659), the immigrant ancestor of the Roosevelt family in America, and Jannetje Samuels Thomas (1625–1660). He was baptized in the Reformed Dutch Church of New Amsterdam. Life and career By 1680, he had moved to Esopus, near Kingston, New York, another early Dutch settlement in the New Netherlands. There, on April 5, 1680, he signed a petition asking for a minister for Kingston. During his time in Esopus, he was a fur trader on friendly terms with Native Americans. In 1690, he returned with his family to New York, where he was listed as having the occupation of a \\"bolter.\\" He was made a freeman on August 23, 1698. Politically active, he was a supporter of the party of Jacob Leisler, who had led an insurrection in 1689 in support of the succession of Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange-Nassau to the English throne in the Revolution of 1688. Nicholas Roosevelt was an alderman from 1698 to 1701 and again for the West Ward in 1715.

She founded Allanstand Cottage Industries in 1897 in Madison County, North Carolina. This ultimately became Allanstand Craft Shop. She then moved the business to downtown Asheville in 1908 and from her College Street headquarters she worked with other leaders of the southern Arts and Crafts movement.Alvic, Philis, Weavers of the Southern Highlands, p. 22, University Press of Kentucky (2003), In 1928 the idea of the Southern Highland Craft Guild was formed.

As an alternative to a hierarchical, top-down control system, it practiced what was called emergent decision-making, which required that those involved with the implementation of a decision should be involved in making the decision. The model rests on research into human personality carried out at the Centre for Human Communication. The model was first publicly presented by Kevin Kingslandhttp://www.business- psychology.com/whois.asphttp://theacidtest.net/blog/kevin.html in his 1977 paper to the 1st European Conference of the Association for Humanistic Psychology, University College London entitled You can tell a man by the company he creates. It was updated in the Kingsland K. and Kingsland V. paper presented in 1996 to 2nd ALPS Euroconference, University of Bologna entitled The Enacted Company.papers It was suggested that the Community Company satisfied the need for a more inclusive and sustainable way of working than was to be found in traditional business models. Many elements of the Community Company model can be seen in recent developments such as the social enterprise model and social business ventures such as the Grameen Bank with its system of self-help groups. Operational Attributes A paper presented to The City University Business School (Masters Programme 1982)http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Community_Company_- _a_paper_presented_to_CUBS_in_1982.pdf identified the following attributes of a Community Company: Imployment. The community company does not have a hard boundary with people either employed or not employed. Rather, it has a fuzzy boundary with people becoming more or less involved through their own volitions. Involvement in day to day work changes over time as people move through different phases or episodes of life. This allows people to adjust their involvement through times of parenting, illness or concerns beyond the company for example. Role evolution. Roles evolve continuously as individuals develop their capabilities and needs change in the company. Individual development is enhanced by and necessary for the development of the community company. The community company values individual development and supports it, allowing people to develop healthily even if it leads to the individual wishing to move away from the company. In this case, the individual is supported. Authority is achieved by natural recognition of an individual's competence. Authority is distributed and authentic. Decision making is achieved by emergent decision making processes. This is a clearly defined methodology that ensures that a decision which is made by the company can be carried out. Decisions are defined as precursors to action. There is no such thing as a decision that is not actioned. Direction of the community company is achieved through a living evolving meta vision. This is a vision that allows each individual to work towards their own vision as part of the whole. The meta vision encompasses each person's vision. Should visions greatly diverge a new community company may be spun out. Examples The first full example of a Community Company was Grael Associates Limited in 1973 which ran restaurants, sold wholefoods and published books. For example HathapradipkaHathapradipika : the means by which constant change may be transcended to reveal the eternal light of the self by Swami Svatmarama, Kevin Kingsland, Venika Kingsland (Used, New, Out-of-Print) - Alibris and the Glastonbury ZodiacAmazon.com: The Glastonbury zodiac: Key to the mysteries of Britain: Mary Caine: Books were both printed and published by Grael Communications. Grael inspired and was followed by other companies such as The Whole Food Company Limited and Infoshare Limited in the 1980s. Academic Interest The application of the model in real life organisations stimulated significant interest from academics (Tan, 1978, Velge 1983) and the model was used in the small business start-up programme taught by Urbedwww.urbed.co.uk in the 1980s.

Float planes were no longer needed because of this development. Therefore, places like Coast Guard Air Station Salem were slowly being phased out. In the 1960s, the Coast Guard began searching for a replacement facility for Coast Guard Air Station Salem, that was in service from 1935 to 1970. Salem was just not able to expand, and the Coast Guard needed a space that could grow as needed and accommodate modern aircraft. =1970-1995= In 1968, the Department of Defense agreed to allow the Coast Guard to utilize Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod for a new Coast Guard Air Station.

Richard Burge (Canadian Forces Exchange Co-Pilot); Petty Officer 2nd Class John Tait (Avionicsman/Navigator); and Petty Officer 2nd Class Bruce Kaehler (Hospital Corpsman). The HH-3F Pelican continued in service until replaced by the HH-60 Jayhawk in the 90s. The last HH-52A Seaguard helicopters were transferred from CGAD Salem to CGAS Cape Cod in late 1970 and were phased out prior to the Jayhawk coming on board. The HU-25 Guardians arrived at CGAS Cape Cod, in 1982, replacing the HU-16E Albatross. The last Albatross, CGNR 7250, was retired on March 10, 1983 and is on display outside the entrance to the air station. CG 7250/NC 7250 was not only the last Coast Guard Albatross, but the last fixed-wing amphibious aircraft in US inventory. Crash of Helo CG-1432 The CG-1432 Crash was a United States Coast Guard aviation accident which involved five crewmembers aboard a helicopter responding to a distress call from the Japanese fishing vessel Kaisei Maru #18. =February 18, 1979= On the morning of February 18, 1979, Kaisei Maru #18 sent a distress call. The call indicated that a 47-year-old crewmember was in distress and needed to be airlifted off the ship, which was operating in the North Atlantic Ocean. The U.S. Coast Guard Sikorsky HH-3F Pelican helicopter CG-1432 from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod at Sandwich, Massachusetts, was alerted and sent out to the vessel. The weather that morning was stormy and conditions were not ideal for flight. On the way to Kasei Maru #18, the helicopter was forced to ditch into the sea after losing power. It remained stable for a brief time before the heavy seas flipped it. This most likely caused the death of four crew members: Canadian Armed Forces Captain G. Richard Burge and U.S. Coast Guard personnel Lieutenant Commander James Stiles, Petty Officer Second Class John Tait, and Petty Officer Second Class Bruce Kaehler. The lone survivor, Petty Officer Second Class Mark Torr (Flight Mechanic/Hoist Operator) remembers the flipping of the helicopter and swimming out, holding onto the nose wheel to stay near the aircraft. =Aftermath= The first vessel to the rescue was Kaisei Maru #18, which rescued Torr and circled the ditched helicopter for 15 hours, looking for survivors and eventually recovering the bodies of the four dead crewmembers. A memorial to the fallen, sits at the entrance to CGAS Cape Cod In an article in the Cape Cod Times that ran on February 22, 1979, the air stations commanding officer, Captain Arthur Wagner, said, \\"They will never be forgotten. They set down a high standard for all of us to follow.\\" A legacy was set in which a reunion would be held every year so that the men would not be forgotten. A memorial was erected in 1980 at the entrance to Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod. At the 2009 reunion, Rear Admiral John Currier, who was stationed at Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod in 1979 recalled telling pilot James Stiles to \\"fly safe.\\" It was the last time that he ever said that to a pilot. Also at service, crash survivor Mark Torr dropped a wreath in memory of his fellow airmen from a hovering helicopter into the surf off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. =1995-present= The Air Station has participated in rescues of sailors from Canada to New York.

Col. Stephen Salerno congratulates a student upon completion of military legal education in N'Dajema, Chad, September 2010. Education in Chad is challenging due to the nation's dispersed population and a certain degree of reluctance on the part of parents to send their children to school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68% of boys continue their education past primary school, and over half of the population is illiterate. Higher education is provided at the University of N'Djamena.\\"Background Notes: Chad\\"Chad\\",Encyclopædia Britannica. History The establishment of Protestant mission schools in southern Chad in the 1814 marked the beginning of Western education in the country. From the outset, the colonial administration required that all instruction be in French, with the exception of religion classes. A standard curriculum was imposed on all institutions desiring official recognition and government subsidies.Chad country study. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Education in Chad is chiefly focused on primary instruction. Until 1942, students who desired a secular secondary education had to go to schools in Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo, severely limiting the number of secondary-school students. State secondary schools were opened in Chad in 1942, but recognized certificate programs did not begin until the mid-1950s. At independence in 1960, the government established a goal of universal primary education, and school attendance was made compulsory until age twelve. Nevertheless, the development of standard curricula was hampered by the limited number of schools, the existence of two- and three-year establishments alongside the standard five- and seven-year collèges and lycées, and the Muslim preference for Quranic education. Even so, by the mid-1960s 17 percent of students between the ages of six and eight were in school. Quranic schools throughout the Saharan and Sahelian zones teach students to read Arabic and recite Quranic verse. In Chad, modern Islamic secondary schools have included the Ecole Mohamed Illech, founded in 1918. Despite the government's efforts, overall educational levels remained low at the end of the first decade of independence. In 1971 about 88 percent of men and 99 percent of women over the age of fifteen could not read, write, or speak French, which at the time was the only official national language; literacy in Arabic stood at 7.8 percent. In 1982 the overall literacy rate stood at about 15 percent. Major problems have hindered the development of Chadian education since independence. Financing has been very limited. Limited facilities and personnel also have made it difficult for the education system to provide adequate instruction. Overcrowding is a major problem; some classes have up 100 students, many of whom are repeaters. In the years just after independence, many primary-school teachers had only marginal qualifications. On the secondary level, the situation was even worse. In the 1970s and 1980s, Chad made considerable progress in dealing with problems of facilities and personnel. To improve instruction, review sessions and refresher programmes have been instituted for primary-school teachers. On the secondary level, increasing numbers of Chadians have taken their places in the ranks of the faculty. Furthermore, during the 1971-72 school year, the Université du Tchad opened its doors. Another problem at independence was that the French curricula of Chadian schools limited their effectiveness. Primary instruction was in French, although most students did not speak that language when they entered school. In addition, the academic program inherited from the French did not prepare students for employment options in Chad. Beginning in the late 1960s, the government attempted to address these problems. Model schools discarded the French-style classical education in favor of a new approach that taught children to reinterpret and modify their social and economic environment. The Chadian Civil War also posed problems to education. Lack of security in vast parts of the country has made it difficult to send teachers to their posts and to maintain them there. In addition, the mobility occasioned by the war has created havoc with attempts to get children to attend classes regularly. The diversion of resources to the conflict has also prevented the government from maintaining the expenditure levels found at independence. Finally, the violence has taken its toll among teachers, students, and facilities. The government has made major efforts to overcome these problems. In 1983 the Ministry of Planning and Reconstruction reported that the opening of the 1982-83 school year was the most successful since the upheavals of 1979. In 1984 the Université du Tchad, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, and the Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics reopened their doors as well. In the late 1980s, the Ministry of Education had administrative responsibility for all formal schooling. Because of years of civil strife, however, local communities had assumed many of the ministry's functions, including the construction and maintenance of schools, and payment of teachers' salaries. However, the government is unable to adequately fund education, and parents in practice make significant payments for tuition and teacher salaries. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 76 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 61 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. In 2004, 39.6 percent of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. Educational opportunities for girls are limited, mainly due to cultural traditions. Fewer girls enroll in secondary school than boys, primarily due to early marriage. In 1999, 54.0 percent of children starting primary school reached grade 5.\\"Chad\\". 2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor .

Higher education When the country became independent in 1960, Chad had no university. For the first decade of the nation's life, students who wished to study beyond the secondary level had to go abroad. In the 1966-67 school year, eighty-three Chadians were studying outside the country; the following year, this number rose to 200. In the early years, almost all students seeking advanced education were male. The largest number went to France (30 percent in the academic year 1966-67, for example), but some Chadians studied in Belgium, Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, and Congo. At that time, most students were pursuing degrees in education, liberal arts, agriculture, and medicine. Pursuant to an agreement with France, the Université du Tchad opened in the 1971-72 academic year. Financed almost entirely through French assistance, the faculty of 25 welcomed 200 students the first year. By the 1974-75 academic year, enrollment had climbed to 500, and the university graduated its first class of 45. The imposition of compulsory yondo rites greatly disrupted the following school year, but after the overthrow of Tombalbaye and the end of the authenticité movement, the university continued to grow. Enrollment rose from 639 in 1976-77 to a high of 1,046 in 1977-78, then dropped slightly to 974 in 1978-79. Unfortunately, the Chadian Civil War curtailed university activities in 1979 and 1980, when the first and second battles of N'Djamena threatened facilities and students alike. With the return of relative calm in the early 1980s, the university reopened. In 1983-84 the university had 141 teachers and 1,643 students. In addition to the university, higher learning in Chad included one advanced teacher—training institution, the Ecole Normale Supérieure, which trained secondary-school instructors. Enrollment in the 1982-83 and 1983-84 school years came to about 200 students. Degree programs included history-geography, modern literature, English and French, Arabic and French, mathematics and physics, and biology-geology-chemistry. Vocational education In 1983 vocational education was offered at three lycées techniques industrielles (in Sarh, N'Djamena, and Moundou), and the Collège d'Enseignement Technique in Sarah Enrollment figures for three of the four technical schools stood at 1,490 in 1983. Primary-school graduates interested in technical or vocational training could follow two courses. They either could enter a first level, three-year programme (première cycle) at a collège (after which they could transfer to one of the four technical schools) or they could enroll directly in one of the lycées for a six-year program. Students completing the three- year première cycle received professional aptitude certificates; those finishing the entire six-year course were awarded diplomas. Apart from the lycées techniques, several other institutions offered vocational training in Chad in the early 1980s. These included the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, which opened in 1963 in N'Djamena; a postal and telecommunications school in Sarh; a school for technical education related to public works; and the Ba- Illi agricultural school. Other Chadians studied at technical training centres abroad. In the late 1980s, advanced medical education was not available in Chad. The only medical training institution was the National School of Public Health and Social Work (Ecole Nationale de Santé Publique et de Service Social—ENSPSS) in N'Djamena. Its enrollment, however, has been very limited; in 1982 there were only twenty-eight students in nursing, three in social work, and thirty-three in public health.

Next in importance were the National Sugar Company of Chad (Société Nationale Sucrière du Tchad—SONASUT), the Chadian Textile Company (Société Tchadienne de Textile—STT), the Logone Breweries (Brasseries du Logone—BdL), and the Cigarette Factory of Chad (Manufacture des Cigarettes du Tchad—MCT). Observers estimated that these five industries generated some 20 percent of GDP. Of lesser importance were the Farcha Slaughterhouse (Abattoir Frigorifique de Farcha), the Industrial Agricultural Equipment Company (Société Industrielle de Matériel Agricole du Tchad—SIMAT), and Soft Drinks of Chad (Boissons Gazeuses du Tchad—BGT). Before the warfare of the 1979-82 period, Chad's industrial sector included between 80 and 100 small and medium enterprises, in addition to the major manufacturing industries. Most of these processed agricultural products, or competed in the import/export trade. About half were local subsidiaries of foreign-owned firms or were Chadian firms with significant foreign capital. The foreign-owned distributorships sold agricultural equipment, construction materials, and petroleum products. Chadian Civil War During the Civil war in Chad (1979-1982), the facilities and equipment of many industries were badly damaged. Most industrial operations either ceased or were reduced greatly, and almost all foreign investors withdrew from the country. Those operations that did continue on a reduced scale were limited to the Soudanian region, which was not involved directly in large-scale fighting. By 1983, with the re-establishment of political stability on a national scale, the five major industrial concerns resumed full operations, and the less significant ones, such as SIMAT and the BGT, were rebuilt. Post-war Since 1983 the return of foreign investment has been slow because of the high costs of rebuilding and a continuing perception of political uncertainty. Of the approximately twenty enterprises that had reopened by the late 1980s, most were import-export enterprises that lacked a formal relationship with the banking sector. Most Chadian-owned enterprises had managed to re-establish themselves. Yet by 1986, small enterprises that had assembled bicycles, motorcycles, and radios remained closed. The lack of access to credit was another impediment to business expansion in Chad. Despite the reopening in 1983 of the Bank of Central African States (Banque des Etats d'Afrique Centrale—BEAC) and of two commercial banks, the International Bank for Africa in Chad (Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique au Tchad—BIAT) and the Chadian Credit and Deposit Bank (Banque Tchadienne de Crédit et de Dépôt—BTCD), the high proportion of available credit going to Chad's major industries limited credit available to smaller enterprises. Moreover, the banks invoked strict criteria for loan eligibility because of the high risk of lending in Chad. Few owners of small businesses knew sufficient accounting and technical skills to meet bank information requirements for loans. Ownership With the exception of the two bottling companies (the BGT and the BdL), which were privately owned, all the other important industries were either parastatals with majority government ownership or mixed companies with important government participation. For the most part, private participation was limited to French investors; investment by private Chadian interests was extremely rare. French companies were also important shareholders in the larger Chadian companies, such as Cotontchad. Except for Cotontchad, whose top management was Chadian, all the other major industries were run by expatriate directors, accountants, and mid-level managers who, for the most part, were French. Industrial output Industrial output grew rapidly in 1983 and 1984, as industries resumed operations that had been interrupted by war. By 1984 and 1985, prewar levels of output had been either reached or exceeded. Growth slowed for all industries after 1985, however, because of the dramatic downturn of world cotton prices, and output in 1986 began to decline. Cotton fiber production by Cotontchad, which directly reflected production of raw cotton, fell sharply in 1985. This decline was stabilized in 1986-87 by emergency support from international donors. These donors prescribed retrenchment programs to prevent the total collapse of the cotton industry. The restrictions imposed on the production of ginned cotton fiber, however, reduced by half the number of ginning mills, with raw cotton production limited to about 100,000 tons. Production of edible oils by Cotontchad was also affected by the program of cost savings. Other industries were affected directly by the fall of cotton prices. STT textile production slowed, as did the production of agricultural equipment by SIMAT, which made plowing equipment for use in cotton planting. Furthermore, the drop in revenues to farmers in the soudanian zone for their cotton and peanut production affected their ability to buy equipment. Lost revenues to farmers, along with the reduction in the numbers of workers needed in ginning operations, took a toll on cash earnings and therefore on buying power. By 1986 the ripple effect of these lost revenues in the cotton sector was widespread. The downturn in production in all industries left Chad with considerable unused capacity, ranging from 15 to 50 percent. Impediments to industry A number of other factors resulted in the slump in Chadian industry. Commercial sale of goods was low in a largely cash poor or nonmonetary economy. The decline in the cotton sector, which had provided the largest infusion of cash into the economy, further reduced consumer demand. Another impediment to industry was the high local cost of production compared with the cost of production in neighboring countries. Factors that raised local production costs included high transportation costs, overdependence on imports, and restricted economies of scale for small operations. Imported inputs were equivalent to about 30 percent of industrial turnover for Cotontchad, the BdL, and the STT and to about 60 percent for the MCT. Local substitutes for inputs were often more expensive than imported equivalents. Imports were often marketed to subsidize local production by a given industry. An example was SONASUT's importing refined sugar at less than local production costs, selling it locally, and using the proceeds to subsidize sugarcane production on SONASUT plantations. Interlocking relationships of production among companies also kept production costs high. For example, the BGT used SONASUT's refined sugar in its production of soft drinks, according to a convention with the government to use local inputs, even though imported refined sugar was cheaper.

Gekko is a superscalar out-of-order 32-bit PowerPC microprocessor custom- made by IBM in 2000 for Nintendo to use as the CPU in their sixth generation game console, the Nintendo GameCube, and later the Triforce Arcade Board. Development Gekko's role in the game system was to facilitate game scripting, Artificial Intelligence, physics and collision detection, custom graphics lighting effects and geometry such as smooth transformations, and moving graphics data through the system. The project was announced in 1999 when IBM and Nintendo agreed to a one billion dollar contract for a CPU running at approximately 400 MHz. IBM chose to modify their existing PowerPC 750CXe processor to suit Nintendo's needs, such as tight and balanced operation alongside the \\"Flipper\\" graphics processor. The customization was to the bus architecture, DMA, compression and floating point unit which support a special set of SIMD instructions. The CPU made ground work for custom lighting and geometry effects and could burst compressed data directly to the GPU.

Also called sal soda or washing soda, natron was used as a salt for medicinal purposes, as a preservative for hides, and as an ingredient in the traditional manufacture of soap; herders also fed it to their animals. Natron deposits were located around the shore of Lake Chad and the wadis of Kanem Prefecture. Natron occurs naturally in two forms: white and black. More valuable commercially, hard blocks of black natron were exported to Nigeria. White natron was sold on local markets, principally in N'Djamena and farther to the south. Although efforts were made in the late 1960s to control the commercialization of natron through the creation of a parastatal, by 1970 those efforts had failed because of resistance by traditional chiefs and traders who controlled production through a system of perpetual indebtedness. A number of other mineral deposits are known, but none had been commercially exploited by the mid-1980s. Bauxite is found in the soudanian zone, and gold- bearing quartz is reported in Biltine Prefecture. Uranium is reported in the Aozou Strip, as are tin and tungsten in other parts of the Tibesti Mountains, but exploration reports in 1971 for these three minerals did not indicate large or rich deposits. As of 1987, conflicts in the region prevented further exploration. By far the potentially most important resource is oil. In 1970, a consortium of Conoco, Shell, Chevron, and Exxon started exploration and in 1974 discovered minor oil deposits at Sédigi, near Rig Rig, to the north of Lake Chad. Total reserves at Sédigi were estimated at 60 million tons, or roughly of oil. Exploration in 1985 by the Exxon-led consortium discovered potentially large deposits near Doba in the southern region of Chad. Further efforts were suspended in 1986 when world oil prices continued to drop, although the consortium maintained a liaison office in N'Djamena in 1988. Plans existed in the late 1970s to exploit the deposits at Sédigi and to construct a small refinery at N'Djamena. Those plans lapsed during the conflicts of the late 1970s and early 1980s but were revived in 1986 by the government with the support of the World Bank. The reasons for proceeding with plans to exploit these deposits and build a refinery were clear. The cost of importing petroleum products exceeded the cost of extracting and refining domestic crude, even when international oil prices were low. The plans, which anticipated operations to begin in the early 1990s, included well development in the Sédigi field, a pipeline to N'Djamena, a refinery with a 2,000- to capacity, and the transformation or acquisition of power-generating equipment in the capital to burn the refinery's residual fuel oil. The refinery's output would satisfy 80 percent of Chad's annual fuel needs, including all gasoline, diesel, butane, and kerosene; lubricants and jet fuel, however, would still have to be imported.

She is best known for the discovery of cryoprecipitation, a process for creating concentrated blood clotting factors which significantly improved the quality of life for hemophiliacs around the world. Background Judith Graham was born in Queens, N.Y. into a Jewish family. Her mother was a school teacher and her father was a stockbroker. She married Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political scientist, in her junior year in College. She stopped her graduate program when she gave birth to her two sons, Jonathan Robert and Jeremy David Pool, in the 1940s. She got a divorce in the 1950s and moved to Oslo, Norway in 1958—1959. She had a daughter twenty years after the birth of her second son, then she married Maurice Sokolow, professor of medicine and hematology. Their marriage ended three years after. Judith Pool died when she was 56 from a brain tumor. Education Pool studied physics at the University of Chicago, then she went on to graduate work and served as an assistant in her department. She taught physics at Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., while writing her dissertation on the electrophysiology of muscle fibers. She finally completed her degree in 1946, produced a remarkable study of the electropotential of a single isolated muscle fiber. After her doctoral degree, She moved to California with her family and obtained a research position at the Stanford Research Institute. In 1953, she began to do blood coagulation studies at the Stanford School of Medicine as a research fellow supported by a Bank of America-Giannini Foundation grant. She went to Oslo, Norway, on a Fulbright research fellowship. Career She was a Stanford senior research associate from 1956 to 1970, then advanced to senior scientist in 1970. In 1972, she was promoted to full professor with a high professorial rank. She also gave lectures, such as the Paul M. Aggeler Memorial Lecture in 1974, at several institutions and congresses. She was a member of the national scientific advisory committees of the National Institutes of Health and the American Red Cross Blood Program, the Advisory Committee of the National Blood Resource Program, the Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Hemophilia Foundation, the Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the World Federation of Hemophilia, and the editorial boards of Transfusion and the American Journal of Hematology. In her last year, she spent most of her time and effort on making more and better opportunities for women in science nationally. She founded and chaired the Professional Women of Stanford University Medical School organization, was a founding member and co-president (along with Neena Schwartz) of the Association for Women in Science in 1971, and was a member of the AWIS steering committee from 1972 to 1973. Contribution Pool's work on blood coagulation resulted in the development of a cold-insoluble protein fraction of blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, which contains an hemophilic factor (AHF) soon to be used widely in blood banks. She obtained awards for this discovery. Pool's major observation was that factor VIII can be simply and cheaply prepared from human plasma, and can be easily and safely given to hemophilic patients. The material can be used to terminate bleeding in the hemophiliac patient, or to preoperatively prepare the hemophiliac patient, so that necessary surgical procedures are now possible in this group of patients. In addition to devising and introducing into clinical medicine a preparation containing the lacking protein in the hemophiliacs, which changed their treatment in a major way, she also made a number of contributions on the extraction, preservation, and survival of proteins. At the time of her death, she was widely respected in the field of hematology. =Selected Work= \\\\- Measurements of membrane potential in a single muscle fiber (with Dr. Ralph W.

The Chadian Water and Electricity Company (Société Tchadienne d'Eau et d'Electricité—STEE), was the major public utility company. The government held 82 percent of the shares and CCCE held 18 percent. STEE provided water and electricity to the four main urban areas, N'Djamena, Moundou, Sarh, and Abéché. The company supplied water, but not electricity, to six other towns. Despite old equipment and high maintenance costs, STEE was able to meet about half of peak demand, which increased significantly from 1983 to 1986. Production of electricity rose by 35 percent from 1983 to 1986, and the supply of water increased by 24 percent during the same period. In 1986 STEE produced 62.1 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and supplied 10.8 million cubic meters of water. In N'Djamena the majority of households had access to water. There were, however, only about 3,000 officially connected customers, a good proportion of which were collective customers. There were also an estimated 1,500 illegal water connections. The rest of the people received water from standpipes. Some 5,000 customers were officially connected for electricity in the capital in 1986, with an unknown number of illegal connections. Because electricity was so expensive and because electrical appliances were beyond the means of most people, the consumption of power per household was low.

The Indian Medical Service (IMS) was a military medical service in British India, which also had some civilian functions. It served during the two World Wars, and remained in existence until the independence of India in 1947. Many of its officers, who were both British and Indian, served in civilian hospitals. Among its notable ranks, the IMS had Sir Ronald Ross, a Nobel Prize winner, Sir Benjamin Franklin, later honorary physician to three British monarchs and Henry Vandyke Carter, best known for his illustrations in the anatomy textbook Gray's Anatomy. History The earliest positions for medical officers in the British East India Company (formed as the Association of Merchant Adventurers in 1599 and receiving the royal charter on the last day of 1600) were as ship surgeons. The first three surgeons to have served were John Banester on the Leicester, Lewis Attmer on the Edward and Rober on the Francis. The first Company fleet went out in 1600 with James Lancaster on the Red Dragon and three other ships, each with two surgeons and a barber.Crawford I:1-3 This was the voyage on which the serendipitous experiment on lemon juice as a cure for scurvy was carried out. The establishment of the East India Company in India was greatly aided by a doctor, although a lot of fiction may have been introduced into accounts relating to this. Gabriel Boughton is said to have saved Shah Jahan's daughter princess Jahanara from injuries due to burns. In reward he was given duty-free trading rights and this document was utilized by the East India Company to obtain a farman or rights for itself from the ruler in Surat.Crawford 1:37-57 As more factories of the East India Company were established in India at this time, new positions began to be created for the appointment of surgeons and physicians. These men of medicine included Nicholas Manucci, a Venetian born in 1639 who served Dara Shikoh before studying medicine in Lahore where he served Shah Alam from 1678-82. Later, he then settled in Madras. An Armenian named Sikandar Beg served as surgeon to Suleiman Shikoh, son of Darah Shikoh, and there are records of several Dutch and French physicians in various courts across India.Crawford 1:7-9 Samuel Browne served around 1694 at Fort St. George, Madras from where he also reported on his botanical and other natural history studies.Crawford 1:16 Jean Martin served Haider Ali and Jean Castarede served under Tipoo Sultan.Crawford 1:11-14 A hierarchy was introduced into the establishment of the East India Company in 1614 with the appointment of a surgeon general. The first to accept this position was John Woodall, who was however accused of embezzling pay from apprentices that he used to hire. With continuing complaints and financial crunch he was retrenched in 1642.Crawford 1:24-25 Another Surgeon Walter Chesley was sent home from service in Sumatra for drunkenness, while a Dr. Coote was removed from Bencoolen for debauchery in 1697.Crawford 1:34 Surgeons were often assigned on diplomatic missions to various courts and they were found to be very influential. The first surgeon at Calcutta was a Dutchman who resigned in 1691. William Hamilton was particularly famous.Crawford 1:116-127 John Zephaniah Holwell who came to Bengal as a Surgeon in 1732 was appointed as Zamindar of Calcutta. He was captured in 1756 by Siraj-ud-Daulah and survived the Black Hole. Holwell was noted as a careful student of native customs and it has been suggested that if he had been in charge of Fort William, the entire incident would not have happened. He returned to England and became as an advisor on various matters of government.Crawford 1:150-176 Surgeons were often spared in wartime. William Fullerton was the sole survivor in 1763 at Patna when the English fought Nawab Mir Qasim.Crawford 1:180-196 Later, around 1830, John Martin Honigberger from Transylvania served Ranjit Singh. He also worked at a hospital set up by Sir Henry Lawrence at Lahore.Crawford 1:15-16 Benjamin Simpson is particularly well known for capturing numerous photographs during his service in the second half of the 19th century. Later, in the nineteenth century, the IMS became one of the routes to becoming a Political officer in the Indian Political Department. Organization The first signs of organization began with the establishment of the Bengal Medical Service on 20 October 1763 with fixed grades, rules for promotion and service. Similar services were established by 1764 in both Madras and Bombay.Crawford 1:197-198 In Bengal increasing military actions required the separation of Military Surgeons from Civil Surgeons. Each non- native regiment had a surgeon and over time the strength of the Medical Service grew. The Bengal service had 382 in 1854 while Madras had 217 and Bombay 181.Crawford 1:201-222 For a while the military service also required combat service and upon promotion they could choose one branch either as Captain or Surgeon. The first Indian natives to join the service was Soorjo Coomar Goodeve Chuckerbutty who entered the service on 24 January 1855 followed by Rajendra Chandra Chandra on 27 January 1858. The Medical Services of the Madras, Bengal and Bombay Presidencies were united after 1857. Separate Medical Boards involved that recruited for the Presidencies were abolished on 12 November 1857. A single Indian Medical Service that separated from the civil medical service in 1858 was placed under a single Director General. =Ranks= Prior to the formation of the IMS in 1764, all medical officers in the employ of the East India Company were unranked. There were two grades of medical officer: *Head Surgeon *Surgeon From 1764, there were four primary ranks of medical officer. The Surgeon-General (at other times designated Physician-General or Chief Surgeon) headed the service from around 1769, while Head Surgeons, who ranked immediately below, nominally oversaw the main military hospitals in the subcontinent, though the exact scope of their authority remained vague. Below the Head Surgeons were Surgeons, followed by Hospital Mates. Sometime prior to 1785, Head Surgeons were redesignated Surgeon-Majors, with Hospital Mates becoming Assistant Surgeons. Apart from the Surgeon-General or his equivalent, all medical officers ranked with warrant officers. The rank of Surgeon-Major was apparently discontinued around 1785 and replaced by the former rank of Head Surgeon. In 1786, formal three- member Medical Boards were established, with one Board for each Presidency. On 24 October 1788, medical officers were reclassified as commissioned officers: *Surgeon-General/Physician-General/Chief Surgeon *Head Surgeons - ranking with Majors *Surgeons - ranking with Captains *Assistant Surgeons - ranking with Lieutenants In 1807, the rank of Superintending Surgeon was officially introduced, having been informally used since around 1803. Ranking above Head Surgeons (redesignated Senior Surgeons around this time), they supplanted them as professional administrators of military hospitals. Each army division was allotted a Superintending Surgeon. In 1842, the three positions on each Medical Board were ranked in order of seniority as Physician-General, Surgeon- General and Inspector-General of Hospitals, respectively. In 1843, the East India Company formalized equivalent military ranks for medical officers, as follows: *Physician-General/Surgeon-General/Inspector-General - ranking with Brigadier-Generals *Superintending Surgeons - ranking with Lieutenant-Colonels *Senior Surgeons - ranking with Majors *Surgeons - ranking with Captains *Assistant Surgeons - ranking with Lieutenants When the British government dissolved the East India Company in 1858 and asserted its rule over India, it abolished the Medical Boards and replaced the appointments of Physician- General and Surgeon-General with a single Director-General. Superintending Surgeons were also redesignated Deputy Inspectors-General at the same time. The ranks of the medical service thus became: *Director-General/Inspector- General - ranking with Brigadier-Generals *Deputy Inspectors-General - ranking with Lieutenant-Colonels *Senior Surgeons - ranking with Majors *Surgeons - ranking with Captains *Assistant Surgeons - ranking with Lieutenants In 1862, the rank of Director-General was briefly redesignated as Principal Inspector- General, but the former designation was restored in 1866, followed by the redesignation of Director-General as Inspector-General in 1869. A new ranking system was introduced in 1873: *Surgeon-General - ranking with Brigadier- Generals *Deputy Surgeons-General - ranking with Lieutenant-Colonels *Surgeons-Major - ranking with Majors *Surgeons (6+ years of service) - ranking with Captains *Surgeons (less than 6 years of service) - ranking with Lieutenants In 1880, the rank of Brigade Surgeon was introduced and all Surgeons regardless of their date of joining were ranked as Captains. The IMS ranks were then as follows: *Surgeon-General - ranking with Brigadier-General *Deputy Surgeons-General - ranking with Colonels *Brigade Surgeons - ranking with Lieutenant-Colonels *Surgeons-Major - ranking with Majors *Surgeons - ranking with Captains IMS officers were given formal military ranks for the first time in 1891, corresponding to those of their British Indian Army counterparts. The appointment of Surgeon-General was upgraded to that of a Major-General, with the title of Surgeon Major-General. The rank of Surgeon- Lieutenant was also introduced in 1891. In 1895, the head of the service was named its Director-General, holding the rank and appointment of a Surgeon- General (Surgeon Major-General). IMS military ranks retained the prefix of \\"Surgeon\\" until it was dropped in 1898.

France controlled Chad beginning in 1900 until the country's independence in 1960. Both nations are today members of the Francophonie and the United Nations.  History  =French Colonialism= Governor Félix Éboué and General Charles de Gaulle in Fort-Lamy (N'Djamena); 1940. During the Partition of Africa France entered the territory of Chad in the late 1890s. In April 1900, France fought against the warlord Rabih az-Zubayr and his forces to control the territory and succeeded in defeating Rabih's forces at the Battle of Kousséri. After the battle, France took control of the Chadian territory (Territoire du Tchad) and incorporated as a French colony under the federation of French Equatorial Africa in 1910.Encyclopedia Britannica: Chad - French Administration In January 1939, France appointed Félix Éboué as the first Governor of Chad and first black Governor of a French colony.Félix Éboué As Governor, Éboué would align the territory of Chad to Free France after German occupation of the country and German controlled Vichy France. In October 1940, Free French General Charles de Gaulle paid a visit to Chad and meet with Éboué in Fort-Lamy (present date N'Djamena). During World War II Chadian soldiers partook in the fighting for the Liberation of Paris. France also created two regiments during the war and named them after the territory (Régiment de marche du Tchad and Régiment de tirailleurs sénégalais du Tchad).L'Ambassade du Tchad à Paris: Histoire (in French) =Independence= Soon after the second World War, France adopted a new constitution in 1946 and granted full French citizenship to residents of French Chad and allowed for the establishment of local assemblies within the new French Union. In March 1953, De Gaulle paid a second visit to Chad. In 1958, Chadians voted in a referendum which granted them greater autonomy. As a result, the French Union dissolved and on 11 August 1960, Chad was granted independence from France. =Post Independence= France was Chad's most important foreign donor and patron for the first three decades following independence in 1960. At the end of the 1980s, economic ties were still strong, and France provided development assistance in the form of loans and grants. It was no longer Chad's leading customer for agricultural exports, but it continued to provide substantial military support. Chad remained a member of the African Financial Community (Communauté Financière Africaine—CFA), which linked the value of its currency, the CFA franc, to the French franc. French private and government investors owned a substantial portion of Chad's industrial and financial institutions, and the French treasury backed the Bank of Central African States (Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale—BEAC), which served as the central bank for Chad and six other member nations. Chad's dependence on France declined slightly during Habré's tenure as president, in part because other foreign donors and investors returned as the war subsided and also because increased rainfall since 1985 improved food production. French official attitudes toward Chad had changed from the 1970s policies under the leadership of Giscard d'Estaing to those of the Mitterrand era of the 1980s. Economic, political, and strategic goals, which had emphasized maintaining French influence in Africa, exploiting Chad's natural resources, and bolstering francophone Africa's status as a bulwark against the spread of Soviet influence, had been replaced by nominally anticolonialist attitudes. The election in France of the Socialist government in 1981 had coincided with conditions of near-anarchy in Chad, leading France's Socialist Party to reaffirm its ideological stance against high-profile intervention in Africa. Hoping to avoid a confrontation with Libya, another important client state in the region, President Mitterrand limited French military involvement to a defense of the region surrounding N'Djamena in 1983 and 1984. Then, gradually increasing its commitment to reinforce Habré's presidency, France once again increased its military activity in Chad. Chadian soldiers taking part in the military parade of Bastille Day; 2013. In 1990, France (along with Libya and Sudan) gave extensive support to the successful coup d'état attempt by Idriss Déby, who took the presidency from Hissene Habré. Since then, France has supported Déby from being ousted from office and they keep a military presence in the country. In November 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy paid a visit to Chad.Rencontre Deby-Sarkozy à N’Djamena (in French) In 2008, President Nicolas Sarkozy stated that France's relationship with Chad, since it was established in an era with a different political landscape, should be re-negotiated or ended.

He began his career in sales and became an innovator who offered finished clothing, which was unusual in an era when textiles were normally sold as unfinished cloth. Cone manufactured unusual textile fabrics and founded a company that became a leading manufacturer of denim. His company was a major supplier to Levi Strauss and Company for nearly a century.Moses H. Cone Memorial Park & Flat Top Manor (Milepost 294.1)Historic Blue Ridge sites - Moses Cone Manor Cone and his wife had no children and donated substantial property upon their deaths. Their home Flat Top Manor has become a North Carolina tourist attraction that receives 250,000 visitors a year. It forms part of Moses H. Cone Memorial Park, which is run by the National Park Service. Their donations founded the Moses Cone Health System, a private not-for-profit health care system based in Greensboro, North Carolina and its principal facility The Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital.  Early life  Moses Herman Cone was born in 1857 in Jonesborough, Tennessee. He was the eldest of thirteen children of Jewish-German immigrants. His parents, Herman Kahn and Helen Guggenheimer, emigrated from Germany to America in the 1840s. Moses' father changed his last name from Kahn to \\"Cone\\" almost immediately upon arrival in the United States to become more American.Noblitt, p. 4 Moses' father Herman had a dry goods and grocery business in Jonesborough along with his brother-in-law Jacob Adler, the husband of his sister Sophia. While running the business Herman and Jacob would alternately make week-long peddling trips selling their wares. On one of these trips Herman met Helen Guggenheimer near Lynchburg, Virginia. They married in 1856 and Moses was born in 1857. Two years later came their next child named Ceaser with whom Moses enjoyed a close relationship all his life.Noblitt, p. 5 The family lived in Jonesborough until 1870 and had an additional five children there. Between 1857 and 1870 Moses' father became fairly well-to-do through his business affairs and real estate ventures. The family then moved to Baltimore, Maryland. There Moses' father and relatives started a wholesale grocery business called Guggenheimer, Cone, & Company, Wholesale Grocers.Noblitt, p. 7 Then in 1873 Jacob Adler also moved to Baltimore and went in partnership with Herman selling groceries. They formed a new firm that was called Cone & Adler. They ran the business successfully and in 1878 dissolved it.Noblitt, p. 8 This same year Moses' parents had their last child.  Adult life  Moses and Ceasar, now as young adults, immediately formed a new firm with their father: H. Cone & Sons. Moses and his brother Ceasar were \\"drummers\\" (traveling salesmen) for their father's dry goods firm. They sold their wares from Maryland to Alabama. In the 1880s the Cones then moved to Eutaw Place in Baltimore, on the same street as the Lindau family. In 1884, Moses began to court Bertha Lindau, the eldest daughter. Moses and Bertha in all likelihood met at a community social club called the \\"Sociables.\\" Moses' and Bertha's courtship would last four years, during which time Bertha was also wooed by others, including Moses' own brother Ceasar.Wedge, Lucius. \\"Moses Herman Cone.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified February 24, 2015. Moses and Bertha were both from German Jewish descendants and had much in common. In addition, they both were firstborn children from large families. They married on February 15, 1888, and would have no children themselves.Noblitt, p. 9  Career  =Early years with textiles= Moses and Ceasar dealt much with textile mill owners in their travels as salesmen. They not only sold normal dry goods, but introduced into their wares ready-made clothing as well as certain fabrics like denim. This gave them experience then in textile products and the textile industry. The Cone brothers soon invested in Southern textile mills which generally had over a 20% return on average.Noblitt, p. 10 One of these companies the Cones invested into was C. E. Graham Manufacturing Company of Asheville, North Carolina, an up-and-coming newly formed textile mill. Moses became its president in 1882. The company's original builder Charles Edward Graham continued with its on-site management while Moses pursued other investments and ventures.Noblitt, p. 11 In 1880 Moses moved to Greensboro, North Carolina. Soon thereafter he joined Simon Lowman and Charles Burger to form Cone Brothers, Lowman, and Burger Clothing Manufacturers based in Baltimore. Moses discovered the need for durable clothing for the blue-collar people of the High Country and fulfilled this need with denim and plain, fabric-based clothing. =Cone Export & Commission Company= In 1890 Moses and Ceasar were contemplating even grander ventures and formed the Cone Export & Commission Company in New York City along with Anderson Price and Jay C. Guggenheimer as the other major stockholders. They developed what was called the \\"Plaid Trust\\" which was a commission clearing house to stabilize the production market on checks and plaids. They were a marketer of Southern cloth mill-goods to South America in competition with Great Britain. Initially the par value of the capital stock of their new company was fifty dollars per share. There were 20,000 shares of the company, so the value of this new firm was placed at one million dollars. Eventually they took in another forty mills over time to capture control of this market, but their ambitious goal was never fully achieved. In 1895 Moses purchased a defunct steel mill and developed it into a large cotton mill called Proximity that produced blue and brown denim. He built additional mills throughout the Greensboro area and the deep South and soon became one of the biggest producers of the denim fabric in the world.,Noblitt, p. 16 becoming known as \\"The Denim King\\" in the late nineteenth century.Noblitt, pp. 20-24 At the turn of the twentieth century he began supplying denim to Levi Strauss and Company, a relationship that the Greensboro firm retains to this day.The Mast Store Jean-ome Project Cone Mills Corporation was the world leader in the manufacturing of denim and largest supplier in the world.Inventory of the Cone Mills Corporation Records, 1858–1997 Moses was instrumental in the development of Watauga Academy, now known as Appalachian State University. In 1899, Moses donated $500 to the founders; it was the largest single donation received for the school's construction.Rhododendron, p. 18  Death  Moses died at age 51 in 1908 of pulmonary edema at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The grave of Moses Cone is on the Cone Estate property approximately a mile by trail from the manor. Widow and sisters His childless wife Bertha lived an additional 39 years and donated the Flat Top Mansion property to the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital. A few years later the hospital conveyed the property to the National Park System with the proviso that it be known as the Moses H. Cone Memorial Park. The Cone sisters, Claribel and Etta, were two of Moses' younger sisters. They befriended Picasso and Matisse while living amongst the School of Paris in its prime in Europe.

History =1960s= Under French and Italian colonial domination, respectively, Chad and Libya had diverged in orientation and development. But even after Chad's independence in 1960, many northerners still identified more closely with people in Libya than with the southern- dominated government in N'Djamena. After seizing power in 1969, Libyan head of state Muammar Gaddafi reasserted Libya's claim to the Aozou Strip, a 100,000-square-kilometer portion of northern Chad that included the small town of Aozou. Libya based its claim on one of several preindependence agreements regarding colonial boundaries, and it bolstered these claims by stationing troops in the Aozou Strip beginning in 1972. Gaddafi's desire to annex the Aozou Strip grew out of an array of concerns, including the region's reported mineral wealth, including uranium. He also hoped to establish a friendly government in Chad and to extend Islamic influence into the Sahel through Chad and Sudan.. Chad's president Hissène Habré was vigorously helped by the ex colonial power, France, which desired to put a limit on Libya's expansion projects in an area with close ties with Paris. French support included sending troops to combat the Libyans in Chadian territory. In doing so, France was politically backed by the United States, also concerned with the increasing expansionism of Gaddafi. A complex set of symbolic interests also underlay Libya's pursuit of territory and influence in the Sahel. Gaddafi's anticolonial and anti-imperialist rhetoric vacillated between attacks on the United States and a campaign focused on the postcolonial European presence in Africa. He hoped to weaken Chad's ties with the West and thereby reduce Africa's incorporation into the Western-dominated nation-state system. Forcing the revision of one of the colonially devised boundaries affirmed by the OAU in 1963 was a step in this direction—one that seemed possible in the context of the troubled nation of Chad, which OAU members dubbed the continent's \\"weakest link.\\" =1970s= Gaddafi attempted alliances with a number of antigovernment rebel leaders in Chad during the 1970s, including Goukouni, Siddick, Acyl Ahmat (a Chadian of Arab descent), and Kamougué, a southerner. Goukouni and Acyl were most sympathetic to Gaddafi's regional ambitions, but these two men clashed in 1979, leading Acyl to form the CDR. After Acyl's death in 1982, Libyan support swung strongly to Goukouni's GUNT. Libya intervened militarily in Chad in 1978 and 1979, starting the Chadian–Libyan conflict. =1980s= In 1980, Libya intervened again in Chad's civil war, occupying most of the country including the capital of N'Djamena in December. On 6 January 1981, a joint communiqué was issued in Tripoli by Libyan Brotherly Leader Gaddafi and Chadian rebel leader Goukouni that Libya and Chad had decided \\"to work to achieve full unity between the two countries\\". Faced with both strong international condemnation and internal opposition from Chadian rebels, Gaddafi and Goukouni backpedaled, and their relations soon deteriorated when Goukouni tried to accommodate international and internal pressure to end the Libyan military presence. Eventually, on 29 October Goukouni demanded the Libyan forces be retreated by the year's end, and surprisingly quickly Gaddafi complied and had withdrawn all Libyan troops to the Aouzou Strip by 16 November. The FAN rebel faction led by Hissène Habré rose to power and in 1982 ousted Goukouni from N'Djamena, forcing his GUNT faction back to the north. Habré was repelled by GUNT in December and January 1983, however, and eventually Gaddafi decided to support Goukouni's GUNT once more. A new Libyan intervention followed in June, though it was largely through material support of the GUNT offensive. France (under Operation Manta), the US and Zaire intervened on Habré's behalf and repulsed the Libyan- backed GUNT in late July. By mid-1988 Gaddafi appeared more willing to come to an agreement with Habré than to continue to support Gaddafi's fractious allies, who had suffered losses at Habré's hands. Chadian and Libyan foreign ministers met in August 1988, and the two governments agreed to further talks. At the same time, Libyan troops remained in the Aozou Strip. Steadily, relations among the two countries improved, with Gaddafi giving signs that he wanted to normalize relations with the Chadian government, to the point of recognizing that the war had been an error. In May 1988 the Libyan leader declared he would recognize Habré as the legitimate president of Chad \\"as a gift to Africa\\"; this led on 3 October to the resumption of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. The following year, on 31 August 1989, Chadian and Libyan representatives met in Algiers to negotiate the Framework Agreement on the Peaceful Settlement of the Territorial Dispute, by which Gaddafi agreed to discuss with Habré the Aouzou Strip and to bring the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for a binding ruling if bilateral talks failed. Therefore, after a year of inconclusive talks, the sides submitted in September 1990 the dispute to the ICJ.G. Simons, p. 58, 60S. Nolutshungu, p. 227M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 95 Chadian-Libyan relations were further ameliorated when Libyan-supported Idriss Déby unseated Habré on 2 December. Gaddafi was the first head of state to recognize the new regime, and he also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation on various levels; but regarding the Aouzou Strip Déby followed his predecessor, declaring that if necessary he would fight to keep the strip out of Libya's hands.M. Azevedo, p. 150 =1990s= The Aouzou dispute was concluded for good on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the ICJ by a majority of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing as early as 4 April an agreement concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April and was completed by 10 May. The formal and final transfer of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on 30 May, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.G. Simons, p. 78 =2000s= In October 2007, four rebel groups in Chad signed a peace deal with their country's government, with Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi hosting the talks. The presidents of Chad and Sudan were present to witness this as well. On 9 August 2009, teams of ministers from Chad and Libya agreed seven deals intended to increase measures relating to security and trade as well as improve political co-operation between the nations. Chadian Prime Minister Youssouf Saleh Abbas and Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi Mahmudi led the ministerial negotiations. Elsewhere and Chadian President Idriss Déby and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi came together on such as issues as saving the rapidly shrinking Lake Chad and working out how the African Union could become more involved in negotiating conflicts of African importance. In a further development, the Saif al-Islam Gaddafi-led Gaddafi International Foundation for Charitable Associations and Development, writing in the Oya newspaper, detailed further its intentions to resettle refugees from Chad in Libya and issued thanks to those who had assisted. =2010s= Since the Libyan Civil War in 2011, relations between the two nations have worsened.

To most people who travel the Parkway it is simply the Parkway Craft Center, which is the major component of the manor house. It is open to the public from spring through fall and gets over 225,000 visitors annually. History The mansion was built by Moses H.

In 1898 Moses announced he was going to build a mansion in Blowing Rock that cost $25,000 when $200 would buy a habitable home in the area.

Its generally paternalistic relations with Chad intensified after the coup that ousted President François Tombalbaye in 1975. After that, limiting Libyan expansion while avoiding direct clashes with Libyan troops also became important goals. Nigeria sponsored talks among Chad's rival factions in 1979 and promoted a little-known civil servant, Mahmat Shawa Lol, as a compromise head of a coalition government. Lol's perceived status as a Nigerian puppet contributed to mounting opposition during his short term as president in 1979. The two nations forged stronger ties during the 1980s. Hoping to benefit commercially and diplomatically by expanding regional trade relations, Nigeria replaced France as Chad's major source of export revenues. Bilateral trade agreements involved Chadian exports of livestock, dried fish, and chemicals and imports of Nigerian foodstuffs and manufactured goods. Both governments also recognized the potential value of the large informal trade sector across their borders, which neither country regulated. In addition, Nigerian industry and commerce employed several thousand Chadian workers. Both nations have seats on the United Nations Security Council. Chad's relationship with Nigeria was not without its strains, however. Beginning in the late 1970s, clashes occurred around Lake Chad, where both countries hoped to exploit oil reserves. Both also sought to defuse these confrontations, first by establishing joint patrols and a commission to demarcate the boundary across the lake more clearly. Then in the early 1980s, the low level of Lake Chad brought a series of tiny islands into view, leading to further disputes and disrupting long-standing informal trade networks. This relationship was also complicated by Nigeria's own instability in the north, generated by rising Islamic fundamentalism. Thousands of casualties occurred as the result of violent clashes in Nigeria throughout the 1980s. Most religious violence was domestic in origin, but Nigerian police arrested a few Libyans, and Nigerian apprehension of Libyan infiltration through Chad intensified. Nigeria's 1983 economic austerity campaign also produced strains with neighboring states, including Chad. Nigeria expelled several hundred thousand foreign workers, mostly from its oil industry, which faced drastic cuts as a result of declining world oil prices. At least 30,000 of those expelled were Chadians. Despite these strains, however, Nigerians had assisted in the halting process of achieving stability in Chad, and both nations reaffirmed their intention to maintain close ties.

Chad: A Country Study (Thomas Collelo, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (December 1988). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In recent times, relations have been strained due to the conflict in Darfur and a civil war in Chad, which both governments accuse the other of supporting. History Herdsmen have in both countries freely crossed the border for centuries. Muslims in eastern Chad often traveled through Sudan on the hajj, or annual pilgrimage to Mecca, and many young people from eastern Chad studied at Islamic schools in Pickens. In addition, Sudan's coffee plantations employed an estimated half a million Chadian workers in 1978. At the same time, the basis for political enmity between these two nations was set in the early 1960s, when Chad's southern bias in government offended many Sudanese Muslims. Sudan allowed FROLINAT rebels to organize, train, and establish bases in western Sudan and to conduct raids into Chad from Sudan's Darfur Province. Refugees from both countries fled across their mutual border. Following the coup that ousted Chadian President François Tombalbaye in 1975, relations between presidents Jaafar an Numayri and Félix Malloum (the Sudanese and Chadian heads of state, respectively) were surprisingly cordial, in part because both nations feared Libyan destabilization. Sudan sponsored talks among Chad's rebel army leaders in the late 1970s and urged Malloum to incorporate them into his government. (Numayri promoted the talents and intelligence of future Chadian president, Hissène Habré, in particular, and persuaded Malloum to appoint Habré to political office in 1978.) These ties were strained in part because of Numayri's warming relations with Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi. As violence in Chad increased between 1979 and 1982, Sudan faced its own internal rebellion, and relations deteriorated after Numayri was ousted in 1985. In 1988 Habré assailed Sudan for allowing Libyan troops to be stationed along Chad's border and for continuing to allow assaults on Chadian territory from Sudan. At the time of the Bashir coup in June 1989, western Darfur was being used as a battleground by troops loyal to the Chadian government of Hissène Habré and rebels organized by Idriss Déby and supported by Libya.Hooglund, Eric. \\"Foreign Relations: Chad\\". Sudan: A Country Study (Helen Chapin Metz, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (June 1991). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Deby was from the Zaghawa ethnic group that lived on both sides of the Chad-Sudan border, and the Zaghawa of Darfur provided him support and sanctuary. Hundreds of Zaghawa from Chad had also fled into Sudan to seek refuge from the fighting. The RCC-NS was not prepared for a confrontation with Chad, which was already providing assistance to the SPLM, and thus tended to turn a blind eye when Chadian forces crossed into Darfur in pursuit of the rebels. In May 1990, Chadian soldiers invaded the provincial capital of Al Fashir, where they rescued wounded comrades being held at a local hospital. During the summer, Chadian forces burned eighteen Sudanese villages and abducted 100 civilians. Deby's Patriotic Movement for Salvation (Mouvement Patriotique du Salut) provided arms to Sudanese Zaghawa and Arab militias, ostensibly so that they could protect themselves from Chadian forces. The militias, however, used the weapons against their own rivals, principally the ethnic Fur, and several hundred civilians were killed in civil strife during 1990. The government was relieved when Deby finally defeated Habré in December 1990. The new government in N'Djamena signaled its willingness for good relations with Sudan by closing down the SPLM office. Early in 1991, Bashir visited Chad for official talks with Deby on bilateral ties. Sudan’s border with Chad had a certain “Wild West” quality to it in the early 2000s. Neither government had firm control over territory its their jurisdiction. Both sides of the Chad border have served as a launching pad for Chadian rebels trying to overthrow the government in N’Djamena. There was always considerable movement across this border; the ethnic groups on each side being related. As recently as 2003, there were only about 13,000 Sudanese refugees in Chad and virtually no Chadian refugees in Sudan. As a result of the crisis in Darfur, the number of Sudanese refugees in Chad jumped to more than 250,000, and large numbers of Chadians took refuge in Sudan. The two governments signed a series of agreements on political cooperation and security along their border. Chadian president Idriss Déby, a Zaghawa who came from the Sudan border area, worked hard but without success to mediate an end to the dispute between the government in Khartoum and the Darfur rebel groups. Sudanese–Chadian relations significantly deteriorated in 2005 as both countries allowed their territory to be used for subversive activities against the other. Darfur and the situation along the border became part of a Zaghawa power struggle in Chad. Libya mediated the dispute and convinced Chad and Sudan to sign the Tripoli Declaration and Agreement of February 8, 2006. But an April 2006 attack by Chadian rebels against the Déby government in N’Djamena nearly toppled it. Déby accused Sudan of supporting the effort and broke diplomatic relations with Khartoum. By November 2006, Déby declared that Chad was in a state of war with Sudan. Following deadly clashes along the Sudan–Chad border in April 2007, Chad’s foreign minister said it was time to turn the page and improve relations with Sudan. The two countries set up a joint military committee to monitor the border and in May the two presidents signed a reconciliation accord in Saudi Arabia. By the beginning of 2008, however, relations had again deteriorated, with the leader of each country accusing the other of conducting cross-border attacks. In March 2008, launching from Chad, a number of JEM troops reached Omdurman on the outskirts of Khartoum. Sudan and Chad signed a non-aggression agreement March 13, 2008, aiming to halt cross-border hostilities.Chad, Sudan sign peace deal, CNN, March 13, 2008 On May 11, 2008 Sudan announced it was cutting diplomatic relations with Chad, claiming that it was helping rebels in Darfur to attack the Sudanese capital Khartoum.Sudan cuts Chad ties over attack, BBC, May 11, 2008 Six months later, in November 2008, relations continued. Further efforts by both Libya and Qatar to improve relations between the two produced a security agreement in late 2009 to control rebel movements from Chad into Sudan. In February 2010, Déby visited Khartoum where he and al-Bashir agreed to normalize relations. The first fruit of these developments was a framework agreement between Khartoum and the main JEM rebel group, signed in N’djamena on February 20, providing for a cease-fire and for further negotiations in Doha, Qatar. Al-Bashir then released more than half of the prisoners held since the JEM attack on Omdurman. In 2010 Chad refused permission for the leader of the JEM to land in N’Djamena. By late 2010, Sudan and Chad had normalized their relations, and Déby publicly stated his opposition to a North–South division of Sudan. Current status Sudanese-Chadian relationship improved dramatically after Chadian President Idriss Deby visited Khartoum on February 9, 2010.

The uprising was led by Leftist groups, the National Liberation Front - Bahrain calling for the end of the British presence in Bahrain and numerous notable individuals participated in the uprising, including Wa'ad political activist Ali Rabea. The uprising was sparked by the laying-off of hundreds of Bahraini workers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company on March 5, 1965. Several people died in the sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police. Background and main events The uprising started when students of Manama High School, which then was the only high school in Bahrain, protested against the laying-off of hundreds of workers at BAPCO (Bahrain Petroleum Company), however, the protest was quickly suppressed by the infantry. The news of the crackdown created a nationwide uprising which would last for a month. The uprising's motto was \\"Down down colonialism\\" (Arabic: يسقط يسقط الاستعمار) Published by the Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohammed Al Khalifa Centre for Culture and Research. =Role of Muharraq in the uprising= Muharraq was a strong center of protests. The opposition managed to control the city for a few days, however, security forces entered it after clashes with residents.

G. amansii is an important food source in East Asian countries and has been shown to have medicinal effects on dieting. Hence, in folklore medicine G. amansii is used to treat constipation. This algae is used to make agar, whose components are the polysaccharide agarose and agaropectin, from the large amount of algin which is located in the algae's cell wall, as well it is sometimes served as part of a salad, puddings, jams, and other culinary dishes in producing regions. Agar is a gelatinous substance that is commercially used as an incubation matrix for microbes and other products that require an ecologically friendly gelatinous matrix. G. amansii can be purple, red, to yellowish-red because it contains the class of pigments known as phycobiliprotein. Its branching body is cartilaginous and can grow up to a height of 8 to 30 cm or 3 to 12 in. G. amansii may have four or five opposite, compound-lobed, pinnate leaves on each branch. It is uniaxial with an apical cell and whorled cells coming from the axial towards the exterior of the algae.

Born in Dartmoor, England, he was known to have lived in London in 1791 and early 1792, but went to New York City in September of that year. He stayed in New York until 1811, conducting a theater orchestra and composing and arranging music for local ballad operas and musical events. He also gave lessons and sold musical instruments and publications in his \\"musical repository\\". He began participating in the musical activities of Boston as early as 1805, and moved there in 1811, pursuing the same activities as he had done in New York. For the rest of his life he traveled between the two cities. After an unsuccessful operation in New York in early 1827, he was brought back to Boston, where died a few months later. His place of burial is not known. Most of his publications were the works of British composers, including William Shield, James Hook and even Haydn and Mozart. He also published about 160 of his own works, including instrumental, keyboard, and vocal compositions. Like other American music teachers of the same era, he also produced several pedagogical books. One of his most well-known works today is The Battle of Trenton, a keyboard sonata written in 1797 and dedicated to George Washington. This sonata contains numerous short sections with descriptive titles, such as \\"The Army in Motion,\\" \\"Attack—Cannons—Bomb,\\" \\"Flight of the Hessians,\\" \\"Trumpets of Victory,\\" and so forth, including one section using the tune \\"Yankee Doodle.\\" When the harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick revived the piece in 1940, Time magazine commented that \\"Though written for the most part in the measured, tinkling idiom of 18th-Century English salon music, The Battle of Trenton still preserved a smoldering crash and rumble reminiscent of the early works of Ludwig van Beethoven.\\" The piece has been arranged for band and can be heard as performed by the Goldman Band on the album \\"Footlifters - A Century of American Marches.\\" It was also recorded by organist E. Power Biggs, who narrated his own performance. Hewitt was especially influential in musical life of New York in the early nineteenth century. Four of his children became prominent musicians: his son John Hill Hewitt (1801–1890) was an important composer, his daughter Sophia Henrietta Emma Hewitt (1799–1845) was a well known concert pianist, his son James Lang Hewitt (1803–53) was a successful music publisher (married to the poet, Mary E. Hewitt), and another son George Washington Hewitt (1811–93) taught and composed music. His niece was soprano Eliza Biscaccianti.

The winery is located in the Right Bank of France's Bordeaux wine region in the commune of Saint-Émilion, in the department Gironde. The estate also produces the second wine Tournelle de Beau-Séjour Bécot, as well as the \\"Vin de garage\\", La Gomerie. History Once a vineyard cultivated by the monks of the Church of St-Martin during the Middle Ages, in the 17th century it was acquired by the Gerès family, the land then named Peycoucou. By marriage the estate came to the de Carle family, seigneurs of Figeac, and in 1787 General Jacques de Carle renamed the property to Beauséjour. When the historic estate in its entirety came to Pierre-Paulin Ducarpe, it was divided in 1869 between his two children. The daughter wed Duffau-Lagarosse, received what became Château Beauséjour-Duffau-Lagarrosse (present day Château Beauséjour) and his son inherited the half which was sold in 1924 to Dr. Fagouet, altering the name to Château Beauséjour-Dr-Fagouet. The estate received its current name after it was acquired in 1969 by Michel Bécot who began extensive efforts to modernise. Michel Bécot retired in 1985, and the estate is to date run by the sons Gérard and Dominique Bécot. =Demotion= The INAO committee in charge revising the Classification of Saint-Émilion wine in 1985 demoted Château Beau-Séjour Bécot from Premier Grand Cru Classé to Grand Cru Classé, as Beau-Séjour Bécot had in 1979 incorporated two other vineyards into its estate, La Carte, owned by the Bécot family since 1929, and Trois Moulins. The vineyard area was increased by 85%, making only Château Pavie the larger estate in the area. The demotion was followed by unprecedented controversy. While no formal application to incorporate the amalgamated vineyards had been made, Beau-Séjour Bécot maintained there had been no loss in quality as demonstrated in formal wine tastings as stipulated by the Saint-Émilion AOC rules. The estate was promoted back to its previous classification at the following revision in 1996.J.

The sole species is Ammandra decasperma, although another species name has been proposed. They are a pinnate-leaved, dioecious palm whose seeds and petioles are used in button and basket making, respectively. It is commonly called ivory palm or cabecita. Description Ammandra decasperma grows in multi-headed clusters, the trunks usually remaining underground or prostrate upon it. Despite the negligible trunk size, the leaves reach over 6 m long, slightly arching, on 2 m petioles. The linear leaflets are dark green, 60–90 cm long, and emerge from the rachis in the same plane. In male plants the inflorescence is a long spike covered in short branches of white to yellow flowers, the female's being much shorter and more compact. The round fruit grows in clusters of 3-6 and is covered in pointed warts, each fruit containing six or more kidney shaped seeds.Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) Genera Palmarum - A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E. Moore. Lawrence, Kansas: Allen Press. / Taxonomy The type species described by Cook was Ammandra decasperma; a similar population was found being geographically separated and with minor flower differences and was designated A. dasyneura (Burret). In September 2001 Bernal et al. published the discovery of an Ammandra population located between the other two with floral characteristics represented in both groups. They, and other taxonomists since, concluded that the three populations were of a single species (see distribution map).Riffle, Robert L. and Craft, Paul (2003) An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms. Portland: Timber Press. / (Page 250) Separately, the only species in the closely related genus 'Aphandra, Aphandra natalia, was initially described as Ammandra natalia but was later given its own genus. The genus name translates from Greek to \\"sand man\\", because \\"The stamens are minute and have the appearance of small grains of sand scattered over the surface of the receptacles\\",Cook, O.F. (1927) New Genera and Species of Ivory Palms from Colombia Ecuador and Peru. in Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences. vol 27. p. 218 and the species epithet derives from two Latin words meaning \\"ten\\" and \\"seed\\", describing the maximum number of seeds per fruit. Distribution and habitat These palms grow in the foothills of the Andes mountains, along Colombia's west coast as well as inland Ecuador up to 450 m in elevation. In either case, they are an understory plant usually receiving only filtered light and nearly year-round rainfall. Cultivation and uses Ammandra is not common in cultivation outside its natural range but when grown requires wet and warm conditions resembling the rain forest and will not tolerate full sun when young. It also prefers free-draining, highly organic soil. In Colombia, their large, strong petioles are commonly woven into baskets and other thatched goods, while the large white seeds, commonly called \\"vegetable ivory\\", are carved into buttons and trinkets.

These were the Wesleyan Methodists, the Primitive Methodists, and the United Methodists. Various groups, which had separated from the Wesleyan Methodists since the death of John Wesley, decided to join the parent body. After 1932, the new body was known simply as The Methodist Church. To distinguish this from Methodism in other countries (chiefly the United States), it is now styled the Methodist Church of Great Britain. The various Methodist denominations Timeline of Methodist connexions in Britain The largest was the parent body, the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion, from which a number of offshoots had sprung. The Primitive Methodists were the second largest of these, having arisen in the first decade of the nineteenth century following the conversion of Hugh Bourne and a number of others in Staffordshire to the north of Stoke on Trent. They had sought to recover the early faith and practice of John Wesley at a time when the Wesleyans were hoping to become more respectable. Their return to Wesley's field preaching, notably in the form of Camp Meetings, did not suit the Wesleyans at that time, and Bourne was put out of membership along with several of his companions. Continuing their evangelism, they began the new group, a Connexion in Methodist terminology, in 1811, taking the name Primitive Methodists in 1812. The United Methodists were the other group involved in the 1932 union. This denomination was created by the United Methodist Church Act 1907, which united three existing organisations: the Methodist New Connexion (founded in 1797), the Bible Christian Church (formed in 1815), and the United Methodist Free Churches (formed in 1857).United Methodist Church Act, 1907 Hymn Book The Methodist Hymn Book As a part of the Methodist Union, a new volume, The Methodist Hymn Book, was compiled and published in 1933. This included 984 hymns drawn from the various merging groups, as well as a selection of the Psalms.The Methodist Hymn Book (1933) - Music Edition, accessed 21 April 2017 A separate version of the hymn book was also prepared for use in Australia and New Zealand, which appeared in 1935.Rumsey, D., The Three Doctrines of the 1933 Methodist Hymn Book, 1994, accessed 21 April 2017 Wesleyan Reform Union The Wesleyan Reform Union remains independent, and many of its members do not accept the description Methodist. They arose in the mid-nineteenth century, mainly in the Erewash Valley area of Derbyshire, and emphasise the early teachings of John Wesley. They also use a Methodist hymn book. One main difference from other Methodists is that every local congregation is autonomous, and cannot be dictated to by a central body. However, they are joined in a union for mutual support.

Vinterkyss is similar to the Danish film Brødre in that it paints a very real picture of what can happen to family members in the event of an unexpected death. The movie is about the pain and sorrow that occurs after a loved one's death, as well as how love can appear in the most unexpected of places, even if it is not wanted. The film shows, in an authentic and convincing way, the daily lives of the characters, as well as what it is like to live in a very small community in a very large world. Victoria (Annika Hallin) starts a new life as a doctor in small, snowy Norwegian town. The film is a story of Victoria's struggle to deal with the deaths of two people: one who was very close to her (her son) and the other very distant (a stranger). Early one winter morning, a young man is found dead in the snow. Victoria points out that the circumstances surrounding the death are unclear, but the police officer figures that the dead teenager must have been hit by the snow plow and then buried under the snow. The stories of the two deaths become intertwined as Victoria tries to unravel the mystery of Darjosh, the young man found dead in the snow. Although Darjosh's parents are very reluctant to deal with Victoria, as the movie progresses, they become closer. At the same time she begins a relationship with the town's snow plow driver, Kai.

In 1921 Grierson Jackson was founded followed two years later in 1923, by the founding of Simpson Coates & Clapshaw. In 1982 Grierson Jackson merged with Bruce Bornholdt's practice to form Grierson Bornholdt, acquiring a Wellington presence. The following year, 1983, saw Grierson Bornholdt and Simpson Coates & Clapshaw merge to create Simpson Grierson. Specialist fields include company law, commercial law, arbitration and construction and energy law. In 1985, Simpson Grierson and Butler White & Hanna merge to create Simpson Grierson Butler White.

Her isolated grave is a notable landmark, located on a hillside approximately 1.5 miles north of Selkirk at .Tibby Tamsons Grave, Canmore, Historic Environment Scotland  Death and burial Few facts are known about Thomson's life. There is a local tradition that Thomson, who lived in the Kirk Wynd in Selkirk, was a poor woman of weak intellectThe Border Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly, Volume 13 (1908), 178 who was treated with contempt in the town.\\"...the victim of religious despair...in a pious frenzy she took her own life...\\", 1913, \\"Highways and Byways in The Border Illustrated\\", Andrew Lang & John Lang She is said to have been accused of stealing a length of yarn, and was summoned to the sheriff court to face trial for the crime of petty theft. She took her own life and in common with others judged to have committed the crime of Felo de se her corpse was given to the burgh constable to be buried in unconsecrated ground.Garside, P.D. (editor). In At this period in Scotland as in England, suicides were often given a 'profane' burial unless family or friends were able to arrange interment secretly.Contrary to popular belief, in both countries 'profane' burial was not actually specified by law, which only specified forfeiture of a suicide's property, but was often carried out as a matter of custom. See Houston, R. (2010). Punishing the Dead?: Suicide, Lordship, and Community in Britain, 1500-1830, Oxford UP, p.211 Accordingly she was placed in a pauper's coffin of deal, which was dragged out of the town while her neighbours threw stones and insults, and was buried on Foulshiels Hill at the point where the Selkirk commonlands joined the estates of Bowhill and Philiphaugh. This practice of the burial of those guilty of Felo de se at the meeting of parish or estate boundaries was found elsewhere in rural Scotland, with a well-known fictional example in James Hogg's Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1823). Amongst other points, burial within boundary areas negated the issue of a community having to get permission from a landowner.Houston (2010) p.218 Remains of inscription: \\"I THOMSON / FS 1790\\" At some point after 1790 a rough stone was placed on the grave with \\"I H / I THOMSON / FS 1790\\" or \\"H.L.

In the woman's pocket he found one penny and one farthing.\\"Craig-Brown, T.

He was the first president of the Confederation of British Industry in 1965–66. Early life Laing was born in Carlisle, Cumberland, the younger son of Sir John Laing. The family were strict Christian Brethren. Laing's father had been running the family construction firm, John Laing & Son, since 1910, and Laing worked for the firm in his school holidays. The headquarters of the business moved from Carlisle to Mill Hill in 1926, and Laing was educated at St Lawrence College, Ramsgate. In 1935, aged 17, he began to work full-time with his father at the family firm. Meanwhile, his elder brother, Sir William Kirby Laing, studied engineering at Cambridge University. After working as a trainee, he began managing the construction of new airfields and barrage balloon stations in 1938. World War II Despite his reserved occupation, and against his father's wishes, he joined the RAF during the Second World War. He initially served in the ranks, and was a Leading Aircraftman when he was commissioned as a Pilot Officer, RAFVR on 30 October 1943; he was promoted Flying Officer in April 1944. His wife's poor health due to tuberculosis delayed his training, but he qualified as a pilot in South Africa, and flew the second British glider across the Rhine. Business career Laing returned to construction in 1945. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1953, and John Laing retired in 1957. Having climbed up the management structure of the firm, Maurice took the number 2 position in 1966, supporting his brother Kirby as chairman. The buildings and structures built by the firm ranged from the first 52 miles of the M1 – the first motorway in the UK – built in 1958 and 1959 to connect Watford and Rugby; through nuclear power stations; to the new Coventry Cathedral and London Central Mosque. Laing swapped positions with his brother in 1976, becoming chairman of the Laing Group. He separated the company's property division from its construction division, creating a separate company, Laing Properties, which was floated in 1978. He became the group's life president when he retired in 1982. Despite his opposition, the property company was taken over by P&O; in 1992. He was a member of the National Economic Development Council from 1962 until 1966, and was a director of the Bank of England from 1963 to 1980. He was the last president of the British Employers' Federation in 1964. Following its merger with the Federation of British Industries and National Association of British Manufacturers, Laing was the first president of their successor, the CBI, in 1965. He was knighted in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours. He was also a governor of the Administrative Staff College and of the National Institute of Social and Economic Research, and president of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. He was also president of the London Bible College. He enjoyed sailing in later life, regularly competing in the Fastnet race. He was rear- commodore and a trustee of the Royal Yacht Squadron, president of the Royal Yachting Association, and admiral of the Royal Ocean Racing Club and of the Island Sailing Club based in Cowes. Because of this love of sailing and yachting, Maurice Laing donated a sum of money to the Ocean Youth Club (later the Ocean Youth Trust) in 1990 to build a boat to help educate young people and disabled members of society in the fine art of yacht sailing. The subsequent boat was named John Laing after his father and is still taking on young people to teach, while also participating in many Tall Ship's Races, a two-year round the world voyage and a 5-month British Army expedition to the Antarctic. Personal life Laing married Hilda Richards in March 1940. He was survived by his wife and their son, John, who runs the Rufford Foundation, a private grant-making organisation.

Terry's son, Mike Schrunk, was elected district attorney of Multnomah County in 1981, and is thought to be the longest-serving district attorney in Oregon history. Mayor Terry Schrunk Plaza in Portland, Oregon. In mid- twentieth-century Portland, gambling dens, brothels, and unlicensed bars operated virtually uninhibited by police as long as vice racketeers paid scheduled kickbacks to key city law enforcement officials. Schrunk was elected mayor with Teamsters union support, allegedly in part because the incumbent Republican mayor, Fred Peterson, offended the union when he wouldn't oust Police chief J. Bardell Purcell. The Teamsters felt that Purcell impeded their drive to open a wider vice business in Portland. In 1957 he appeared as himself in the CBS documentary film A Day Called X and on September 2nd of that year, as reported by the Oregonian on its September 4th 1957 edition, was seen in the front seat of a Lincoln convertible as he and the then biggest star in the world of music, the 22 year old Elvis Presley saluted the 14,600 fans awaiting for his concert to start at Providence Park (known at that time as Multnomah Stadium). An allegation against Mayor Schrunk soon landed him before the special Senate committee headed by Arkansas Democrat John McClellan investigating U.S. labor racketeering in March 1957. While still sheriff in September 1955, Schrunk and his deputies had raided the 8212 Club, a gambling and after-hours drinking joint financed by Portland Racketeer James B. Elkins. Elkins testified that the manager, Clifford Bennett, told him he had paid Schrunk $500, and the sheriff had gone away without causing any more trouble—except for arresting a few drunks. Although Bennett refused to testify, several others confirmed pieces of the story. Schrunk flatly denied having taken bribes from Bennett. But he did admit that his deputies had raided the 8212 Club, seen liquor being illegally served after hours, spotted gambling equipment all over the place—and that he had gone away without taking further action. Robert Kennedy, then the lead attorney for the Senate committee, came to Portland to testify against him. Jurors acquitted Schrunk in less than two hours. Three years later, Kennedy was managing his brother, Senator John F. Kennedy's, presidential campaign, with Oregon one of seven primaries that JFK entered. Kennedy's pursuit of Schrunk had angered enough Oregon Democrats that some of JFK's key supporters persuaded Kennedy operative Joseph S. Miller to ask Senator Kennedy to keep his younger brother out of Oregon. Although JFK largely accepted the advice, Miller's bluntness angered both brothers.Miller, Joseph S. (2008)The Wicked Wine of Democracy, University of WA Press, pp 131-132. Continued resentment by Schrunk and his supporters was seen as a contributing factor to Robert Kennedy losing the Oregon Democratic Primary to Eugene McCarthy in May 1968. Schrunk suffered a heart attack in October 1972 while at City Hall and was taken to the hospital where he survived. Schrunk died after suffering another heart attack in 1975, less than a week before his 62nd birthday.

LCS 2005 was first released in 2005, and was updated with new features with Service Pack 1 in 2006. LCS 2005 has been superseded by Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007. Overview This product allows SIP clients to exchange IMs and presence using the SIMPLE protocol. The client also allows two clients to set up audio/video sessions, application sharing, and file transfer sessions. The product was released in two editions, Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition. The Standard Edition uses a Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine (MSDE) (included with the product) to store configuration and user data. Enterprise Edition uses a full version of Microsoft SQL Server (purchased separately). New features to this version compared to the 2003 release is the ability to leverage SQL and remote user access. Presence is conveyed as levels of availability to communicate. Levels of presence support by LCS: *Online *Busy *Do not disturb *Be right back *Away *In a Meeting These presence levels are controlled manually and automatically. Automatic presence changes can be triggered by the following events: *Locking the workstation -> Away *Screen save launches -> Away *User does not touch keyboard or mouse for a configured time -> Away *User is in full screen mode -> Do not disturb *A user is busy, according to the user's calendar on the Microsoft Exchange Server -> In a meeting Dependencies *Microsoft Active Directory **Storage of server configuration data **Authentication ***Kerberos ***NTLM *PKI **MTLS - used for server to server connections **TLS - optionally used for client to server connections *Microsoft SQL Server **Storage of server configuration data **User contact list **User watcher list Client Software *Microsoft Office Communicator 2005 *Windows Messenger Server Roles Both editions of the server software can be installed into several distinct roles: *Home Server *Director *Access Proxy *Branch Office Proxy *Application Proxy Home Server In Standard Edition, this server role is designed to host data for the users. The user's data is stored in an SQL database on the backend server (on Enterprise Edition) or on the Home Server (on Standard Edition). The server stores each user's list of contacts and watchers. The contact list is the list of users the end user has added to client software in order to facilitate the sending of IM's and for the monitoring the presence. The watcher list is the list of other users that have added this user to their contact list. Director This optional server role is designed to be a kind of traffic cop when you have more than one Home Server role deployed or when you are setting up for remote users to connect to the Home Server. This server does not host any of the user's data, but knows which server each user is homed on, and can therefore redirect or proxy the request. Access Proxy This server role is required to allow remote SIP clients to connect from the internet. This server role would be traditionally deployed in a DMZ network. The server's job would be to scan the SIP traffic and only allow communication that the server had been configured to allow to traverse to the internal network. The traffic would be sent either directly to the internal Home Server or to a Director that would send the traffic to the appropriate home server, based on the user the message was destined to. Branch Office Proxy This role is used to aggregate connections, from a branch office clients, across a single Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypted link, allowing many remote clients to share a single communication channel. Application Proxy This server role is designed to allow 3rd party developers to leverage the Live Communications Server SIP stack with a custom code running on top of it. This allows 3rd parties to make a gateway server that could be used to communicate with a PBX or other internal telephony infrastructure without having to create a fully functioning SIP stack. Public IM Connectivity (PIC) This is a feature that allows organizations to IM and share presence information between their existing base of Live Communications Server-enabled users and contacts using public IM services provided by MSN, AOL and Yahoo!. This was feature was introduced with LCS 2005 Service Pack 1 in April 2005.

The three men now appear as motivational speakers known as The Three Doctors. Summary Sampson, George, and Rameck could easily have followed their childhood friends into drug dealing, gangs, and prison. Like their peers, they came from poor, single-parent homes in urban neighborhoods where survival, not scholastic success, was the priority. When the three boys met in a magnet high school in Newark, they recognized each other as kindred sprits that wanted to overcome the incredible odds against them and reach for opportunity. They made a friendship pact, deciding together to take on the biggest challenge of their lives: attending college and then medical and dental schools. Along the way they made mistakes and faced disappointments, but by working hard, finding the right mentors, separating themselves from negative influences, and supporting each other, they achieved their goals–and more. Based on the book The Pact, the film chronicles the true life story of Rameck Hunt, Sampson Davis, and George Jenkins, who made a pact in their inner-city high-school in Newark, New Jersey, to find a way to go to college and then medical school. The documentary follows the three doctors as they navigate the minefields of their community work, struggling with exhausting shifts at the hospital, and wrestle with their own painful childhood memories while they spread the word to inspire other inner-city children to stay out of gangs and use education to escape from their urban streets. The narrator of the film, 12-year-old Malique Bazemore, is a Newark resident whom the doctors have taken under their wing. Bazemore lives with his mother and younger sister, who suffers from a rare, deforming neurological disorder. His father abandoned the family when his sister was born. Bazemore accidentally got involved in the film and became one of its central characters. Background The three future doctors forged a strong friendship at Newark’s University High School. During junior year, they vowed to change their lives, stay in school and become doctors, hence the making of \\"the pact\\" their promise of commitment and support to each other. According to Davis, \\"the pact\\" was an informal agreement the three made as high school juniors when, cutting class one day, they escaped into the school library to avoid being caught by a security guard. A recruiter from the Seton Hall was giving a talk about the university's Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Plus Program designed for minorities interested in careers in medicine. The three agreed to apply to the program, and to go on to medical school if accepted. The three overcame staggering statistics. The high school dropout rate in Newark is more than 50 percent. Homicide ranks as the leading cause of death of African American under the age of 24. One out of three blacks is involved with the criminal justice system. All three ultimately graduated from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.Smith, Faye McDonald, “Men in White,” National Medical Association News, Summer 2005 Today, they practice medicine in the same city where they grew up. Davis works in emergency medicine at Newark’s Beth Israel Hospital, the same medical facility where he was born. Hunt is an internist, and Jenkins is a dentist who recently became the director of minority affairs at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.Kane, Gregory, “Film Shows Kids a Way Up and Out of the Street,” The Baltimore Sun, December 20, 2006 Andrea Kalin, the film’s director, was attracted to the compelling story of individuals who transcended adverse circumstances. \\"In our society, we're obsessed with people known for their fame and beauty, not for their characters,\\" says Kalin. \\"But there are real heroes. These are both men and doctors who can teach us how to face inevitable obstacles with courage.\\"Smith, Faye McDonald, “Men in White,” National Medical Association News, Summer 2005. Reception Before its airing on public television, many predicted that the film \\"will do as much, if not more, to influence the aspirations of young men than the rap game, professional sports or street culture ever could.\\" John- Hall, Annette. “Maligning Black Men,” The Philadelphia Inquirer, December 13, 2006 A number of organizations throughout the country included the documentary as part of their different outreach projects to keep kids out of gangs and in school. In Florida the People For the American Way Foundation used it for their Message Project, a series of education forums for urban youth and young professionals.Paul, Nathanael, “Kids Benefit From Seeing The Pact,” The Miami Times, August 9–15, 2006 Three organizations arranged for different groups of Baltimore boys to view The Pact. Richard Rowe of the African American Male Leadership Institute, David Miller and LaMarr Darnell Shields of the Urban Leadership Institute, and Imam Earl El-Amin, co-host with Rowe of the radio show Dialogue with the African American Male on WEAA thought the message in The Pact was so powerful that the film warranted a third showing in Baltimore.

History The quartet was founded in 1978 by Daniël Brüggen, Bertho Driever, Paul Leenhouts and Karel van Steenhoven, four students of Frans Brüggen at the Sweelinck Conservatory Amsterdam. Following its formation, the ensemble's reputation grew quickly and was further strengthened at the 1981 Musica Antiqua Bruges competition where, challenging the competition rules, it performed an unusual arrangement of a Stevie Wonder song and emerged with second prize. The long name of the group is explained in the following: :The quartet was founded in Amsterdam, hence Amsterdam and Quartet. LOEKI was the name of a little lion-puppet on Dutch television who appeared in between commercials with a short funny act. The appearance of the lion was always accompanied by a short melody, which everyone in Holland knew and could whistle. We arranged this melody for four recorders and played it as a joke in a concert. Hence Loeki. STAR was the name of the company which broadcast the commercials, hence Stardust (we liked the dust). The Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet has enjoyed an international career and are recognized as a serious ensemble of unparalleled virtuosity. They have appeared at many early music festivals including those in Berlin, Utrecht, London and Sapporo, and regularly tour throughout Europe, the USA and Japan. They also perform separate from festivals in concert halls. In 1998, 2001, 2004, 2009, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands requested the quartet to perform for her during official festivities. Since its formation, the quartet has continually explored the boundaries of the recorder consort, playing a mix of recorder music from all ages of music, especially from the Renaissance, Baroque and twentieth-century. A number of composers have been inspired to write for the Quartet, which has helped create a new repertoire that proves the recorder to be an important voice of our time. A few years ago, both Bertho Driever and Paul Leenhouts left Loeki Stardust in order to pursue other careers in music. They were replaced by Daniel Koschitzki and Andrea Ritter. After internal struggle, it was decided to end the ensemble which led to a farewell concert in November 2007. After seeing each other in private, the four founding members of the group decided to regroup in order to celebrate their 30th anniversary in 2008, but not to make plans after that since they do not wish to re-establish an ensemble. At present, about 50 concerts are planned all over the world.  Recorded music  The Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet has made a wide range of recordings on CD of recorder music throughout the ages. Two of them were awarded with an Edison Award. * The Loeki Files (2008) * Fade Control (2007) * Nocturne (2005) * Fugue around the clock (2003) * Fantazia (2001) * Time Signals (2001) * Die Kunst der Fuge (1998) * Dutch Masters volume 40 (1998) * Pictured Air (1995) * The Image of Melancolly (1991) * Extra Time (1991) * Italian Recorder Music (1991) * Baroque Recorder Music (1987) * Virtuoso Recorder Music (1985) * La Spagna * Consort Songs * Concerti di Flauti * Capriccio di Flauti * A Concorde of Sweete Sound * Alte Musik im Linzer Schloß References Further reading *  External links  * Loeki Stardust at Youtube Musical groups established in 1978 Dutch recorder players Musical quartets Musical groups from Amsterdam 1978 establishments in the Netherlands ","title":"Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet"},{"id":"16011436","text":"Saint Clateus (died 64 AD) was an early Christian martyr.

Eyston.  Records held  Between 1937 and 1939, the competition for the Land Speed Record was between two Englishmen: Captain Eyston and John Cobb. Thunderbolt's first record was set at on 19 November 1937 on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Within a year Thunderbolt returned with improved aerodynamics and raised its record to on 27 August 1938. This record only stood for a matter of weeks before John Cobb's Reid-Railton broke the barrier and raised it to on 15 September 1938, as Eyston watched. This inspired him to take Thunderbolt to a new record of . Cobb had held the record for less than 24 hours. Eyston and Thunderbolt held the record for almost a year, until Cobb took it again at a speed of on 23 August 1939. This was the last record attempt before the outbreak of the Second World War. Although Cobb returned after the war and further developed his car to exceed , Thunderbolt never attempted the record again.  Design  The leading Land Speed Record cars of the period had taken two approaches to obtaining power; using either the latest and most sophisticated aero-engines available or combining multiple engines. Thunderbolt used both techniques to produce an unprecedentedly powerful car. In its day, terms like \\"leviathan\\" and \\"behemoth\\" were commonly used to describe the 7-ton car, over twice the weight of its competitors. The engines were a pair of Rolls-Royce R-type V-12 aero engines, as previously used singly in Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird of 1933. In fact, one of Eyston's spare engines for the record attempts was on loan from Campbell. There were so few of these engines built (around 20) that many of them had illustrious careers over several different records. One of the Thunderbolt's had already powered the Schneider Trophy winner. Each engine was of 36.5 litres capacity, supercharged, and had an individual output power of . Handling all this power through a single driven axle required great innovation in metallurgy and in manufacturing the geartrain, as well as water-cooling the completed transmission. The chassis and bodyshell were built at the Bean works in Tipton. (commercial photo gallery) There were three axles and eight tyres. The two leading axles steered and were of different track, so that each tyre ran on a clean surface rather than following a rut. The driven rear axle used twin tyres to reduce the load on them, a technique already used by Bluebird. Separate panels of polished silver Birmabright, a new aluminium alloy, clad the chassis. The body never had the aerodynamic refinement of the Railton Special and was distinctly blocky in appearance. At the rear was a large triangular tailfin, flanked by a pair of hydraulically activated air brakes. includes some images of Thunderbolt = Design changes = When first built there was a large eight-sided cooling air intake at the front, replaced by a smaller oval intake for the 1938 season. Another improvement for this second attempt was to paint a matt black arrow onto the side of the car. During the first attempts, the new photo-electric timing equipment had failed to detect the polished aluminium car body against the brilliant white salt. For the 1939 attempts, the streamlining was increased further. Cooling was now by a tank of melting ice rather than a radiator (as used first by Golden Arrow). A rounded nose now filled the previous radiator air intake and the stabilising fin was removed, all leading to an appearance more like Cobb's Railton.  Thunderbolt today  Thunderbolt was displayed in the British Pavilion at the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition in 1939-40, it also toured New Zealand during the Second World War, but is thought to have been destroyed by a fire in a Rongotai warehouse.

Smith founded the Lab School for children with learning difficulties in 1967.The Lab School She was also a professor in the School of Education and the Head of the Graduate Program in Special Education at the American University until the time of her death. Life =Early years= Smith was born in New York City to Isaac and Bertha Liberman on Tuesday May 7, 1929. She was the youngest of four daughters and grew up in New York. Her father, Isaac, was the president of a department store, Arnold Constable and Co. =Education= In 1950 Smith graduated from Bennington College in Vermont – at the time an all women's institution. At Bennington, Smith studied dance under acclaimed modern dancer, Martha Graham. Smith also studied under Erich Fromm in the area of psychoanalytics.Sally Smith, 78; Lab School Founder - washingtonpost.com Her first published book was born under Fromm's guidance: A Child's Guide to a Parent's Mind, 1951. Smith subsequently received a master's degree in Education from New York University in 1955. Smith then became a professor at the School of Education at the American University and ran the Masters Program focused on learning disabilities. =Professional life= After receiving her master's degree, Smith worked for the World Health Organization and lived abroad, moving with Robert Smith who was in the Foreign Service. While traveling, she wrote her second book: Nobody Said It's Easy: Can the Years Between 13 and 19 Be the Best Year's of a Child's Life?, 1965. In 1967, when Smith's youngest son, Gary, was in first grade, Smith discovered the extent of Gary's learning disabilities that were hindering him from excelling in school in the same way as his peers. Motivated by the lack of services for children like Gary, Smith started the Lab School with a few children from her neighborhood. Smith observed her son's interaction and progress during the themed birthday parties she would throw. She used this idea and technique to create an interactive classroom. The Academic Club Method was created by Smith during the first years of the Lab School as more and more parents enrolled their children at the school.. As Smith became the director of the Lab School, she also took on the role of professor and head of the Learning Disabilities Masters program at the American University in Washington. In 1983, the Lab School moved to a more permanent residence and the success gave birth to a fund raising campaign in 1984 connecting famous figures with learning disabilities to supporting the school's efforts. In 2000, another campus of the Lab School opened in Baltimore to accommodate the growing interest of parents with learning disabled children. Smith established the Academic Club Teaching Service (ACTS) in 2005 to train educators at other intuitions in the Academic Club Method. Philosophy Sally Smith held a strong belief in the ability of all children to learn and discover their talents, believing that traditional education reaches a certain sector of the population but innovative methods are needed to help unlock the talent within children with learning abilities outside of that spectrum. The Lab School model uses art-infused academic coursework in such a way as to address the specific neurological passageways in the brains of students with learning disabilities. Smith found that often these children have a higher I.Q. than their peers and, thus, require stimulation for critical thinking and logic- based approaches to learning. Smith also believed highly in the importance of enjoyment in the learning process and often spoke of the joy expressed by her students in coming to the Lab School. Publications Sally Smith authored ten books, numerous articles, and appeared in several videos on the Lab School and teaching methods for students with learning disabilities. =Books= *A Child's Guide to a Parent's Mind – Schuman, 1951 *Nobody Said It's Easy: Can the Years Between 13 and 19 Be the Best Years of a Child's Life? – The Macmillan Company, 1965 *Succeeding Against the Odds: How the Learning- Disabled Child Can Realize Their Promise – Tarcher/Perigee, 1993 *Different Is Not Bad, Different Is the World: A Book About Disabilities – Sopris West, 1994 *No Easy Answers: The Learning Disabled Child At Home and At School – Bantam new edition February, 1995 and Sin Respuestas Simples: El Niño con Problemas de Aprendizaje En El Hogar Y En La Escuela – Editorial Plaza Mayor, Inc., 1999 *The Power of the Arts: Creative Strategies for Teaching Exceptional Learners – Paul H Brookes Publishing, 2001 *Live It, Learn It: The Academic Club Methodology For Students With Learning Disabilities and ADHD – Brookes Publishing, 2005 =Articles= *\\"What Do Parents of Children with Learning Disabilities, ADHD, and Related Disorders Deal With?\\" – Pediatric Nursing, May/June 2002 issue *\\"Learning Disabilities\\" – Encyclopædia Britannica, 1985 Medical and Health Annual =Video= *Teach Me Different – PBS series, 2002 *Lab School: Sally Smith – Today Show, 2007 Smith was also featured in numerous publications: *Creativity and Learning Disabilities – National Center for Learning Disabilities (NCLD), 2002 *Extraordinary Women: Fantasies Revealed 58 Women of Accomplishment Portray Hidden Dreams and Real Hopes – Stewart, Tobari, and Chang, 2005 *Teaching, Schools, and Society (8th Edition) – David Miller Sadker, Myra Pollack Sadker, Karen R.

Later in 1990, Riggi was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. However, that same year, Vastola went to federal prison on a 20-year sentence on extortion charges. Riggi replaced Vastola with D'Amato as acting boss. D'Amato murder In January 1992, Capo participated in the murder of acting boss D'Amato. Earlier in 1991, D'Amato's girlfriend, retaliating against D'Amato over an argument, told Rotondo that D'Amato was an active bisexual. She described swinging encounters that D'Amato had in Manhattan sex clubs with both women and men. Rotondo shared this information with underboss Giacomo Amari, and consigliere Stefano Vitabile.

The three men ordered D'Amato's execution and gave the job to Capo, Vincent Palermo, and James Gallo. In contravention of Cosa Nostra rules on the killing of a family boss, the plotters did not ask permission to kill D'Amato from the Mafia Commission in New York. On the day of the attack, D'Amato, Capo and the other two hitmen entered D'Amato's car to drive to lunch. Sitting in the back seat, Capo shot D'Amato four times, killing him. Capo and Rotundo left the body at a safe house, where other mobsters disposed of it. D'Amato's body was never recovered.

Ormoceras is a characterized by its straight shell, more or less circular in cross section, and a relatively narrow subcentral siphuncle composed of globular segments in which the radial canals in the endosiphuncular canal system are straight and normal to the central canal. Septal necks are short, narrowly rounded or sharply recurved, but never recumbent. As with most actinocerids, cameral deposits are common. Ormoceras is derived from Adamsoceras which has a siphuncle with the same general form but in which the canal system is reticulate as in Wutinoceras. Ormoceras gave rise to Deiroceras early on during the Mohawkian (Middle Ordovician) and slightly later to Troedssonoceras.

The watershed is also home to some of the West Coast's most imperiled species, such as coho salmon (Oncorhyncus kisutch), steelhead trout (O. mykiss), northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), and the California red-legged frog (Rana aurora draytonii).“The Watershed.” Redwood Creek Watershed: Vision for the Future The Redwood Creek watershed is 95% public lands and holds Muir Woods National Monument, as well as the communities of Muir Beach and Green Gulch Farm. An indication of its ecological value is that the watershed is one of 25 global biodiversity \\"hot spots\\" recognized by the Nature Conservancy and targeted by the global conservation community as key to preserving the world's ecosystem Stein, B.A., L.S. Kutner, and J.S. Adams, eds. Precious Heritage: The Status of Biodiversity in the United States. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2000. It is also within the Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve, one of 411 reserves designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) \\"Man and the Biosphere\\" Program to provide a global network representing the world's major ecosystem types.UNESCO. \\"UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB)\\". People, Biodiversity and Ecology. February 2, 2008. Function The Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy runs five native plant nurseries, which have three main goals: # Produce high quality container plants for park restoration from local seeds. # Create and foster a volunteer program. # Educate community members about concepts of community, ecology, and horticulture. Redwood Creek Nursery began over 20 years ago, returning native plant communities to trampled areas on the \\"floor\\" of Muir Woods. In 1997, the Parks Conservancy began providing professional support in nursery management and restoration through a financial partnership with the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Since that time, the nursery facility has been upgraded and made more ecologically sensitive. More than 80,000 plants have been grown from seed collected in the Redwood Creek watershed. These have then been planted into the watershed, from the upper slopes of Muir Woods to the mouth of Redwood Creek at Muir Beach. Recent Restoration Projects Old Road Removal: It is a priority of the National Park Service to remove roads and pavement wherever possible. Just such a project was accomplished in Muir Woods. By removing a redundant access road to park residences, over an acre of redwood understory habitat was restored. Muir Woods Trail Decompaction: Until the 1920s, visitors could drive their cars into Muir Woods, and it wasn't until the 1950s that trails began to be officially established in the park. Unrestricted driving and hiking killed most of the understory plants; they also compacted the soil, making it difficult for those species to return on their own. Using hand tools, areas are being decompacted and native plant species reintroduced, helping to restore the Muir Woods plant community. Lower Redwood Creek Floodplain and Salmon Habitat Enhancement (Banducci): During the last hundred years, farmers and ranchers channelized sections of Redwood Creek and filled in adjoining wetlands. The National Park Service bought out one farm in 1986 and, in 2003, began to restore the creek and its floodplain. Redwood Creek provides the southernmost habitat for the federally listed Coho salmon and Steelhead. Restoring stream processes and revegetation of the stream corridor will provide more useful habitat for these and other species, such as migratory songbirds. Easkoot Creek: This creek in the Stinson Beach watershed and is also home to the federally listed Coho salmon. The Redwood Creek nursery assists in collecting the seed and growing the native plants which are used in the restoration of this creek.

She made a significant contribution to the 1948 master plan for Nairobi and also took a leading role in planning Mombasa and other parts of Kenya. She became interested in development projects seeking to improve living standards and was director of the Women in Kibwezi project, which was recognised at the United Nations Habitat II conference in 1996. The \\"Woman in Kibwezi\\" project was but one of several NGO's she headed across Kenya, many of them engaged in fostering women's cooperatives. In 2003 she was honoured with the title of Architect Laureate for Kenya.  Personal life  She was born Erika Schoenbaum in Vienna in 1917 and grew up in Romania where she went to school in Bucharest before studying architecture at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris. She married her husband Igor Mann a few weeks after meeting him and falling in love.Rhodia Mann, 'Courage and hard work that left an indelible mark', The Nation, 1 Sep 2013 He was a Polish veterinarian who had had to leave his homeland when it was invaded by Nazi Germany. In late 1940 the Manns, who were both secular Jews,Betty Caplan, 'A Woman of Substance', The East African, 17 July 2007 escaped across the Danube to safety, travelling east and south via Palestine and Egypt before spending some months in a British-run refugee camp in Northern Rhodesia. In 1942 they moved to Kenya, then under British rule, and made their lives there. They became UK citizens in 1948, although Mann did not always feel welcomed by the British expatriate community in Kenya.Rachel Lee, 'Erica Mann and an Intimate Source', Abe Journal, April 2013 She and her husband became known for hosting \\"open house\\" afternoons where they welcomed guests of all ethnicities: colleagues, artists, politicians and other people from the \\"intelligentsia\\". They had three children.  Career  Not long after she settled in Kenya, the colonial administration set up a town planning department in Nairobi. Mann applied to join it and worked on the 1948 master plan for the city. Although some aspects of the original plan still exist, like the suburbs of Jericho and Ofafa designed by Mann, she said in the 1990s that Nairobi was not the city she and her colleagues had planned, although she did plan some of the broad boulevards.Benjamin Tiven, 'On The Delight of the Yearner: Ernst May and Erica Mann in Nairobi', Kenya, 1933–1953, Journal of Contemporary African Art, Spring 2013 She was soon recognised as a talented and committed urban planner and became the senior planning and development officer for many major projects, in charge of researching and evidence gathering for strategic planning decisions. She was attracted by the ideas of the \\"Ekistics\\" movement which encouraged a holistic approach to planning harmonious human settlements. Mann was interested in traditional African house designs, repudiating any idea that they were \\"primitive\\", and wrote and lectured on the subject. She saw urban planning as \\"an ideal profession for a woman because it builds on her innate capacity for providing an orderly and aesthetic environment for herself, her family and the community in which she lives\\". She kept in touch with the ideas of architects and thinkers across the world and promoted the work of \\"ecological\\" and innovative architects in the magazines she founded: Build Kenya and Plan East Africa. In 1952 she started planning work on the city of Mombasa and Coastal Province. In 1962 she moved on to Central Province for another ten years, and then to North-Eastern Province. After Kenyan independence in 1963 Mann was one of the Europeans who continued to serve under the new government. She supported independence and was happy to work under President Kenyatta who believed in continuity and gradual administrative change. She went to many international conferences and lectures as a representative of postcolonial Kenya, and between 1964 and 1968 she was intermittently seconded to take charge of overseas trade exhibitions. Her interests broadened out to include sustainable development and human rights issues and she described herself as a socialist. In 1972 she founded the Council for Human Ecology: Kenya, also known as CHEK, concerned with empowering rural women as well as environmental protection. CHEK became the umbrella for numerous NGO efforts over the years. With CHEK, Mann led the Women in Kibwezi rural development project which offered several thousand women support in building self-sufficiency, including training in apiculture (bee keeping), brickmaking, and rabbit breeding.Erica Mann, Women of Kibwezi - A Case Study of the Kibwesi Women's Integrated Rural Development <gwmw class=\\"ginger-module-highlighter-mistake-type-1\\" id=\\"gwmw-15538946477138183155248\\">Programmegwmw>, Habitat 1990 This was recognised as a valuable and successful project by the United Nations Habitat II conference in 1996. Mann became known for her deep respect for the wisdom and knowledge of the indigenous peoples of Kenya, working for example to preserve the knowledge of healing botanicals held by many traditional healers. After retiring from government employment in 1984 some of Mann's creativity went into her unique collection of succulent plants from different parts of the African continent, arranged in an artistic and carefully designed garden. It drew international attention from botanists including some from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. Erica also accumulated one of the largest private collections of African art anywhere in East Africa.  Legacy  Mann was given the title of Architect Laureate in 2003. Four years later she died, on 4 June 2007, shortly before her 90th birthday. At her memorial service a former chairman of the Architects Association of Kenya, said she was \\"a lone woman in a forest of men - one reason why she joined the International Union of Women Architects as well as becoming an active member of the Kenya Association of University Women\\". In a memoir Mann said, \\"I have generally tried to put both my head and hands to good use, always guided by my heart. From this point of view, I have maintained that I was a complete person in that I have used every gift granted by my Maker.\\" Writing shortly after Mann's death, Betty Caplan, in an obituary titled \\"A Woman of Substance\\", described her as \\"Town planner, architect, ecologist, project manager, conservationist, bee keeper, speaker of seven languages, avid promoter of women's equality, jeweller, potter, craftswoman, gardener, collector.\\" In 2014, Erica's daughter Kenny made an award-winning documentary about the life of her mother and father, arriving in Kenya as refugees then gradually building lives of substance in Kenya. It is entitled Beautiful Tree, Severed Roots. Erica Mann's maiden name, Schoenebaum, meant \\"beautiful tree\\". The film won several awards.

However, it has been removed and no other history is known of the column. The column is believed in local legend to be related to Saint Helena. George F. Taylor classified it among a group of Temples of the Beqaa Valley and noticed that the position of the Iaat column was equidistant between the temples of Baalbek and Qasr el Banat. Whilst technically not being a temple, Taylor suggested that the column might have been placed by the Romans where it is as a victory column to mark the site of a great ancient battle.

Life Joyce Ballou Gregorian was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the third child of Phebe Ballou, of New England descent and the noted oriental rug dealer and expert Arthur T. Gregorian, an Armenian immigrant. She graduated from Beaver Country Day School in 1963. She attended the University of Edinburgh for one year and graduated with honors from Radcliffe College in 1968. She then taught English for one year at the Iran Bethel School in Tehran. After that she joined the family business and became president. She married John Hampshire in 1986.\\"Joyce Ballou Gregorian Hampshire\\", in memoriamBeaver Country Day School - books by alumni \\"Obituaries\\", Locus: The Newspaper of the Science Fiction Field, Vol. 27, No. 1 (Issue 366) (July, 1991), p. 61. Writing Joyce Ballou Gregorian wrote a trilogy of fantasy novels, sometimes called the \\"Tredana Trilogy,\\" that takes place in a parallel world, focussed on the city of Tredana, its inhabitants and neighbors, in a part of that world which resembles the Middle East. The chief character is Sibyl Barron, from our own world, whose life is entwined with the other world. Her love of horses shows in her trilogy, and some horses she owned were written into the books. She also collaborated with her father, Arthur T. Gregorian, and her nephew, Douglas Christian, on a book on Armenian oriental rugs. She authored a variety of articles for Arabian breed publications chronicling major breeding families, profiling individual horses or breeders, and commenting on various topics in preservation breeding. Other activities Gregorian was passionate about breeding and training working Arabian horses. She competed in eventing, Arabian breed shows, and dressage competitions, and she also exhibited her horses in unusual circumstances (such as an indoor mall) to demonstrate the Arabian's versatility. In the 1980s she discovered the Davenport Arabian bloodlines were being preserved as a separate breeding program and became dedicated to the desert-bred Arabian horse. In 1989 she was elected president of Al Khamsa, a preservation breeding group for Arabian horses. She was re- elected in 1990 and served until her death. Her breeding farm averaged about seventy head of Arabians. At the time of her death she had about 40 Davenport Arabian horses on her farm and another dozen from Al Khamsa bloodlines. Gregorian purchased the Alice Payne library in 1988 from the estate of Alice Payne, a noted breeder and importer of desert-bred Arabians. The library was notable for containing large quantities of correspondence between Carl Raswan and Alice Payne. Carl Raswan was working on the Raswan Index while he was corresponding with Alice Payne, and was also offering advice on the directions her breeding program could go. Carl Raswan is considered by some in the Arabian horse world to be a controversial figure, but his views on strain breeding and \\"asil\\" (purity) are generally accepted by modern preservation breeders. Gregorian was an avid researcher of his life and opinions. The Alice Payne library also included annotated pictures, notes, and advertising pamphlets. The library is currently held by the Arabian Horse Trust. Gregorian was also musical, both composing and performing (voice, harpsichord, lute and mandolin). Music and song have a significant role in her novels. Each chapter is separated from the next by a song or poem written by the author. She did all her own illustrations for each book. Gregorian was a board member of the Armenian Library and Museum of America in Watertown, Massachusetts. During her tenure ALMA renovated an empty bank building, turning the space into a dedicated library, research, museum, and community meeting space. Death Joyce Gregorian Hampshire died in 1991 in Boston, Massachusetts, at Massachusetts General Hospital, after a long illness with cancer. Works =Novels= * The Broken Citadel.

Boxley, the bridge consists of five spans, with construction commencing in summer 1925. The bridge officially opened to traffic on May 6, 1926, at a final cost of $282,750. Although officially open to traffic for over four months, its official dedication occurred on August 30 with U.S. Representative Clifton Woodrum in attendance. The delay in its dedication was attributed to delays involving the creation of the bronze, dedication plaques. It is officially dedicated to Roanoke's veterans of World War I. The bridge features five plaques, with their contents determined by the Roanoke City Council. Four of them feature quotations from notable historic figures: Patrick Henry, Theodore Roosevelt, Stonewall Jackson and Thomas Jefferson; with the fifth containing the names of all the soldiers from Roanoke who died in World War I. Although dedicated to the veterans who fought in World War I, many did not attend the dedication ceremony due to its not being originally conceived as a monument to former servicemen. The bridge was officially rededicated on November 11, 1991, sixty-five years after its original dedication. Due to its deteriorating state as a result of corrosion from salt used for deicing in the winter, in April 2002 a major restoration of the span commenced. Costing $1.17 million and completed by spring 2003, the restoration included the replacement of corroded elements, removal of the original Roanoke Street Railway Company streetcar tracks from the roadbed and a resurfacing of the pavement. Additionally, the restoration project incorporated traffic calming principles in reducing the number of vehicular travel lanes from four to two. In addition to the removal of a pair of lanes, both a median and two bike lanes were incorporated onto the bridge.

There are only four characters who are mentioned: Domovoi Butler (\\"Butler\\") and his younger sister Juliet,Artemis Fowl p. 22 who are major characters, and Butler's uncle, known only as \\"the Major\\", and Virgil Butler.  Relationship to Fowls  It is revealed in the first book that the Butler family has been serving the Fowl family as bodyguards for centuries. The first ever pairing was of Virgil Butler as a servant, bodyguard, and cook to Lord Hugo de Fóle for one of the first Norman Crusades. It may actually be the origin of the term butler.Artemis Fowl p. 15 It is mentioned that a pairing of a Butler and a Fowl lasted for life. It is not known what happens if the Butler dies in the middle of his service, except that his/her family receives a \\"six-figure settlement plus a monthly pension\\". The job is described as demanding and lonely, but with high rewards.Artemis Fowl p. 16 A Butler never reveals his or her first name to their employer in order to avoid personal attachment; this is demonstrated in Book 3, when the only time (Domovoi) Butler reveals his first name to Artemis Fowl II is when he was about to die. However, Butler is later revived in the story due to the use of Holly Short's magic, which becomes the only known case of a Fowl knowing the first name of a living Butler family member.  Training  The children of the Butler family underwent training starting at the age of ten. The training took place in various private training centers, (such as one in Japan), known as , where they were taught Cordon Bleu cooking, marksmanship, a blend of different martial arts, emergency medicine, and Information technology. If there was no Fowl to guard at the end of training, he/she was quickly taken as bodyguards for \\"various royal personages, generally in Monaco or Saudi Arabia\\".  Domovoi Butler  Domovoi Butler, known simply as \\"Butler\\", is a large man of Eurasian descent, specifically Russian- Japanese.Artemis Fowl p. 4 Well-known around the world as one of the strongest men and one of the most skilled in martial arts, he is also the only man in history to have taken on a troll and won (Albeit in a rematch and wearing a suit of armor; the first such clash resulted in fatal injuries that Holly was able to heal). Butler stands approximately 6 feet 10 inches tall (about 210 cm). He is described as \\"the essence of understated efficiency\\", favoring a simple black suit. He usually wears his hair either close-cropped or completely shaved. Due to an injury sustained when he took a bullet meant for Artemis, he has Kevlar permanently fused to his torso, which makes his chest capable of stopping small-caliber bullets. The healing that saved his life on this occasion aged him 15 years, but in later books he reveals that fairies gave him an overhaul of his body, so his exterior seems younger. In The Last Guardian, he is severely injured by a bolt of black magic, which permanently cripples his heart. Butler is the bodyguard to the teen criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II, a position that he assumed the day the boy was born, having trained at Madame Ko's academy and undertaken various assignments for intelligence services and governments around the world. He has earned the admiration of their various allies for his dedication to Artemis's goals and his sheer power, his strength having played an important role in many of their adventures and his human contacts being highly useful to Artemis. Although the magical nature of later threats has rendered him less useful than he was previously, he remains one of Artemis Fowl's main assets, his staunchest ally, and his closest friend. Although quite lethal with his bare hands alone, Butler is proficient with weapons of all description. A typical combat load for him would include a 9mm SIG Sauer pistol (probably a P228), a two-shot derringer, throwing knives, garrote wire, and a ball bearing cosh. He has, at various times, also made use of a medieval-era mace, a dart rifle configured like an AK-47 (a souvenir from an ivory hunter he killed in Kenya), and a number of weapons of fairy manufacture.  Juliet Butler  Juliet Butler is Butler's little sister. It is mentioned that Juliet is the only person to laugh at Butler multiple times. Juliet is the only mentioned family of Butler who appears in the series, and whom he is extremely fond of, regarding his happiest childhood memory \\"as a teenager, teaching his baby sister how to do spinning kicks in her sandbox\\". She is 4 years older than Artemis,Artemis Fowl p. 64 making her 16 at the time Artemis II decoded the Book of the People.Artemis Fowl p. 2 Juliet also has blond hair that some people find extremely attractive.Artemis Fowl pgs. 64-66 In the first book, she is given large blue eyes. She won the fictional \\"Miss Sugar Beet Fair 1999\\", but only revealed this alone with Holly Short.Artemis Fowl pg. 100 She has an adoration for wrestling, most likely inherited from her martial arts training. Juliet has a major role in The Eternity Code in comparison to the other books because of (Domovoi) Butler's sudden aging and incapability to fulfill his usual, physically demanding role in Artemis Fowl's master plan. She returns to help Artemis Fowl in the middle of her training at the mention of Butler's first name, which indicates that Butler's life was in critical danger. She was attempting to match Domovoi Butler's record of graduating from Madam Ko's Academy at the age of 18, but failed due to her childish kindred spirit. In terms of physical ability, however, outstanding. Juliet gives up the career of a bodyguard after the events of The Eternity Code in order to become a professional wrestler under the ring name \\"Jade Princess\\" with an American wrestling troupe. The name originates from her jade hairpiece, with which she smacks opponents. Many fans say that Juliet was the only character in the graphic novel that looked like they imagined it. Juliet is not in Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception, due to the fact she was in a Mexican wrestling team. But, she returns in The Atlantis Complex, where Butler travels to Mexico after he is told that Juliet is in danger. This was a diversion set up by the already-paranoid Artemis, who suffered from Atlantis Complex, and had reached the stage of the disorder where his paranoia is extreme. She was not, however, in any danger prior to Butler's arrival, but was placed in danger after Turnball Root, villainous older brother of the late Commander Julius Root, mesmerized the fans at a wrestling show where Juliet was performing into attempting to kill them.

Vilsack had previously been considered as Vice Presidential candidate for Senator John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. He ran for the Democratic Party's 2008 nomination for President of the United States. His short-lived campaign was focused on his home state of Iowa but suffered low standing in national polls and a lack of name recognition. During the campaign, he emphasized the War in Iraq and his plan for ending it. His run concluded on February 23, 2007, before any debates or primaries, due to funding shortfalls. He endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton after his exit, but shifted to Barack Obama after her withdrawal. Early stages right Near the end of his eight years as Governor of Iowa, Vilsack, as head of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, campaigned for Democratic gubernatorial candidates across the nation. While on the campaign trail he gauged support for a possible presidential run. Vilsack was inspired by the results of the 2006 mid-term elections, and proclaimed that \\"Americans sent a clear message\\" that \\"they want leaders who share their values, understand their needs and respect their intelligence\\" and that that is what he would \\"intend to do as president\\". On November 9, Vilsack filed with the FEC and announced that he had been \\"put[ting] together the building blocks needed to run a successful national presidential campaign.\\" He made his formal announcement on November 30. Campaign developments Vilsack made his announcement in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. He listed the themes of his campaign as energy independence, national security, and the economy. The candidate promised change in government by means of reduced partisanship and decried the Bush Administration as one \\"whose first impulse is to divide and to conquer.\\" Vilsack acknowledged his underdog status, given his low profile outside Iowa, which hampered fundraising. In December, Vilsack embarked on a campaign tour beginning in his hometown of Pittsburgh. While there, he addressed a local Democratic Committee, reminiscing about his childhood and how his adopted mother overcame alcoholism. He also discussed his policy on the Iraq War, advocating devolving control to the Iraqi government: \\"It's their country, it's their future and they should be willing to fight for it and they certainly should be willing to die for it.\\" He returned to Iowa for a fundraiser later in the week. Vilsack campaigning in Winterset, Iowa in February 2007 In mid-December 2006 Vilsack was interviewed by two major magazines. In U.S. News and World Report, he explained why he decided against forming an exploratory committee like many of his Democratic rivals, on the principle that he had \\"to get to work.\\" He linked the issue of energy security to global warming and national security. He advocated moving American troops from southern and central Iraq to the north, and further commented that political reconciliation must be refocused on \\"building local governance\\" rather than spending \\"all the time on the national government.\\" In an interview with Rolling Stone, he made a distinction between \\"experience and judgment\\" and emphasized the importance of the latter. Vilsack attacked Republican candidate John McCain's planned Iraq troop surge as \\"making a big mistake bigger\\", and denied that the military had the resources to execute it. In discounting the importance of name recognition, he said \\"people don’t have to remember my name, they only have to remember the first letter which is V. It stands for vision, it stands for victory, it stands for Vilsack.\\" He also expressed his satisfaction with frontrunner Hillary Clinton, calling himself \\"a big fan.\\" In January, Vilsack toured New Hampshire, site of the first primary. There he met with middle school students, with whom he discussed his plans for rebuilding Iraq. Dismissing his Democratic opponents' calls for caps on American troops in the nation, Vilsack advocated a troop withdrawal. He also talked about Iraq with employees of the Granite State Independent Living Group, blaming the costs of rebuilding for the lack of public funds available for domestic projects. In Iowa later in the month, Vilsack reiterated his opposition to troop caps, likening them to \\"staying the course\\". He stated that troop capping \\"reflects the continuation of a failed policy\\" and that America \\"ought to be...aggressively redeploying troops out of Iraq.\\" Vilsack officially announcing his withdrawal with his wife Christie On February 15, before an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Vilsack visited the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco where he gave a speech about energy. He explained that his campaign remained carbon neutral through the purchase of carbon credits. On The Tonight Show, Vilsack joked about his relative obscurity. He remarked that he was okay with Leno making jokes about him, because \\"when you are just below the margin of error in polls, anything anybody says about you is important.\\" Vilsack officially withdrew from the race on February 23, stating that the crowded field of Democratic candidates made it impossible for him to raise enough money to continue his campaign. In explaining his withdrawal, he stated that he \\"came up against something for the first time in [his] life that hard work and effort couldn’t overcome.\\" Bemoaning an electoral process that he saw as dominated by fundraising, he left the race proclaiming \\"it is money and only money that is the reason we are leaving today.\\" Vilsack raised $1.1 million during his run and left the race with $396,000 on hand. Polling In the race for the Democratic nomination, Gallup polls placed Vilsack at 1% support in November and December 2006. This fell to 0% on January 7, where it remained until his withdrawal in February. A Rasmussen report published December 18, 2006 that polled voters on their preferences in a variety of hypothetical presidential matchups showed that Vilsack was preferred to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee by a margin of 37% to 29%, but trailed former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani 56% to 28%.\\" A similar poll, published in February 2007 before Vilsack's withdrawal, found that he trailed Republican Senator John McCain 50% to 22%. In a separate poll by Rasmussen, Vilsack was viewed favorably by 21% of the electorate and unfavorably by 21%. 58% of voters did not have enough information about Vilsack to have an opinion. 19% of respondents considered Vilsack a moderate, 9% considered him a liberal and 7% considered him a conservative. 65% could not describe his political stands. Aftermath Vilsack campaigns for Hillary Clinton in January 2008 After withdrawing from the race, Vilsack endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton for the presidency on March 25, 2007. He hoped to build momentum for her in Iowa. The former Governor identified Clinton as the candidate with \\"the best ideas, the most energy, and the values and vision to lead our country.\\" Shortly after the endorsement, Clinton named Vilsack's wife Christie as the co-chairman of her campaign in Iowa. The Clinton campaign announced they would help Vilsack pay off his campaign's $400,000 debt. Vilsack campaigned for Clinton nationwide as national campaign co-chairman, and focused on helping her win the Iowa caucuses. Despite his efforts, Clinton finished third in the caucuses behind Barack Obama and John Edwards Following Clinton's withdrawal, Vilsack endorsed Obama for the presidency on July 15, 2008. He labeled Obama as the \\"only candidate\\" for voters \\"against partisanship\\" to change \\"the tone in Washington\\" Vilsack was later nominated by President Obama to serve as the United States Secretary of Agriculture in his administration. He was confirmed for the post by the Senate on Inauguration Day.

The present day ballroom tango is divided into two disciplines: American Style and International Style. Both styles may be found in social and competitive dances, but the International version is more globally accepted as a competitive style. Both styles share a closed dance position, but the American style allows its practitioners to separate from closed position to execute open moves, like underarm turns, alternate hand holds, dancing apart, and side-by-side choreography. History American tango =American style tango= American style tango's evolutionary path is derived from Argentina to the United States, when it was popularized by silent film star Rudolph Valentino in 1921, who demonstrated a highly stylized form of Argentine tango in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As a result, the Hollywood style steps mixed in with other social dance steps of the times began this branch away from the Argentine style. Meanwhile, the tango was also making its own inroads into Europe. Following the English standardization of their version of tango, Arthur Murray, a ballroom dance instructor in the U.S., tried his own hand at standardizing the ballroom dances for instruction in his chain of social dance schools. This looser social style was referred to as American style by the English. =International style tango= International tango In 1912 tango was introduced to British audiences, showcased in the successful musical comedy The Sunshine Girl. Concurrently, the dance became popular elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Paris,Denniston, Christine. 2003. Couple Dance Begins in Europe. Hosted by history-of-tango.com. Retrieved on October 26, 2009. and Europeans began to inject their own culture, style and technique into the dance. In an effort to teach a standardized version of the tango, the English eventually codified their own version of tango for instruction in dance schools and for performance in competitions in 1922. The resulting style was referred to as English style, but eventually took on the name International style, as this became the competitive ballroom version practiced around the world. Eventually, championships in the international style tango were organized all over Europe with numerous participating countries. Adjudicators were able to judge against a standardized syllabus and book of techniques, thereby creating a more objective means of picking the champions, even though artistic interpretation remains an important element of competition.ISTD International Standard Syllabus, Ballroom Dance: Waltz, Quickstep, Tango, Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz Initially, the English dominated the International style tango, but eventually, technicians from other backgrounds, most notably the Italians, have chipped away at the English standard and created a dynamic style that continues to raise the competitive bar.List of Blackpool Professional Standard Champions See also * Ballroom dance * Argentine tango *Finnish tango * Tango (music) References Dancesport Tango dance ","title":"Ballroom tango"},{"id":"16011911","text":"Lambeoceras is a genus of rather large actinocerids with a convexly lenticular cross section from the Upper Ordovician of North America and the sole representative of the family Lambeoceratidae. Morphological description Lambeoceras is of medium to moderately large size with a long, straight, depressed shell, broad in cross section with the dorsum and venter both about equally convex, meeting acutely along the sides. Chambers are short, and septa are closely spaced, forming broad lobes on the upper and lower sides, which meet in sharp saddles along the sides. The siphuncle is submarginal, near the ventral side and relatively narrow. Septal necks are extremely long, brims short and recumbent. Segments are broadly expanded, connecting rings thin. Radial canals within the siphuncle from broad arcs that may bifurcate close to the parispatium. Derivation and phylogeny Lambeoceras is derived from the same stock in Actinoceras that produced Kochoceras according to Flower (1968), although consideration had been given to Armenoceras in Flower (1957). Teichert (1964) on the other hand, in the Treatise, thought that Lambeoceras was derived from Gonioceras and included it in the Gonioceratidae. Kochoceras differs from Lambeocernas in having a flattened venter and a siphuncle that rests on the ventral side and is closely allied with Actinoceras (Flower 1957) Distribution Lambeoceras is found with Actinoceras, Armenoceras, and Nybyoceras in the Second Value Formation in New Mexico; with Armenoceras and Selkirkoceras in the Burnam Limestone in central Texas; with Actinoceras, Paractinoceras, and Kochoceras in the Lander Sandstone in Wyoming, and with Armenoceras. Actinoceras, and Selkirkoceras in the overlying dolomite – all of Red River age, marking the transition between the Middle and Upper Ordovician. Lambeoceras is also found with Actinoceras in the Dog Head member of the Red River Series in Manitoba and with Actinoceras and Kochoceras in the Mt. Silliman beds on Baffin Island. Paleoecology While the earlier Gonioceras no doubt rested on the sea floor in ambush, perhaps half buried or more in sediment, Lambeoceras may have more actively hunted in the water close to but above. On the other hand, Lambeoceras ' shape may have had more to do with stabilization in shallow surge ridden waters than with hunting methods.

Aspren lived at the end of the 1st century and in the early 2nd century, as confirmed by archaeological studies regarding the early Neapolitan Church as well as the fact that \\"Aspren\\" was a common name during the days of the Roman Republic and the early years of the Roman Empire and afterwards fell into disuse. The Marble Calendar of Naples (Calendario Marmoreo di Napoli) attests to Aspren's existence and the fact that he lived during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian; Aspren's episcopate is stated as lasting twenty-three years. Nothing is known of his life, but an ancient legend holds that Saint Peter, on his way to Rome, stopped at Naples and converted an old woman (identified as Candida the Elder) after he cured her of an illness. Numerous other converts to Christianity were made during this time in Naples, including Aspren, who was converted either by Peter or Candida herself and who had also been ill.Catholic Online The legend holds that Peter consecrated Aspren as bishop of Naples and asked him to construct the oratory of Santa Maria del Principio, which would form the basis for the basilica of Santa Restituta; San Pietro ad Aram was also said to have been built during this time.

Since World War I, however, southern Chad, particularly the Sara ethnic group, had provided a large share of the Africans in the French army. Chadian troops also had contributed significantly to the success of the Free French Forces in World War II. In December 1940, two African battalions began the Free French military campaign against Italian forces in Libya from a base in Chad, and at the end of 1941, a force under Colonel Jacques Leclerc participated in a spectacular campaign that seized the entire Fezzan region of southern Libya. Colonel Leclerc's 3,200-man force included 2,700 Africans, the great majority of them southerners from Chad. These troops went on to contribute to the Allied victory in Tunisia. Chadians, in general, were proud of their soldiers' role in the efforts to liberate France and in the international conflict. The military involvement also provided the country's first taste of relative prosperity. In addition to the wages paid its forces, Chad received economic benefits from three years of use as a major route for Allied supply convoys and flights to North Africa and Egypt. By 1948 about 15,000 men in French Equatorial Africa (Afrique Equatoriale Française, AEF) were receiving military pensions. Many Chadian southerners, finding military life attractive, had remained in the French army, often becoming noncommissioned officers (NCOs); a few had earned commissions as well. The French wars in Indochina (1946–53; see First Indochina War) and Algeria (1954–62; see Algerian War) also drew on Chadians in great numbers, enlarging the veteran population still further. Those men receiving pensions tended to form the economic elite in their villages. As southerners, they did not become involved in later insurgent movements that developed in central and northern Chad. Early years Prior to independence, the French forces had been reorganized to redeploy some of the Chadian troops assigned to other African territories back into Chad. Following independence, Chad's army was created from southern troops that had served with the French army. Initially, the army was limited to 400 men, some Chadian officers and many French commissioned officers and NCOs. Other soldiers were transferred into a larger paramilitary security force, the National Gendarmerie. Equipped with light arms and other supplies, the army used facilities inherited from the French units that it had replaced. Because the French army units in Chad provided security, a large indigenous force was unnecessary. Accordingly, the Chadian army was deliberately restricted in size. By 1966, however, the departure of the French administration from sparsely populated Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture in the north encouraged dissident forces in the central prefectures to rebel. In response, the government expanded its armed strength to a 700-man infantry battalion with supporting light artillery and also activated an air unit. The continued insurgency necessitated the further enlargement of the army, to a total of 3,800 men by 1971. The army formed a paratroop company from 350 Chadians trained by Israeli instructors at a base in Zaire. In addition to strengthening the regular army, the government increased mobile security companies of the National Gendarmerie, equipped as light infantry, to a strength of more than 1,600 men. A third force, the National Guard (later known as the National and Nomad Guard), which had at least 3,501 members, provided security for officials, government buildings, and regional government posts. Except for the small number of nomad guards, the army and other security components continued to be composed primarily of members from southern ethnic groups, especially Sara. Little effort was made to enlist northerners, who, in spite of their reputation as fierce warriors, were not attracted to the professional army. Consequently, southern troops stationed in Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture were looked upon as an army of occupation. They imposed humiliating restrictions in the northern settlements, and their abusive behavior was a source of bitterness. Military under Hissène Habré The growing unpopularity of the country's first president, François Tombalbaye, impelled him to strengthen further the internal security forces and to employ a unit of Moroccan troops as his personal bodyguard. During the early 1970s, Tombalbaye doubled the size of the National and Nomad Guard and augmented the National Gendarmerie considerably. At the same time, he neglected and downgraded FAT, which the force interpreted as a lack of trust. These actions ultimately contributed to the decision by a small group of officers to carry out a coup in 1975 that resulted in Tombalbaye's death and a new government under Félix Malloum's presidency. Malloum's military regime insisted on the departure of the French troops. FAT, however, found itself increasingly unable to cope with the insurgency in the north, and, as a consequence, Malloum was obliged to invite the French back in 1978. As part of an effort at conciliation with one of the rebel factions, Habré was brought into the government. Habré rejected, however, the plan to integrate his FAN troops into the army, and his force soon demonstrated its superior resolution and strength by expelling Malloum's army from N'Djamena. By the late 1980s, Chad's national security establishment was a conglomeration of former rebel armies under the command of Habré, whose troops were mostly from the north. The evolution of the national security establishment from an army of mostly southerners was rapid. This change occurred between April 1975, when Malloum assumed power, and early 1979, when the combined northern forces of Habré and Goukouni drove the southern-dominated FAT from N'Djamena. Internecine conflict in the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, prevented Chad from achieving political or military unity. Erstwhile comrades Habré and Goukouni became bitter adversaries, and, with Libyan backing, Goukouni evicted Habré from the capital in 1980. Although forced to flee, Habré had fought his way back to N'Djamena by mid-1982. His occupation of the city was followed by victories in the south against his divided opponents). With most regions of the country now under his authority, Habré assumed the presidency, promulgated a provisional constitution, the Fundamental Law of 1982, and introduced a cabinet and other institutions broadly representative of the existing political forces. The Fundamental Law, which remained in effect as of 1988, declares that the president is the supreme commander of the army and is authorized to appoint high-ranking military officers, such appointments to be subject to implementing decrees approved by the Council of Ministers (presidential cabinet). Article 21 of the Fundamental Law states that \\"under the authority of the President of the Republic, the Chief of State, and the government, the national army has the task of defending the national independence and unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity, the security of the country, and its preservation from subversion and any aggression. The army participates in the work of national reconstruction.\\" Habré, who had personally commanded the major element of the northern forces during most of the Chadian Civil War, retained the title of supreme commander and a large measure of control over the military establishment. In addition to his positions as president and supreme commander, Habré had assumed the ministerial portfolio of national defense, veterans, and war victims. In a practical sense, however, in 1988 the Ministry of National Defense, Veterans, and War Victims was not a fully staffed government department independent of the military command structure. At the head of the military chain of command in 1988 was Hassane Djamouss, the commander in chief of FANT and the battlefield commander during the succession of military victories over Libya. His senior deputy with responsibility for administration and logistics was Zamtato Ganebang. The second deputy, Adoum Yacoub, formerly commander of the People's Armed Forces (Forces Armées Populaires, FAP), a rebel army in the north, was responsible for tactics and operations. Another former rebel leader, Oki Dagache Yaya, was the senior representative of the FAP units that had been integrated into FANT. The creation of a five-member military cabinet attached to the presidency, on which several of the ethnic groups composing FANT were represented, was one of the measures adopted by Habré to provide a governmental role for his former opponents. The extent to which Habré relied on its advice on matters of the military policy was not certain; some observers believe that Habré's former adversaries had been given symbolic positions having no real influence. The headquarters staff of FANT totaled about twenty officers and was composed of a number of bureaus patterned after those of the French military. Included were personnel (B-1), intelligence (B-2), operations (B-3), logistics (B-4), and communications (B-5). Other bureaus were tactics and recruitment. French advisers were detailed to all but the intelligence bureau. The Presidential Guard (Sécurité Presidentielle, SP) was responsible for the personal security of the president and performed other internal security duties as well. Although the Presidential Guard participated in combat missions, it functioned as an independent wing of the armed forces. The Presidential Guard depended on FANT headquarters for administration and was officially part of FANT's structure, but it operated as a separate army, often in semisecrecy. Dominated by soldiers of Habré's ethnic group, the Daza, it enjoyed many privileges and was assigned the most modern transportation equipment and weaponry. In 1987 the 3,600-man force was commanded by Ahmed Gorou. Except for the north, which had been organized into a separate military region, the country was divided into twelve military zones, each with headquarters in a major town. The senior officer, generally a major of the Presidential Guard, held command responsibility for any military units within his designated zone. Subzones were located in smaller communities, usually under a lieutenant. Military under Idriss Déby Eland 90 armoured car of the Chadian Army. President Déby purchased a number of these vehicles from a Belgian firm in 2008. The Military of Chad was dominated by members of Toubou, Zaghawa, Kanembou, Hadjerai, and Massa ethnic groups during the presidency of Hissène Habré. Current Chadian president Idriss Déby, a member of the minority Zaghawa- related Bidyate clan and a top military commander, revolted and fled to Sudan, taking with him many Zaghawa and Hadjerai soldiers in 1989. The forces that Déby led into N'Djamena on December 1, 1990, to oust President Habré, was mainly Zaghawa, including a large number of Sudanese, many of whom were recruited while Déby was in the bush. Déby's coalition also included a small number of Hadjerais and southerners. Chad's armed forces numbered about 36,000 at the end of the Habré regime, but swelled to an estimated 50,000 in the early days of Déby's rule. With French support, a reorganization of the armed forces was initiated early in 1991 with the goal of reducing the armed forces to 25,000. An essential element of this effort was to make the ethnic composition of the armed forces reflective of the country as a whole. Neither of these goals was achieved. The military still numbers at least 30,000 men and is dominated by the Zaghawa. War and rebellion continue to plague Chad. Following Déby's rise to power, Habré loyalists continued to fight government troops and rob civilians around Lake Chad. There were numerous small rebellions in eastern Chad, even among the Zaghawa. In the mid- and late-1990s, a rebellion in the south by the FARF delayed the promised petrol development until it was crushed by government forces. Most recently, Youssouf Togoimi and his Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT) were the most serious threat to Déby's power. Since 1998, government and rebel forces have fought with little progress on either side. In January 2002, the government and the MDJT signed a formal peace accord. In 2004, the government discovered that many of the soldiers it was paying did not exist and that some officers were taking these salaries for themselves; it furthermore determined that there were only about 19,000 soldiers in the army, as opposed to the 24,000 that had been previously believed. Government crackdowns against the practice are thought to have been a factor in a failed military mutiny in May 2004. The Chad National Army dislodged Military Command Council for the Salvation of the Republic rebels from the town of Miski, near the border with Libya.

Karol Szajnocha (1818–1868) was a Polish writer, historian, and independence activist. Self-taught, he would nonetheless become a notable Polish historian of the partitions period. Biography Karol Szajnocha was born as on 20 November 1818 in Komarno, son of Polonized Czech Vaclav Scheinoha Vtelenský of Austrian origin, who signed himself as Scheinoha Wtelensky in Poland\\"Dziela Karola Szajnochy\\", vol. 10, 1878, p.248, \\"Life of Karol Szajnocha\\", by Klemens KanteckiNote: \\"Scheinoha\\" comes from German-language surname toponymic surname Schöneich/Schönaich, 'Vtelenský' is a Czech toponymic surname literally meaning \\"from Vtelno\\". and Maria Łozińska. Karol attended schools in Sambor and Lwów; in that period Szajnocha adopted the polonized version of his name (gradually changing his signature from Scheynoha de Wtellensky, to Szejnoha de Wtellensky, to Szajnocha). Piotr Czartoryski-Sziler, Karol Szajnocha – wielki polski dziejopis, Nasz Dziennik In 1834 while in gymnasium he founded a secret society, \\"Societ of the Ancient Times\\" (Towarzystwo Starożytności), dedicated to collecting information on the historical monuments of the partitioned Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and inspired by the Philomath Student Movement. The society was discovered and closed by the authorities and Szajnocha received a mild punishment. In 1835 he entered the University of Lwów, philosophical department. In 1836 he was found guilty of spreading pro-Polish and anti-government leaflets and poems (on the anniversary of the recent November uprising); he was imprisoned from January of that year till mid-1837 and for the first several months he was locked in a single cell without any light. For activism related to Polish pro-independence movement he was also expelled from university and forbidden to reenlist.Robert A. Kann, A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526–1918, University of California Press, 1974, , Google Print, p.391 He continued his education unofficially (he was mostly self-taught), although later he would receive some help from his mentor, August Bielowski), concentrating first on linguistics (he started in prison where by reading grammar books he learned the English language), later on literature and history. Szajnocha became a private tutor as well as journalist and an editor of several important Polish publications in Lwów (he was connected, amongst others, to Dziennik Mod Paryskich, Tygodnik Polski, Rozmaitości, and Dziennik Literacki). In 1838 he joined a new secret organization, Sarmacja. While pro-Polish it was moderate in its views and argued against an armed struggle. In 1839 he first published his own literary works; he wrote poems, novels, dramas and historical essays as well as translate (primarily from Serbian language). Around 1847 his vision started to worsen and was advised by medical doctors to limit amount of writing and reading; he rejected their advise. By that time his fame had grown and twice (in 1850 and 1862) he was offered a position at the Jagiellonian University, which he refused. Beginning in 1853, he worked in the Ossolineum Institute, which helped him to publish some of his works. In 1855 he married Joanna Bilińska. In 1860 he became completely blind (he already had major problems reading since 1856) but would not give up reading and writing – he would listen to a lector and dictate his works as well as write himself with the aid of a device he designed himself (although eventually rheumatism would prevent him from that). On 10 January 1868 he died in Lwów and later buried in the Łyczakowski Cemetery. His funeral was well known and attended by many and seen as a Polish patriotic manifestation. Works He is remembered mostly for his contributions as a historian. His first academic work, Pogląd na ogół dziejów polskich, was published in 1847. He wrote many works, on Polish kings Bolesław Chrobry (1849), Władysław Łokietek (between 1849 and 1854), Władysław Jagiełło (Jogaila) and Queen Jadwiga of Poland (1855–1856), Kazimierz the Great, marshal, hetman, voivode, and magnate Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski and others (Szkice historyczne (1854—1869), Dwa lata dziejow naszych, 1646 i1648 (1865–1869), Obrazy lechickie, Śmierc Czarnieckiego, Obyczaje pierwotnych Słowian). He was also one of the initiators of work on and the publisher of the Monumenta Poloniae Historica (published from 1864 to 1893), a six-tome compilation of important primary sources related to history of Poland.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and is an official City of Santa Paula and Ventura County Landmark. It is in the Santa Clara River Valley, approximately inland from the Pacific Ocean.  History  The hotel was built in 1911 when Santa Paula was growing and prospering as an oil town, and was headquarters to Union Oil. The Tudor-Craftsman hotel was designed by famed architects Burns and Hunt and funded by a consortium of twenty-five wealthy townsmen each of whom wanted one thousand dollars for its construction. It was erected directly opposite the train depot to provide accommodations to the many newcomers lured to the area by the burgeoning oil and citrus industries, and to provide a gathering place for Santa Paula's growing high society circles. During Prohibition, the Inn retained something of its Wild West origins as the third floor - at that time, an open space not yet built out into separate guestrooms - was utilized as a speakeasy, brothel and gambling parlor.Stolz, Kit (October 12, 2014) \\"Historical society honors Santa Paula inn\\" Ventura County Star Many legends stem from this era, including tales of murdered prostitutes and shootouts between unruly gamblers. These stories, though mostly unconfirmed, persist with a life of their own as part of the hotel's rich lore. In the 1930s, Hollywood discovered the valley hamlet of Santa Paula.About Us. City of Santa Paula official webpage. Retrieved on 2008-04-04 Its ruggedly picturesque vistas and hills – improbably close to the sprawl of Los Angeles - provided a setting for numerous Westerns. During this era, the Glen Tavern Inn hosted such notables as Carole Lombard, John Wayne, Houdini and canine thespian, Rin Tin Tin, who boasted his own suite long before “pet-friendly” entered the hospitality lexicon. Eventually, as oil money and old Hollywood moved on, Santa Paula traded fortune, glamour and vice for the quieter constancy of agriculture and small town life Americana. The Santa Susana Tunnel (opened in 1904) allowed for shorter routing, bypassing the town. The train depot became defunct, and likewise economic development bypassed the town. For the next half century the hotel endured a marginal existence, alternating owners and uses many times as it slowly sank into flophouse decrepitude until it was eventually rescued by developers with intentions of restoring its original grandeur. During 2005 through 2007, the Glen Tavern Inn was extensively renovated by the Jennett Investment Group. Mid-renovation, in April 2006, the hotel sustained a fire. Fortunately, fire fighters were able to douse the blaze in time to save the landmark from major harm, and the burned portion was rebuilt. It reopened as a full-service hotel, restaurant and lounge in 2007. The renovation preserved the Inn's historical attributes alongside the addition of more modern amenities. On February 24, 2008, the Glen Tavern Inn was awarded Certificates of Special Recognition from the United States Senate, United States Congress and the California State Assembly for the successful restoration project.Santa Paula Times, February 27, 2008  Ghost stories  Keeping with the hotel's motto \\"Where the Past Comes to Life\\" the Inn is allegedly haunted.America’s Most Haunted Inns, Robert Child In July 2007, the Ventura Paranormal Society held its annual convention there.Ventura County Reporter, 7/26/07 In 2013, the inn was featured on an episode of Ghost Adventures with special guests Brit Morgan and Mimi Page.

It is the type genus of the family Armenoceratidae. The shells of Armenoceras are straight and medium to large in size with a circular to subcircular cross section. The siphuncle is large, located subcentrally to resting on the ventral margin. Segments are wider than long, broadly expanded into the camerae. Septal necks short with wide brings that may be in contact with posterior surface of septa. In most the canal system within the siphuncle in is of the double arc type. Cameral deposits are rare. Armenoceras is derived from Wutinoceras through a thinning of the connecting rings and a simplification of the endosiphuncular canal system. The earliest Armenoceras known comes from the lower Whiterock equivalent in northern China and Korea but is unknown in North America until the end of the Middle Ordovician when it appears in Red River faunas. Worldwide, in addition to east Asia and North America including Greenland, Armenoceras has been found in northern Europe, Russia, and Australia. Armenoceras is thought to have given rise to Nybyoceras in the Chazyan (Flower 1968), although the reverse was earlier suggested in Teichert (1964), and to Selkirkoceras in the Eden-Red River Stage in the Upper Ordovician. Possible Silurian derivatives include Megadiscosorus, Monocyrtoceras, and Elrodoceras although some may turn our to have Nybyoceras as the progenitor.

Life and career Mitchell was born in Reading, Berkshire, raised in Hermitage, Berkshire, and educated at Oakham School. Upon leaving Oakham she went up to Magdalen College, Oxford, to read English. In a career spanning thirty years she has directed over 100 shows - over 70 theatre productions and nearly 30 operas. She began her career behind the scenes at the King's Head Theatre in London before taking on work as an assistant director at theatre companies including Paines Plough (1987) and the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) (1988 - 1989). Early in her career she directed a number of early productions under the umbrella of her company Classics On A Shoestring. In 1989 she was awarded a Winston Churchill Travel Fellowship to study director’s training in Russian, Georgia, Lithuania and Poland and the work she saw there, including productions by Lev Dodin, Eiumentas Nekrosius and Anatoli Vassiliev, influenced her own practice for the next twenty years. In 1996 Mitchell started directing operas at Welsh National Opera where she directed four productions, including Handel's Jephtha and Jancek's Jenufa. Since then she has directed operas at houses, including the Royal Opera House, English National Opera, Glyndebourne, the Salzburg Festival, the Staatsoper (Berlin), the Royal Danish Opera, Opéra Comique (Paris), Geneva Opera and most recently, the Aix-en-Provence Festival. In 1997 Mitchell became responsible for programming at The Other Place, the RSC's now defunct black box theatre. While at the RSC her productions included The Phoenician Women which won her the Evening Standard Award for Best Director in 1996. Early in her career in the 1990s she directed five early productions under the umbrella of her company Classics On A Shoestring, including Women of Troy for which she won a Time Out Award. Mitchell was an Associate Director at the Royal Shakespeare Company between 1996 and 1998 and in 1997 she became responsible for programming at the Other Place – the RSC's now defunct black box space. While at the RSC she directed nine productions, including The Phoenician Women which won her the Evening Standard Award for Best Director in 1996. Between 2000 and 2003 she was an Associate Director at The Royal Court Theatre and between 2003 and 2011 she was an Associate of the Royal National Theatre.[2] She has directed thirteen productions for the Royal Court, including Ten Billion (2012) and 2071(2014) about the climate emergency, an issue she is passionate about. Recent productions at The Royal Court include her ongoing collaboration with the writer Alice Birch on Ophelia’s Zimmer and Birch’s play, Anatomy of a Suicide. At the National Theatre she has directed eighteen productions, the most innovative being an adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s novel, The Waves, where she combined theatre making with the use of live video, creating a form later called ‘live cinema’. The live cinema work was subsequently developed in Germany and France. She has directed over 15 live cinema productions in the UK, Austria, Germany and France, at theatres like the Schaubühne Theatre (Berlin) and Cologne Schauspielhaus, and these pieces have toured the world including Greece, Russia, China, Portugal and Brazil. These ground-breaking shows have contributed to the development of the use of video in theatre and influenced the creative horizons of the younger generation of theatre makers. Whilst at the National Theatre Mitchell also pioneered children’s theatre for primary school age theatre goers, including an adaptation of Dr Seuss’s Cat in the Hat. Her interest in this age group also led her to initiate English National Opera’s first ever opera commission for a primary school audience - an adaptation of Oliver Jeffers’s book, The Way Back Home. From 2008 Mitchell started working regularly on mainland Europe in Germany, Holland, France, Denmark and Austria. Her first production for the Cologne Schauspielhaus, Wunschkonzert, earned her a place at the Theatertreffen in Berlin and since then she has directed four productions for the Cologne Schauspielhaus, seven for the Schaubühne Theatre, Berlin, and six for the Hamburg Schauspielhaus. She has also worked at the Toneelgroep, Amsterdam, and twice at the Bouffes du Nord, Paris. She is currently a resident director at The Schaubühne Theatre, Berlin, the Hamburg Schauspielhaus and she has just finished a seven-year artist-in-residency at the Aix-en-Provence Festival. In 2015 the Stadsschouwburg Theatre in Amsterdam held a retrospective of her opera and theatre work, presenting eight productions from across Europe. In 2009 Mitchell published The Director’s Craft: A Handbook for the Theatre (Routledge), her practical manual to help young directors learn how to direct. She also published two books based on her live cinema productions – …some trace of her and Waves, both in 2008. Mitchell has also directed installations, including Five Truths at the V&A.; In 2011 The Department of Theatre and Performance at the Victoria and Albert Museum invited Mitchell and Leo Warner of 59 Productions to conceive and produce a video installation exploring the nature of 'truth in performance'. Taking as its inspiration 5 of the most influential European theatre directors of the last century, the project examines how each of the practitioners would direct the actress playing Ophelia in the famous 'mad' scenes in Shakespeare's Hamlet. This multiscreen video installation, launched at the Chantiers Europe festival at the Theatre de la Ville in Paris on 4 June, and opened at the V&A; on 12 July 2011. She is currently a Professor of Theatre Directing at Royal Holloway University, London, where she teaches on an MA in directing. Other academic positions include: * Visiting Professor of Opera at Oxford University 2017 * Visiting Fellow at Central St Martins, London 2016 – 2018 * Honorary Fellow at Rose Bruford College, London 2014 * Cultural Fellow at King’s College, London 2015 –Present Reputation Mitchell has been described as \\"a director who polarises audiences like no other\\" and \\"the closest thing the British theatre has to an auteur\\". In 2007, the artistic director of the NT accused the British press of affording Mitchell's productions \\"misogynistic reviews, where everything they say is predicated on her sex\\". Her productions have been described as \\"distinguished by the intensity of the emotions, the realism of the acting, and the creation of a very distinctive world\\" and accused of \\"a willful disregard for classic texts\\", but Mitchell suggests that \\"there's a signature in every director's work\\" and that it is not her intent to work to a \\"strong personal signature\\". At the beginning of her career, Mitchell's process involved long and intensive rehearsal periods and use of the Stanislavski's system. She regularly involves psychiatry in looking at characters, and in 2004 directed a series of workshops on Stanislavski and neuroscience at the NT studio. Since her 2006 play Waves, she has also experimented with video projections in a number of productions. In 2016 Mitchell was described as ‘British theatre’s Queen in exile’ and a director who ‘provokes strong reactions.’ Some see her ‘as a vandal, ripping apart classic texts and distorting them to her own dubious purpose’ and others ‘consider her to be the most important British director of theatre and opera at work today – indeed, among the greatest in the world.’ (The Guardian, 14th January 2016) Personal life She has a daughter Edie, born 2005. Honours In 2009 Mitchell was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours.

It is situated on the A1067 road between Hellesdon and Taverham.  History  Drayton is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Draituna, meaning place where logs are dragged. However, the area seems to have been settled much earlier. In 1849, Roman pottery was unearthed in the village. Between 1432 and 1459 the village was in the possession of Sir John Fastolf, a prominent soldier in the Hundred Years' War who gave his name to Shakespeare's character Sir John Falstaff. He built Drayton Lodge, a red brick 'plaisance', as a lookout overlooking the river Wensum and the main road into Norwich. Its ruins are still visible today. On Falstolf's death in 1459, his properties passed into the hands of John Paston. His inheritance soon became the subject of bitter litigation from the Duke of Suffolk, who owned the neighbouring village of Costessey, leading to violent clashes between the two landowners (described in the Paston Letters). A resident of the village, Harry Cator, received the Victoria Cross for his gallantry during the First World War. A large new housing estate, Thorpe Marriott, was built partially within the parish of Drayton in the late 20th century.  Amenities  Drayton has a petrol station (all night), Barclays Bank, two post offices, butcher, doctors’ surgery and late night pharmacy, Lloyd's chemist, baker, patisserie, florist, four hairdressers, beautician, dress shop, two industrial estates and several public houses including the Cock Inn and the Red Lion, and Stower Grange hotel and restaurant. It also has three Tesco outlets. There are two schools (First and Middle), a village hall, Longdale and King George V playing fields, the Bob Carter Sports and Community Centre and an insurance broker (Drayton Insurance). Drayton also has Low Road Potato Farm which serves the local community and businesses with potatoes and vegetables. R G Carter construction and farms' businesses are located here. The parish church of St Margaret's was built in the 13th century, but was substantially rebuilt in the 19th century, after the tower collapsed in 1850. Part of Thorpe Marriott lies within the ward of Drayton North. Thorpe Marriott is a late 1980s early 1990s residential community covering parts of Drayton and Taverham parishes. It has its own shopping centre at Acres Way, including a fish shop, mini Tesco, the Otter public house and an estate agent. Thorpe Marriott is served by Trinity Ecumenical Church (Methodist & Anglican) and by St Margaret's Drayton and St Edmund's Taverham, partner churches with local Methodists in the Trinity LEP (Local Ecumenical Partnership). St Margaret's, together with Drayton Methodist and Trinity Church are members of 'Churches Together in Drayton, Taverham & Thorpe Marriott'. Drayton was once served by its own Drayton railway station on the now closed Midland and Great Northern line into Norwich from the north. Today, the track bed forms part of the Marriott's Way, a long distance footpath.

Lawrence was a full-rigged sailing ship built in Maitland, Nova Scotia, along the Minas Basin and named after her builder, the merchant and politician William Dawson Lawrence (1817–1886). Construction and career Built in 1874 at the William D. Lawrence Shipyard in Maitland, she was the largest wooden sailing ship of her day, one of the largest wooden ships ever built and the largest sailing ship ever built in Canada. William Lawrence was a fierce opponent of Canadian Confederation which he predicted would bring ruin to Nova Scotia's flourishing shipbuilding industry. Initially planning to build a smaller vessel, he deliberately increased the size of William D. Lawrence to create a landmark vessel for the province's shipping industry before it declined. The vessel defied critics who claimed that a wooden vessel of its size would be unmanageable and lose money. After several profitable years, the ship was sold to Norwegian owners in 1883 and renamed Kommander Svend Foyn. She was stranded in the English Channel in 1891 and converted to a barge, later sinking in Dakar, Africa. Commemorations William D. Lawrence (ship) carved into the Bank of Nova Scotia Building, Hollis Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia In 1930, William D. Lawrence and his great ship were commemorated by the Bank of Nova Scotia, which placed a stone carving of the ship above the door of the head office building in Halifax, Nova Scotia (located on Hollis Street, directly across from Province House). A monument dedicated to Lawrence's ship as a national historic treasure was erected on the grounds of his home in 1967, and his home was opened to the public as a provincial museum site on August 11, 1971. The ship has also been commemorated by the Canada Post with a postage stamp (1975) and the Royal Canadian Mint with a coin (2002).

Knowledge entrepreneurship is different from 'traditional' economic entrepreneurship in that it does not aim at the realization of monetary profit, but focuses on opportunities with the goal to improve the production (research) and throughout of knowledge (as in personal transformationHarvey, L., & Knight, P. (1996). Transforming higher education. Buckingham [England] ; Bristol, Pa.: Society for Research into Higher Education : Open University Press), rather than to maximize monetary profit. It has been argued that knowledge entrepreneurship is the most suitable form of entrepreneurship for not-for-profit educators, researchers and educational institutions. The Information / Knowledge Entrepreneurship Following ClarkClark, B. R. (1998). Creating entrepreneurial universities : organizational pathways of transformation (1st ed.). Oxford ; New York: Published for the IAU Press by Pergamon Press.Clark, B. R. (2004). Sustaining change in universities. Continuities in case studies and concepts: Open University Press.\\"entrepreneurial\\" can be used as a characteristic not only applied to individuals, but to organizations as social systems, as well as to projects. However, in contrast to Clark, the dynamic process of vision, and change aspects of entrepreneurship (Kuratko, 2006; Schumpeter & Opie, 1934), also known as entrepreneuring are stressed. Thus entrepreneurship is the act of pursuing new ways of doing thing in a real context, or more concretely \\"the essential act of entrepreneurship is new entry\\" (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Or as Brown put it: \\"Entrepreneurship is a process of exploiting opportunities that exist in the environment or that are created through innovation in an attempt to create value\\" (Brown & Ulijn, 2004, p. 5) Model of knowledge entrepreneurship. Used in Senges 2007 and adapted from McDonald 2002 According to Kanter,Kanter, R. M. (1983). The change masters : innovations for productivity in the American corporation. New York: Simon and Schuster. entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial organizations \\"always operate at the edge of their competence, focusing more of the resources and attention on what they do not yet know (e.g. investment on R&D;) than controlling what they already know. They measure themselves not by the standards of the past (how far they have come) but by visions of the future (how far they have yet to go). And they do not allow the past to serve as a restraint on the future; the mere fact that something has not worked in the past does not mean that it cannot be made to work in the future. And the mere fact that something has worked in the past does not mean that it should remain.\\" (Kanter as in (Cornwall & Perlman, 1990, pp. 27–28). Using McDonald (2002, pp. 12–33), the following specific set of attractors have been proposed by Senges (2007) to directly influence the knowledge entrepreneurship ability (figure 1.6): Environmental awareness describes with what practices and with what intensity the organization gathers information about its external and internal environment. The importance of this practice for the establishment of an entrepreneurial organization was also recognized by Cornwall and Perlman (1990). They write: \\"Scanning should be a fundamental part of every manager's job, not something that is done by top management in conjunction with the annual update of the strategic plan\\"(Cornwall & Perlman, 1990, p. 46). As such the concept includes activities like internal needs analysis, benchmarking and inter-organizational networking. The organizations attitude towards the risk inherent in the pursuit of all innovation is captured under the concept of risk tolerance. A factor which has not been part of McDonald's model (and which replaces the variable named analytical diligence) covers the organizations vision in the sense of entrepreneuring (Kuratko, 2006). This ability is strongly related to strategic thinking and planning, describes its culture of envisioning and scouting new developments. New project support refers to the degree to which new initiatives are institutionalized as a means of institutional development. Thereby the monetary means, as well as managerial attention given to experimental projects is looked at. Communication is the last variable taken into consideration as a major influence for knowledge entrepreneurship. The organizational style of communication and the richness of communication channels are evaluated here. Furthermore, the organizational condition, described through its setting and its current leadership and its organizational culture are set to determine the general possibilities for knowledge entrepreneurship to occur. Thereby the organizational setting represents the basic factual being of the organization; its size, type of institution, business model, history and historic approach to innovation. Under leadership the style and values embraced by the current top decision makers, as well as the governance structure itself is evaluated. The concept of organizational culture is central to the understanding of the enabling or discouraging condition of the organization, as it adapts its attitude towards organizational learning and whether values like innovativeness, competitiveness, entrepreneurship etc. are embraced or rejected. On the output side, knowledge entrepreneurship is set to improve innovativeness and thereby indirectly improve performance. But Review of literature In this section, only a few works that have been identified to have used the concrete term 'knowledge entrepreneur' (and derivates) are reviewed. Most of them have only a broad understanding of the concept and are thus only cited to give a context. The Ph.D. research conducted by McDonald (2002) seems to be the first to have proposed and tested a conceptualization of the term as defined here. In the following paragraphs it is reviewed what has been published in books and then the journal papers: The Demos Think-Tank has published a report entitled: \\"Surfing the long wave: Knowledge entrepreneurship in Britain\\" (Leadbetter & Oakley, 2001), Colin Coulson-Thomas a Professor and Consultant has been promoting his version of the concept in various articles and workshops as well as in the book \\"The knowledge entrepreneur\\" (Coulson-Thomas, 2003), and lastly the librarian Stan Skrzeszewski (2006) wrote about knowledge entrepreneurship in the librarian context. The Demos report is meant to influence policy planning in the UK. It starts with an overview section on entrepreneurship and why it is important to have an entrepreneurial society. It then goes on to present a collection of case studies from the UK creative IT services (gaming and animation). Even though there is no specific definition of the term given, they use knowledge entrepreneurship to indicate that the entrepreneur is starting an enterprise that is based on knowledge work. With \\"The knowledge entrepreneur\\" Coulson-Thomas has written an interesting management consultant book. Having years of experience as business professor and board member, he brings reams of advice he has to give to the table. \\"The knowledge entrepreneur\\", has many general chapters (such as 'contemporary information problems', or 'requirements of different stakeholders'). In general this is not an academic but a practitioner oriented book; however some original concepts are worth noting. He describes knowledge- based opportunities as distinct from (classical) resource based opportunities; unfortunately there is no clear definition of a knowledge based opportunity which makes it difficult to demarcate, as all opportunities except for purely spontaneous action or intuition based opportunities are somehow knowledge based. He also puts forward a list of eleven things a knowledge entrepreneur needs to understand. It is an extensive list starting with the ability to acquire, develop, share, manage and exploit information, knowledge and understanding, and related support tools, and it ends with the ability to lead and manage knowledge workers, network organizations and virtual teams. The third book 'The Knowledge Entrepreneur' by Stan Skrzeszewski (2006) was originally meant to be entitled \\"The Entrepreneurial Librarian\\" (Skrzeszewski, 2006, p. v), it describes practical hands-on advise for how to embrace the entrepreneurship paradigm in the librarian profession. He defines: \\"A knowledge entrepreneur is someone who is skilled at creating and using intellectual assets for the development of new ventures or services that will lead to personal and community wealth creation or to improved and enhanced services. The knowledge entrepreneur must have sufficient personal knowledge capital to be able to create value and/or wealth through the use of that knowledge capital\\" (Skrzeszewski, 2006, p. 3). The definition is rather complementary with the Wikipedia conceptualization, only the dependence on existing intellectual capital and the result of 'wealth creation and/or improved services' actually alludes to a different objective than knowledge product or service per se. He continues: \\"The knowledge entrepreneur must know more about the subject at hand than his or her client of boss. It does not always have to be a great deal more, and sometimes the difference is based on the ability to communicate, present, or more importantly, apply the knowledge asset\\" (Skrzeszewski, 2006, p. 3). Now this argument is not convincing as true knowledge entrepreneurship, as for the knowledge entrepreneur identifying and realizing an opportunity, rather than exploiting existing intellectual capital is the motivating factor. Later, when Skrzeszewski elaborates on how information technology is a key trend to be exploited by knowledge entrepreneurs, his librarian perspective shows through again: \\"There is a growing need and expectation for relevant and usable digital information products and services. At the same time, there is a growing problem of information overload. Therefore, there is an attendant need to organize and package information for users, to put the information in context, to provide information intermediaries and facilitators, and to digitize all forms and formats of information – all major entrepreneurial opportunities\\" (Skrzeszewski, 2006, p. 31). The fourth author, McDonald (2002), has conducted his PhD research entitled \\"Knowledge entrepreneurship: Linking organizational learning and innovation\\" about a comparison of the conditions at hospitals regarding their approaches to knowledge sharing and exploration and the entry of innovations. The work is assessed as the first to develop the distinct characteristics of knowledge entrepreneurship. Another Author that has used the theme is Jennifer Rowley. In her paper \\"From learning organization to knowledge entrepreneur\\" (Rowley, 2000) she deals with how organizational learning can be meaningfully conceptualized. Thereby she stresses learning and the usefulness of the knowledge codified. In this context she elaborates on the concept of the knowledge entrepreneur. In her understanding \\"an organization that is a knowledge entrepreneur recognizes the multi-faceted nature of knowledge, and the implication that this has for organization learning. Specifically, a knowledge entrepreneur understands how to interface organizational learning and systems evolution in such a way as to optimize and capitalize on its knowledge resources in pursuit of its vision\\" (Rowley, 2000, p. 14). This understanding expresses the role of knowledge entrepreneurship in a different way but interesting. She writes knowledge entrepreneurship serves to \\"build bridges between people and systems\\". She then goes on to list what is in her eyes important to achieve the co-evolution of system and organizational learning in tandem. These are: allow for diversity, allow for historicity and a knowledge culture, as well as appropriate systems for storage and dissemination. A short paper entitled \\"It's difficult to innovate: The death of the tenured professor and the birth of the knowledge entrepreneur\\" (Bouchikhi & Kimberly, 2001) has been published in the Human Relations journal. The paper describes a near future where knowledge entrepreneurs are \\"working under a diversity of employment contracts and attachments\\" (Bouchikhi & Kimberly, 2001, p. 82). Therefore, \\"knowledge entrepreneurs will be hired and compensated based on their ability to imagine, execute, and use of the results of research to develop original educational products\\". The authors are dealing specifically with business and management education, for which they are painting a profoundly transformed scenario as they are \\"break[in] out of their institutional straight jackets and redefine their roles in the production of knowledge\\". According to their vision, there will be \\"an almost medieval hierarchy\\" amongst professors, with the super-star academics performing more the role of a \\"CEO of a firm than like the traditional professor, managing their work and their careers with extraordinary autonomy from customary university constraints\\" (Bouchikhi & Kimberly, 2001, p. 82).

The events feature gassers and super stockers and hundreds of popular drag machines in vintage trim. Another event, the Goodguys Nostalgia Nationals held at Beech Bend Raceway Park in Bowling Green, Kentucky also features vintage drag arcing. Goodguys founder Gary Meadors Gary Meadors is the founder and former Chairman of the Board of the Goodguys Rod & Custom Association. Gary grew up in the small central valley farming community of Dinuba, California. He built up his first hot rod at the age of 14, taking a 1947 Plymouth and installing a modified flathead Chrysler Six engine and then lowering the suspension until the car nearly scraped the ground – a Meadors rodding trademark to this day. Meadors has accomplished several milestones in his hot rodding career including membership in the prestigious Bonneville Club when he drove the Dozier & Hegarty blown flathead Chrysler-8 powered streamliner to a record speed of at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1994. In 1995, Gary was given the STREET RODDER Magazine Lifetime Achievement award. He was inducted into the Street Rod Marketing Alliance Hall of Fame in 1998 and at the 2004 SEMA show in Las Vegas, Meadors received the Hot Rod Industry Alliance (HRIA) “Lifetime Achievement” award for his contributions to the world of hot rods and customs. He died on December 27, 2015 at his home in Arizona. History The first Goodguys event was staged in 1983 in Pleasanton, California at the Alameda County Fairgrounds. It was a one-day car show which welcomed all years, makes and models of American Cars and Trucks. It was called the All American Get-Together. Held on a Saturday in March, the event attracted over 650 cars. In 1987, Goodguys went national with a small team of employees staging ten events across the country during the spring and summer catering to hot rods and custom cars and has continued this tradition ever since, expanding the schedule to include 24 events in 17 states in 2008.

Coffee, which originated in Ethiopia, is the largest foreign exchange earner.Agriculture accounted for 46.3% of GDP, 83.9% of exports, and 80% of the labor force in 2006 and 2007, compared to 44.9%, 76.9% and 80% in 2002/2003, and agriculture remains the Ethiopian economy's most important sector.\\"The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia: Selected Issues Series\\", International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 08/259, pp. 5, 26 (accessed 4 February 2009) Ethiopia has great agricultural potential because of its vast areas of fertile land, diverse climate, generally adequate rainfall, and large labor pool. Despite this potential, however, Ethiopian agriculture has remained underdeveloped. Because of drought, which has repeatedly affected the country since the early 1970s, a poor economic base (low productivity, weak infrastructure, and low level of technology), and overpopulation, the agricultural sector has performed poorly. For instance, according to the World Bank between 1980 and 1987 agricultural production dropped at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, while the population grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Consequently, the country faced a famine that resulted in the death of nearly 1 million people from 1984 to 1986.Wubne, Mulatu. \\"Agriculture\\" (and subsections). A Country Study: Ethiopia (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds.) Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1991). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.. Historically, Ethiopia was a rare exception in Sub-Saharan Africa, because of its special environmental circumstances, that enabled Ethiopian farmers to increase their productivity, for example by using ploughs. The beneficial climate in the Highlands of Ethiopia also enabled irrigation and other advanced agricultural technology. Regular and reliable harvests helped generate stable tax income that led to relatively strong governmental structures that were ultimately the reason that Ethiopia was the only country not to be colonized in the late-nineteenth century ‘Scramble for Africa’ apart from Liberia. During the imperial period, the development of the agricultural sector was retarded by a number of factors, including tenancy and land reform problems, the government's neglect of the agricultural sector (agriculture received less than 2 percent of budget allocations even though the vast majority of the population depended on agriculture), low productivity, and lack of technological development. Moreover, the emperor's inability to implement meaningful land reform perpetuated a system in which aristocrats and the church owned most of the farmland and in which most farmers were tenants who had to provide as much as 50% of their crops as rent. To make matters worse, during the 1972-74 drought and famine the imperial government refused to assist rural Ethiopians and tried to cover up the crisis by refusing international aid. As a result, up to 200,000 Ethiopians perished. A fruit orchard in Ethiopia Although the issue of land reform was not addressed until the Ethiopian Revolution in 1974, the government had tried to introduce programs to improve the condition of farmers. In 1971 the Ministry of Agriculture introduced the Minimum Package Program (MPP) to bring about economic and social changes. The MPP included credit for the purchase of items such as fertilizers, improved seeds, and pesticides; innovative extension services; the establishment of cooperatives; and the provision of infrastructure, mainly water supply and all-weather roads. The program, designed for rural development, was first introduced in a project called the Chilalo Agricultural Development Union. The program later facilitated the establishment of similar internationally supported and financed projects at Ada'a Chukala (just south of Addis Ababa), Welamo, and Humera. By 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture's Extension and Project Implementation Department had more than twenty-eight areas with more than 200 extension and marketing centers. Although the MPPs improved the agricultural productivity of farmers, particularly in the project areas, there were many problems associated with discrimination against small farmers (because of a restrictive credit system that favored big landowners) and tenant eviction. Imperial government policy permitting investors to import fertilizers, pesticides, tractors and combines, and (until 1973) fuel free of import duties encouraged the rapid expansion of large-scale commercial farming. As a result, agriculture continued to grow, albeit below the population growth rate. According to the World Bank, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 2.1 percent between 1965 and 1973, while population increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent during the same period. Agricultural productivity under the Derg continued to decline. According to the World Bank, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 0.6 percent between 1973 and 1980 but then decreased at an average annual rate of 2.1 percent between 1980 and 1987. During the same period (1973–87), population increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent (2.4 percent for 1980-87). The poor performance of agriculture was related to several factors, including drought; a government policy of controlling prices and the free movement of agricultural products from surplus to deficit areas; the unstable political climate; the dislocation of the rural community caused by resettlement, villagization, and conscription of young farmers to meet military obligations; land tenure difficulties and the problem of land fragmentation; the lack of resources such as farm equipment, better seeds, and fertilizers; and the overall low level of technology. President Mengistu's 1990 decision to allow free movement of goods, to lift price controls, and to provide farmers with security of tenure was designed to reverse the decline in Ethiopia's agricultural sector. There was much debate as to whether or not these reforms were genuine and how effectively they could be implemented. Nonetheless, agricultural output rose by an estimated 3 percent in 1990–91, almost certainly in response to the relaxation of government regulation. This modest increase, however, was not enough to offset a general decrease in GDP during the same period. Land use The hilly land has led to extensive terracing in some parts of the country.Of Ethiopia's total land area of 1,221,480 square kilometers, the government estimated in the late 1980s that 15 percent was under cultivation and 51 percent was pasture. It was also estimated that over 60 percent of the cultivated area was cropland. Forestland, most of it in the southwestern part of the country, accounted for 4 percent of the total land area, according to the government. These figures varied from those provided by the World Bank, which estimated that cropland, pasture, and forestland accounted for 13%, 41%, and 25%, respectively, of the total land area in 1987. Inaccessibility, water shortages, and infestations of disease-causing insects, mainly mosquitoes, prevented the use of large parcels of potentially productive land. In Ethiopia's lowlands, for example, the presence of malaria kept farmers from settling in many areas. Most agricultural producers are subsistence farmers with small holdings, often broken into several plots. Most of these farmers lived in the Ethiopian Highlands, mainly at elevations of 1,500 to 3,000 meters. There are two predominant soil types in the highlands. The first, found in areas with relatively good drainage, consists of red-to-reddish-brown clayey loams that hold moisture and are well endowed with needed minerals, with the exception of phosphorus. These types of soils are found in much of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR). The second type consists of brownish-to-gray and black soils with a high clay content. These soils are found in both the northern and the southern highlands in areas with poor drainage. They are sticky when wet, hard when dry, and difficult to work. But with proper drainage and conditioning, these soils have excellent agricultural potential. According to the Central Statistical Agency (CSA), in 2008 the average Ethiopian farmer holds 1.2 hectares of land, with 55.13% of them holding less than 1.0 hectare.\\"National Statistical Abstract. Section D. Agriculture.\\" , Table D.8. Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia website (accessed 3 February 2009) An Ethiopian farm The population in the lowland peripheries (below 1,500 meters) is nomadic, engaged mainly in livestock raising. Sandy desert soils cover much of the arid lowlands in the northeast and in the Ogaden of southeastern Ethiopia. Because of low rainfall, these soils have limited agricultural potential, except in some areas where rainfall is sufficient for the growth of natural forage at certain times of the year. These areas are used by pastoralists who move back and forth in the area following the availability of pasture for their animals. The plains and low foothills west of the highlands have sandy and gray-to-black clay soils. Where the topography permits, they are suitable for farming. The soils of the Great Rift Valley often are conducive to agriculture if water is available for irrigation. The Awash River basin supports many large-scale commercial farms and several irrigated small farms. Soil erosion has been one of the country's major problems. Over the centuries, deforestation, overgrazing, and practices such as cultivation of slopes not suited to agriculture have eroded the soil, a situation that worsened considerably during the 1970s and 1980s, especially in Eritrea, Tigray, and parts of Gondar and Wollo. In addition, the rugged topography of the highlands, the brief but extremely heavy rainfalls that characterize many areas, and centuries-old farming practices that do not include conservation measures have accelerated soil erosion in much of Ethiopia's highland areas. In the dry lowlands, persistent winds also contribute to soil erosion. During the imperial era, the government failed to implement widespread conservation measures, largely because the country's complex land tenure system stymied attempts to halt soil erosion and improve the land. After 1975 the revolutionary government used peasant associations to accelerate conservation work throughout rural areas. The 1977 famine also provided an impetus to promote conservation. The government mobilized farmers and organized \\"food for work\\" projects to build terraces and plant trees. During 1983-84 the Ministry of Agriculture used \\"food for work\\" projects to raise 65 million tree seedlings, plant 18,000 hectares of land, and terrace 9,500 hectares of land. Peasant associations used 361 nurseries to plant 11,000 hectares of land in community forest. Between 1976 and 1985, the government constructed 600,000 kilometers of agricultural embankments on cultivated land and 470,000 kilometers of hillside terraces, and it closed 80,000 hectares of steep slopes for regeneration. However, the removal of arable land for conservation projects has threatened the welfare of increasing numbers of rural poor. For this reason, some environmental experts maintain that large-scale conservation work in Ethiopia has been ineffective. , some countries that import most of their food, such as Saudi Arabia, had begun planning the development of large tracts of arable land in developing countries such as Ethiopia. This has raised fears of food being exported to more prosperous countries while the local population faces its own shortage. Land reform A USAID Development Credit Authority credit guarantee enabled this farmer to expand his poultry farm and employ more workers (2011)Until the 1974 revolution, Ethiopia had a complex land tenure system, which some have described as feudal. In Wollo Province, for example, there were an estimated 111 types of land tenure. The existence of so many land tenure systems, coupled with the lack of reliable data, made it difficult to give a comprehensive assessment of landownership in Ethiopia, as well as depressed the ability of peasants to improve themselves. By the mid-1960s, many sectors of Ethiopian society favored land reform. University students led the land reform movement and campaigned against the government's reluctance to introduce land reform programs and the lack of commitment to integrated rural development. Following their rise to power, on March 4, 1975, the Derg proclaimed their land reform program. The government nationalized rural land without compensation, abolished tenancy, forbade the hiring of wage labor on private farms, ordered all commercial farms to remain under state control, and granted each peasant family so-called \\"possessing rights\\" to a plot of land not to exceed ten hectares. Tenant farmers in southern Ethiopia, where the average tenancy was as high as 55% and rural elites exploited farmers, welcomed the land reform. But in the northern highlands, where title to farm land was shared amongst members of descent groups, many people resisted land reform. Despite the Derg's efforts to reassure farmers that land reform would not affect them negatively, northerners remained suspicious of the new government's intentions. Their resistance to this change increased when Zemecha members campaigned for collectivization of land and oxen. Government attempts to implement land reform also created problems related to land fragmentation, insecurity of tenure, and shortages of farm inputs and tools. Peasant associations often were periodically compelled to redistribute land to accommodate young families or new households moving into their area. The process meant not only smaller farms but also the fragmentation of holdings, which were often scattered into small plots to give families land of comparable quality. Consequently, individual holdings were frequently far smaller than the permitted maximum allotment of ten hectares. A 1979 study showed that around Addis Ababa individual holdings ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 hectares and that about 48 percent of the parcels were less than one-fourth of a hectare in size. Another study, of Dejen (subregion) in Gojjam, found that land fragmentation had been exacerbated since the revolution. For example, during the pre-reform period, sixty-one out of 200 farmer respondents owned three or four parcels of land; after the reform, the corresponding number was 135 farmers. In 1984 the founding congress of the Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE) emphasized the need for a coordinated strategy based on socialist principles to accelerate agricultural development. To implement this strategy, the government relied on peasant associations and rural development, cooperatives and state farms, resettlement and villagization, increased food production, and a new marketing policy. Despite government efforts, farmers responded less than enthusiastically. While by 1988 a total of 3600 Service Cooperatives were serving 4.4 million households and almost 4000 Producer cooperatives comprising 302,600 households had been founded, in that year they represented only 5.5% of national cereal production.Patrick Webb and Joachim von Braun, Famine and Food Security in Ethiopia: Lessons for Africa (Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, 1994), pp.42f Another major component of the Derg's agricultural policy was the development of large-scale state farms. Of an estimated 750,000 hectares of private commercial farms in operation at the time of the 1975 land proclamation, 67,000 hectares were converted into State Farms that, beginning in 1979, were operated by a new Ministry of State Farms. By 1989, the area covered by the State Farms had grown to a total of 220,000 hectares. However, despite substantial investments and subsidies, State Farms provided only 4.2% of the cereal production in 1988/89. The primary motive for the expansion of state farms was the desire to reverse the drop in food production that has continued since the revolution. After the 1975 land reform, peasants began withholding grain from the market to drive up prices because government price-control measures had created shortages of consumer items. In addition, increased peasant consumption caused shortages of food items such as teff, wheat, corn, and other grains in urban areas. The problem became so serious that Mengistu lashed out against the peasantry on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of military rule in September 1978. Mengistu and his advisers believed that state farms would produce grain for urban areas, raw materials for domestic industry, and also increase production of cash crops such as coffee to generate badly needed foreign exchange. Accordingly, state farms received a large share of the country's resources for agriculture; from 1982 to 1990, this totaled about 43% of the government's agricultural investment. Despite the emphasis on state farms, state farm production accounted for only 6% of total agricultural output in 1987 (although meeting 65% of urban needs), leaving peasant farmers responsible for over 90% of production. The objectives of villagization included grouping scattered farming communities throughout the country into small village clusters, promoting rational land use, conserving resources, providing access to clean water and to health and education services, and strengthen security. However, opponents of villagization argued that the scheme was disruptive to agricultural production because the government moved many farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons. There also was concern that villagization could have a negative impact on fragile local resources, accelerate the spread of communicable diseases, and increase problems with plant pests and diseases. In early 1990, the government essentially abandoned villagization when it announced new economic policies that called for free-market reforms and a relaxation of centralized planning. Agricultural production The effect of the Derg's land reform program on food production and its marketing and distribution policies were among two of the major controversies surrounding the revolution. Available data on crop production show that land reform and the various government rural programs had a minimal impact on increasing the food supply, as production levels displayed considerable fluctuations and low growth rates at best. Since the fall of the Derg, there have been a number of initiatives to improve the food supply, which include research and training by the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research.Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research website Agricultural Goals: 2011-2015 The Ethiopian Government set up the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) to reach certain goals between 2011 and 2015. Primarily, growth in the market should reach 8.1 percent per year during this time frame. This includes: bolstering smallholder farmers’ productivity, enhancing marketing systems, upgrading participation of private sector, increasing volume of irrigated land and curtailing amount of households with inadequate food. In addition, it is hoped that the number of key crops are doubled from 18.1m metric to 39.5m metric tonnes. These programs should also result in Ethiopia getting to middle income status by 2025. =Major cash crops= Coffee Coffee farmer Feleke Dukamo checks the latest coffee prices. The Ethiopia Commodity Exchange's new price information line already gets 40,000 calls a day from farmers like Feleke. Because he knows the price coffee is trading for in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, Feleke can drive a hard bargain with his buyers. (2011)The most important cash crop in Ethiopia was coffee. During the 1970s, coffee exports accounted for 50-60% of the total value of all exports, although coffee's share dropped to 25% as a result of the economic dislocation following the 1974 revolution. By 1976 coffee exports had recovered, and in the five years ending in 1988/89, 44% of the coffee grown was exported, accounting for about 63% of the value of exports. Domestically, coffee contributed about 20% of the government's revenue. Approximately 25% of Ethiopia's population depended directly or indirectly on coffee for its livelihood. Ethiopia's coffee is almost exclusively of the arabica type, which grows best at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Coffee grows wild in many parts of the country, although most Ethiopian coffee is produced in the Oromia Region (63.7%) and in the SNNPR (34.4%), with lesser amounts in the Gambela Region and around the city of Dire Dawa. The amount of coffee inspected in the fiscal year 2007/2008 by the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority (ECTA) was 230,247 tons, a decrease of almost 3% from the previous fiscal year's total of 236,714 tons.\\"National Statistical Abstract. Section D. Agriculture.\\", Table D.2. About 98 percent of the coffee was produced by peasants on smallholdings of less than a hectare, and the remaining 2 percent was produced by state farms. Some estimates indicated that yields on peasant farms were higher than those on state farms. In the 1980s, as part of an effort to increase production and to improve the cultivation and harvesting of coffee, the government created the Ministry of Coffee and Tea Development (now the ECTA), which was responsible for production and marketing. The ten-year plan called for an increase in the size of state farms producing coffee from 14,000-15,000 hectares to 50,000 hectares by 1994. However, beginning in 1987 the decline in world coffee prices, reduced Ethiopia's foreign-exchange earnings. In early 1989, for example, the price of one kilogram/US$0.58; of coffee was by June it had dropped to US$0.32. Mengistu told the 1989 WPE party congress that at US$0.32 per kilogram, foreign-exchange earnings from coffee would have dropped by 240 million Birr, and government revenue would have been reduced by 140 million Birr by the end of 1989. Pulses and oilseed Women and children pick green beans at the Dodicha Vegetable Cooperative in Ethiopia. The beans will be sold to a local exporter, who will sell them to supermarkets in Europe (2005)Before the Ethiopian Revolution, pulses and oilseeds played an important role, second only to coffee, in the country's exports. In EFY 1974/75, pulses and oilseeds accounted for 34% of export earnings (about 163 million Birr), but this share declined to about 3% (about 30 million Birr) in EFY 1988/89. Three factors contributed to the decline in the relative importance of pulses and oilseeds. First, the recurring droughts had devastated the country's main areas where pulses and oilseeds were grown. Second, because peasants faced food shortages, they gave priority to cereal staples to sustain themselves. Finally, although the production cost of pulses and oilseeds continued to rise, the government's price control policy left virtually unchanged the official procurement price of these crops, thus substantially reducing net income from them. In EFY 2007/2008, the CSA reported that 17,827,387.94 quintals of pulses were produced on 1,517,661.93 hectares, an increase from the 15,786,215.3 quintals produced on 1,379,045.77 hectares. In the same fiscal year, 707,059.29 hectares under cultivation produced 6,169,279.99 quintals of oilseeds, an increase from the previous year of 4,970,839.57 quintals grown on 741,790.98 hectares.\\"National Statistical Abstract. Section D. Agriculture.\\", Table D.1.1 In 2006/2007 (the latest year available), exports of oilseeds accounted for 15.78% of export earnings (or million 187.4 Birr) and pulses 5.92% (or 70.3 million Birr).\\"The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia: Statistical Appendix\\", p. 26 Flowers Ethiopia's flower industry has become a new source for export revenue. The industry began in 2004, when the government made an aggressive push for foreign investments by establishing a presence at major international floricultural events. Since then, export earnings from this sector have grown to about US$65 million in 2006/07 and are projected to double over the next few years. Ethiopia is well positioned because highland temperatures make it ideal for horticulture, the average wage rate is US$20 per month (compared to US$60 a month in India), the price of leased land is about US$13 per hectare, and the government has tremendously aided the entry of new businesses into this sector in recent years. As a result, a number of Indian entrepreneurs are relocating to Ethiopia to develop its thriving flower industry which has led to gains in market share at the expense of neighboring countries.\\"The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia: Selected Issues Series\\", International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 08/259, pp. 35f (accessed 4 February 2009) Khat plantation near Bahir Dar Khat  Another new source for export revenue is the production of chat, an amphetamine-like stimulant which is consumed both inside Ethiopia and in adjacent countries, and which is considered a drug of abuse that can lead to mild to moderate psychological dependence. In 2006/2007 (the latest year available), exports of chat accounted for 25% of export earnings (or 8oo million Birr). Cotton Cotton is grown throughout Ethiopia below elevations of about 1,400 meters. Because most of the lowlands lack adequate rainfall, cotton cultivation depends largely on irrigation. Before the revolution, large-scale commercial cotton plantations were developed in the Awash Valley and the Humera areas. The Tendaho Cotton Plantation in the lower Awash Valley was one of Ethiopia's largest cotton plantations. Rain-fed cotton also grew in Humera, Bilate, and Arba Minch. Since the revolution, most commercial cotton has been grown on irrigated state farms, mostly in the Awash Valley area. Production jumped from 43,500 tons in 1974/75 to 74,900 tons in 1984/85. Similarly, the area of cultivation increased from 22,600 hectares in 1974/75 to 33,900 hectares in 1984/85. =Major staple crops= Ethiopia's major staple crops include a variety of cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and coffee. Grains Teff harvest in northern Ethiopia (2007)Grains are the most important field crops and the chief element in the diet of most Ethiopians. The principal grains are teff, wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, and millet. The first three are primarily cool-weather crops cultivated at altitudes generally above 1,500 meters. Teff, indigenous to Ethiopia, furnishes the flour for enjera, an sourdough pancake-like bread that is the principal form in which grain is consumed in the highlands and in urban centers throughout the country. Barley is grown mostly between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. A major subsistence crop, barley is used as food and in the production of tella, a locally produced beer. Ethiopia's demand for grain continued to increase because of population pressures, while supply remained short, largely because of drought and government agricultural policies, such as price controls, which adversely affected crop production. Food production had consistently declined throughout the 1980s. Consequently, Ethiopia became a net importer of grain worth about 243 million Birr annually from 1983/84 to Separating wheat grain from hay in Mekele (2017) 1987/88. The food deficit estimate for the 1985/89 period indicated that production averaged about 6 million tons while demand reached about 10 million tons, thus creating an annual deficit of roughly 4 million tons. Much of the food deficit was covered through food aid. Between 1984/85 and 1986/87, at the height of the drought, Ethiopia received more than 1.7 million tons of grain, about 14 percent of the total food aid for Africa. In addition, Ethiopia spent 341 million Birr on food purchases during the 1985-87 period. Sorghum, millet, and corn Sorghum, millet, and corn are cultivated mostly in warmer areas at lower altitudes along the country's western, southwestern, and eastern peripheries. Sorghum and millet, which are drought resistant, grow well at low elevations where rainfall is less reliable. Corn is grown chiefly between elevations of 1,500 and 2,200 meters and requires large amounts of rainfall to ensure good harvests. These three grains constitute the staple foods of a good part of the population and are major items in the diet of the nomads. Pulses Pulses are the second most important element in the national diet and a principal protein source. They are boiled, roasted, or included in a stew-like dish known as wot, which is sometimes a main dish and sometimes a supplementary food. Pulses, grown widely at all altitudes from sea level to about 3,000 meters, are more prevalent in the northern and central highlands. Pulses were a particularly important export item before the revolution. major pulse crops grown in the country are chickpea, haricot beans, lentils, fababean and peas Vegetable oils The Ethiopian Orthodox Church traditionally has forbidden consumption of animal fats on many days of the year. As a result, vegetable oils are widely used, and oilseed cultivation is an important agricultural activity. The most important oilseed is the indigenous Niger seed (), which is grown on 50 percent or more of the area devoted to oilseeds. Niger seed is found mostly in the northern and central highlands at elevations between 1,800 and 2,500 meters. Flaxseed, also indigenous, is cultivated in the same general area as Niger seed. The third most important oilseed is sesame, which grows at elevations from sea level to about 1,500 meters. In addition to its domestic use, sesame is also the principal export oilseed. Oilseeds of lesser significance include castor beans, rapeseed, peanuts, and safflower and sunflower seeds. Most oilseeds are raised by small-scale farmers, but sesame was also grown by large-scale commercial farms before the era of land reform and the nationalization of agribusiness. Ensete (false banana) Ensete, known locally as false banana, is an important food source in Ethiopia's southern and southwestern highlands. It is cultivated principally by the Gurage, Sidama, and several other ethnic groups in the region. Resembling the banana but bearing an inedible fruit, the plant produces large quantities of starch in its underground rhizome and an above-ground stem that can reach a height of several meters. Ensete flour constitutes the staple food of the local people. Taro, yams, and sweet potatoes are commonly grown in the same region as the ensete. Other fruits and vegetables The consumption of vegetables and fruits is relatively limited, largely because of their high cost. Common vegetables include onions, peppers, squash, and a cabbage similar to kale. Demand for vegetables has stimulated truck farming around the main urban areas such as Addis Ababa and Asmera. Prior to the Revolution, urbanization increased the demand for fruit, leading to the establishment of citrus orchards in areas with access to irrigation in Shewa, Arsi, Hararghe, and Eritrea. The Mengistu regime encouraged fruit and vegetable production. Fresh fruits, including citrus and bananas, as well as fresh and frozen vegetables, became important export items, but their profitability was marginal. The Ethiopian Fruit and Vegetable Marketing Enterprise, which handled about 75 percent of Ethiopia's exports of fruits and vegetables in 1984–85, had to receive government subsidies because of losses. =Livestock= With the extra money he gets for his coffee – up nine-fold since the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange started – farmer Feleke Dukamo has been able to buy a few animals to provide milk and meat for his family (2011)Livestock production plays an important role in Ethiopia's economy. Estimates for 1987 indicated that livestock production contributed one-third of agriculture's share of GDP, or nearly 15 percent of total GDP. In the 2006/2007 EFY hides, skins and leather products made up 7.5% of the total export value; live animals accounted for 3.1% of the total value of exports during the same period. Although varying from region to region, the role of livestock in the Ethiopian economy was greater than the figures suggest. Almost the entire rural population was involved in some way with animal husbandry, whose role included the provision of draft power, food, cash, transportation, fuel, and, especially in pastoral areas, social prestige. In the highlands, oxen provided draft power in crop production. In pastoral areas, livestock formed the basis of the economy. Per capita meat consumption was high by developing countries' standards, an estimated thirteen kilograms annually. According to a 1987 estimate, beef accounted for about 51% of all meat consumption, followed by mutton and lamb (19%), poultry (15%), and goat (14%). Ethiopia's estimated livestock population is often said to be the largest in Africa.See, for example, Central Statistical Authority of Ethiopia, \\"Livestock Sample Survey (AgLVS 2006), version 1.0\\" , December 2007 (accessed 3 January 2009) It is estimated to number over 150 million in 2007/2008. Excluding the Afar and Somali Regions, there were approximately 47.5 million cattle, 26.1 million sheep, 21.7 million goats, 2.1 million horses and mules, 5.6 million donkeys, 1 million camels, and 39.6 million poultry. For the later two Regions, estimated numbers vary greatly between conventional and aerial censuses, but total less than 15% of the non-nomadic Regions. Though the raising of livestock always has been largely a subsistence activity,\\"National Statistical Abstract. Section D.

Brighter Green, 6.http://brightergreen.org Herding livestock to market Ethiopia has great potential for increased livestock production, both for local use and for export. However, expansion was constrained by inadequate nutrition, disease, a lack of support services such as extension services, insufficient data with which to plan improved services, and inadequate information on how to improve animal breeding, marketing, and processing. The high concentration of animals in the highlands, together with the fact that cattle are often kept for status, reduces the economic potential of Ethiopian livestock. While efforts are being made to intensify and industrialize the sector, questions arise as to how Ethiopia can develop and expand its livestock population when Ethiopians already struggle to gain access to good soil, grazing land, and water.Mia MacDonald and Justine Simon (2010) Climate, Food Security, & Growth: Ethiopia's Complex Relationship with Livestock. Brighter Green, 2.http://brightergreen.org As Ethiopia increasingly experiences the effects of climate change, drought, and desertification, experts predict that \\"Ethiopia will have to open its markets to grain imports in order to keep up with the growing demand for meat, milk, and eggs.\\".USGC Reps Meet With Ethiopian Feed Industry to Assess Market Barriers . Grainnet.com. 2009-4-10. Retrieved 2011-01-12. Both the imperial and the Marxist governments tried to improve livestock production by instituting programs such as free vaccination, well-digging, construction of feeder roads, and improvement of pastureland, largely through international organizations such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank. During Derg rule, veterinary stations were opened at Bahir Dar, Bedele, and Bishoftu to provide treatment and vaccination services. Cattle in Ethiopia are almost entirely of the zebu type and are poor sources of milk and meat. However, these cattle do relatively well under the traditional production system. About 70 percent of the cattle in 1987 were in the highlands (commonly involved in transhumance), and the remaining 30 percent were kept by nomadic pastoralists in the lowland areas. Meat and milk yields are low and losses high, especially among calves and young stock. Contagious diseases and parasitic infections are major causes of death, factors that are exacerbated by malnutrition and starvation. Recurring drought takes a heavy toll on the animal population, although it is difficult to determine the extent of losses. Practically all animals are range-fed. During the rainy seasons, water and grass are generally plentiful, but with the onset of the dry season, forage is generally insufficient to keep animals nourished and able to resist disease.Wubne, Mulatu. \\"Agriculture\\" (and subsections), updated with latest figures from the CSA. Most of Ethiopia's estimated 48 million sheep and goats are raised by small farmers who used them as a major source of meat and cash income. About three-quarters of the total sheep flock is in the highlands, whereas lowland pastoralists maintain about three- quarters of the goat herd. Both animals have high sales value in urban centers, particularly during holidays such as Easter and New Year's Day. Most of the estimated 7.5 million equines (horses, mules, and donkeys) are used to transport produce and other agricultural goods. Camels also play a key role as pack animals in areas below 1,500 meters in elevation. Additionally, camels provide pastoralists in those areas with milk and meat. Poultry farming is widely practiced in Ethiopia; almost every farmstead keeps some poultry for consumption and for cash sale. The highest concentration of poultry is in Shewa, in central Wollo, and in northwestern Tigray. Individual poultry farms supply eggs and meat to urban dwellers. By 1990 the state had begun to develop large poultry farms, mostly around Addis Ababa, to supply hotels and government institutions. Multinational agribusinesses supply these industrial poultry farms with high yielding breeds, such as Rhode Island Reds and White Leghorns. However, herding cattle is one of the agricultural activities that resorts to indentured labor and particularly child labor according to the U.S. Department of Labor. With 22% of children aged 5 to 14 working in the informal sector, the Department reported that \\"government efforts to address child labor have not sufficiently targeted sectors with a high incidence of child labor\\", and cattle herding still figures among the goods listed in the DOL's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor published in December 2014. Researchers found however that, since transhumance takes place in summer, during school holidays, the transhumance in itself does not affect schooling. Young herders take their text books of the upcoming school year to the grazing grounds. Among the popular games on the grasslands, football (introduced via schools) tends to replace the traditional game. Furthermore, cropping has become more intensive and needs more labour; the establishment of exclosures and the expansion of cropland have led to less grazing grounds. Hence, fewer people send their cattle in transhumance.  Traditional farming tools in Ethiopia  Almost all farming tools in Ethiopia are traditional and made from different types of wood. These tools includes sickle, pick axe, plough shaft, ploughshare, plow, beam and animal force as a machines. The plough shaft, beam and ploughshare are made of wood and the sickle, pick axe, plow are made of metal. Ploughing the land using these tools is ambiguous and time-consuming.Plough tool According to Ethiopia farming, this ploughing the land to prepare the soil for sow requires around two quarter of a year. ploughing the land to soften the land takes three months and from sowing and seedling to the harvesting of the crops requires three to four months. Ethiopian farmers plough their land by combining the above tools for such three months to get yearly consumed food. The major product in are teff, wheat, maize, sesame, Niger, linseed etc. in addition to these cereals, they produce different types of fruits and coffee which are not seasonal.Traditional farm tool Government marketing operations Private traders and the Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC), established in 1976, marketed Ethiopia's agricultural output. The AMC was a government agency whose objective was to influence the supply and price of crops. It purchased grain from peasant associations at fixed prices. The AMC set quotas of grain purchases to be delivered by peasant associations and cooperatives and also bought from private wholesalers, who were required to sell half of their purchases at predetermined prices. State farms sold their output to the AMC. Although the AMC had agents in all regions, it was particularly active in the major cereal producing regions, namely, Gojjam, Shewa, Arsi, and Gondar. In 1981/82, out of the AMC's purchases of 257,000 tons of grain, Gojjam accounted for 32 percent of the purchases, and Arsi, Shewa, and Gonder accounted for 23%, 22%, and 10%, respectively. The government's price controls and the AMC's operations had led to the development of different price systems at various levels. For instance, the 1984/85 official procurement price for 100 kilograms of teff was 42 birr at the farm level and 60 birr when the AMC purchased it from wholesalers. But the same quantity of teff retailed at 81 birr at food stores belonging to the urban dwellers' associations (kebeles) in Addis Ababa and sold for as much as 181 birr in the open market. Such wide price variations created food shortages because farmers as well as private merchants withheld crops to sell on the black market at higher prices.

Outside these areas, the domestic market for fish is small. Two factors account for this low level of local fish consumption. First, fish has not been integrated into the diet of most of the population. Second, because of religious influences on consumption patterns, the demand for fish is only seasonal. During Lent, for example, Christians who abstain from eating meat, milk, and eggs consume fish. Although the Second Five-Year Agricultural Development Plan (2001-2005) laid down a number of targets to improve the yield of Ethiopia's fisheries, a number of problems remain to be overcome. Federal and state laws regarding commercial fishing did not exist until 2002/2003. This has led to localized overfishing. Some commercially important species are already suffering from overexploitation, including Nile perch in Lake Chamo, and tilapia in Lakes Awasa and Zway.

Ever since Delrita moved to Tangle Nook, Missouri, her mother has been hounding her to make friends, but Delrita is hiding a secret: she lives with her Uncle Punky, who has Down's syndrome. Delrita is worried that if people find out they'll make fun of Punky, something she's spent her entire life trying to prevent. As a way of protecting Punky, Delrita has made herself socially invisible, refusing friendship offers and certainly not making any of her own. She is a lonely, sad girl, but she fears that letting anyone new into her life will only bring her pain. When Avanelle finally catches up to Delrita and invites her over for a snack, Delrita rudely turns her down. In the days that follow, Delrita learns a lot about Avanelle and her family: they live on the outskirts of town, have a houseful of kids, are on welfare, and have a father in prison. Even though the girls are kindred spirits - both with a secret to hide - Delrita refuses to befriend her, or anyone else. A few weeks later, Delrita's parents take her and Punky to Silver Dollar City, an old fashioned city where a master woodcarver works. Delrita's favorite hobby is whittling wood, so she's very excited about the excursion. Her parents drop her and Punky off before heading further north to an antique fair. The day couldn't be any better for Delrita: she and Punky ride rides, eat junk food, and best of all, visit the woodcarver's workshop, which is a source of great inspiration for Delrita. When they are supposed to meet Delrita's parents, however, Delrita has a nagging suspicion that something is wrong. As the minutes, and soon hours, tick by with no sign of her parents, Delrita knows something terrible has happened. Then she receives the news: her parents have been killed in a car accident. She and Punky are sent to live with Delrita's Uncle Bert (Punky's brother) and Aunt Queenie. Delrita has a very difficult time adjusting to living with her uncle and aunt, mainly because Aunt Queenie's fastidious nature clashes with Punky's messy eating and habits. Delrita is outraged when her Aunt and Uncle suggest that Punky would do well at a sheltered workshop: a place for handicapped adults. Delrita's mother had dedicated her life to caring for Punky, and now Aunt Queenie wants to send him away. Delrita swears that she will stop at nothing to protect Punky, no matter the cost. Feeling desperately alone, Delrita finally accepts Avanelle's offer to come over after school. The girls become fast friends, and Delrita soon develops a crush on Avanelle's older brother, Tree. For a few weeks, Delrita catches glimmers of real happiness as she enjoys her first friend, whose entire family accepts Punky as he is without making fun of him or asking him to change. Unfortunately, a misunderstanding with one of Avanelle's letters to her father in prison breaks up the happy friendship around the same time that Aunt Queenie succeeds in sending Punky to the workshop. Delrita feels as if her world is falling apart again. At Aunt Queenie's insistence, Delrita accompanies Punky to work one morning and finds that it is a very happy place: he has friends, a girlfriend, and a sense of pride he never had before. Delrita is ashamed for the way she's been sheltering Punky, and she realizes that her own fears of rejection have caused her to hide behind Punky's handicap, using his difference as an excuse to separate herself from society. She vows to change, but unfortunately, Avanelle is unwilling to forgive her. As the weeks pass, Delrita resigns herself to becoming invisible once again. And then everything changes, once again: Delrita receives the terrible news that Punky has had a heart attack. A few days later, Delrita's best friend and uncle passes away. The entire city shows up for his funeral, and Delrita realizes that Punky was well-loved by his community. At the close of the ceremony, she runs into the arms of Avanelle, who has realized that Delrita's friendship means everything to her, too.

There is a history of the parish, written by Percy Millican, bearing the descriptive title 'The History of Horstead and Stanninghall'. ;Horstead Horstead () is today a large dormitory village of Norwich. It contains a public house, a butchers, a florists, two garages and a garden equipment store. ;Stanninghall Stanninghall () contains an old farmhouse, on the site of a medieval manor house which acquired the title of 'Stanninghall Hall', the remains of a church tower and a number of council houses. In the inter-war years, it was an isolation settlement for people suffering from tuberculosis. Millican states that the church was allowed to fall down by the family at the Hall who were Roman Catholics. Horstead Mill Horstead is well known for its mill which is used for recreational activities like kayaking/canoeing, fishing and swimming. The mill was gutted by fire in 1963 which burnt most of the mill and for health and safety reasons more of the mill had to be destroyed after the fire. The mill was bought with a lottery fund of £105,000 in 1997 after the parish council requested a grant. The mill is now open to the public and there is a small walk around the mill and the site is also the start of a walk along the river which ends up at Brampton. Wildlife in Horstead with Stanninghall Horstead has a variety of wildlife, as it is near the Broads and has many types of habitat and many undisturbed areas.

The clearing of land for agricultural use and the cutting of trees for fuel gradually changed the scene, and today forest areas have dwindled to less than 4% of Ethiopia's total land. The northern parts of the highlands are almost devoid of trees. However, about 45,000 square kilometres of dense forest exist in the southern and southwestern sections of the highlands. Some of these include coniferous forests, found at elevations above l,600 meters, but a majority of the forestland consists primarily of woodlands found in drier areas of the highlands and in the drier areas bordering the highlands.Wubne, Mulatu. \\"Forestry\\". A Country Study: Ethiopia (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds.) Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1991). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.. Lumber from the coniferous forests is important to the construction industry. The broadleaf evergreen forests furnish timber that is used in construction and in the production of plywood. The woodlands are a major source of firewood and charcoal. Certain trees --boswellia and species of commiphora—are of special economic significance. Both grow in the arid lowlands and produce gums that are the bases for frankincense and myrrh. A species of acacia found in several parts of the country is a source of gum arabic used in the manufacture of adhesives, pharmaceutical products, and confectionery. The eucalyptus, an exotic tree introduced in the late nineteenth century and grown mainly near urban areas, is a valuable source of telephone and telegraph poles, tool handles, furniture, and firewood. It is also a major source of the material from which fiberboard and particleboard are made. Data on forestry's contribution to the economy are not readily available, largely because most GDP tables aggregate data on forestry, fishing, and hunting. In 1980/81 forestry accounted for 2.5% of GDP at constant 1960/61 factor cost and 5.4% of the share attributable to the agricultural sector. Before 1974 about half of the forestland was privately owned or claimed, and roughly half was held by the government. There was little government control of forestry operations prior to the Ethiopian revolution. The 1975 land reform nationalized forestland and sawmills, which existed mostly in the south. The government controlled harvesting of forestland, and in some cases individuals had to secure permits from local peasant associations to cut trees. But this measure encouraged illegal logging and accelerated the destruction of Ethiopia's remaining forests. To ensure that conservation activity conformed with government policy and directives on land use, reforestation programs were organized through the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development or district offices that planned, coordinated, and monitored all work. The local peasant associations lacked decision-making authority. Reforestation Reforestation programs resulted in the planting of millions of seedlings in community forests throughout Ethiopia. A variety of Non Governmental Organizations, which had to organize their activities through the local peasant association, supplemented government efforts to rehabilitate Ethiopia's forests. However, critics maintain that both systems caused communal resources to be developed at the expense of private needs. As a result, reforestation programs did not perform well. Seedling survival rates varied from as low as 5 to 20% in some areas to 40% in others, largely because of inadequate care and premature cutting by locals. In late 1990, Addis Ababa was in the process of launching the Ethiopian Forestry Action Plan (EFAP) to improve woodland conservation, increase public participation in reforestation projects, and prevent further depletion of existing forest resources. It remained to be seen whether this plan would improve the state of Ethiopia's forests.

Biography  Panagiotis was born in Andritsaina around 1790 and was part of a poor family. In 1808 emigrated with his family to Smyrna (Izmir, Turkey) while he attended a school in Constantinople (Istanbul, Turkey). He then relocated to Odessa where he worked at the drapery shop of Athanassios Sekeris, a wealthy Greek of Constantinople. There he met Nikolaos Skoufas with whom he was initiated into Filiki Eteria. As a member of Filiki Eteria he initiated members that would be proved valuable for it in the future. He undertook important activities in Odessa, in Vlachia, and in Italy, where he came in contact with Pisa's circle. From very early, Anagnostopoulos, clashed with Xanthos, an antagonism that would continue and in the next years, as well as with Papaflessas. His role in taking the decision for the murder of Nikolaos Galatis was important, while he had initiated Anagnostaras, Demetropoulos and Sekeris. With the start of the Greek War of Independence, Anagnostopoulos, though he was friendly to the wing of Maurokordate, penetrated in the alliance of Alexander Ypsilantis, whom he had escorted on his arrival in Peloponnese. He fought side to side with Theodoros Kolokotronis and Anagnostaras. The negotiations about the fall of Tripolitsa, in which Anagnostopoulos participated, projected him as a great political figure. In the third National Assembly he refused to sign the bill for British protection. In 1828 Anagnostopoulos was assigned by Kapodistrias temporary commissioner-governor (prefect of Ilieia), while later he took other political positions such as that of Euboia's administrator and governor of Achaia and Ilidos. = Dispute with Xanthos = In 1834 the historian Ioannis Philimon issued the \\"Historical Essay of Filiki Eteria,\\" in which he mentioned as the first triad of the society Skoufas-Tsakalov-Anagnostopoulos. Emmanuel Xanthos, who lived abroad at the time issued \\"Xantho's apology\\" in order to answer Philimon's claim, and by extension that of Anagnostopoulos. With an article in newspaper Aeon, Philimon, in his effort to reinstate Xanthos, admitted that he was unfair to him. Anagnostopoulos, in an unpublished article, with the title \\"General Observations\\" criticized Xanthos for not being in the founding members of Filiki Eteria and accuses him of financial malpractices. The truth about who was initiated first in the Filiki Eteria is of this day unknown since the opinions of historians are divided, while the archived documents are few and sometimes unreliable to answer with certainty. = Death = Anagnostopoulos died in 1854 in Athens from cholera, brought to Greece by the English-French army occupying Piraeus during the Crimean War. In 1884, he was honoured with a central road in Kolonaki.

Various factors – including the lack of basic infrastructure, the dearth of private and public investment, and the lack of any consistent public policy aimed at promoting industrial development – contributed to the insignificance of manufacturing. Five-year plans In 1957, Ethiopia initiated a series of five-year development plans. Throughout much of the 1960s and early 1970s, manufacturing activity increased as the government's five-year plans diversified the economy by encouraging agro-industrial activity and by substituting domestically produced goods for imported items. Thus, according to the World Bank, manufacturing production increased at an annual rate of 6.1 percent between 1965 and 1973. During the same period, agriculture grew at an annual 2.1 percent rate, and services grew at an annual 6.7 percent rate. Despite this favorable growth rate, manufacturing in 1975 accounted for less than 5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and employed only about 60,000 people. Handicrafts, such as weaving, pottery, blacksmithing, leather working, and jewelry making, along with other small- scale industries, accounted for another 5 percent of GDP. In 1984/85 manufacturing and handicrafts together accounted for 11.4 percent of GDP.Wubne, Mulatu. \\"Agriculture\\". A Country Study: Ethiopia (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, editors). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1991). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.. Nationalization In 1975 the Derg nationalized more than 100 industries and took partial control of some of them. The main characteristics of the manufacturing sector inherited by the revolution included: a predominance of foreign ownership and foreign managerial, professional, and technical staffing; great emphasis on light industries; inward orientation and relatively high tariffs; capital-intensiveness; underutilized capacity; minimal linkage among the different sectors; and excessive geographical concentration of industries in Addis Ababa, the capital city. Exodus of foreigners Following nationalization, there was an exodus of foreigners who had owned and operated the industrial enterprises. The war in Eritrea and labor strikes and demonstrations also closed the approximately 30 percent of the country's manufacturers that had been located in that region. Economic dislocation The economic dislocation that followed the revolution had a significant impact on the manufacturing sector. Private sector capital investment ceased, and labor's marginal productivity began to decline. In performance terms, the manufacturing sector's output after 1975 grew haltingly. Manufacturing had grown at an average annual rate of 6.1 percent between 1965 and 1973. A period of decline from 1974/75 to 1977/78 and an average annual growth rate of 18.9 percent for 1978/79 and 1979/80 were followed by a reduction of the growth rate to about 3.1 percent per annum between 1980/81 and 1984/85 and 3.8 percent per annum from 1985/86 to 1988/89. Manufacturing productivity Socialist economy Finally, in March 1990 president Mengistu Haile Mariam announced the replacement of Ethiopia's communist economic system with a socialist economic system. Among the proposed changes were that private investors would be permitted to participate in all parts of the economy with no limit on the amount of capital invested.

This new policy provided investor benefits in the form of tax exemptions, remittances of foreign exchange, import and export duty relief, tax exemptions on dividends, and the provision of financing through the Ethiopian Investment Corporation and the Development Bank of Ethiopia. In addition, the government guaranteed protection to industrial enterprises by instituting high tariffs and by banning the importation of commodities that might adversely affect production of domestic goods. Protected items included sugar, textiles, furniture, and metal. The government also participated through direct investment in enterprises that had high capital costs, such as oil refineries and the paper and pulp, glass and bottle, tire, and cement industries. In 1963, with the Second Five-Year Plan under way, the government enacted Proclamation No. 51. The proclamation's objective was to consolidate other investment policies enacted up to that period, to extend benefits to Ethiopian investors (previous legislation had limited the benefits to foreigners only), and to create an Investment Committee that would oversee investment programs. In 1966 the Ethiopian government enacted Proclamation No. 242, which elevated the Investment Committee's status as an advisory council to that of an authorized body empowered to make independent investment decisions. Thus, by the early 1970s, Ethiopia's industrialization policy included a range of fiscal incentives, direct government investment, and equity participation in private enterprises.Wubne, Mulatu. \\"Agriculture\\". A Country Study: Ethiopia (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, editors). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1991). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.. The government's policy attracted considerable foreign investment to the industrial sector. For instance, in 1971/72 the share of foreign capital in manufacturing industries amounted to 41 percent of the total paid-up capital. Many foreign enterprises operated as private limited companies, usually as a branch or subsidiary of multinational corporations. The Dutch had a major investment (close to 80 percent) in the sugar industry. Italian and Japanese investors participated in textiles; and Greeks maintained an interest in shoes and beverages. Italian investors also worked in building, construction, and agricultural industries.  Under the Derg  In 1975 the Derg nationalized most industries and subsequently reorganized them into state-owned corporations. On February 7, 1975, the government released a document outlining Ethiopia's new economic policy, which was explicitly socialist in philosophy and intent. The policy identified three manufacturing areas slated for state involvement: basic industries that produced goods serving other industries and that had the capacity to create linkages in the economy; industries that produced essential goods for the general population; and industries that made drugs, medicine, tobacco, and beverages. The policy also grouped areas of the public and private sectors into activities reserved for the state, activities where state and private capital could operate jointly, and activities left to the private sector. The 1975 nationalization of major industries scared off foreign private investment. Private direct investment, according to the National Bank of Ethiopia, declined from 65 million birr in 1974 to 12 million in 1977. As compensation negotiations between the Ethiopian government and foreign nationals dragged on, foreign investment virtually ceased. The United States Congress invoked the Hickenlooper Amendment, which had the effect of prohibiting the use of United States funds for development purposes until Ethiopia had settled compensation issues with United States nationals. During 1982 and 1983, the Ethiopian government settled claims made by Italian, Dutch, Japanese, and British nationals. Negotiation to settle compensation claims by United States nationals continued until 1985, when Ethiopia agreed to pay about US$ 7 million in installments to compensate United States companies. Issued in 1983, the Derg's Proclamation No. 235 (the Joint Venture Proclamation) signaled Ethiopia's renewed interest in attracting foreign capital. The proclamation offered incentives such as a five-year period of income tax relief for new projects, import and export duty relief, tariff protection, and repatriation of profits and capital. It limited foreign holdings to a maximum of 49 percent and the duration of any joint venture to twenty-five years. Although the proclamation protected investors' interests from expropriation, the government reserved the right to purchase all shares in a joint venture \\"for reasons of national interest.\\" The proclamation failed to attract foreign investment, largely because foreign businesses were hesitant to invest in a country whose government recently had nationalized foreign industries without a level of compensation these businesses considered satisfactory. In 1989 the government issued Special Decree No. 11, a revision of the 1983 proclamation. The decree allowed majority foreign ownership in many sectors, except in those related to public utilities, banking and finance, trade, transportation, and communications, where joint ventures were not allowed. The decree also removed all restrictions on profit repatriation and attempted to provide more extensive legal protection of investors than had the 1983 proclamation. President Haile Mariam Mengistu's March 1990 speech to the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Ethiopia was a turning point in Ethiopia's recent economic history. Acknowledging that socialism had failed, Mengistu proposed implementing a mixed economy. Under the new system, the private sector would be able to participate in all parts of the economy with no limit on capital investment (Ethiopia had a US$ 250,000 ceiling on private investment); developers would be allowed to build houses, apartments, and office buildings for rent or sale; and commercial enterprises would be permitted to develop industries, hotels, and a range of other enterprises on government-owned land to be leased on a concessionary basis. Additionally, state-owned industries and businesses would be required to operate on a profit basis, with those continuing to lose money to be sold or closed. Farmers would receive legal ownership of land they tilled and the right to sell their produce in a free market. Whereas there were many areas yet to be addressed, such as privatization of state enterprises and compensation for citizens whose land and property had been confiscated, these proposals generated optimism among some economists about Ethiopia's economic future. However, some observers pointed out that Mengistu's proposals only amounted to recognition of existing practices in the underground economy.

As the population of Ethiopia has increased in the twentieth century, the need to move inhabitants has only increased as available cropland per family declined to its current level of less than one hectare per farmer. Precursors The policy of encouraging voluntary resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia began in 1958, when the government established the first known planned resettlement in Sidamo Province. Resettlement under the Derg Shortly after the 1974 revolution, as part of their policy of land reform it became Derg policy to accelerate resettlement. Article 18 of the 1975 Land Reform Proclamation stated that \\"the government shall have the responsibility to settle peasants or to establish cottage industries to accommodate those who, as a result of distribution of land . . . remain with little or no land.\\" Accordingly, in 1975/76 there were eighty- eight settlement centers accommodating 38,818 households. The government conducted most of these resettlement programs under the auspices of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. By 1982 there were 112 planned settlements populated by more than 120,000 people. The settlements were concentrated mainly in the south and southwest. In 1984 Addis Ababa announced its intention to resettle 1.5 million people from the drought-affected northern regions to the south and southwest, where arable land was plentiful. By 1986, according to Mulatu Wubne, the government had resettled more than 600,000 people. More than 250,000 went to Welega; about 150,000 settled in the Gambela area of Illubabor; and just over 100,000 went to Pawe, the largest planned resettlement in Gojjam and largely sustained by Italian financial support. In addition, another 78,000 went to Kaffa, Shewa, and western Begemder.Mulatu Wubne. \\"Resettlement and villagization\\". A Country Study: Ethiopia (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, editors). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1991). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.. In mid-1986 the government halted the resettlement program, largely to fend off the negative reaction from the international community. Richard Pankhurst, in his review of the book Politics and the Ethiopian Famine, 1984-1985, notes that some critics of the regime at the time compared \\"the resettlement centres to Hitler's concentration camps\\", and having visited them noted that Ethiopia is \\"a poor and economically underdeveloped country. Resettlement is therefore being carried out 'on a shoe-string', and the centres, like the country at large, face many difficulties.\\"Richard Pankhurst, \\"The Ethiopian Famine: Cultural Survival's New Report\\", Anthropology Today, vol. 2 No. 3 (June 1986), pp. 4-5 But in November 1987 the program resumed, and in March 1988 Mengistu Haile Mariam spoke of the need to move at least 7 million people; 100,000 - 200,000 were resettled when the program resumed in 1987 and March 1988 when it was suspended.Gebru Tereke, The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 149 n.28 He claimed resettlement would resolve the country's recurring drought problem and would ease population pressure from northern areas where the land had been badly overused. Western donors and governments, whom Addis Ababa expected to help with the program, remained apprehensive of the government's intentions, however. Some believed that the plan to resettle 1.5 million people by 1994 was unrealistic, given the country's strained finances. Others argued that resettlement was a ploy to depopulate areas of unrest in the ongoing conflict, particularly in Eritrea and Tigray. Additional arguments against resettlement included charges of human rights violations, forced separations of families, and lack of medical attention in resettlement centers, which resulted in thousands of deaths from malaria and sleeping sickness. Gebru Tareke, studying the government records of this resettlement program, provides a more accurate picture. \\"Between 1984 and 1986,\\" he writes, \\"594,190 people were hastily, forcibly, and pitilessly uprooted from the cool, dry highlands of Shewa, Tigray, and Wello to the hot, wet lowlands of Gojjam, Illubabor, Kafa and Wellega, and an estimated cost of 767 million birr (US $374 million).\\"Gebru Tareke, Ethiopian Revolution, p. 149 Of this number, the largest group 367,016 or 62% came from Wollo; 108,241 or 18% from Shewa; 89,716 or 15% from Tigray. \\"The seven sites for settlement were randomly selected by Mengistu and Legesse Asfaw. No ecologists, agronomists, horticulturalists, economists, or anthropologists were consulted, and no consent from either the resettlers or the host population was solicited.\\" The new settlers encountered harsh conditions: as many as 33,000 or 5.5% died from starvation and tropical diseases, while at least 84,000 or 14% more are believed to have fled these new settlements.Gebru Tereke, Ethiopian Revolution, pp. 150 As for the claims that the resettlement was primarily motivated to depopulate the rebel areas, or to establish buffer areas against the rebel groups, Gebru is largely dismissive, noting that no people were removed from Eritrea, for example, and that the population transferred from Tigray and Wollo were too small to have made any meaningful difference. =Villagization in the 1980s= In 1985 the government initiated a new relocation program known as villagization. The objectives of the program, which grouped scattered farming communities throughout the country into small village clusters, were to promote rational land use; conserve resources; provide access to clean water and to health and education services; and strengthen security. Government guidelines stipulated that villages were to house 200 to 300 households, with 100-square-meter compounds for each family. In 1985 Addis Ababa established a national coordinating committee to oversee the villagization plan's implementation. By March 1986, about 4.6 million people in Shewa, Arsi, and Hararghe had been relocated into more than 4,500 villages. Although the government had villagized about 13 million people by 1989, international criticism, deteriorating security conditions, and lack of resources doomed the plan to failure. Nevertheless, Mengistu remained committed to the villagization concept. Opponents of villagization argued that the scheme was disruptive to agricultural production because the government moved many farmers during the planting and harvesting seasons. There also was concern that villagization could have a negative impact on fragile local resources, particularly on water and grazing land; accelerate the spread of communicable diseases; and increase problems with plant pests and diseases. In early 1990, the government essentially abandoned villagization when it announced new economic policies that called for free-market reforms and a relaxation of centralized planning. The pressure on large-scale state farms was under attack by Western donors, who channeled their agricultural aid to the peasant sector. These donors maintained that experiences elsewhere in Africa and in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union had shown that state farms were inefficient and a drain on scarce resources. Voluntary resettlement in the 2000s Voluntary resettlement programs were renewed in the mid-2000s, as the government encouraged farmers to move from less productive to more productive regions.\\"ETHIOPIA: Rural resettlement programme criticised\\" (IRIN-Africa), March 1, 2004, accessed on July 17, 2011 Some new settlements showed promise;\\"Resettlement as a Response to Food Insecurity\\" , UN-EUE Report May/June 2003 (accessed 19 February 2009) however, at others the problems of self-sufficiency once again reared their heads.\\"Nutrition Survey Report of Chewaka Resettlement Area Bedele Woreda, Illubabur Zone\\", May 2004, pp. 3f (accessed 27 February 2009) See also *Agriculture in Ethiopia References Further reading * John M.

This was due, in part, to the small size of its industrial working force (which was estimated to number 15,583 in 1957), but more importantly because the Ethiopian government viewed any type of organized protest as a form of insurrection.Edmond J. Keller, Revolutionary Ethiopia: From Empire to People's Republic (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 147. Although the 1955 constitution guaranteed the right to form workers' associations, it was not until 1962 that the Ethiopian government issued the Labor Relations Decree, which authorized trade unions. In April 1963, the imperial authorities recognized the Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions (CELU), which represented twenty-two industrial labor groups. By 1973 CELU had 167 affiliates with approximately 80,000 members, which represented only about 30 percent of all eligible workers.Wubne, Mulatu. \\"Labor Unions\\". A Country Study: Ethiopia (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, editors). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1991). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.. The CELU drew its membership from not only the railway workers, but included workers at the Addis Ababa Fiber Mills, Indo-Ethiopian Textiles, Wonji Sugar Plantation, Ethiopian Airlines and General Ethiopian Transport (also known as the Anbassa Bus Company).Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (London: James Currey, 2001),p. 200 CELU never evolved into a national federation of unions. Instead, it remained an association of labor groups organized at the local level. The absence of a national constituency, coupled with other problems such as corruption, embezzlement, election fraud, ethnic and regional discrimination, and inadequate finances, prevented CELU from challenging the status quo in the industrial sector. Further, both management and government officials treated the unions with contempt. As Keller notes, \\"The government was slow to revise archaic labor laws such as those which dealt with child labor and the minimum wage. Union leaders were harassed, and when unions threatened to strike, they were 'locked out.'\\" CELU had organized general strikes in 1964, and 1970, but each time failed to attract necessary widespread support. After 1972 CELU became more militant as drought and famine caused the death of up to 200,000 people. The government responded by using force to crush labor protests, strikes, and demonstrations. This militancy peaked with the successful general strike of 7–11 March 1975, which not only led to salary and pension increases, but played an important role in the Ethiopian Revolution and helped to discredit the regime of Emperor Haile Selassie. Although many of its members supported the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie, the CELU came to ally itself with the radical intelligentsia in pressuring the Derg to share power. The CELU also demanded shop-floor control over production. Despite numerous strikes in and around Addis Ababa, which sometimes ended in bloody confrontations, on May 19, 1975, the Derg temporarily closed CELU headquarters on the grounds that the union needed to be reorganized. The military authorities also demanded that workers should elect their future leaders according to the aims and objectives of Ethiopian socialism. This order ostensibly did not rescind traditional workers' rights, such as the right to organize freely, to strike, and to bargain collectively over wages and working conditions. Instead, the intent was to control the political activities of the CELU leadership. As expected, CELU rejected these actions and continued to demand democratic changes and civilian rights. After battling one another for most of the year, the Derg at last decreed a curfew and martial law on 30 September, and arrested 1,500 union members; although the CELU responded with a general strike, it failed to gather support in the main industrial sectors. As Rene Lafort concludes, \\"The CELU was dead. The Labour Code promulgated on 6 December 1975 was its obituary.\\"Lefort, Ethiopia: An Heretical Revolution? translated by A.M. Berrett (London: Zed Press, 1983), p. 136 On 8 January 1977, the Derg replaced the CELU (abolished December 1975) with the All- Ethiopia Trade Union (AETU). The AETU had 1,341 local chapters, known as workers' associations, with a total membership of 287,000, or twice as large as CELU had been. The government maintained that the AETU's purpose was to educate workers about the need to contribute their share to national development by increasing productivity and building socialism. In 1978 the Derg replaced the AETU executive committee after charging it with political sabotage, abuse of authority, and failure to abide by the rules of democratic centralism. In 1982 a further restructuring of the AETU occurred when Addis Ababa issued the Trade Unions' Organization Proclamation. An uncompromising Marxist–Leninist document, this proclamation emphasized the need \\"to enable workers to discharge their historical responsibility in building the national economy by handling with care the instruments of production as their produce, and by enhancing the production and proper distribution of goods and services.\\" A series of meetings and elections culminated in a national congress in June 1982, at which the government replaced the leadership of the AETU. In 1986 the government renamed the AETU the Ethiopia Trade Union (ETU). In 1983/84 the AETU claimed a membership of 313,434. The organization included nine industrial groups, the largest of which was manufacturing, which had accounted for 29.2 percent of the membership in 1982/83, followed by agriculture, forestry, and fishing with 26.6 percent, services with 15.1 percent, transportation with 8.1 percent, construction with 8.0 percent, trade with 6.2 percent, utilities with 3.7 percent, finance with 2.4 percent, and mining with 0.7 percent. A total of 35.6 percent of the members lived in Addis Ababa and another 18.0 percent in Shewa. Eritrea and Tigray accounted for no more than 7.5 percent of the total membership. By the late 1980s, the AETU had failed to regain the activist reputation its predecessors had won in the 1970s. According to one observer, this political quiescence probably indicated that the government had successfully co-opted the trade unions. Current status In 2000 a private company dissolved its labor union after a disagreement between management and the workers. A total of 586 workers were expelled from the company, including union leaders. The Ethiopian government attempted to mediate the dispute, but the employer refused to cooperate; the case was expected to be referred to the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs later that year.\\"Ethiopia: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\\", Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, US State Department (accessed 9 July 2009) During 2008, the top management of the state-owned Bole Printing Enterprise disagreed with its union over issues of worker compensation and unlawful termination.

It is 96 feet long. Circa 1820, Cherokee Chief George Welch constructed a gristmill, a sawmill, and a simple open bridge at the site. Welch continued to run and maintain the mills and bridge until the Cherokee removal in 1838. The land that held the bridge and mills was won in the land lottery by John Maynard of Jackson County, Georgia, who sold the land to Jacob Scudder. Following Scudder's death in 1870 the mill and bridge were bought by Dr. M.L. Pool. A cotton gin was added at the site in 1920, but cotton was largely abandoned by local farmers when the poultry farming was introduced. The mill was left in disuse by 1947 and was burned by vandals in 1959. The original bridge that stood at the site was washed away in a flood in 1899. It was decided that a new bridge using the Lattice truss bridge style would be built on the site. The design called for wooden pegs to be driven into holes bored into wooden beams to hold the design together. The beams were cut on site at the saw mill, but the holes were bored in the wrong positions. At this point the construction was taken over by Bud Gentry, who oversaw the redrilling of the holes. The misdrilled holes can still be seen in the bridge's beams. In the mid-1990s the bridge began to sag and a revitalization effort began. A support pier was built in the middle of the creek. During this revitalization private citizens also donated land in the area to allow the creation of Poole's Mill Park.

It includes removal of a tooth from the patient or a donor. After removal, a lamina of tissue cut from the tooth is drilled and the hole is fitted with optics. The lamina is grown in the patients' cheek for a period of months and then is implanted upon the eye. The procedure was pioneered by the Italian ophthalmic surgeon Professor Benedetto Strampelli in the early 1960s. Strampelli was a founder-member of the International Intra- Ocular Implant Club (IIIC) in 1966.National Dental Centre - 25 May 2005 TOOTH- IN-EYE (OOKP) SURGERY HELP 8 REGAIN SIGHT  Medical uses  An operation to graft the OOKP is undertaken in severe pemphigoid, chemical burns, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, trachoma, Lyell syndrome and multiple corneal graft failure. There is a significant risk of anatomical failure of lamina in the long term, estimated at about 19% in a small study, with the main risks being laminar resorption, particularly in allografts, and glaucoma. Another, bigger study comparing OOKP with the lesser known osteo-keratoprosthesis (OKP) in 145 and 82 patients and follow-up terms up to 10 years yielded the following statistics: * 10-year anatomical survival: 66% for OOKP and 47% for OKP * 2-year functional survival: 63% for OOKP and 49% for OKP * 10-year functional survival: 38% for OOKP and 17% for OKP with functional survival defined as best corrected visual acuity above 0.05. Another long-term study of 181 patients puts the chances of retaining an intact OOKP after 18 years at 85%. Procedure OOKP is a two-stage operation: Stage 1 of the surgery involves five separate procedures: # The eye is opened up and the entire inner surface of the eyelids, corneal surface and all scar tissue is removed # Inner mucosal lining of the cheek is transplanted onto the new surface of the eye # A canine or premolar tooth and part of the adjacent bone and ligaments are removed # A bolt-shaped structure is fashioned from the tooth-bone complex which is fitted with a plastic optical cylinder # The tooth-bone-cylinder complex is implanted into the patient's cheek to grow a new blood supply Stage 2 (about 4 months later) involves two separate procedures: # The cheek mucosal lining over the eye is opened and the inner contents of the eye are removed # The tooth-bone- cylinder complex is removed from the cheek and inserted into the eye, the mucosal cheek lining is replaced over the implant. At the end of the procedure, light can now enter through the plastic cylinder, and the patient is able to see through this cylinder with good vision.  History  The procedure was pioneered by the Italian ophthalmic surgeon Professor Benedetto Strampelli in Rome in the early 1960s. The son of the geneticist and agronomist Nazareno Strampelli, Benedetto Strampelli held the chair of ophthalmic surgery at Rome's Ospedale di San Giovanni in Laterano where he was one of the first surgeons in Italy to transplant cornea. In 1953 he was the first Italian to implant intraocular lens which were manufactured to his own design by Rayners in UK.

Historically, elite women in Ethiopia have been visible as administrators and warriors. This never translated into any benefit to improve the rights of women, but it had meant that women could inherit and own property, and act as advisors on important communal matters. As late as the first part of the nineteenth century, Queen Menen, consort of Emperor Iyasu IV, had a decisive role in running the Ethiopian Empire. Workit and Mestayit regents to their minor sons have been held responsible for their provinces. They owed their rights to landed property because of a special type of land tenure that expected tenants to serve as militia to overlords, irrespective of gender. In 1896, Empress Tayetu Betul, wife of Emperor Menelik II, actively advised the government and participated in defending the country from Italian invasion. Prominent and other landowning women fought against the second invasion in 1935–41. With assistance of European advisors, women in the ensuing period were kept out of the army and politics, even as advisors. Instead, they were restricted to family and household work of raising children and cooking. With a steady increase in female representation in education, they have started to undertake nursing, teaching and similar other supportive roles. Over 2018–2019 period their gradual participation in state politics has been increasing pace.Tsehai Berhane-Selassie, Ethiopian Warriorhood: Land Defence and Society'James Currey, 2018; Abate, Yohannis. \\"The Role of Women\\".

Social role of women As in other traditional societies, in Ethiopia a woman's worth is measured in terms of her role both as a mother and wife. Over 85 percent of Ethiopian women reside in rural areas, where households are engaged primarily in subsistence agriculture. In the countryside, women are integrated into the rural economy, which is often labor-intensive and exacts a heavy physical toll on all, including children. The Ethiopian Revolution had little impact on the lives of rural women. Land reform did not change their socioeconomic status, which was anchored in deep-rooted traditional values and beliefs. An improvement in economic conditions would improve the standard of living of women, but lasting change would also require a transformation in the attitudes of government officials and men regarding the roles of women.Abate, Yohannis. \\"The Role of Women\\".

In 1976, around 40 percent of employed women in urban areas worked in the service sector, mainly in hotels, restaurants, and bars. A few women with higher education also found professional employment. Employment in production and related areas (such as textiles and food processing) accounted for 25 percent of the female work force, followed by sales, which accounted for about 11 percent. The survey also found that women factory workers in Addis Ababa earned about a quarter of the wages men earned for the same type of work. These differences existed despite a 1975 proclamation stipulating equal pay for equal work for men and women. Following the Ethiopian Revolution, women made some gains in economic and political areas. The Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association (REWA), which claimed a membership of over 5 million, took an active part in educating women. It encouraged the creation of women's organizations in factories, local associations, and in the civil service. Some women participated in local organizations and in peasant associations and kebeles. However, the role of women was limited at the national level. In 1984, for example, the government selected only one woman as a full member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Ethiopia. Of the 2,000 delegates who attended the party's inaugural congress in 1984, only 6 percent were women. Under the Derg regime, the enrollment of girls in primary and secondary schools increased from about 32 percent in 1974/75 to 39 percent in 1985/86. The enrollment rate among girls in urban areas far exceeded that of girls in rural areas. The adult literacy rate also rose to 60 percent following a nationwide educational campaign. After the Derg's ouster, the adult literacy rate dropped to around 39 percent as of 2007; 28.9% for females and 49.1% for males. In response, the Ministry of Education launched a new educational campaign, which targets an eventual literacy rate of 95 percent and aims to educate 17 million adults. As of 2008–2009, there was a steady increase in general enrollment and a decrease in gender disparity in access to education. The average annual growth rate of enrollment in all levels education was 27.2 percent for females and 33.7 percent for males, with an average annual growth rate of 29.7 percent for girls in Kindergarten, 13.4 percent for girls in primary school, 30.8 percent for girls in secondary school, 14.5 percent for women in TVET, and 21.4 percent for women in higher education. After the formation of the Federal Republic in 1995, the Ministry of Women's Affairs was also established. As of October 2009, Muferiat Kamil serves as the Minister.\\"House Approves Appointment Of Nine Ministers\\" (accessed 14 April 2009)  Social issues  = Women's health = Community health care workers The total fertility rate as of 2014 is 5.23 children born/woman. Although most women do not traditionally use contraception, there has been a marked increase in contraceptive use. Between 2000 and 2011, contraceptive prevalence increased from 8.2% to 28.6%.http://countryoffice.unfpa.org/ethiopia/drive/DHSIn- depthAnalysisonFamilyPlanning.pdf As of 2010, the maternal mortality is 350 deaths/100,000 live births. The HIV/AIDS rate for both genders was estimated at 1.3% in 2012. More women are infected than men, and infections among women are partly due to their often lower socioeconomic status.http://countryoffice.unfpa.org/ethiopia/drive/WomenandGirlsandHIV- AIDSinEthiopia.pdf Since sex between spouses is traditionally regarded as an obligation, the UNFPA argues that married women are at a greater risk of contracting HIV as they have less control over the frequency and nature of such relations. =Violence against women= traditional ceremony An UN analysis of several international studies suggests that domestic violence against women is most prevalent in Ethiopia.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6040180.stm Sexual violence is also reportedly common. Article 620 of the 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia, defines rape differently as compelled \\"sexual intercourse outside wedlock\\".http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/49216b572.pdf Article 53 of the 2000 Revised Family Code of Ethiopia also stipulates that \\"they [the wife and husband] shall have with one another the sexual relations normal in marriage unless these relations involve a risk of seriously prejudicing their health\\". This is interpreted as rendering marital rape a legally impossible concept.Law of Family – Teaching Material. pp. 76 \\"The RFC also requires the spouses to have sexual relations normal in marriage unless these relations involve a risk of seriously prejudicing their health. As a result of this obligation, one cannot talk of marital rape under the Ethiopian law.\\" In a 2005 WHO study, 59% of women reported lifetime sexual abuse by a partner, while one third of women reported that during the past 12 months they were physically forced to have sex against their will with their partner. This was the highest prevalence of all countries surveyed.WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women – Initial results on prevalence, health outcomes and women's responses WHO = Female genital mutilation = As of 2005, 74.3% of women aged 15 – 49 years had undergone female genital mutilation (FGM).https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/ The pre-marital custom is mainly endemic to Northeast Africa and parts of the Near East and has its ultimate origins in Ancient Egypt.Herbert L. Bodman, Nayereh Esfahlani Tohidi, Women in Muslim societies: diversity within unity, (Lynne Rienner Publishers: 1998), p. 41 . Although legally proscribed under Articles 565 and 566 of the 2004 Penal Code, the procedure is still widely practiced, as it is deeply ingrained in the local culture. Encouraged and performed by women in the community, circumcision is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault.Suzanne G. Frayser, Thomas J. Whitby, Studies in human sexuality: a selected guide, (Libraries Unlimited: 1995), p. 257 . = Bride kidnapping = Bride kidnapping is practiced by certain communities in Ethiopia, mainly in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region (SNNPR). According to surveys conducted in 2003 by the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia, the custom's prevalence rate in the SNNPR was estimated at 92 percent. The 2004 Criminal Code criminalizes this practice, as well as other forms of abuse of women, such as child marriage, trafficking and sexual harassment, at Chapter III – Crimes Committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices (Articles 561–570) and also by other provisions (Articles 587, 597, 625, 635, 637, 648). Wife-beating is also illegal: Article 564 – Violence Against a Marriage Partner or a Person Cohabiting in an Irregular Union. The 2014 gang rape and death of Hanna Lalango, as well as several other contemporaneous high-profile sexual assaults, prompted outrage from women in Ethiopia and internationally. The Yellow Movement was founded as a response to encourage women to speak out against sexual violence. Fighting for gender equality Gender equality has been a problem in Ethiopia for decades but has had an improvement over the past three years since when Mulatu Teshome became president. The USAID is one of the worldwide countries that have done a lot in promoting women in Ethiopia and giving them an opportunity to live a better life without discrimination. Other international organizations working with Ethiopia include All African Women For Peace (AAWP) and many others part of the UN keeping their focus on advancing the participation of women in peacemaking and strive to stop early marriages and gender-based violence. In addition to the international help and participation, the Ethiopian government has also created some organizations such as the Ethiopian Women Association (EWA) which mainly focuses on stopping some dangerous cultural practises done against women and girls like FGM which involves removing some parts of their private parts and promoting their economic, social and legal rights. Local organizations such the Women Fight in Harar, a small city in Ethiopia have been trying to fight any parents who keep their from school and putting shame to men who attack, rape or try to rape girls and women. Furthermore, Ethiopian girls and women's struggles and problems are mostly associated with social acceptance, access to education and child or forced marriages. To many, it seems the tragedy begins immediately when they are born because when a mother gives birth to a baby girl, the baby is considered as something unwanted but celebrations are made when a baby boy is born. Being regarded as vulnerable, parents give various excuses to keep their daughters at home doing housework instead of going to school. A school-age girl is not allowed to attend school, with the excuse that she may be raped, abducted or harmed on the way to school. Boys are considered strong enough to protect themselves from any attack or harm. Girls cannot choose when and whom to marry. \\"Either the parents will choose the bride, or the groom will marry the girl of his choice\\" (Womankind). A woman who is a victim of rape will face humiliation starting from the police. Rape is not taken seriously and hence men are seen committing several atrocious violence against women, especially in villages. = Women's empowerment = Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment is a controversial topic in Ethiopia. More women in Ethiopia are committed to deal with everybody in the family and village/community. In Ethiopia, about 80% of the populace lives in rural zones and women are responsible for most of the agricultural work in these communities. Women are rarely perceived for their hard work, and most of the time a man figure in their lives confines their access to assets and network interest. One out of three women in Ethiopia have encountered sexual, physical, or mental viciousness, 65% of women have likewise experienced gender mutilation, and half of the young women who enroll into elementary schools ever make it to grade five. As young women get older, numerous things become less available, for example, education and scholastic support. Academic participation turns out to be progressively troublesome as it removes time from fundamental income creating activities. Undergraduate colleges in Ethiopia are composed of 35% women, and 5% are set to drop out during their first year. There are 11% of women educators in Universities making them disproportionately represented in the Ethiopian Academic System. A few different ways to better help women become compelling pioneers later on is to have a holistic educational program in their beginning phases of their education. For example, learning their reading skills early on, the association Reading for Ethiopia's Achievement Developed action centers around improving reading abilities in elementary schools. = Social norms relate to gender inequality = In the Ethiopian language there are certain feminized slurs and idiomatic expressions that contrast women with animals. Teferra expresses that this kind of language strengthens negative generalizations and depicts gender based violence on women as though it is admissible and on occasion important. Biased language use can influence uniformity for women, despite everything it places them on a lower proficient, social, and monetary level to men. In order to comprehend this issue and step forward, it will expect individuals to know about their language use and how it tends to be destructive and how it might influence a women's prosperity. Gendered Expectations can negatively affect women's sexual and reproduction wellbeing. Ewenat Gebrehana talks about how \\"the criminalization of child marriage and passage of a relatively lenient abortion law illustrates the progress made in designing legislative frameworks to improve women’s health.” And tragically numerous Ethiopian families still practice arranged marriages at young ages. According to the Ethiopian Demographic And Health Survey 2016, the women's median for their first marriage is at 17 years of age and 15 years of age in the Amhara district, however it is 23 years of age for men. Society's desires for how a proper young women should behave and sociocultural standards about women sparing themselves until marriage.This signifies the many double standard guidelines related with sex and sexually transmitted diseases. Likewise, there are double standard norms related with women with socially sexually transmitted diseases not having the option to look for sexual and contraceptive wellbeing services. Health Care services are regularly not reasonable or open to ladies, this causes ladies with undesirable pregnancies or who furtively experience hazardous premature births to feel dread of judgment and the consequences of going astray from the standard. = Arranged marriages = Numerous women in Ethiopia are placed into arranged marriages when they're young. Fetura Mohammed a 14 year old in the Oromo region had an organized marriage set by her dad, yet she just desired to \\"complete her education and have her own job before getting married.\\" Many young women are uninformed of their rights in Ethiopia with regards to harmful traditional practices because of the absence of education women get. These harmful traditional practices can extend from child marriage, female gential mutilation and polygamous marriage. As indicated by specific tribes, for example, the Oromo tribe being married after the age of 16 is viewed as a taboo and carries disgrace to the young women and the family. Komobolcha is the home of a Local Rights Programmers where ActionAid Ethiopia a grantee of the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against women, which is sharing knowledge among women to help anticipate child marriage/arranged marriages and other unsafe traditional practices. The program additionally gives data about lawful arrangements and enables women to get sorted out into watch groups. As women structure into watch groups they start to raise their voices and protest , spread open mindfulness, network with leaders, take legal actions, and form events for an after school clubs. When ActionAid began in 2009 there was a total of 655 women who were prepared and sorted out into 78 watch groups in 10 regions in Ethiopia. The 17 women watch groups in Kombolcha have created that system and engaged with community leaders, school clubs and law requirement offices to dispose of child marriage , and breaking down religions and traditional beliefs that help support it. Through these courses of actions some men leaders who are traditional/old-fashioned that also use to rehearse these conventional convictions are currently taking a shot at abolishing it and playing a role in change. = Abortion = Binyam Bogale, Mekitie Wondafrash, Tizta Tilahun, and Eshetu Girma discuss how women In Ethiopia are always in a position where their opinions are voiced by someone else or not voiced at all in regards to the use of contraceptives. Usually these issues are either made or voiced by their partners, and can affect their reproductive lives more than their partners. By fixing this issue it can affect the relevance for planning contextually appropriate family planning interventions. Modern family planning interventions in the area should be promoted by considering empowering of women on modern contraceptive use decision making. Mekitie Wondafrash, Tizta Tilahun, and Eshetu Girma come to a conclusion that in order to help empower women to make important decisions their needs to be a collective discussion addressing the issue to prevent pregnancy. According to Binyam Bogale, Mekitie Wondafrash, Tizta Tilahun, and Eshetu Girma, high level of current modern contraceptive practice with reduced urban-rural difference was found as compared to regional and national figures. Urban women had better power to make decisions on modern contraceptive than rural women.”  See also  * Polygamy in Ethiopia * Human trafficking in Ethiopia  References   Further reading   External links * \\"New law in Ethiopia represents a step forward for women's reproductive rights \\" IPAS, 7 June 2005 Ethiopia ","title":"Women in Ethiopia"},{"id":"16013210","text":"Chryssa Vardea-Mavromichali (; December 31, 1933 – December 23, 2013) was a Greek American artist who worked in a wide variety of media.http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/12/23/famous-greek-artist-chryssa- passes-away/ An American art pioneer in light art and luminist sculpture widely known for her neon, steel, aluminum and acrylic glass installations, she always used the mononym Chryssa professionally.
