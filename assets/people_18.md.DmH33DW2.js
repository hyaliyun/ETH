Completed in 1991, Muir Commons was designed by McCamant & Durrett Architects and is known for being the first new-construction cohousing development in the United States. Opposed to many traditional neighborhoods, Muir Commons was created and maintained around the premise of fostering a sense of community between its residents by facilitating community-level functionality. While each family or individual lives in a privately owned residence, many other features of the community are shared, including a central communal building, an orchard, gardens, yards, workshops, and even the decision-making process. Design History As one of the original cohousing developments in the United States, the inspiration for the layout and framework of Muir Commons came primarily from European models of cohousing communities. These models focused on creating an atmosphere for increased social interaction and included aspects such as private homes, common areas, internal methods of management, and shared community objectives. Although the individual residence dwellings are privately owned, common areas within the neighborhood are owned and maintained equally by all residents. The process of designing and implementing Muir Commons was strongly influenced by considerations of future residents, with the help and guidance of McCamant & Durrett Architects. Local workshops were conducted within the community to assess needs, which covered the \\"design, development, group, and financial processes\\". One resident-suggested outcome from this process included the decision to make all units wheelchair accessible. Due to limited funds and the intention for most of the homes to be considered affordable, the design and development process was heavily focused on communal features as opposed to individual dwellings. The neighborhood was completed in the summer of 1991. Community Characteristics In order to foster a community-oriented living environment, all homes face towards the interior of the property and are congregated around a central walking path. All parking for the neighborhood is located along the periphery of the community as to only allow bicycles and foot traffic within the living environment. According to McCamant & Durrett Architects, the reason for this is to enable more face-to-face interaction and create a safe environment for children. A central component of Muir Commons is a community building that contains a kitchen, laundry room, office, gym, guest rooms, and a large room for gathering. In addition to this, there is a garage studio available to all residents that provides tools for automobile and home maintenance. Muir Commons also includes a variety of outdoor community spaces, such as a playground, an orchard, gardens, and lawns. As a cohousing development, the upkeep of the community and property relies on continued collaboration between residents. All residents are expected to contribute to the maintenance of the shared areas, as well as help cook a meal once a month for the rest of the community. In addition to this, all decisions that affect the entire community are made by consensus.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.  Houghton County Traction Company  The Houghton County Traction Company was started in 1900 as an interurban line in the Keweenaw Peninsula.History of the Houghton County Traction Company, Wally Weart, on the Copper Range Railroad site, retrieved 8/20/09 The first section of track ran from Hancock to nearby Boston; in 1901, the line was extended to Calumet. During the next few years, a spur was built running to Lake Linden and Hubbell, and in 1908 the line was extended to just north of Mohawk. The Houghton County Traction Company remained in business until 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression.  Station History  The Ahmeek Station is one of the original trolley stops of the Houghton County Traction Company, which served Ahmeek and the surrounding location.Ahmeek Streetcar Station from the Keweenaw Free Guide, retrieved 8/20/09 The original stop in Ahmeek was a simple shelter. However, in 1909 the Allouez Mining Company leased land to the Houghton County Traction Company to construct a sub-station and waiting at this location. A building was constructed that year, but almost immediately outgrew its space. In 1910, the Traction Company constructed a small addition, which has since been removed. In 1931, Highway 41 was widened by the Michigan Department of Transportation, and the entire building was moved approximately 40 feet west to the other side of the railroad tracks. After the rail line folded, the station was used for various purposes, including a bus stop and gas station. An ice cream window has been in place since the 1950s and in summer 2011, a local non-profit organization called Keweenaw Natural Areas opened a visitor center in what was the waiting room. The current owners also just finished renovating the entire original building, including the apartment upstairs that the original operators of the station lived in. Description The Houghton County Traction Company Ahmeek Streetcar Station is a rectangular wood-framed two-story building with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. A single story wing with two garage doors faces the highway. The front of the building has a pair of doors in the center and large windows are at each end of the first floor. Above are four 1/1 double hung windows. One of the first floor windows has a walk-up sliding window with a shed roof overhang. The rear of the building was originally the site of the train platform. Inside, the first floor contains a large waiting room, now serving as a seating area for a restaurant, and a kitchen area one end along with restrooms. The main room is finished with headboard below a chair rail and has a tongue and groove headboard ceiling.

It was programmed by Richard K. Balaska Jr. Tunnel Runner is one of three CBS games for the Atari 2600 with an additional 256 bytes of RAM in each cartridge, a feature promoted by CBS as \\"RAM Plus.\\" The other two RAM Plus games are Mountain King and the port of Omega Race. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot The game offers two modes of gameplay. The GAME1 mode is a campaign mode, with pre-programmed levels that never change. GAME2 mode generates random mazes for each level. In the game, the player has a first person view of a maze that he or she has to navigate. The task is to locate and use the exit door of the labyrinth within a certain time limit. Whilst many mazes have multiple exit doors, the player must find the key hidden somewhere in the labyrinth. Once the key is obtained the player can leave and progress to the next maze. However, if the player could not find a way out of the labyrinth within the time limit they have to repeat the level upon finding the exit. At higher levels the available time decreases considerably. Apart from the time limit, there are many other obstacles in each level. Several creatures - called Zots - are scouting the tunnels, looking for the player. Unarmed, the player must avoid them at all costs in order to quickly find the key and exit to the next level. This is quite easy at the start, but later the game becomes harder by placing more Zots on each level (up to a maximum of four). Above all this, the Zots get faster and faster up to a certain limit and at higher levels they can even pass through walls. This is not a glitch, the manual refers to this as \\"Zot magic\\". Because of the Atari's limitations, the game lacks a turning animation when changing directions, so it is easy to become disoriented; especially when the Zots are chasing the player. It is also worth mentioning that the walls' colour constantly changes in each maze. The most difficult levels have black walls where only the floor is visible and the doors themselves cannot be seen (making it impossible to know what type they are). Tunnel Runner features many black levels in a row periodically, making them a real challenge to pass. To compensate the increasing difficulty of the game, the player's running speed also increases during the game. The small arrow on the time indicator always pinpoints the direction the player is facing, and the player also has a map to help him out of each maze. The player may press the FIRE button to view a map of the current level in overhead form which shows the location of the player, the Zots, the key and the exit. As the levels progress the increasing difficulty also affects the map, such as making the map invisible (especially on black wall levels), making the Zots invisible or making the player or the key invisible. The map is never rendered to be completely useless, so \\"something\\" will always be shown regardless the current level state. Viewing the map, however, may cause the player to be vulnerable as the player must stand still to view the map while the Zots can move freely during that time. Although not shown on the map, there are multiple types of doors in each maze. They can be easily found as the floor is colorfully vibrating in front of a door on a nearby wall. There are five types of doors which only the player can use; the Zots cannot. The player will automatically stop running each time they reach one of these colorful sections, and the time will not decrease while standing on it. The player must take these into account when running away from Zots. Door with up arrow. The exit of the maze. Only accessible if the player has acquired the key. These are only found at the east walls of each maze, and are shown on the map at early stages. Door with double up arrows. Warp exit, which transfers the player ahead two levels instead of one. Only accessible if the player has acquired the key and has seen the normal exit before. These warp exits only appear at the east walls of the maze. Door with two side arrows. Teleporting doors. Upon entering, they transfer the player to a random location of that particular maze. They can be extremely useful for escaping from the Zots and saving precious level time at higher stages. The random teleportation may also be valuable help in finding the key, as sometimes the player will spontaneously grab the key during the \\"teleportation\\". However, there is always a slight chance of being teleported right in front of a Zot. They can appear on almost every wall. Door with double down arrows. This door sends the player back to the previous level, and is considered an obstacle, especially at black wall levels where all doors are invisible. Like teleporting doors they can be seen frequently on many walls. Doors with \\"cb db\\" symbol. This door cannot be entered, but staring at it will award the player with up to 1000 bonus points as long as they continue to face it. Turning away and turning back will not restore the scoring ability. Being a secret door they are quite rare, but can appear everywhere and are invisible on the level map. The symbols are the initials of the game's programmer and his wife of the time. The player has 3 initial extra lives when starting a new game. Every time a Zot catches the player, he or she loses one life and reappears at a random location in the level with the same time he had before the unfortunate event (the player will also not lose the key). The player may also gain extra lives (maximum 4) by earning a certain number of points. Points are awarded for wandering through tunnels, exiting the level as soon as possible, or finding the \\"cb db\\" secret doors.

Set in Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the plot centers on the efforts of Japanese and Russian espionage agents to get their hands on an amulet which is the key to a $5 million fund meant to help China purchase munitions. Footage from the bombing of Shanghai during the 1937‚Äì1945 war was incorporated into several scenes.  Plot  Russian agent Igor Sargoza shoots down Peter Roma's biplane over an orphanage in China where Roma's sister Irene teaches. Badly wounded, Peter entrusts Irene with a broken amulet that he needs to get to San Francisco; the other half is being held there, where the two halves will unlock $5 million to be used for the purchase of munitions for China to defend itself during the Second Sino-Japanese War. With Sargoza on her trail, Irene misses the last ship of the day evacuating foreigners and goes to see Howard Barclay, whom her brother says will help her. Barclay‚Äôs friend Johnny McGinty, an Irish-American photojournalist who also wants to leave Shanghai the next day, is asked to assist Irene. Since Irene lacks an American passport, Barclay suggests she and Johnny get married so she can be added to Johnny‚Äôs passport. They can annul the marriage when they reach San Francisco. Johnny happily goes into his adjoining room to pack and is accosted by a gun- wielding Chinese man, who escorts him out into Sargoza‚Äôs car. At the border of the international zone, however, Japanese officers led by Fuji Yokohama stop the car and release Johnny. Yokohama warns Johnny to stay away from Irene and lets him go. Johnny finds Barclay and Irene at the home of Wu Chang, a minister who performs the marriage ceremony. Back at the hotel, a wedding present, a Mandarin incense burner, is delivered from Lun Sat Li, a friend of Johnny's. Unbeknownst to them, the courier was waylaid and an explosive device planted inside. Barclay suggests they hide the amulet in the incense burner. Suddenly, Japanese bombers invade the city. As the bombing continues, the three escape the city to the home of Lun Sat Li. Sargoza and his men barge into the house and the three escape in a power launch through a trap door in the floor. They receive permission to board the ship that will evacuate American citizens in the morning. Entering their stateroom, they find Yokohama waiting for them, demanding the amulet. He grabs the box from Irene and prepares to open it when Sargoza appears. Sargoza takes the incense burner from Yokohama and locks the four in a room while he lights a match to melt the candle and retrieve the amulet. The incense burner explodes, killing Sargoza. Yokohama then explains to the others that he was the one who had planned the interception of the gift and the planting of the bomb. Yokohama also tells Johnny that Barclay is a Chinese agent who was empowered to purchase munitions with the funds waiting in San Francisco. However, now that President Roosevelt has declared an embargo on government shipments to nations at war, the funds cannot be used for that purpose. Barclay bids goodbye to Johnny and Irene and slips the amulet‚Äîwhich he never placed in the incense burner‚Äîinto Irene's hand. Johnny and Irene make plans to sail for San Francisco and stay married for real.

Paul Sutton, Linda Grey, James Dunn, and Ralph Morgan in a scene from the film Development Shadows Over Shanghai was based on an original story by Richard B. Sale; the screenplay was written by Joseph Hoffman. The film was produced under the working titles of Shadows over China, Shadows over China Seas, and Thunder over China. Casting This was the first leading role for actress Linda Grey, who had previously performed in stock theatre in the Midwestern United States. Filming Filming began in mid-July 1938. Footage from the bombing of Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937‚Äì1945 was incorporated into several scenes. Release Shadows Over Shanghai was released on October 14, 1938. It was the first production by Fine Arts Pictures to be released under the auspices of Grand National Pictures. Critical reception Contemporary critics cited James Dunn's engaging personality and the footage of aerial bombing from the Second Sino-Japanese War as the film's highlights. The New York Daily News, which gave the film 2 ¬Ω stars, complimented Dunn's \\"particular brand of engaging nonchalance and smart talk\\", and said Linda Grey was \\"a pretty foil for James Dunn's clowning\\". The Brooklyn Daily Eagle similarly noted that Dunn had his \\"usual sparkling personality\\". Davenport Daily Times called Dunn \\"half of the show\\", adding that the film \\"would be relegated to second place fare without the carefree James Dunn and the best bombing photography of the Sino-Japanese war yet to be shown here\\". The StarPhoenix, however, called the plot \\"pretty standard stuff\\", and said that \\"Jimmy Dunn tries desperately to be facetious under the strain of war\\". The Morning Herald reserved praise for Paul Sutton, who in appearance and demeanor plays a scheming Japanese officer. A modern review in TV Guide gave the film one out of four stars, criticizing the production as \\"confusing and uneven ... it is hard to figure out what is going on\\". This review also decried the use of stock footage from the Sino-Japanese War, and called some of the comedy \\"very unfitting\\". McLaughlin and Parry note that Shadows Over Shanghai was part of a trend in 1930s Hollywood productions which \\"at least indirectly sympathized with the victims of fascism and criticized to a lesser or greater degree the aggressors. This is most clearly seen in the films that depict the Chinese as victims of Japan\\". The film follows this approach by presenting scenes of the Japanese bombardment of Shanghai, refugees fleeing the city, and children in a Chinese orphanage.

The song made a big buzz when it was used in Palestinian writer Sayed Kashua's successful TV show Avoda Aravit (Arab Labor). Flower (Wardeh) * Featuring Sameh Zakoout (AKA SAZ) and Jamil Nafar * Mixed by Tam Cooper Warde is a slang used in Lyd, meaning \\"brother, dude, my man, etc.\\" The song is a boast about who is the best on the mic. Revolution (Inkilab) * Produced by Arye Avtan * Mixed by Tam Cooper A Suhell Nafar solo and the first Palestinian reggae song. My Lady (Ya Sayedati) * Feature Suhell Fodi from Zaman and a former member of Wala'at * Produced and Mixed by Ran Harush * Oud: Alaa Azam * Kanoun: Mahran Mer'eb The first single of the album, released Valentine's Day 2006. Its music video, directed by Marwan Asaad, was the first from the album. Freedom for my Sister (Al Huriye Unt'a) * Produced and Mixed by Ran Harush Tamer's first solo in the album, the song protests against the oppression of women. In their shows DAM present the song by saying \\"How can we beat the occupation with one hand? We need the other one, so let's stop choking our sisters and instead use the hand to fight.\\" The song features Safaa Hathut, the first Palestinian female rapper from Arapeyat Acka. Its DAM (Da Dam) * Produced by Karem Matar * Mixed by Tam Cooper The song represents DAM, explaining who they are and what their message is. It samples a very popular Egyptian play \\"Madraset al Mushag'ibin ‚Äì The school of hooligans\\" with Adel Imam, Said Saleh, Ahmad Zaki and Younes Shalabi. In one of their interviews, DAM explained how hard it was to clear the sample since there was no official organization to request it from. While they were in Berlin Film Festival to participate in the opening of Udi Aloni's film \\"Forgiveness ‚Äì Mehilot\\" that they played a role in, they met with the Egyptian actor Nour El-Sherif and spoke to him about the problem of the sample, he put them in contact with Said Saleh who signed the clearance and faxed it to DAM without any payment. Hibuna Ishtruna (Love us buy us) * Produced by Ori Shochat * Mixed by Tam Cooper \\"We made a catchy chorus without any meaning just so you can play it in the Radio\\", one of DAM's funniest song as they mock the meaningless songs that are taking over the radios. In a lecture DAM gave at the University of Rome, Italy about Palestinian hip hop as a form of resistance, they explained that they love pop music but do not like the fact that it is the only thing played on the radio. As such, they say even if the media was playing only protest songs they will sing \\"We made a protest song just so you can play us\\". DAM: \\"The massage is that our culture like any culture is colorful, we have pop stars, we have alternative music, we have hardcore artists, let's give a shot to everyone.\\" One of the lines of the songs, Tamer Nafar: \\"If you shake your head you will move your brain an get though out of it, but we only shake the ass, so all we get is shit.\\" My Hood (Mes Endroits) feat. Nikkfurie/La Caution Another funny song, a sarcastic view of ghettos, DAM explained that in the beginning they used to rap about their ghetto, when they succeeded in Palestine they found out that the world is bigger than their hood and when they started touring around the world they discovered that the world is bigger than Palestine. DAM explains that if the Israeli Police are working with the Atlanta Police to oppress minorities, then the minorities should work together and fight the oppressors. This is why they chose to work with French rapper Nikkfurie of La Caution, as DAM will talk about their ghetto in Israel and he will talk about his ghetto in France. A Love Story (Usset Hub) * Produced by Ori Shochat & Ran Harush * Mixed by Ran Harush Tamer's second solo in the album, the song has no chorus. The song is a love story, and the title was originally a placeholder name that was kept because time constraints prevented them from choosing another title. In one of DAM's performances, they started the song by reading a quote from the Egyptian writer Nawal El Saadawi where she explains how love is treated by the Arab society, the lovers are like 2 beautiful flowers and society is like the bees, they suck the honey and the sweetness of it. The song features Palestinian actress Rawda Suleiman in the role of the girl and the mother and the singer/actor Ibahim Sakalla as Tamer's friend in the song. Stranger in my own Country (G'areeb fi Bladi) * Features Amal Bisharat and Ibrahim Sakalla * Produced by Ori Shohat and Ran Harush * Mixed by Ran Harush * Oud: Alaa Azam * The chorus was written by Abir al Azinati Starting the song with the voice of the late Tawfiq Ziad, DAM went to visit his family before they released the song and they got a clearance to use his voice and words. The song continues with verses that explains to the Arab world the catch 22 that faces Palestinians who live in Israel, seen in lyrics like \\"The Arab world treats us as Israelis and Israel treats us as Palestinians, I am a stranger in my own country.\\" In the third verse, Tamer raps the names of the 13 Palestinian civilians killed by Israeli forces in October 2000 demonstrations as a form of wordplay, using their names as verbs. Tamer explained in an interview that \\"it took him more than a month to deliver the political message using specific names as verbs and only in 16 bars and not more, it was challenging but worth it, sometimes after a show someone surprises me and tells me I am the sister of one of the martyrs, or the mother, and they come to talk to me after hearing his name in the song, it is sad but it moves me\\" Words (Kalimat) Mahmood's solo in the album, a hardcore song for the streets, Mahmood is explaining the important role of the lyrics/words and speeches during the history of the world. The chorus is samples from DAM's old songs. Originally the song was recorded over the Fairuz sample \\"Habbaytak Bissayf\\" but after having problems with the clearance they recomposed it. Lines from the song, Mahmood Jreri: \\"I am the word's master but I am their slave as well\\" \\"And those who are gifted, can use them to walk through borders and in some governments, it‚Äôs forbidden to give words freedom But if you choke them and kill them then it's allowed\\" Driver of Faith (Sawa' al Zaman) * Produced & Mixed by Edi Sumeran Hany Abu-Assad, director of the film Paradise Now, which won a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category, said about using the song: \\"I just finished editing my documentary Ford Transit (2002) and I had in one of my scenes a song by Dr. Dre ‚Äì Big Egos, after meeting DAM they offered me replace the song, if the scenes were about Palestine then it should be backed by Palestinian Hip Hop and DAM were the right people for that, they were limited by the creation of the song since the scene is already edited, so they took Dr. Dre song as a reference and came out with something the fits perfect and new, me and my staff watched the scene with the both songs and we all voted for the new DAM song, Driver of Fate, which lyrically goes with the film, but not one on one, more metaphorically\\" Dedication (Ihda') * The song is featuring Ibrahim Sakalla * Produced by Ori Shochat * Mixed by Tam Cooper A review from the Arabic Hip Hop Heads website states that \\"The final track is a bittersweet personal Dedication (Ihda‚Äô) to all those who supported DAM - a good song indeed.\\" The song features Ibrahim Sakalla and is composed by Ori Shochat.

Listed since 1971 in the National Register of Historic Places, Kent House is located in Alexandria in Rapides Parish. The plantation house is a representation of southern plantation life between 1795 and 1855. The main structure was erected in 1800. The bousillage Creole house and restored period outbuildings are now a showcase for tourists. History Kent Plantation House displays original artifacts from people who worked and lived at the house during its operation. Buildings H. Parrott Bacot, former director of the Anglo-American Art Museum at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, led the interior restoration. The several outbuildings surrounding the main structure are furnished with Federal, Sheraton, and Empire pieces. The Milk House was built between 1820 and 1830; dairy products, such as cheese, milk, and butter, were prepared and stored there. The Slave Cabin shows the primitive conditions in which the slaves at the plantation lived. The Blacksmith Shop was constructed about 1815. The Kitchen contains an open hearth fireplace for cooking. Marker Text The marker at the front entrance of the Kent Plantation House reads: > Kent House, the oldest known standing structure in Rapides Parish, was built > by Pierre Baillio, completed in 1800.

The process is the reverse of the immigration to the United States. The United States does not keep track of emigration, and counts of Americans abroad are thus only available courtesy of statistics kept by the destination countries. Reasons There are many reasons why Americans emigrate from the United States. While some emigrate for economic reasons, the United States' position as an affluent country and a country with a strong immigrant history means that many leave for a chance to experience other parts of the world, to return to their country of origin, for religious reasons, such as missionary work, or to escape policies of the American government.Sullivan, Andrew. The New American Diaspora, The Atlantic, 22 December 2009, accessed 17 April 2011. With the ongoing problems with the American economy, and increase in economic opportunities for skilled workers in emerging markets, economic opportunities are increasingly driving migration abroad, both for native-born AmericansSappho, Paul. A Looming American Diaspora, Harvard Business Review, 2009, accessed 17 April 2011. and naturalized immigrants returning to their home country. Common reasons for living abroad are marriage/partnership, study, employment, and retirement. Since children born in the United States to non-citizens are generally automatically granted U.S. citizenship, children born to migrant workers, temporary foreign employees on visas, or international students are U.S. citizens, and when they return to their countries of origin, they are also considered to be U.S. citizens living abroad. They are sometimes called \\"accidental Americans\\". Other reasons for Americans to leave the United States are for political reasons, racism, economic inequality, and no universal healthcare. Normally, Americans do not easily have access to any foreign country for the purpose of permanent residence (with certain exceptions such as Jews emigrating to Israel, Americans of Irish descent emigrating to Ireland, etc), so the American diaspora is relatively small in comparison to the total American population. Reasons include: * Economic reasons (e.g. inexpensive housing in Mexicohttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/Demographic/meetings/egm/migrationegm06/DOC%2019%20ILO.pdf) * Political reasons * Access to benefits and health reasons (see Universal health care) * Evasion of legal liabilities (e.g. crimes, taxes, loans, etc.) * Family reasons (most common with recent immigrants or permanent residents) * Marriage to a foreigner * Safety concerns * Wanting to experience a new culture * Religious reasons (e.g. Jewish migration to Israel) * Individuals living in a diaspora in the United States wanting to go back to their original homelands * Loss of rights due to having a felony * Men avoiding military service or fighting in wars (pre-1973) According to a Gallup poll from January 2019, 40 percent of women under the age of 30 would like to leave the United States. Net effect The United States is a net immigration country, meaning more people are arriving to the U.S. than leaving it. There is a scarcity of official records in this domain.http://unstats.un.org/unsd/Demographic/meetings/egm/migrationegm06/DOC%2019%20ILO.pdf#page=2 Given the high dynamics of the emigration-prone groups, emigration from the United States remains indiscernible from temporary country leave. Statistics There are no exact figures on how many Americans live abroad. In 1999, a State Department estimate suggested that the number may be between 3 million and 6 million. In 2016, the agency estimated 9 million U.S. citizens were living abroad. However, these numbers are highly open to dispute as they often are unverified and can change rapidly. The United States Census Bureau does not count Americans abroad and individual American embassies offer only rough estimates, which makes the U. S. the only developed country that does not even attempt a formal enumeration of expatriate citizens. The State Department does not release what statistics it may have, citing \\"security reasons.\\" One reasonably \\"hard\\" indicator of the U.S. citizen population overseas is offered by the fact that often when they have a child abroad, they obtain a Consular Report of Birth Abroad from a US consulate as a proof of the child's U.S. citizenship. The Bureau of Consular Affairs reports issuing 503,585 such documents over the decade 2000‚Äì2009. Based on this, and on some assumptions about the family composition and birth rates, some authors estimate the US civilian population overseas as between 3.6 and 4.3 million.These are our Numbers: Civilian Americans Overseas and Voter Turnout , By Dr. Claire M. Smith (Originally published: OVF Research Newsletter, vol. 2, issue 4 (Aug), 2010) Sizes of certain subsets of US citizens living abroad can be estimated based on statistics published by the Internal Revenue Service. US Citizens are liable for US income tax even if they reside overseas; however, if they receive earned income (wages, salaries, etc.) while residing in a foreign country, they can exclude an amount of foreign earned income from the US taxation or receive credit for foreign taxes paid. The IRS reported that almost 335,000 tax returns with such a foreign-earned income exclusion form were received in 2006. This imposes a lower (and very imprecise) bound on the number of US citizens who were living and working in foreign countries at the time. In the same tax year, almost 969,000 US taxpayers reported having paid foreign tax on \\"general limitation income\\" (i.e., income other than interest, dividends, and other \\"passive income\\") from foreign sources on their foreign tax credit forms. Of course, not all of these were actually residing abroad full-time. As of June 2016, the State department's consular section estimated that there are 9 million non-military U.S. citizens living abroad,American Overseas Network an increase from the 4 million estimated in 1999.http://unstats.un.org/unsd/Demographic/meetings/egm/migrationegm06/DOC%2019%20ILO.pdf#page=4 However, these numbers are often disputed as being underestimated. Citizenship Americans can only lose their citizenship in a very limited number of ways, and anyone born to at least one American parent, or born on American soil, is considered to be an American citizen. It is not automatic for a child born abroad to one American parent to obtain US citizenship if the American parent has been living abroad for a long time.Birthright citizenship in the United States#Children born overseas to married parents Few Americans living abroad renounce their citizenship, with the long-term trend being in the low-hundreds per year; this changed, however, after the United States government passed Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, requiring foreign banks to report information on American depositholders with bank accounts located outside of USA. Almost 3,000 Americans renounced their citizenship in 2013 alone, many citing the new disclosure laws and difficulty in finding banks willing to engage in said reporting.  History  Due to the flow of people back and forth between Britain and the colonies, and America and the Caribbean, there has been an American diaspora of a sort since before the United States was founded. During the American Revolutionary War, a number of American Loyalists relocated to other countries, chiefly Canada and the United Kingdom. Residence in countries outside the British Empire was unusual, and usually limited to the well-to-do, such as Benjamin Franklin, who was able to self-finance his trip to Paris as an American diplomat.  19th century  Thanks to the increase of whalers and clipper ships, Americans began to travel all over the world for business reasons. The early 19th century also saw the beginning of overseas religious missionary activity, such as with Adoniram Judson in Burma. The middle of the 19th century saw the immigration of many New Englanders to Hawaii, as missionaries for the Congregational Church, and as traders and whalers. The American population eventually overthrew the government of Hawaii, leading to its annexation by the United States. During this time former slaves also migrated to Liberia, becoming the Americo- Liberians, who dominated the country for most of its history. Also, due to an invasion in the late 19th century, many Americans became immigrants to the Philippines when it was a colony after the American victory in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. In Asia, the American government made efforts to secure special privileges for its citizens. This began with the Treaty of Wanghia in China in 1844. It was followed by the expedition of Commodore Perry to Japan 10 years later, and the United States‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1882. American traders began to settle in those countries.  Early 20th century  Cecil Rhodes created the Rhodes Scholarship in 1902 to encourage greater cooperation between the United States, the British Empire, and Germany by allowing students to study abroad.  Interwar period  In the period between the First and Second World Wars, many Americans, particularly writers such as Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and Ezra Pound, migrated to Europe to take part in the cultural scene. European cities like Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, Paris, Prague, Rome, Stockholm, and Vienna came to host a large number of Americans. Many Americans, typically those who were idealistic and/or involved in left-leaning politics, also participated in the Spanish Civil War (mainly supporting the Republicans against the Nationalists) in Spain while they lived in Madrid and elsewhere. Other Americans returned home to the countries of their origin, including the parents of American author/illustrator Eric Carle, who returned to Germany. Thousands of Japanese Americans were unable to return to the United States, after the Attack on Pearl Harbor.  Cold War  During the Cold War, Americans became a permanent fixture in many countries with large populations of American soldiers, such as West Germany and South Korea. The Cold War also saw the development of government programs to encourage young Americans to go abroad. The Fulbright Program was established in 1946 to encourage cultural exchange, and the Peace Corps was created in 1961 both to encourage cultural exchange and a civic spirit of volunteerism. With the formation of the state of Israel, over 100,000 Jews made Aliyah to the holy land, where they played a role in the creation of the state. Other Americans traveled to countries like Lebanon, again to take place in the cultural scene. During the Vietnam War, about 100,000 American men went abroad to avoid conscription, 90% of them going to Canada. European nations, including neutral states like Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, offered asylum to thousands of American expatriates who refused to fight. A small number of Americans abandoned the country for political reasons, defecting to the Soviet Union, Cuba, or other countries, such as Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, current Libyan nominee as UN ambassador, and sixties radicals such as Joanne Chesimard, Pete O'Neal, Eldridge Cleaver, and Stokely Carmichael. During this period Americans continued to travel abroad for religious reasons, such as Richard James, inventor of the Slinky, who went to Bolivia with the Wycliffe Bible Translators, and the Peoples Temple establishment of Jonestown in Guyana.  After the Cold War  The opening of Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and Central Asia after the Cold War provided new opportunities for American businesspeople. Additionally, with the global dominance of America in the world economy, the ESL industry continued to grow, especially in new and emerging markets. Many Americans also take a year abroad during college, and some return to the country after graduation. Iraq War deserters sought refuge mostly in Canada and Europe, and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden escaped to Russia. Increasing numbers of Americans are retiring abroad due to financial setbacks resulting from the 2008 financial crisis. Young Americans facing a tough job market due to the recession are also increasingly open to working abroad. According to a Gallup poll from January 2019, 40 percent of women under the age of 30 would like to leave the United States.  Issues One of the biggest issues with the American diaspora is the issue of double taxation. Unlike most developed nations, the United States taxes its citizens even when they live overseas. The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion mitigates double taxation on wage income, but the Internal Revenue Code treats ordinary foreign savings plans held by residents of foreign countries as if they were offshore tax avoidance instruments and requires extensive asset reporting, resulting in significant costs for Americans at all income levels to comply with filing requirements even when they owe no tax.\\"Costing More Over There\\", The Economist, 22 June 2006, accessed 17 April 2011 Even Canada's Registered Disability Savings Plan falls under such reporting requirements. The most prominent piece of legislation which has attracted the ire of Americans abroad is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Disadvantages stemming from FATCA, such as hindering career advancement overseas, may decrease the number of Americans in the diaspora in future years. The problem is so severe that some Americans have addressed it by renouncing or relinquishing their American citizenship. Since 2013, the number of people giving up US citizenship has risen to a new record each year, with an unprecedented 5,411 in 2016. This is up 26 percent from the 4,279 renunciations in 2015.

In a study about the effects of Oxycholesterol in rabbits with induced hypercholesterolemia, it was shown that compared feeding rabbits cholesterol and unoxidized cholesterol, feeding rabbits Oxycholesterol caused there to be much higher levels of total cholesterol and LDL Cholesterol. It is also shown to increase the amount of HCY and ADMA levels in the rabbits. An abundance of HCY (Homocysteine) leads to an organism with greater chances of endothelial cell injury which can then lead to coronary artery disease. ADMA (Asymmetric dimethylarginine) is shown to cause adverse effects on humans in the form of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Therefore it was concluded that adding oxycholesterol into diets of animals with hypercholesterolemia increases endotheial dysfunction and inflammatory response.

Barzil orders Gerrit out of his house. In China, Gerrit rescues Taou Yuen (Joy) from a gang of ruffians. Her father, a Manchu noble, orders the two to be wed or slain. Gerrit marries Taou and brings her to Salem where her appearance causes consternation among the Ammidon family and Nettie to become ill. Edward Dunsack (Hatton), a drug addict, is fascinated by Taou and tries to turn her mind against Gerrit. Edward tells her that Gerrit loves Nettie, whom she has seen at a party, but Taou repulses him.

Lockley (born 1950) is a Welsh palaeontologist. He was educated in the United Kingdom where he obtained degrees (BSc and PhD) and post-doctoral experience in Geology in the 1970s. Since 1980 he has been a professor at the University of Colorado at Denver, (UCD) and is currently a Professor Emeritus. He is best known for work on fossil footprints and was former director of the Dinosaur Tracks Museum at UCD. He is an Associate Curator at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History and Research Associate at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. During his years at UCD he earned a BA in 2007 in Spanish with a minor in Religious Studies, became a member of the Scientific and Medical Network and taught and published on the evolution of consciousness. Early life Lockley was born in the Channel Islands in 1950 and grew up in Orielton, a large country house in South Wales,Dino Land Paleontology Interviews, Dr Martin Lockley now the Orielton Field Studies Centre. His interest in natural history grew under the influence of his father, Ronald M. Lockley (1903‚Äì2000) who became well known as a ornithologist and author of more than 50 books. Lockley moved to England in the early 1960s where he attended Leighton Park School and twice (1966, 1968) won the All England Schools championship in shot put. Later after earning a BSc in Geology from the Queens University Belfast, he embarked on a career in palaeontology under the guidance of his mentor Sir Alwyn Williams FRS obtaining a PhD from the University of Birmingham (1977). As a graduate student and post-doctoral researcher at Glasgow University (1977‚Äì1980) he studied Welsh Ordovician paleoecology and represented Wales in athletics. In 1980 Lockley took a position as Assistant Professor of Geology at the University of Colorado Denver, and began his field oriented research on fossil footprints. Before then, few people had studied fossil footprints in the Rocky Mountain region, despite what turned out to be an abundance of important sites, including the Purgatoire Dinosaur Tracksite site in southeast Colorado. As the fossil footprint collections grew, Lockley created the Dinosaur Tracks Museum acting as Curator/Director there from 1966 until 2012. During this time he became a founding member of the Museum of Western Colorado with Dinosaur Ridge near Denver. He built up the fossil footprint collection to include more than 2,700 specimens representing Colorado, Utah.http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/Dinosaur- Tracks-Museum-in-its-last-year-at-CU-Denver.aspx Career Lockley is (2014) researching fossil trackways in Colorado and western North America, China, South Korea, Spain and the UK. He has published results of fossil footprint research in Portugal, Germany, France, Bolivia, Japan, Thailand and East Africa. He has been involved in efforts to create Geoparks, Unesco World Heritage sites and other protected areas in North America, Europe and East Asia. Awards and recognition Awards and recognition include American Association of Petroleum Geologists Distinguished Lecturer (1991‚Äì1992) and Harrison Schmitt Award (2013), Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists Distinguished Public Service and Journalism Awards, and The University of Colorado Chancellor's Lecturer Award, Researcher of the Year and Colorado Community Service Awards.

In their first season, between November 2008 and July 2009, Cabaret Red Light staged the series \\"The Seven Deadly Sins\\". Their second and third series (\\"The Experiment\\", about a cabaret that builds a time machine, and \\"The Seven Deadly Seas\\", a pirate and gypsy-jazz show aboard the barquentine Gazela) began in 2010, and they recently performed the premiere of their ballet-and-burlesque version of The Nutcracker based on E. T. A. Hoffmann's original Gothic short story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. Cabaret Red Light‚Äôs shows have been described as a blend of Agitprop and burlesque, an unlikely combination that earned them the title ‚ÄúThe Best Marxist Girlie Show in Hell.‚Äù In their third show in the Seven Sins series, WRATH!, the group handed out pamphlets announcing the emergence worldwide of ‚Äúpornographic socialism.‚Äù In the finale of their fifth show, GLUTTONY!, they immersed a showgirl (Annie A-Bomb) in liquid chocolate and invited members of the audience to lick it off. When Holly Otterbein of Philadelphia City Paper asked co-director Peter Gaffney about the politics of the show, he responded, \\"The common ways in which we entertain ourselves ‚Äî TV, movies, the Internet ‚Äî involve sitting in a room by yourself. Compare that to the licking scene. It's the opposite. It's real people in a room experimenting with themselves and testing out their own limits.\\"Otterbein, Holly. \\"Sin-City\\" in Philadelphia City Paper, June 18, 2009. Online at http://www.citypaper.net/articles/2009/06/18/sin-city . Retrieved on 2009-08-19. In other interviews, however, Gaffney has denied that Cabaret Red Light has any overtly political agenda. \\"We think that theater has no business being in politics,\\" he stated in an interview with Emily Orrson of The Daily Pennsylvanian, \\"and neither does the government.\\"Orrson, Emily. \\"Seas and sins at the cabaret: Alumnus and Cinema Studies prof doubles as co-director of Cabaret Red Light\\" in The Daily Pennsylvanian, September 27, 2010.

Melissa Bang-Bang), Rolf Lakaemper, Andrew Morris, Shoshanna Hill, Angela Schleinkofer (a.k.a. Satangela) and Evan Smoker. Previous members, technical engineers and guest performers include Josh Anderson, Ryan Berg, Jess Conda, Andy Cowles, Alexandra Cutler-Fetkewicz, Nick Gilette, Biz Goldhammer, Toni Guinyard, Mike Harkness, Heather Henderson, Brian Hopely, Nicki Jaine, Julie-Fran√ßoise Kruidenier, Lindsay Ouellette, Gina Pickton, Kaveh Saidi, Timaree Schmit, Michael Schupp, Benjamin Shwartz (as The Ringer), Jeff Smith (a.k.a. Calvin the Jester), James Stapleford, Monsieur Thujone, Owen Timoney, Nick Troy, Koofreh Umoren, Marina Vishnyakova, Randi Warhol, and Kim Zelnicker (a.k.a. Svedka von Schotz). History Peter Gaffney and Anna Frangiosa created Cabaret Red Light in 2008 in order to challenge the common perception that burlesque is not serious theater, and that politically engaged theater, on the other hand, is serious to a fault. Their influences include Anita Berber, NSK (the Neue Slowenische Kunst political art collective), Georges Brassens, Kurt Weill, Bulat Okudzawa, Bertolt Brecht, Aristophanes and Wilhelm Reich, as well as more contemporary artists and performance groups such as Julie Atlas Muz, Les Yeux Noirs, Frank Zappa, Bread and Puppet Theater, Tom Waits, the Yes Men and The Yard Dogs Road Show. In November 2008 they performed their first show, \\"Vanity\\" as part of \\" The Seven Deadly Sins\\" series at L'Etage Cabaret in Philadelphia. Beginning in November, 2009, Plays and Players Theatre began presenting Cabaret Red Light's shows derived from their cabaret material. These shows were called \\"The Takeover\\", \\"The Occupation\\", and \\"Lust\\". These elaborately staged productions have included such things as an army of showgirls armed with feathers and weapon props, and a 20-foot octopus puppet. In the summers of 2010 and 2011 the company produced four shows in the series, \\"The Seven Deadly Seas\\". The shows were about pirates as corporate/capitalist figures and featured swordplay and burlesque. They premiered on the Gazela, a historic three masted tall ship. Shows were performed in Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore. Their original production of Nutcracker premiered in December 2010 at Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia. The show featured an original adaptation of the original E. T. A. Hoffmann story by Peter Gaffney and Anna Frangiosa. Music by Rolf Lakamper. Choreography by Christine Fisler. The adaptation was for adults and featured ballet, shadow puppetry, burlesque, and a seven piece orchestra. The production was re-mounted in December 2011 and sold out all performances. In October 2011 Cabaret Red Light produced an original musical play inspired by Mae West titled, \\"Looking Pretty and Saying Cute Things\\". Written by Anna Frangiosa and Peter Gaffney. Music direction by Chris Ashman. Inspired by Mae West's early brushes with the law over obscenity, her imprisonment for eight days after an \\"obscenity conviction\\", and her censuring by the Hayes Code. Cabaret Red Light produced no shows in 2012. The company's website had not been updated since 2011.

Biography  Beatriz Villaca√±as was born in Toledo (Spain). She obtained her PhD in English Philology at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, where she is professor of English and Irish literature. Daughter of Juan Antonio Villaca√±as. Corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and History of Toledo. She has lived in the UK where she taught Spanish. She has translated English and Irish poets such as: W. Shakespeare, W.B. Yeats, Seamus Heaney, Michael Hartnett and Brendan Kennelly. Due to family and professional reasons, Ireland has long been her second country. Related to the latter are her numerous articles on Irish literature and Irish authors and her book Literatura Irlandesa, the first complete study on Irish Literature in the Spanish language. She has been invited to An Tobar (The Well): Meetings between Irish and Spanish poets (Madrid) and conferences on Irish-Spanish Relations throughout the Ages (Salamanca, Sevilla, Madrid). She was invited poet to F√©ile na Bealtaine, International Poetry Festival, Dingle, Ireland, 2007. . Together with the Irish poet and translator Michael Smith she has selected and translated poems by Juan Antonio Villaca√±as, Selected Poems, Shearsman Books.  Work  Beatriz Villaca√±as's work comprises books of poetry, short stories, articles and essays. Lyrical reflection and probing into themes such as love, death, life and suffering are characteristic of Beatriz Villaca√±as' poetry, together with a marked preoccupation about transcendence and spiritual questions: \\"El tiempo nos esculpe y nos destruye, / la eternidad aguarda y nos rescata.\\"(\\"Time sculptures and destroys us/ Eternity awaits and rescues\\")\\"Para poder creerlo\\", (\\"If One Were to Relieve it\\", La gravedad y la manzana (Gravity and the Apple), Madrid, 2011 \\"Tierra, voy a dormir contigo,/ si alguna vez despierto,/ compartiremos juntos/ la inmortalidad\\" (Earth, I am going to sleep with you/ If I wake up some day/ We will together share/ immortality\\"\\"El Epitafio de Alberto Durero\\" (\\"Albrecht D√ºrer's Epitaph\\"), La gravedad y la manzana (Gravity and the Apple), Madrid, 2011 \\"Cada descubrimiento alimenta un enigma nuevo\\" (\\"Each discovery nourishes a new enigma\\")\\"Frutos de duda y de certeza\\" (\\"Fruits of Doubt and Certitude\\", La gravedad y la manzana (Gravity and the Apple), Madrid, 2011 Critics have singled out the liric personality of her poetry as well as her mastery of poetic forms.

It was born out of the 1950 revolution in Nepal, and was established in law in 1951, although it has been changed somewhat by law over time. It has six members who serve for six-year terms, as established by the Constitution of Nepal. During the Constituent Assembly elections in 2008, it was criticized for not fully upholding its duties, but was acknowledged to have managed the elections well nonetheless. The first election commissioner was Subarna Shumsher Rana in 1951 A.D. History The year 1950 was important in the history of Nepal: in that year, the Rana dynasty, which had controlled the government for exactly 104 years, was overthrown. The coup d'√©tat marked Nepal's first attempt at democracy; one of the primary goals of the revolution was to eventually establish the Nepalese Constituent Assembly. The democratic experiment was short-lived; in less than ten years, King Mahendra dissolved the government in favor of the Panchayat system. However, another major accomplishment was the establishment of the National Election Commission in 1951.The Nepal Interim Government Act of 1951, Section VI, 69. states \\" The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls for, and the conduct of these election, and, including appointment of Election tribunals for the decision of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection of with these election shall be vested in this Commission, which is referred to in this Act as the Election Commission.\\" ( ) The commission was declared by law to be independent of the government in 1966. This has been confirmed by Nepal's interim constitution in 2007. Composition It has five members, consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and four others. The members serve for 6 years. In order to enforce its election guidelines, the commission employs a group of around 240,000 officials, mostly civil servants, to monitor elections. When the commission was established, the members were chosen by the King. In 1989, King Birendra's constitution declared that the Chief Election Commissioner would still be appointed by the king, but the others would not. The interim constitution further amended the body's composition in 2006: all five members were made under appointment of the Prime Minister. The new constitution of Nepal has made the provision of appointment of chief election commission and other members by the president on the recommendation of constitutional members Criticism The commission came under some criticism during the Constituent Assembly elections for failing to enforce the code of conduct during elections. It also failed to fully educate voters about the election. However, it was acknowledged to have helped the elections run smoothly overall.

The film based on the novel of the same name by Antonio Soler, who also wrote the script for the film.  Plot summary  The film takes place in 1978 in M√°laga (Spain), and depicts the life of teenager Miguelito D√°vila (Alberto Amarilla), who after suffering from kidney disease and spending some time at the hospital, has learned such classic poetry as Dante's Divine Comedy and dreams of leaving his job at a hardware store and pursuing his dream of becoming a poet. One summer, he hangs out with his childhood friends Babirusa (Ra√∫l Ar√©valo), Paco Front√≥n (F√©lix G√≥mez) and Moratalla (Mario Casas), until he meets a girl called Luli (Mar√≠a Ruiz) at the swimming pool, and the two start dating. Luli would love to become a professional dancer, and is best friends with \\"La cuerpo\\" (Marta Nieto), who fancies Miguelito's posh friend Paco. The two couples spend time together swimming, and they gradually experiment with other distractions. Miguelito later meets an older teacher (Victoria Abril), who is interested in his talent, and begins an affair with her around the same time that Cardona (Antonio Garrido), an older and apparently richer man, starts courting Luli with the promise of helping her career as a dancer.

Roberts (APD-94), ex-DE-235, was a United States Navy high- speed transport in commission from 1945 to 1946.  Construction and commissioning  John Q. Roberts was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS John Q. Roberts (DE-235) on 15 November 1943 by the Charleston Navy Yard and launched as such on 11 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Deany Roberts Garner, mother of the ships namesake, Ensign John Q. Roberts. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-94 on 17 June 1944. After conversion to her new role, the ship was commissioned on 8 March 1945 with Lieutenant Commander R. N. Bavier, Jr., in command.  Service history   World War II  Following shakedown training in the Caribbean, John Q. Roberts underwent amphibious training in Hampton Roads, Virginia, during April 1945. She then got underway from Norfolk, Virginia, to join the United States Pacific Fleet, departing on 7 May 1945. She arrived at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 31 May 1945 and trained with underwater demolition team units until proceeding to Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Islands on 13 June 1945. In the weeks that followed, John Q. Roberts escorted convoys and took part in fleet maneuvers in the Philippines preparatory to Operation Olympic, the anticipated invasion of the island of Ky≈´sh≈´ in Japan.

History Breau had continual drug problems from the mid-1960s, which he only managed to get under control during the last years of his life. At one point, his friend Glen McDonald claims he isolated Breau in a remote cabin to help him straighten out and it was during this time he recorded Breau, resulting in these informal tracks done on solo acoustic guitar. This issue, on Randy Bachman's Guitarchives label includes an interview with McDonald discussing the background of the recordings. Others close to Breau dispute the location and claim these are recordings made in the home studios of Don Thompson and Gary Binstead in Toronto.

In 2015, he was named distinguished son (\\"hijo predilecto\\") of the city of Toledo. Biography Born in Toledo in 1922, the Civil War cut short his secondary education. Obligatory military service was carried out in places as different as Melilla and the Pyrenean Valley of Ar√°n. In the former, he was placed in charge of the reorganisation of the Military Club library and he took advantage of the opportunity to develop an intense autodidactic process, reading avidly and widely. On returning to Toledo, he was employed by the Town Council where he was later to take charge of the area of Art and Culture, a post he held for many years. His book of poetry Los Sapos (1968) is an indictment of power and its abuses, where a Town Council is at the same time a reality and a metaphor of such power. Plaque commemorating the birthplace of Juan Antonio Villaca√±as in Toledo In 1956, he was invited by the Belgian Academy of French language and literature to the III Bienale Internationale de Po√©sie de Knokke-le-Zoute (Belgium). His close friendship with the Hispanicist and poet Edmond Vandercammen dates from this period. The latter reviewed his Conjugaci√≥n Po√©tica del Greco in Le Journal des Po√®tes (1959) and translated several of Juan Antonio‚Äôs poems into French, all appearing in the said Journal (1972). Following his stay in Belgium, he was interviewed at the UNESCO in Paris where his voice was recorded for a special broadcast for Spanish America. From the 1950s onwards, the work of Juan Antonio Villaca√±as begins to appear in both national and international poetry anthologies. At the same time, extracts from his poetic and critical works was to appear in different journals and newspapers. Villaca√±as lived in Toledo throughout his life, remaining independent of groups and literary trends and following his own poetic and personal course. Such personal and artistic independence was to bring the toll of silence and neglect from the established groups and critical trends from the 1980s onwards. However, from 2001 onwards, the number of poets and critics, both Spanish and foreign, that admire Villaca√±as' work increases. This revival, coming after the break of these decades of the twentieth century, shows once again, the importance of Juan Antonio Villaca√±as. Relevant in this respect are the appreciations of such poets and critics as Emilio Porta,‚ÄúWith time, justice will be done to one of the best poets of the twentieth century, Juan Antonio Villaca√±as. His poetic works are very notable for the richness of themes and for the complexity they display, and they have been collected in an extraordinary book, edited and selected by another great poet, Beatriz Villaca√±as, Juan Antonio's daughter. Beatriz has made an excellent and thorough job full of love and knowledge towards the poetic works of her father. It is a book that should be read by everyone who loves real Literature.‚Äù Porta, Emilio, ‚ÄúLa Poes√≠a de Juan Antonio Villaca√±as: Argumento de una Biograf√≠a-Obra Po√©tica 1960-1984‚Äù, Mirador.

The opening speech was said by his daughter, Beatriz Villaca√±as Carlos Mu√±oz, 9 May 2010, ‚ÄúLa Feria del Libro rinde culto al poeta Juan Antonio Villaca√±as‚Äù (Book Fair pays tribute to the poet Juan Antonio Villaca√±as), El D√≠a de Toledo. Works Juan Antonio Villaca√±as wrote thirty three books of poetry, spanning a wealth of themes and forms, from free verse (as early as the 1950s) to the sonnet, from stanzas and rhymes of his own invention to the lira: Juan Antonio Villaca√±as infused this classical form with new and surprising content, so much so that his liras are now known as \\"Liras juanantonianas\\". To honour the mastery of Juan Antonio Villaca√±as regarding the lira, Juan Ruiz de Torres invented a new form deriving from this one, called decilira. In addition to poetry, he also produced an ample work of criticism and essays (these were to appear in a wide variety of publications as for instance La Estafeta Literaria y Nueva Estafeta, directed by Luis Rosales) and two prose books: B√©cquer o la Poes√≠a de Todos (awarded the C√≠rculo de Escritores y Poetas Iberoamericanos de Nueva York prize in 1971) y Vers√≥manos (1989). In the latter, Villaca√±as exposes the fallacies underlying a great part of the predominant poetry criticism of that time. Poems, reviews, short stories and writings of different types can be found in such publications as ABC, Poes√≠a Espa√±ola (1¬™ y 2¬™ √âpocas), Diario Ya, Poes√≠a Hisp√°nica, Diario de Le√≥n, Le Journal des Po√®tes and El Mercurio de Chile. In the seventies, Juan Antonio Villaca√±as explores a new way of creating: the union of poem and image to construct a unity of significance that he called ‚Äúliriforma‚Äù. An exhibition of these ‚Äúliriformas‚Äù took place in the Palace of Benacaz√≥n in Toledo in 1976. These ‚Äúliriformas‚Äù form together, a book called Testamento de Carnaval. Together with some other media, the periodical La Estafeta Literaria covered the news interviewing the author in the N¬∫ 579, 1 January 1976.

The Dunlap coke facility, which converted coal mined atop Fredonia Mountain into coke for use in blast furnaces in nearby Chattanooga, brought drastic change and modernization to Dunlap and the central Sequatchie Valley, the economy of which had long been based on subsistence agriculture. While the ovens themselves are all that remain from Dunlap's coke production operations, the Sequatchie Valley Historical Society has redeveloped the coke ovens area into a substantial public park and museum. Location The Sequatchie Valley is a long, narrow anticline valley carved into the southern section of the Cumberland Plateau. Dunlap, the county seat of Sequatchie County, is located near the center of the valley. The relatively steep walls of the Plateau rise roughly above the valley floor, which is traversed by the Sequatchie River. Fredonia Mountain, a section of the western valley wall, rises steeply a few miles west of Dunlap. The Dunlap Coke Ovens are situated at the base of Fredonia Mountain, along a stream known as Coops Creek. The ovens and surrounding park are located on Mountain View Road, just under a mile west of downtown Dunlap. The Dunlap ovens and the coking process Sandstone facing of two ovens The Dunlap coke ovens facility consists of five batteries‚Äî four \\"double\\" batteries of ovens built back-to- back in staggered formation, and one \\"single\\" battery of ovens resting against an embankment. The batteries are all approximately tall and wide, and range in length from to . The largest battery contains 100 ovens built back-to-back, and the smallest battery contains 24 built back-to-back. The lone \\"single\\" battery contains 38 ovens, and measures . Each battery rests on a foundation of clay.Carson Camp, Coke Ovens Walking Tour Map. Retrieved: 2009-08-21. 1879 illustration showing coke ovens in operation at an unnamed location The ovens themselves are in diameter, with sandstone exteriors and firebrick interiors. Each oven has an opening at the top and a \\"window\\" on the side. In the early 1900s, railroad tracks ran across the top of each battery. An incline railway connected the ovens to a coal mine further up the mountain slope, and railroad cars would carry coal from the mine to the tops of the batteries and dump the coal into the ovens' top openings.Henry Camp, Sequatchie County (Memphis, Tenn.: Memphis State University Press, 1984), pp. 70‚Äì76. During the coking process, a laborer would level the deposited coal through the side window using a scaper. Once the coal was ready, the side window would be sealed with clay, leaving a opening to allow the entry of air. The process, which essentially involves heating bituminous coal in a closed chamber to remove its volatile material, took about 72 hours. At the end of the process, the clay seal was broken, and the coke was removed and placed on a train for shipment to an iron furnace in Chattanooga. Two tons of coal typically produced one ton of coke. History Reconstructed commissary (now the Coke Ovens Museum) The arrival of the railroad in the 1880s brought major coal mining operations to the southern Cumberland Plateau. Coal was first mined on Fredonia Mountain in 1899, although it was considered too soft for domestic purposes. The following year, the Douglas Coal and Coke Company purchased a tract of land around the base of Fredonia Mountain for the mining of coal and production of coke.Carson Camp, The Boom Years in Dunlap. Originally published in the Running Water Historical News, June 1995. Retrieved: 2009-08-21. By 1902, Douglas had constructed the first 50 coke ovens, developed several coal mines, built the incline railway, and had established a company town with a commissary and clubhouse. The company suffered from labor problems, however, and never quite developed a method of separating the dirt from the coal. In 1904, Douglas halted operations.Carson Camp, The Company Town. Originally published in the Running Water Historical News, June 1995. Retrieved: 2009-08-21. Shed and tools on display at the Dunlap Coke Ovens Park mine replica The Chattanooga Iron and Coal Company purchased the Douglas operation in 1905, and the following year built a steam-powered coal washer and constructed additional coke ovens. Chattanooga Iron and Coal owned quarries in Georgia and a blast furnace in the Tannery Flats section of Chattanooga. At its blast furnace, the company used coke from its Dunlap operation to convert iron ore mined at its Georgia quarries into pig iron. The operation proved profitable until 1916, when a boiler explosion destroyed its coal washer. The company built a new washer and added more coke ovens that year, but the cost and poor performance of the new washer drained the company financially. In 1919, the company sold its entire iron and coke operation to the Southern States Iron and Coal Company. By 1920, Dunlap effectively consisted of two towns, just under a mile apart. Dunlap proper (the town's courthouse square and downtown area) had a population of 765, whereas the company town operated by Southern States Iron and Coal (at the present coke ovens park site) had a population of 700. The company's 350-man Dunlap workforce included a sizeable African-American population that was segregated. The coke ovens required a crew of 85 to remain in full operation. Southern States Iron and Coal produced coke at Dunlap until 1922, when it shut down its Dunlap operations. In 1928, brothers E.P. and E.K. Rosamund purchased Southern States' Dunlap properties with plans to revive the coke operation, but with the onset of the Great Depression and plummeting coal prices, their plans never materialized. Dunlap Coke Ovens Park Amphitheater, with battery of ovens in the background After the 1920s, the Dunlap Coke Ovens lay dormant for over a half century. By the 1980s, all that remained of the Dunlap operations were the ovens, a slate pile and coal washer ruins, two company houses (drastically modified), and the clubhouse. Some of the ovens retained only their sandstone frame, some retained only their brick interiors, and some had collapsed entirely. In 1985, the ovens were added to the National Register of Historic Places. The property, which had come under the ownership of the Bowater Corporation, was donated to the Sequatchie Valley Historical Association later that same year. With the help of hundreds of volunteers, the association cleared tons of trash from the area, and the Dunlap Coke Ovens Park opened in 1987.Carson Camp, Preserving Our History. Originally published in the Running Water Historical News, June 1995. Retrieved: 2009-08-21. To raise funds for park staffing and maintenance, the Sequatchie Valley Historical Association built an amphitheater adjacent to one of the oven batteries, and held its first annual Coke Ovens Bluegrass Festival. In 1989, the park received $71,000 from the estate of Rhea County historian David Henry Gray, which it used to reconstruct the commissary on its original foundation. The reconstructed building now houses the Coke Ovens Museum.Carson Camp, Reconstructing Our History. Originally published in the Running Water Historical News, June 1995. Retrieved: 2009-08-21. Along with the museum, ovens, and amphitheater, Dunlap Coke Ovens Park includes a coal mine replica with mining machinery on display, the ruins of the 1906 coal washer, a replica of the Dunlap depot, a caboose, and various park shelters. A hiking trail now follows the incline railway grade to the former mining areas atop Fredonia Mountain. Annual bluegrass festival The park's signature event is the annual bluegrass festival, which takes place the first weekend in June.http://www.cokeovens.com/ The event attracts bands and fans from around the region, including the strong bluegrass community in Chattanooga. The festival continues the long friendship between bluegrass musicians and the historical association. Local pickers played an integral role in the development of the park from the beginning, providing effort, connections, and entertainment to help with clean-up, construction, and fundraising. The event is promoted as family-friendly.Charli Wyatt, \\"Coke Ovens Slaves,\\" Video. 27 minutes. 2008 Documentary In 2008, filmmaker Charli Wyatt produced a half- hour program about the park and bluegrass festival. \\"Coke Ovens Slaves\\" tells the story of the volunteers and musicians who work to preserve local history and culture through the Coke Ovens park and festival. The program aired several times on Chattanooga's PBS station, WTCI. A DVD was also released locally. The title of the film refers to a song written by Ed Brown, the festival's music director and an original member of the historical society. Bluegrass monument In 2008, a group of local bluegrass fans erected and dedicated a monument to those bluegrass musicians who have performed at the park or in the Sequatchie Valley. Musicians' names are inscribed on stone slabs on each side of the monument.

It was among three sites in Louisiana founded by former members of the Utopian Movement called the Harmony Society in the early 19th century.Brochure, Germantown Colony Museum, 200 Museum Road, Minden, Louisiana 71055 Historical background The original colonists came from Germany, having first settled in Harmony, Pennsylvania, in 1803, then in New Harmony, Indiana in 1814, and finally in 1825 in Economy (now Ambridge, Pennsylvania). About 250 former members of the Harmony Society, many of whom left Economy, Pennsylvania, during 1832, decided to leave because of disagreements over the society's custom of celibacy. They followed a visionary named Bernhard M√ºller, who called himself \\"Count de Leon\\". The Count called upon all the heads of Europe to relinquish their crowns in a \\"new world to come.\\"Mrs. Paul Campbell, \\"Germantown historical marker to be unveiled by Gov. Kennon Tuesday\\", Minden Press, October 7, 1954, p. 2 The New Philadelphian Congregation, established by the New Philadelphia Society, planted its first colony in 1832 at Phillipsburg (now Monaca), Pennsylvania. Perhaps because of ongoing litigation, and other financial problems, M√ºller's group decided to sell their communal land in Pennsylvania in 1833. Some community members stayed, while others followed M√ºller and his family down the Ohio River on a flatboat. Soon they started again at Grand Ecore, twelve miles north of Natchitoches, Louisiana. There M√ºller died and was interred in Natchitoches Parish. When the Count died, a congressman obtained passage of a bill donating a tract of land to the colonists and to Countess Leon, the Count's widow. The roots of the Germantown Colony were hence established.\\"Minden Germantown Colony\\", Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, August 14, 1987 Kitchen at Germantown Museum The Countess takes charge In 1835, the group, then led by M√ºller's widow, the Countess, settled seven miles (11 km) northeast of Minden in what was then Claiborne Parish.David James, III, \\"Germantown: Once Thriving and Socialistic\\", Minden Press, July 7, 1958, pp. 1-2 For nearly four decades, the colony operated on a communal basis until it dispersed in 1871, when Webster Parish was created from Claiborne Parish.\\"Respect for the Past, Confidence in the Future\\", Webster Parish Centennial, 1871-1971, pp. 13-14 The Countess then moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where she died in 1881. One of three Utopian Society settlements in this area, the Germantown Colony, located off Louisiana Highway 531, was the most successful and lasted the longest, having peaked at fifty to sixty pioneers but usually with fewer than forty followers. The settlement had been planned by the Countess' husband, who died on August 29, 1834, of yellow feverThe Louisiana Historical Association in its Dictionary of Louisiana Biography attributes the cause of death as cholera. at Grand Ecore near Natchitoches, before he ever reached the intended Webster Parish. Leon and his followers attempted to build an earthly utopia, socialist in practice, while awaiting for the Second Coming of Christ. For his religious views, Leon had been exiled from Germany. He intended to plant the settlement in Webster Parish to coincide with the latitude of Jerusalem, 31 degrees, 47 minutes. The colonists worshiped under oak trees at the center of the colony. They supported themselves from farming, with a concentration on cotton. According to the Louisiana historian Marietta LeBreton of Northwestern State University, there was also navigation nearby on the lower Dorcheat Bayou from Lake Bistineau to Minden. Guide Amanda Steiner, a descendant of the Krouses, at Germantown Museum The colony thereafter was maintained by members of the Krouse family, including Dr. Francis Otto Krouse. In 1973, Krouse descendants, including Chester Phillip Krouse (1899‚Äì1981) and his sister, Ruby Florence Krouse (1906‚Äì2005), donated an acre of land to the Webster Parish Police Jury, equivalent to county commission in other states. Three of the original buildings, the Countess‚Äô cabin, the kitchen-dining hall, and the Dr. Goentgen cottage, survive at the site. The general store no longer exists. Replicas have been constructed of the smokehouse and the blacksmith shop. The buildings contain items used by the early settlers. There is also a sugar cane press outside. Some of the original wallpaper remains in the large room of the Countess' cottage, paper which she had ordered from New Orleans to cover the rough walls. A refined woman, the Countess gave piano instruction to girls and young women in her cottage. Historic Germantown Cemetery The small Germantown Cemetery at the site holds the remains of many of the settlers. Tombstone information reveals that a number were born in Germany. In some cases, the cause of death is listed on the markers. Establishment of the museum In 1954, then Governor Robert F. Kennon unveiled a still standing historical marker of the Germantown Colony. The sign is located at the intersections of Broadway, Elm, and East and West streets, across from the Webster Parish Library.\\"Governor to unveil historical marker here\\", Minden Press, September 30, 1954, p. 1 The Germantown Museum did not open to the public until May 10, 1975, with then former Governor Kennon, a Webster Parish native and a descendant of Germantown colonists, in attendance for the observation.\\"Ceremonies formally open Germantown\\", May 12, 1975, p. 1 In 1979, the colony was placed on the list of the \\"Cultural Resources Worthy of Preservation\\" by the United States Department of the Interior. As Germantown, the village was listed in 1979 on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008, the Louisiana State Legislature under Act 847 declared it appropriate for the state to operate the Germantown Colony and Museum. On July 1, 2009, the museum switched from parish to state control. Museum hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday through Saturday. A Bluegrass music festival is held annually the last Saturday of September. The facility is closed during the winter. There is no admission.Statement of Amanda Steiner, Germantown Colony guide, August 13, 2009 Germantown Colony is featured in two 1977 articles in the publication North Louisiana History, based in Shreveport.

The Germantown Colony Museum temporarily closed on June 3, 2013, for the construction of a new visitors center in the dogtrot style of architecture. The visitors center, which cost $512,000, opened to the public in November 2014. It provides a climate-controlled area to display more than a hundred artifacts used by the settlers. The renovation includes restrooms and new office space. The museum director is former State Representative Jean Doerge of Minden. She had worked in 2008 to secure funding for the building. Webster Parish raised more than $60,000 in contributions and in-kind donations of plumbing and electrical fixtures. Germantown Colony and Museum is the last museum to have been added to the state system. \\"We are telling a part of history that's almost been lost. We're opening that up to not only adults but children as well,\\" said Doerge.Kate Archer Kent, \\"Germantown Colony Museum reopens in Minden, 1800s artifacts preserved\\", mediad.publicbroadcasting.net, November 21, 2014 After all the renovation was completed, the museum fell victim to mid-year budget cuts required by Governor Bobby Jindal. Beginning April 13, 2015, the museum became open to the public only on Saturdays, instead of the former three-day a week schedule. Related Webster Parish history is also featured in the Dorcheat Historical Association Museum in Minden.

Wayne Waddell, a former state representative from Shreveport who is an administrator for Secretary of State Tom Schedler, said that funding for the museum is secure for the 2016‚Äì2017 years, despite the questionable condition of the overall state budget. Waddell said that Schedler will continue, where possible, to transfer facilities such as Germantown Colony and Museum, to the local communities.

The yaw rate or yaw velocity of a car, aircraft, projectile or other rigid body is the angular velocity of this rotation, or rate of change of the heading angle when the aircraft is horizontal. It is commonly measured in degrees per second or radians per second. Another important concept is the yaw moment, or yawing moment, which is the component of a torque about the yaw axis. Measurement Yaw velocity can be measured by measuring the ground velocity at two geometrically separated points on the body, or by a gyroscope, or it can be synthesized from accelerometers and the like. It is the primary measure of how drivers sense a car's turning visually. Axes of a ship and rotations around them It is important in electronic stabilized vehicles. The yaw rate is directly related to the lateral acceleration of the vehicle turning at constant speed around a constant radius, by the relationship :tangential speed*yaw velocity = lateral acceleration = tangential speed^2/radius of turn, in appropriate units The sign convention can be established by rigorous attention to coordinate systems. In a more general manoeuvre where the radius is varying, and/or the speed is varying, the above relationship no longer holds. Yaw rate control The yaw rate can be measured with accelerometers in the vertical axis. Any device intended to measure the yaw rate is called a yaw rate sensor. Road vehicles Studying the stability of a road vehicle requires a reasonable approximation to the equations of motion. Dynamics of a road vehicle The diagram illustrates a four-wheel vehicle, in which the front axle is located a metres ahead of the centre of gravity and the rear axle is b metres towards the rear from the center of gravity. The body of the car is pointing in a direction \\\\theta (theta) while it is travelling in a direction \\\\psi (psi). In general, these are not the same. The tyre treads at the region of contact point in the direction of travel, but the hubs are aligned with the vehicle body, with the steering held central. The tyres distort as they rotate to accommodate this mis-alignment, and generate side forces as a consequence. From directional stability study, denoting the angular velocity \\\\omega, the equations of motion are: :\\\\frac{d\\\\omega}{dt}=2k\\\\frac{(a-b)}{I}\\\\beta-2k\\\\frac{(a^2+b^2)}{VI}\\\\omega :\\\\frac{d\\\\beta}{dt}=-\\\\frac{4k}{MV}\\\\beta+(1-2k)\\\\frac{(b-a)}{MV^2}\\\\omega The coefficient of \\\\frac{d\\\\beta}{dt} will be called the 'damping' by analogy with a mass-spring-damper which has a similar equation of motion. By the same analogy, the coefficient of \\\\beta will be called the 'stiffness', as its function is to return the system to zero deflection, in the same manner as a spring. The form of the solution depends only on the signs of the damping and stiffness terms. The four possible solution types are presented in the figure. 600px The only satisfactory solution requires both stiffness and damping to be positive. If the centre of gravity is ahead of the centre of the wheelbase ((b>a), this will always be positive, and the vehicle will be stable at all speeds. However, if it lies further aft, the term has the potential of becoming negative above a speed given by: ::V^2=\\\\frac{2k(a+b)^2}{M(a-b)} Above this speed, the vehicle will be directionally (yaw) unstable. Corrections for relative effect of front and rear tyres and steering forces are available in the main article. Relationship with other rotation systems These rotations are intrinsic rotations and the calculus behind them is similar to the Frenet- Serret formulas. Performing a rotation in an intrinsic reference frame is equivalent to right-multiply its characteristic matrix (the matrix that has the vector of the reference frame as columns) by the matrix of the rotation. History The first aircraft to demonstrate active control about all three axes was the Wright brothers' 1902 glider.

Though more often, and originally only applied to males, it can be used equally for males and females; although women would more commonly use another slang word to refer to another unnamed female person, such as \\"chava\\" (young woman) or \\"vieja\\" (old lady). It is used roughly the same way \\"dude\\" is used in modern American English.What is G√ºey in English? - G√ºey Spanish It is derived from the term buey, which refers to an ox, used for meat, sacrifice, or labor. It was used to insult men as cuckolds, because oxen are slow, castrated bulls. Over time, the initial underwent a consonant mutation to a , often elided; resulting in the modern wey. The word can be used as an insult, like \\"fool\\", although, due to its extremely high frequency of use in a multitude of contexts, it has lost much of its offensive character, becoming a colloquialism. Use It is common to use both meanings of the term interchangeably: # To denote stupidity or ignorance, in expressions like \\"¬°Estoy bien wey, olvide mi celular!\\" (I'm an idiot, I forgot my (cell) phone!) Or \\"¬°No seas wey!\\" (Don't be an idiot!) # Cut the word to say \\"we\\"/\\"g√ºey\\". Like \\"¬°We! ¬°Estoy en mi Celular!\\" (Dude, I'm on my phone!) # To refer to the same person you are talking about, like \\"Wey, no pude ir.\\" (Dude, I couldn't go.) # To refer to a person whose name is unknown, like \\"¬øNo es tu hermano ese we, el de la camisa roja?\\" (This is your brother, this dude with the red shirt?) In the first case, it is used like the English profanity, \\"dumbass\\". In the last two cases, it is used like the American slang term, \\"dude\\". Although the word is not always offensive nor an insult between friends, its usage is generally considered uneducated. Thus its usage is limited mostly to friends and trusted acquaintances or among young people. It is considered in poor taste for a teenager or a child to refer to an adult as \\"Wey,\\" although among adults it is usually used in a common way. The word is used in any social class, being equally accepted and used in all. It is also used in television and radio in popular entertainment, but not in more formal or objective programs, like in the news.

It is a mixture of four stereoisomers (see below). It has a density of 0.851 g/mL, and a boiling point of 158 ¬∞C. Due to the presence of three strained cyclopropane rings, the molecule has a highly positive enthalpy of formation: ŒîfH¬∞(l)= 133 kJ/mol (980 kJ/kg, the average value for the isomeric mixture), bringing additional energy into the combustion process. It has advantages over the traditional hydrocarbon fuels, such as RP-1, due to higher density, lower viscosity and higher specific heat of oxidation. Syntin was used in the Soviet Union and later Russia in 1980s-1990s as fuel for the Soyuz-U2 rocket. It was first synthesized in the USSR in the 1960s and brought to mass production in the 1970s. It was prepared in a multi-step synthetic process from easily obtained acetylcyclopropane: :Syntin synthesis 01 After dissolution of the USSR, the production of this fuel was halted due to the expense of the synthesis.

Under the arrangement, Cook would operate for 90 minutes as WHB-TV and then Midland Broadcasting Company would operate it as KMBC-TV. They would switch back and forth in such arrangement and have separate studios. Cook sold its WHB franchise in 1954 and bought full rights to the channel 9 license, along with KMBC radio, keeping the KMBC call letters and keeping Midland's studios at the Victoria Theatre.

The walkout drew national attention when it climaxed on Sunday August 22 in a bloody battle between strikers, private security agents, and the Pennsylvania State Police. At least 12 people died, and perhaps as many as 26.Marylynne Pitz, \\"Pressed Steel Car strike in McKees Rocks reaches centennial anniversary\\". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 16, 2009, pg. E1. The strike was the major industrial labor dispute in the Pittsburgh district after the famous 1892 Homestead strike and was a precursor to the Great Steel Strike of 1919. History of the strike Background Frank Norton Hoffstot's Pressed Steel Car Company, sited downstream from Pittsburgh on the south bank of the Ohio River in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, manufactured passenger and freight railroad cars on an assembly-line basis. It was America's second- largest rail car producer.Edward Levinson, I Break Strikes: The Technique of Pearl L. Bergoff. New York: Robert M. McBride & Co., 1935; pg. 71. Pressed Steel employed a workforce of 6,000, most foreign born, comprising 16 distinct ethnicities. The firm was infamous for its style of industrial peonage with immigrant workers.Charles McCollester, The Point of Pittsburgh: Production and Struggle at the Forks of the Ohio. Pittsburgh: Battle of Homestead Foundation, 2008; pg. 181. Working conditions in the plant were primitive even by Pittsburgh standards.Crystal Eastman, Work-Accidents and the Law. New York: Russell Sage Foundation Publications, 1910. Pressed Steel Car Company was locally called \\"The Last Chance\\" and \\"The Slaughterhouse\\". \\"Men are persecuted, robbed, and slaughtered, and their wives are abused in a manner worse than death--all to obtain or retain positions that barely keep starvation from the door,\\" said Rev. A.F. Toner, a priest at St. Mary Roman Catholic Church in McKees Rocks, in an interview with The Pittsburgh Leader. The local coroner, Joseph G. Armstrong, estimated that deaths in the plant averaged about one a day and were often caused by moving cranes. One of the charges made by Slavic immigrant workers was that wives and daughters were subject to sexual harassment to repay food and rental debts to the company agents.McCollester, The Point of Pittsburgh, pg. 182. Anti-Hoffstot cartoon about the 1909 strike Particularly galling to the workers was the use of the Baldwin contract, commonly known as \\"pooling.\\" Under this system, jobs were parceled out in lots by a foreman who contracted that it be done for a given sum, with the money paid to be divided pro rata by the men under him.Louis Duchez, \\"The Strikes in Pennsylvania,\\" The International Socialist Review, vol. 10, no. 3 (September 1909), pg. 194. The system was rife with corruption, with workers often paying substantial kickbacks to the foreman to retain their jobs.Duchez, \\"The Strikes in Pennsylvania,\\" pg. 195. The system resulted in unpredictable and often insufficient rates of pay, as one sympathetic journalist reported: Adding further to the destabilizing misery was the company-owned housing, ramshackle dwellings housing six families and renting for $12 a month. Moreover, the company owned the stores from which the workers had to buy their provisions at inflated prices, lest they lose their jobs. The system of economic domination was particularly severe and there came a day when the breaking point was reached. The strike begins Mounted members of the Pennsylvania constabulary were deployed during the McKees Rocks strike. These officers were called \\"Cossacks\\" by the strikers. The strike was triggered on Saturday July 10, a payday on which many workers were shorter in their pay than usual. The men demanded an explanation; management refused to speak with the workers' representatives. James Rider, manager of The Pressed Steel Car Company, responded by hiring Pearl Bergoff, the notorious owner of strike-breaking paramilitary force.Levinson, I Break Strikes, p. 70. The first fatality was an immigrant striker named Stephen Horvat, shot and killed by a black strikebreaker called Major Smith. Two days later Berghoff had deployed 500 strikebreakers to the plant, most entering quietly by rail, although a boat called Steel Queen carrying 300 was rebuffed, at least initially, by strikers' gunfire on the shore. The next day 200 state constables and 300 deputy sheriffs insured the safety of the strikebreakers and also began evicting strikers from company houses. The New York Times reported, \\"The illiterate foreigners were like so many savages today when they first caught sight of the khaki-clad constabulary who had come in during the night.\\"Levinson, I Break Strikes, pg. 77. The strikers were joined by members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), especially William Trautmann, one of its founders. Trautmann later published a novel, Riot, about the McKees Rocks strike. After Trautmann's arrest for strike organizing activities, Joe Ettor replaced him, and IWW leader Big Bill Haywood also arrived to rally strikers.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 4: Industrial Workers of the World. New York: International Publishers, 1965; pg. 235. In all, some 5,000 workers of the Pressed Steel Car Company's plant at McKees Rock went out on strike. These were joined by 3,000 others who worked for the Standard Steel Car Company of Butler and others in New Castle.Duchez, \\"The Strikes in Pennsylvania,\\" 'pp. 194-195. An adjacent company-owned community, Presston (called Schoenville at the time and popularly referred to as \\"Hunky Town\\"), was at the heart of the strike. Presston workers were kept in constant debt to the company store and those behind in rent were evicted. On Saturday August 21 Deputy Sheriff Harry Exley assisted in one eviction by placing a baby buggy on top of a wagon laden with a Presston family's possessions. A photographer captured the moment. When it was printed in a Pittsburgh newspaper, the photo whipped up public sympathy for the strikers. This set up the confrontation of the next day, August 22, \\"Bloody Sunday\\". A crowd of thousands of strikers who'd set up a checkpoint identified Exley, in civilian clothes, and targeted him for retaliation. In a fury the mob killed him, and clashed with Pennsylvania State Police mounted on horseback, called \\"Black Cossacks\\" by immigrant Slav workers.McCollester, The Point of Pittsburgh, pg. 184. One local source put the number of dead at sixteen, which includes Exley, two state troopers, and three strikers. Perhaps ten others were gravely hurt, \\"while scores were wounded by being shot in the legs, hit by bricks and clubbed into unconsciousness by the constabulary.\\" Martial law was declared the next day. Striker workers evicted from Presston homes, 1909 Settlement of the strike The strike was settled on September 8 when Pressed Steel Car agreed to a wage increase, the posting of wage rates, and ending abuses in company housing practices. Legacy Before the strike was over, and then in more detail in 1911, the strikebreakers appeared before federal panels to describe their own living and working conditions after they were brought to the conflict. Held inside the plant or in boxcars against their will, fleeced, stolen from, physically threatened, and given rotten food, one hearing witness collapsed and was diagnosed with ptomaine poisoning. Two hundred of the strikebreakers had responded by banding together in their own improvised union. They'd quit work and were camping on the nearby banks of the Ohio River in an attempt to collect back wages, naming Chief of Police Farrell of the Coal and Iron Police and Pearl Bergoff's lieutenant Sam Cohen as those most responsible. Lawyer for the strikebreakers was the ambitious William N. McNair, who alleged that this treatment amounted to peonage. McNair would later serve one chaotic term as Mayor of Pittsburgh in 1934. On August 22, 2009 the Pennsylvania Labor History Society and the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission dedicated a state historical marker there to commemorate the strike's centennial.

Usually associated with severe head injuries, it may also occur with other types of trauma, such as long bone fractures, or with several non- traumatic systemic diseases. However, the exact cause of the disease is not well understood. There are no treatments specific for Purtscher's retinopathy, and the prognosis varies. The disease can threaten vision, sometimes causing temporary or permanent blindness. It is named for the Austrian ophthalmologist, Othmar Purtscher (1852‚Äì1927), who detected it in 1910 and described it fully in 1912. Presentation Associated diseases * Severe head, chest, or long bone trauma * Acute pancreatitis * Amniotic fluid embolism * Chronic kidney failure * Dermatomyositis * Fat embolism syndrome * Scleroderma * Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) * Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) Pathophysiology Purtscher's retinopathy likely involves complex pathophysiology, with several contributing factors, including complement-mediated aggregates, fat, air, fibrin clots and platelet clumps. The diseases leads to the formation of cotton wool spots in the retina, a finding observed in several other diseases, and atrophy of the optic nerve. Diagnosis Where trauma is involved, only a funduscopic examination of the back of the eye (retina) is necessary to make the diagnosis. Fluoroscein angiography may show a decrease in blood flow to the areas of whiteness in the retina. Treatment It may be treated with triamcinolone in some cases. However, in general, there are no treatments for Purtscher's retinopathy. If it is caused by a systemic disease or emboli, then those conditions should be treated. Prognosis Purtscher's retinopathy can lead to loss of vision, and recovery of vision may occur very little. However, vision recovery does occur in some cases, and reports have varied on the long-term prognosis. History  Purtscher's retinopathy was first characterized in 1910 and 1912 as a syndrome of sudden blindness after head trauma, with patches of hemorrhage and whitening of the retina in both eyes. Later, it was discovered to occur after other types of trauma, such as chest trauma, and is associated with several non-traumatic systemic diseases. Purtscher's retinopathy may also be associated with acute pancreatitis, vasculitis, embolization of such materials as fat and amniotic fluid, systemic lupus erythematosus, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and chronic kidney failure. Purtscher's retinopathy may be caused by extensive fractures of the long bones.

The band was one of the early pioneers among the first wave of \\"new millennium\\" heavy metal bands in Sri Lanka when the genre saw a rise in popularity in the country after the year 2000.  Biography  School mates Hasula Dias and Javeen Soysa formed Tantrum in 2002 as a heavy metal band when they were students at S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. At the time they barely knew the rudiments of instrumentation, and actually getting a band off the ground seemed unrealistic. Eventually, Hasula learned how to play a box guitar, later moving on to an electric guitar. In the meantime, schoolmate Dasith Fernando got a drum set and soon they were jamming, with Javeen on vocals. Another schoolmate, Soorya Hasthimuni, joined the band, and the four of them started to cover songs by their favourite bands. Soorya was on lead guitar and Hasula on rhythm guitar. Since they were lacking a bassist, they got another friend to help them on the bass guitar.Biography on Rock.lk At the beginning of 2004 the band decided take things more seriously and chose the name \\"Tantrum\\". They started off practising in cheap studios, since access to cash and good equipment was hard to come-by. The band put together a demo for TNL Onstage, although they were still short of a consistent bassist. Javeen took up bass guitar duties, but found it hard to play and sing at the same time. The band then got a new vocalist, who was also a schoolmate, who agreed to fill in until the band could identify a permanent vox. In the end, the band did not make it in to TNL Onstage 2004 due to the poor quality of the recording submitted as a demo as the band could not afford to record the track in a professional studio.Tantrum‚Äôs fifth birthday rock party and Biography This disappointing incident motivated the members to improve. Soon after, drummer Dasith left the band and other schoolmates filled in on various instruments for a short period, with Sujiv Fonseka and James Mather staying on as permanent drummer and lead guitarist respectively at the end of 2004. With these talented new members admitted to the Tantrum line-up, in the first few months of 2005 Tantrum had a stable line-up and decided to work on developing the original songs the band had composed over the past year. For once, they did not have to depend on many outside practice studio facilities as they practised at the drummer's home.Band history at official site Tantrum recorded and released their first single titled \\"The Destroyer\\", which instantly made waves in the local music scene with its unique theme, creative riffs and catchy drumming. It reached the number one spot on local TNL Radio's SL Hot 10, which it held for several weeks, and was the first debut track of any local band to reach the Number 1 spot on this much listened to chart-show that highlighted the best of local talent each week. This earned Tantrum some recognition in the music scene. They joined the now defunct Rock Company, which was then the main organisation promoting rock and metal bands in Sri Lanka. Soon afterwards, Tantrum released their second single, titled \\"Alone,\\" which although wholly different from The Destroyer in terms of mood and composition, also became a chart topping hit within a few weeks of its debut, and a new favourite among the local rock fans. Tantrum entered TNL Onstage 2005, and won the trophy for the Best Band.Tnl onstage 2005 winners This was a good achievement as the band had been unable to even qualify for the competition the previous year. After Onstage and the release of the track \\"Alone,\\" drummer Sujiv left the band as he was leaving the country. He was replaced by former Hi-Octane drummer Heshan Jayawardena. Soon after Tantrum's first Rock Saturday event, which was also in 2005, Hasula left the band as he was leaving the country. The band that had a unique presence with three guitarists was now down to two, and has remained a four-member line-up ever since.The Colombo Spirit ‚Äì Bleed For Your Passion The band also later saw the exit of guitarists Soorya and James who both left the country and were replaced by Malinda Senanayake and Arjun Dhas. Malinda later left the band and was replaced by Thishan Wijesinghe, while Arjun was replaced by Akila Peiris. Drummer Heshan Jayawardena left the band in 2006, and was replaced by Oshada Wijemanne who played with the band until 2008, when he left the country and was replaced by Tharaka Seneviratne, formerly of Whirlwind and Stigmata. The band released an EP titled The Destruction Begins in 2006. They have performed at several large and small musical events across Sri Lanka, having also headlined Heavy Metal festivals in India and the Maldives, with some members having played in Australia with associated acts. Tantrum released their debut album \\"Rebellion\\" in 2012, setting a new standard in the quality of heavy metal recordings in Sri Lanka. On February 14, 2015, Tantrum released a statement announcing that Taraka Senewirathne would step down from drumming duties. He was replaced by Ranil \\"Jackson\\" Senarath. On September 28, 2015 Tantrum released a brand new song titled \\"Milieu\\". The song was part of a compilation put together by TNL Radio for the station's 15th anniversary. Tantrum vanished without explanation shortly after the release of \\"Milieu,\\" thus ending an era with one of the last of the original new millennium heavy metal bands in Sri Lanka being destroyed by the very mainstream music it set out to challenge.

Early life  Emanuel Vardi was born April 21, 1915 in Jerusalem. His mother, Anna Joffa Vardi, had a piano studio with many students and started Emanuel on piano at about age 3. His father, Joseph Vardi had a violin studio and also started his son out on his instrument at about the age of 3. The family came to the United States in 1920 via Paris, France, aboard a ship called \\"the Asia\\" to escape the pogroms in the Middle East. He continued studying both piano and violin until about age 7, when he forwent piano to focus on violin. He played Mozart's Fantasy in D-minor at a recital at age 9. The next day the New York Herald Tribune came out with an article by Charles Isaacson where he said, \\"Keep a lookout for this future pianist\\". At age 12, his father found out about the Juilliard School, and filled out a submission form which was accepted. Then when they showed up for the audition, the jury expected his father to play. But his father pointed to Emanuel and said \\"no, he will be the one playing\\". They accepted Emanuel, but since the age limit was 16, he was sent to the Institute of Musical Art, where he studied under Constance Seeger, mother of folk singer Pete Seeger. Around age 14, Constance got him into the private Walden School, since the public schools wouldn't allow him sufficient daily practice time. She arranged for him to have 2 to 3 hours of practice daily. While there he was dubbed Mani by one of his teachers, Mr. Hill. About age 15, Emanuel dropped out of school for a time as a sort of teenage rebellion and lived with his friend Zack Baratz. Constance noticed he wasn't in school, coaxed him to return to his studies and then he was invited to return to Juilliard.  Career  In 1942, Vardi received the ‚ÄúRecitalist of the Year‚Äù award from the New York music critics for the best New York recital following his Town Hall debut. He had the distinction of being asked to perform a solo recital at the White House for President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II. Vardi is one of one two violists in the world to have ever given a solo recital in Carnegie Hall. He taught at the Manhattan School of Music and Temple University. In crossing musical genres of classical and jazz, he toured and performed with jazz greats such as Louis Armstrong and Al Hirt. In the early 1960s, Vardi worked for Audio Fidelity Records in New York as producer. In 1985, Vardi was featured in a full-length article in Strad Magazine, and in 2003 he was honored with a lengthy interview in the American Viola Society Journal, with his painting ‚ÄúHomage to a Great Violist‚Äù appearing on the front cover. Due to an accident in 1993, Vardi lost the use of his shoulder, forcing him to retire from the viola. After his accident Vardi continued with his painting and art endeavors. Emanuel Vardi died in North Bend, Washington, at the age of 95.

The result is a bright, powerful tone, often very high-pitched, although the sound is still different from and more feminine than what is produced by the modal voice.Caruselli, Grande enciclopedia, vol 4, p. 1196, article: \\"tenore\\"; Celletti, Storia, p 167. The term falsettone is also used for the mixed vocal register that can be achieved using this technique. History and description Falsettone has reportedly been used by tenors, baritenors, hautes-contre, and tenori contraltini of the Baroque and Classical eras. It was used from about A4 or B4 upwards. According to various authors,Potter, pp. 19/23; Grove, vol. 2, p. 113, article: Falsetto baroque and neoclassical tenors simply used falsetto to sing high notes, with the exception of hautes-contre, who could reach up to B in what was claimed to be the modal voice register. However, it was actually a \\"mixed head and chest voice, and not the full chest voice that Italian tenors would develop later\\".Potter, p. 23. Such mixed register does not seem, after all, very different from that described by Celletti and the Grande Enciclopedia. (Here, \\"head voice\\" refers to falsetto and \\"chest voice\\" refers to modal voice.) Nowadays, the falsettone register is seldom used in Opera. Such notes as high C, C-sharp, D and E are usually sung in the modal or modal sounding \\"mixed voice\\" register (or, as it is sometimes misleadingly described, \\"from the chest\\"). Even the famous F5 of Bellini‚Äôs I Puritani, which used to be left out or sung falsetto (for example by Luciano Pavarotti) has often been performed with a more \\"chesty\\" voice by the new bel canto tenor generation of the late 20th century.. It's unclear whether this mode of execution of notes as high as F5 and around is actually modal or, or the same light registration of falsettone but with more compression twang and brighter vowels which make it sound like a prosecution of modal. Falsettone is however employed in many renditions of classical baroque music, of which Monteverdi, Handel are names worth of mention, pioneers of this genre, by male singers, tenors but often even baritones or lower, taking roles which used to be of castrati. These singers use a resonating falsetto to achieve the notes and approximate the timbre which possibly used to be of these men. We can name among them Andreas Scholl, Philippe Jaroussky. Female opera singers often use this register for the higher part of their tessitura, but they connect it to their lower register. In that same period Italian musicologist Rodolfo Celletti, who was also an amateur singing teacher, tried to restore the falsettone technique, training the tenor Giuseppe Morino, who made his debut singing the tenore contraltino role of Gualtiero in Bellini‚Äôs Il pirata, at the Festival della Valle d'Itria in Martina Franca. Just a register or a specific style? We can notice that in the definition of falsettone, laryngeal and stylistic aspects overlap, it seems like the sound color, relatively dark, \\"covered\\", pure, rounded and consistent as the same time, is part of it. It possibly includes as well a stroger level of adduction and support than the typical falsetto. It is object of discussion whether to apply this definition to any sound even the ones most similar to the modal sound possibly made in M2, especially in the higher section of the voice. \\"Reinforced falsetto\\" is also used interchangeably, but more frequently, to describe strategies which intend to enrich and swell emissions which might be M2 or \\"falsetto\\" in nature.

In June 1941, at the age of eleven, his town was destroyed by the Nazi Luftwaffe. He survived World War II by running 3000 miles across Ukraine, Russia and Uzbekistan to Tajikistan. Hunger forced him to quit school and get his first full-time job at the age of twelve, while his father, mobilized into the Red Army, fought in the Battle of Stalingrad, where he was wounded. To escape from Soviet anti-Semitism and reach America, Robert illegally crossed from the Soviet Union into Romania, where he unsuccessfully tried to reach Palestine. From Romania into Hungary, then to Austria and Italy, he crossed the Alps twice by foot. In the DP camps in Cremona, Italy, he discovered ORT schools, where he and two others, out of 400 applicants throughout Italy, were accepted into the Central ORT Institute in Anieres near Geneva. In 1950, after some three years in DP camps, at the age of nineteen, Frimtzis reached America, where he earned a bachelor's degree from CCNY in 1956, and a master‚Äôs from Columbia University in 1960, both in electrical engineering, without finishing high school. Subsequently, in various engineering management positions, Robert contributed to the successes of America's space and defense programs. Career After his bachelor's degree, Frimtzis gained valuable experience in designing flight simulators for the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC7 airplanes at Curtiss-Wright, Electronics Division. Then at Emerson Radio and Phonograph Co., he performed systems engineering for the Radar Operator Simulator of the Hughes MG-13 Fire Control with the purpose of training radar operators on the F101B fighter plane. In 1960, Robert Frimtzis was introduced to the newly evolving and fascinating dinosaur industry. At General Dynamics, Astronautics (GDA) in San Diego, California, he headed a study titled Lunar Vehicle Gudiance Study, under contract to the Navigation and Guidance Laboratory of Aeronautical Systems Division, Air Force Systems Command. This study was led in conjunction with two other studies. Rendezvous Study performed by MIT Instrumentation Laboratories, and Earth Terminal Guidance and Lunar Landing, by ITT Laboratories. These were early pioneering lunar studies in the area of guidance and trajectory. At the end of the study, Technical Documentary Report ASD-TDR-62-207 dated March 1962, was issued. In 1962, at North American Aviation (Rockwell) in Downey, California, Robert Frimtzis was engaged in guidance and control studies for advanced systems. Later, as project manager of the Apollo Mission Simulator (AMS), a device being designed for the purpose of training astronauts to fly to the moon, Robert worked closely with Neil Armstrong, the only astronaut assigned to follow the AMS. He later managed the development of the timelines defining all the activities the three astronauts had to perform in the correct chronological sequence for each lunar Apollo mission. In 1966 at Hughes Aircraft Company (HAC) in El Segundo, California, Frimtzis was the assistant manager of the Trajectory Analysis Department on the Surveyor program. The department developed the trajectories for all Surveyor spacecraft flights. Additionally, he managed the Liftoff and Translation experiment. It proved that spacecraft engines can be reignited on the lunar surface, a task which was not a Surveyor technical requirement. The Surveyor was the first unmanned spacecraft to soft land on the moon. In addition to collecting and analyzing lunar samples, and photographing the surface of the moon, it proved the principle of soft landing a spacecraft on the lunar surface, and selected the landing corridor for the future Apollo manned flights. Later, as the engineering department manager, and assistant laboratory manager of systems engineering for a critical defense satellite program, Frimtzis had responsibility for the design and analysis of all major analytically complex spacecraft functions, such as orbit, and attitude determination, and spacecraft pointing. In addition to being responsible for trajectory analysis and launch vehicle integration, he also managed various studies of advanced defense satellite systems. In 1978, at TRW, Redondo Beach, California, Frimtzis, as an assistant to the director of systems engineering conducted various advanced system studies. Subsequently, he was the project manager of the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), where he was responsible for winning the competitive study and negotiating one hundred million dollar contract to build the huge spacecraft requiring the entire shuttle to launch it into earth orbit. He was later the project manager of a space laser crosslink system. In 1984, Robert Frimtzis with his wife, a mechanical engineer, founded in Torrance, California, RFA Associates Inc., a software engineering company, contracting with major aerospace companies like TRW, Hughes, Rockwell, and Northrop. RFA also developed a logistics analysis program called LISA for use by government contractors. Robert Frimtzis is currently retired and lives in California.

The route is in Jeff Davis and Reeves counties and connects Toyahvale to points farther west along I-10 including Kent and Van Horn. FM 3078 is part of the state's Farm and Ranch to Market Road System. Between 1966 and 1983 the numerical designation was assigned to a road in Maverick and Zavala counties. The current road was previously assigned as SH 27 and then U.S. Route 290 before the completion of I-10 locally. The road was part of a major route connecting El Paso to central and southern Texas and was accordingly constructed better than its current designation would suggest. The road is entirely rural in nature with no major intersections between its termini. History Maverick and Zavala counties Ranch to Market Road 3078 (RM 3078) was on June 21, 1966 originally the designation of a road in Maverick County extending northeastward from the former SH 76, a road that would become SH 57 that same year, and then US 57 since 1971. On April 25, 1978, RM 3078 was extended an additional and was re-designated as a farm to market road. On January 23, 1980, the route was extended an additional through Zavala County to FM 481 at the county line between Zavala and Uvalde counties. On July 8, 1983, the route was designated as an extension of FM 481. Jeff Davis and Reeves counties alt=Image of historic shield of SH 27.

At the bottom of the shield between the two circles and between the bottom two points of the star is the word Texas. alt=Image of US 290 highway shield. The shield is white on a black rectangular background. Within the shield is the number 290. The present route was originally part of SH 27. That highway had been proposed as early as 1919 and, after TxDOT's predecessor, the Texas Highway Department, gained authority to maintain state highways in 1924, SH 17 had become part of the state highway system by 1933 and concurrent with US 290. By 1939, the SH 27 designation along the present day FM 3078 had been cancelled. In the early 1980s, the I-10 bypass around Balmorhea and Toyahvale had been completed. With the completion of the Interstate, US 290 through much of West Texas became largely concurrent with the Interstate separating only to serve as a sort of business route into towns bypassed by the Interstate. With the creation of Interstate business routes, US 290 became obsolete on the portion running along I-10 and its route designation over that portion was canceled on November 21, 1991. The entire portion of US 290 through Toyahvale and Balmorhea, part of which was concurrent with SH 17, did not become a new Interstate business route. Instead, Business Route 10-F separated from I-10 at FM 2903 to enter Balmorhea and rejoin the Interstate along SH 17. FM 3078 was designated in 1992 along the portion of US 290 between I-10 and SH 17 to allow that stretch of highway not concurrent with SH 17 to have a highway designation when the US 290 designation was canceled. Route description alt=Image of FM 3078 passing through desert shrub land with the Davis Mountains looming in the distance. FM 3078 status as a formerU.S. highway during construction makes it built beyond the usual standards as a farm to market road. The two-lane road has broad lanes and paved shoulders. The road has bridges over all water crossings and no sharp turns or curves allowing a 70-mile per hour speed limit. The road travels through ranch land just north of the foothills of the Davis Mountains. There are no major intersections along the length of the road, and the road passes through no cities or towns before reaching its eastern terminus at Toyahvale.

It was also the site of the first papermill in the region and one of the first production sites for Kentucky Bourbon. The ell of the present structure, a small Georgian house, was constructed in 1789 by Craig. The two- story section was constructed by Gen. Richard M. Gano in 1812. While the ell originally faced the Royal Spring Branch, and the two-story section faced north, it was reoriented later to face North Broadway (Cincinnati Pike) and remodeled in the popular bracketed style by Hiram E. Stedman ca. 1860. The older sections of the house retain the original ash floors, paneled doors, paneled cupboards on the side of the fireplaces and original mantels in Kentucky Georgian and Federal style. After Craig's death the house passed to his son-in-law, Samuel Grant, who was killed by Indians. Afterward the house was purchased by Gano, who commanded a regiment at the Battle of the Thames, and who‚Äîin collaboration with his brother-in-law‚Äîdeveloped the city of Covington, Kentucky. At Gano's death, the property passed to Dr. Wm. H. Richardson, first professor of obstetrics and Dean of Transylvania Medical School, who brought the paper-making Stedman family to Georgetown.

After graduating from P.S. 9 in 1918, he then studied at the Grand Seminary of Montreal in Quebec, Canada until 1924, when he returned to the United States and entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. He was ordained to the priesthood on September 21, 1929, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Weldon completed his graduate studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He served as a curate at St. John the Evangelist Church in White Plains and at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Mount Kisco. From 1931 to 1935, Weldon was spiritual director at the Newman School in Lakewood, New Jersey. He was a curate at St. John Chrysostom Church (1935‚Äì1936) and at Blessed Sacrament Church (1936‚Äì1942) in New York. During World War II, he was a chaplain in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1946. He then returned to New York, where he became master of ceremonies to Cardinal Francis Spellman. Serving as executive director of Catholic Charities from 1947 to 1950, he was raised to the rank of a Papal Chamberlain in 1947 and a Domestic Prelate in 1948. On January 28, 1950, Weldon was appointed the fourth Bishop of Springfield in Massachusetts by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 24 from Cardinal Spellman, with Archbishop Richard Cushing and Bishop Stephen Joseph Donahue serving as co-consecrators. During his tenure, Weldon oversaw the construction of Cathedral High School, Our Lady of Lourdes School in Springfield, added a wing to Farren Memorial Hospital in Montague, and built Mont Marie, the motherhouse of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Springfield. He erected 10 new parishes, and constructed 11 new churches and several parish centers. He established a center for the Hispanic apostolate in Springfield, and a diocesan newspaper in 1954. He attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, and served as president of Elms College from 1958 to 1977. After 27 years as bishop, Weldon resigned on October 15, 1977. He later died at Mercy Hospital in Springfield, aged 76. In September 2018, a Diocesan Review Board notified Bishop Mitchell T. Rozanski that it had found an alleged story of sexual abuse by Weldon credible, citing a resident of Chicopee who had said such abuse had occurred to him as a child. The Review Board would later split, with several members saying that the victim did not name Weldon directly, while three others present maintained they had witnessed otherwise; in June 2019 Rozanski met with the alleged victim, saying he found the allegations \\"deeply troubling\\".

Development After the Second World War Slingsby wished to produce a high-performance sailplane to be used in the Olympic games. The German DFS Meise, renamed Olympia, had already been chosen as the standard aircraft for the abandoned 1940 games and was produced in large quantities in several countries. The licence for the 'Olympia' was held by the Chilton Aircraft Company so Slingsby had no choice but to design his own version. Due to the identical specification and the use of state of the art construction the Gull 4 emerged with very similar features to the Olympia. A replacement for the Kite 2 was proposed as the T.32 Gull 4B, but this glider did not reach the hardware stage. Design The fuselage was of semi- monocoque wooden construction with plywood skinning throughout over longerons and built up frames, most of which were shared with the Slingsby T.26 Kite 2. The wing was mounted on a narrowed pylon which faired into the cockpit canopy, reducing interference drag between fuselage and wing. A rubber sprung nose skid, landing wheel and sprung tail-skid completed the undercarriage. A large comfortable cockpit with an upright seat was covered by a canopy made from blown plexiglas, providing excellent visibility but sometimes giving a poor fit. The cantilever two-part wing had a rectangular centre section and tapering outer sections from approximately ‚Öì-span. A thickened G√∂ttingen 549 section was chosen for the wing root transitioning to G√∂ttingen 549 at the fourth rib then to NACA 0009 at the tip with 5¬∞ wash-out at the tips. Large DFS-style airbrakes opening from the top and bottom surfaces aft of the main spar provided adequate approach control. Ailerons were fitted to the trailing edge over the outer ‚Öì-span. Constructed entirely of wood with steel fittings the single-spar wings had plywood-covered torsion boxes forming the leading edges, and fabric covering aft of the mainspars. The fin was integral with the fuselage and also skinned with plywood. The tailplane was built up with wooden ribs and plywood leading edges stiffened with internal diagonal braces. The prototype was built with an adjustable tailplane for trimming but this was soon changed to a trim tab on the elevator. Operational history Flight trials of the Gull 4 began in late 1947 revealing no major vices and very similar, if not superior, handling to the Olympia. Performance was superior, a measured L/D ratio of 24.2:1 compared very favourably with the Olympia's L/D ratio of 22.5:1, and minimum sink speeds were similar. Samedan 1948 Two Gull 4s were prepared for the International gliding championships to be held at Samedan in the Swiss Alps in July 1948, joining two Elliott Olympias, and two Weihes from RAF clubs in Germany. Philip Wills and Christopher Nicholson flew the two Gull 4s, during a disastrous competition where Nicholson flying a Gull 4 and Greig flying an Olympia were both killed flying in challenging conditions in the Alps. Wills flying the other Gull 4 missed fourth place overall due to a barograph failure during the first day's task, later establishing a British National speed record for the 100 km triangle at 47 km/h (29.2 mph). After Samedan The aircraft flown by Wills was exported to Australia and made a phenomenal climb in cloud to 23,500 ft without oxygen, the pilot was forced to land in trees, when he emerged from the cloud at around 30 m (100 ft), wrecking the aircraft. Re-built the Australian Gull 4 continued flying until a winch launching accident caused extensive damage, the wreckage is stored at Tocumwal. The prototype was bought by the London Gliding Club at Dunstable, flying National competitions in 1949 and 1950; after a crash on the Dunstable hill-side the wings were fitted to a Slingsby Kite 2 fuselage. The last Gull 4 was purchased by the RAFGSA and flew with the Moonrakers Club, took part in the 1950 Internationals in Sweden, where its canopy parted company, but despite a new canopy being flown in, results were disappointing. This aircraft succumbed to an accident in 1966. Specifications (Slingsby T.25 Gull 4) See also References Notes Bibliography  Further reading *Taylor, J. H.

He belonged to the highly influential right-wing tendency prominent in Argentine politics either side of the Second World War. Rise to prominence A native of Buenos Aires, Amadeo studied philosophy and briefly worked as an academic in that area. During the 1930s the youthful Amadeo was closely associated with the anti-liberalism tendency and took his inspiration from such Catholic conservative writers as L√©on Bloy, Charles P√©guy, Jacques Maritain, G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Giovanni Papini and Ramiro de Maeztu.Alberto Ciria, Parties and Power in Modern Argentina (1930-1946), 1974, p. 151 As such he belonged to the group of rightist authors and activists that included Carlos Ibarguren, Manuel G√°lvez, Juan Carulla, Ernesto Palacio, M√°ximo Etchecopar and Rodolfo and Julio Irazusta.

MacLachlan, Argentina: What Went Wrong, 2006, p. 116 In response, author Ernesto Sabato published an open letter to Amadeo, The Other Face of Peronism, in which, without denying his own opposition to the populist leader, Sabato appealed for less hostility towards Per√≥n's largely working class supporters.La Naci√≥n (26 Mar 2006): Ernesto Sabato, el escritor y sus im√°genes Following the coup against Per√≥n, on September 25, Amadeo was appointed Foreign Minister for President Eduardo Lonardi; his spell in the post ended, however, when General Lonardi was replaced by General Pedro Aramburu on November 13.

Amadeo was involved in the disappearances during the Dirty War and was personally responsible for law 22068 which allowed the government to declare anyone disappeared for 90 days as legally dead. At the same time however Amadeo was also a member of the Sub- Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities attached to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which was investigating the disappearances. As a member of this group in 1979 he accepted that Argentine prisons were poor but argued that political disappearances had already ended and even argued that similar disappearances were a regular feature of life in New York City.Iain Guest, Behind the Disappearances, 1990, p. 120 References Category:1911 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Argentine male writers Category:Christian fascists Category:Argentine Roman Catholics Category:People of the Dirty War Category:Foreign ministers of Argentina Category:Permanent Representatives of Argentina to the United Nations Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Catholicism and far-right politics Category:Argentine people of Asturian descent Category:Argentine people of Basque descent Category:Argentine people of Canarian descent Category:Argentine people of Irish descent Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Argentine people of Portuguese descent Category:Argentine people of Spanish descent ","title":"Mario Amadeo"},{"id":"24071774","text":"Blekinge (, old ) is one of the traditional provinces of Sweden (), situated in the south of the country. It borders Sm√•land, Scania and the Baltic Sea. It is the country's second-smallest province by area (only √ñland is smaller), and the smallest province located on the mainland. The name \\"Blekinge\\" comes from the dialectal adjective , which corresponds to the nautical term for \\"dead calm\\". Administration  The historical provinces of Sweden serve no administrative function. However, Blekinge is the only province, besides Gotland, which covers exactly the same area as the administrative county, which is Blekinge County. Blekinge was granted its current arms in 1660 at the time of the funeral of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden (1622‚Äì1660) based on a seal from the 15th century. Symbolically the three crowns from the Coat of arms of Sweden had been placed on the trunk of the tree to mark the change in status of the former Danish province, that now belonged to Sweden. The arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: \\"Azure, an Oak Tree eradicated Or ensigned with three Crowns palewise of the same.\\"  Geography  Relative to the rest of Sweden Blekinge has warm summers and mild winters. Blekinge has a scenic archipelago and is sometimes called \\"Sweden's garden\\" (). The nature of Blekinge is characterized by its oak forests with occasional hazel and common hornbeam. The relief is an uneven joint valley terrain with straight and narrow valley bottoms that widen towards the coast. Bedrock in Blekinge is mostly granite and gneiss of the Blekinge-Bornholm rock province.  History  Blekinge became part of the kingdom of Denmark at some point in the early 11th century ‚Äì most likely 1026. Its status before then is unknown. It then remained a Danish province for over 600 years, and together with the provinces of Sk√•ne and Halland, it made up Sk√•neland. The eastern part of the Danish kingdom where Scanian Law (Sk√•nske Lov) prevailed. As a border province, Blekinge was often raided and looted by Swedish troops during Danish‚ÄìSwedish wars. In 1658, it was ceded to Sweden according to the Treaty of Roskilde and has remained Swedish ever since. During the Danish era, the port town of S√∂lvesborg was the seat of the administration in the western part of the province and Kristianopel in the eastern part. Notable fortifications during this period included sites at Elleholm, S√∂lvesborg, Lyckeby and Avask√§r. Towns in Blekinge with city privileges were: Ronneby (1387), S√∂lvesborg (1445), Elleholm and Kristianopel. After the Swedish takeover two new towns, Karlshamn (chartered in 1664) and Karlskrona (1680), were built, and the populations of Ronneby and Kristianopel were forcibly relocated to them. Karlskrona has for more than 300 years been the principal naval base in Sweden.  Subdivisions  Hundreds (in G√∂taland incl. Blekinge called h√§rad in Swedish, in Svealand called hundare) were the historical subdivisions of a Swedish province. Blekinge's hundreds were Br√§kne Hundred, Eastern Hundred, Lister Hundred, and Medelstad Hundred.  Language  In Blekinge the dialect was historically closely related to Danish and eastern Scanian, which is most likely an effect of the former administrative links to Scania. Today, the dialect is not as significant as before, with the exception of Listerlandet with its special language. The eastern dialect of Danish can also be found on the Danish island of Bornholm. Sports Football in the province is administered by Blekinge Fotbollf√∂rbund.

On 10 April 1917 she hit a mine laid by the German U-boat UC-26. History Built by the French company, Soci√©t√© des Forges et Chantiers de la Mediterran√©e, at La Seyne-sur-Mer for the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Transport Maritime Steam. The Salta was chartered by the British Admiralty in February 1915 and converted into a hospital ship. The former liner was painted white with wide green stripes and the insignia of the Red Cross, according to the terms laid down in the Hague Convention of 1894. Sinking While returning to pick up wounded at the port of Le Havre, France, Salta struck a mine at 11:43, one mile (1.6 km) north of the entrance to the dam. A huge explosion smashed the hull near the stern in the engine room and hold number three. Water rushed into the disabled ship which listed to starboard and sank in less than 10 minutes. Of the 205 passengers and crew members, nine nurses, 42 member of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and 79 crew drowned. The British patrol boat HMS P-26 attempted to come alongside to assist, but also struck a mine and sank. One of the survivors of the sinking was a steward, Frederick Ralph Richardson. Entered below is a verbatim copy of the report he was required to make once he had been rescued and had somewhat recovered from the ordeal. The report is handwritten. The report contains at least one error in that he describes the Patrol Boat P-26 as a \\"Destroyer\\". Any other errors should be listed here so that the report stands as written.

The dialects are significantly influenced by Welsh grammar and often include words derived from Welsh. In addition to the distinctive words and grammar, a variety of accents are found across Wales, including those of North Wales, the Cardiff dialect, the South Wales Valleys and West Wales. Accents and dialects in the west of Wales have been more heavily influenced by the Welsh language while dialects in the east have been influenced more by dialects in England. In the east and south east, it has been influenced by West Country and West Midland dialects while in north east Wales and parts of the North Wales coast, it has been influenced by Merseyside English. A colloquial portmanteau word for Welsh English is Wenglish. It has been in use since 1985.Lambert, James. 2018. A multitude of ‚Äòlishes‚Äô: The nomenclature of hybridity. English World- wide, 39(1): 32. DOI: 10.1075/eww.38.3.04lam Pronunciation Vowels Short monophthongs * The vowel of cat is pronounced as a more central near-open front unrounded vowel . In Cardiff, bag is pronounced with a long vowel . In Mid-Wales, a pronunciation resembling its New Zealand and South African analogue is sometimes heard, i.e. trap is pronounced * The vowel of end is a more open vowel and thus closer to cardinal vowel than RP * In Cardiff, the vowel of \\"kit\\" sounds slightly closer to the schwa sound of above, an advanced close-mid central unrounded vowel * The vowel of \\"bus\\" is pronounced [~] and is encountered as a hypercorrection in northern areas for foot. It is sometimes manifested in border areas of north and mid Wales as an open front unrounded vowel or as a near-close near-back rounded vowel in northeast Wales, under influence of Cheshire and Merseyside accents, and to a lesser extent in south Pembrokeshire. * The schwa tends to be supplanted by an in final closed syllables, e.g. brightest . The uncertainty over which vowel to use often leads to 'hypercorrections' involving the schwa, e.g. programme is often pronounced Long monophthongs Monophthongs of Welsh English as they are pronounced in Abercrave, from .

Diphthongs of Welsh English as they are pronounced in Abercrave, from Diphthongs of Welsh English as they are pronounced in Cardiff, from * The vowel of car is often pronounced as an open central unrounded vowel and more often as a long open front unrounded vowel * In broader varieties, particularly in Cardiff, the vowel of bird is similar to South African and New Zealand, i.e. a mid front rounded vowel * Most other long monophthongs are similar to that of Received Pronunciation, but words with the RP are sometimes pronounced as and the RP as . An example that illustrates this tendency is the Abercrave pronunciation of play-place * In northern varieties, as in coat and as in caught/court may be merged into (phonetically ). Diphthongs * Fronting diphthongs tend to resemble Received Pronunciation, apart from the vowel of bite that has a more centralised onset * Backing diphthongs are more varied: **The vowel of low in RP, other than being rendered as a monophthong, like described above, is often pronounced as **The word town is pronounced with a near-open central onset **Welsh English is one of few dialects where the Late Middle English diphthong never became . Thus you , yew , and ewe are not homophones in Welsh English. Consonants * A strong tendency (shared with Scottish English, Northern English and some South African accents) towards using an alveolar tap (a 'tapped r') in place of an approximant (the r used in most accents in England) is present while some accents influenced by Welsh may use an alveolar trill * Most Welsh accents are non-rhotic, however variable rhoticity can be found in accents influenced by Welsh, especially northern varieties, while some speakers in Port Talbot may supplant the front vowel of bird with , like in many varieties of North American English * H-dropping is common in many Welsh accents, especially southern varieties like Cardiff English, but is absent in northern and western varieties influenced by Welsh. * Some gemination between vowels is often encountered, e.g. money is pronounced * As Welsh lacks the letter Z and the voiced alveolar fricative /z/, some first-language Welsh speakers replace it with the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ for words like cheese and thousand, while pens () and pence merge into , especially in north- west, west and south-west Wales. * In northern varieties influenced by Welsh, chin () and gin may also merge into * In the north-east, under influence of such accents as Scouse, ng-coalescence does not take place, so sing is pronounced * Also in northern accents, is frequently strongly velarised . In much of the south-east, clear and dark L alternate much like they do in RP * The consonants are generally the same as RP but Welsh consonants like and (phonetically ) are encountered in loan words such as Llangefni and Harlech Distinctive vocabulary and grammar Aside from lexical borrowings from Welsh like bach (little, wee), eisteddfod, nain and taid (grandmother and grandfather respectively), there exist distinctive grammatical conventions in vernacular Welsh English. Examples of this include the use by some speakers of the tag question isn't it? regardless of the form of the preceding statement and the placement of the subject and the verb after the predicate for emphasis, e.g. Fed up, I am or Running on Friday, he is. In South Wales the word where may often be expanded to where to, as in the question, \\"Where to is your Mam?\\". The word butty (, probably related to \\"buddy\\") is used to mean \\"friend\\" or \\"mate\\" There is no standard variety of English that is specific to Wales, but such features are readily recognised by Anglophones from the rest of the UK as being from Wales, including the (actually rarely used) phrase look you which is a translation of a Welsh language tag. The word tidy has been described as \\"one of the most over-worked Wenglish words\\" and can have a range of meanings including - fine or splendid, long, decent, and plenty or large amount. A tidy swill is a wash involving at least face and hands. Orthography Spellings are almost identical to other dialects of British English. Minor differences occur with words descended from Welsh that are not anglicised unlike in many other dialects of English. In Wales, cwm, valley, is always preferred over the Anglicised version coombe. As with other dialects of British English, -ise endings are preferred: realise instead of realize. However, both forms are acceptable. Code-switching As Wales has become increasingly more anglicised, code-switching has become increasingly more common. Examples Welsh code-switchers fall typically into one of three categories: the first category is people whose first language is Welsh and are not the most comfortable with English, the second is the inverse, English as a first language and a lack of confidence with Welsh, and the third consists of people whose first language could be either and display competence in both languages. Welsh and English share congruence, meaning that there is enough overlap in their structure to make them compatible for code-switching. In studies of Welsh English code-switching, Welsh frequently acts as the matrix language with English words or phrases mixed in. A typical example of this usage would look like dw i‚Äôn love-io soaps, which translates to \\"I love soaps\\". In a study conducted by Margaret Deuchar in 2005 on Welsh-English code-switching, 90% of tested sentences were found to be congruent with the Matrix Language Format, or MLF, classifying Welsh English as a classic case of code-switching. This case is identifiable as the matrix language was identifiable, the majority of clauses in a sentence that uses code-switching must be identifiable and distinct, and the sentence takes the structure of the matrix language in respect to things such as subject verb order and modifiers. History of the English language in Wales The presence of English in Wales intensified on the passing of the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535‚Äì1542, the statutes having promoted the dominance of English in Wales; this, coupled with the closure of the monasteries, which closed down many centres of Welsh education, led to decline in the use of the Welsh language. The decline of Welsh and the ascendancy of English was intensified further during the Industrial Revolution, when many Welsh speakers moved to England to find work and the recently developed mining and smelting industries came to be manned by Anglophones. David Crystal, who grew up in Holyhead, claims that the continuing dominance of English in Wales is little different from its spread elsewhere in the world. The decline in the use of the Welsh language is also associated with the Welsh Not policy, designed to discourage everyday use in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Influence outside Wales While other British English accents from England have affected the accents of English in Wales, especially in the east of the country, influence has moved in both directions. Accents in north-east Wales and parts of the North Wales coastline have been influenced by accents in North West England, accents in the mid-east have been influenced by accents in the West Midlands while accents in south- east Wales have been influenced by West Country English. In particular, Scouse and Brummie (colloquial) accents have both had extensive Anglo-Welsh input through migration, although in the former case, the influence of Anglo-Irish is better known. Literature Boathouse, Laugharne \\"Anglo-Welsh literature\\" and \\"Welsh writing in English\\" are terms used to describe works written in the English language by Welsh writers. It has been recognised as a distinctive entity only since the 20th century. The need for a separate identity for this kind of writing arose because of the parallel development of modern Welsh-language literature; as such it is perhaps the youngest branch of English-language literature in the British Isles. While Raymond Garlick discovered sixty-nine Welsh men and women who wrote in English prior to the twentieth century, Dafydd Johnston believes it is \\"debatable whether such writers belong to a recognisable Anglo-Welsh literature, as opposed to English literature in general\\". Well into the 19th century English was spoken by relatively few in Wales, and prior to the early 20th century there are only three major Welsh-born writers who wrote in the English language: George Herbert (1593‚Äì1633) from Montgomeryshire, Henry Vaughan (1622‚Äì1695) from Brecknockshire, and John Dyer (1699‚Äì1757) from Carmarthenshire. Welsh writing in English might be said to begin with the 15th-century bard Ieuan ap Hywel Swrdwal (?1430 - ?1480), whose Hymn to the Virgin was written at Oxford in England in about 1470 and uses a Welsh poetic form, the awdl, and Welsh orthography; for example: :O mighti ladi, owr leding - tw haf :::At hefn owr abeiding: ::Yntw ddy ffast eferlasting ::I set a braents ws tw bring. A rival claim for the first Welsh writer to use English creatively is made for the diplomat, soldier and poet John Clanvowe (1341‚Äì1391). The influence of Welsh English can be seen in the 1915 short story collection My People by Caradoc Evans, which uses it in dialogue (but not narrative); Under Milk Wood (1954) by Dylan Thomas, originally a radio play; and Niall Griffiths whose gritty realist pieces are mostly written in Welsh English. In popular culture * In the UK TV series Thomas & Friends, the narrow gauge engines Skarloey, Rheneas, Sir Handel, Peter Sam and Duke speak in a Welsh dialect, as do the two characters Merrick and Owen. * The Welsh comedy-drama series Stella is set in a fictional South Wales valley where Welsh English can be heard throughout. * The Anglo-Welsh comedy series Gavin & Stacey features extensive Welsh English throughout and has helped to popularise the word \\"cwtch\\" (cuddle, hug) around the UK.

The building is also known as United States Post Office and Courthouse‚ÄîMontgomery and listed under that name on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1992, it was renamed by the United States Congress in honor of Frank Minis Johnson, who had served as both a district court judge and a court of appeals judge.S.1467 -- To designate the Federal Building and the United States Courthouse located at 15 Lee Street in Montgomery, Alabama, as the \\"Frank M. Johnson Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse\\". It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2015. Building history The courthouse annex By 1929, there was an acute need for a new federal building in Montgomery. Federal offices were crowded, outdated, and scattered throughout the city. The United States Congress authorized funding for a new building in 1930, and the government purchased a lot containing the Court Street Methodist Church for $114,000 in 1931. The congregation relocated and the church was razed. The government, which had been authorized under the Public Buildings Act of 1926 to hire private architects, selected Frank Lockwood, Sr., of Montgomery to design the building. The Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore oversaw the project. Lockwood had completed a number of important projects in Montgomery, including the wings of the Alabama State Capitol and the Carnegie Library. The cornerstone was laid in a Masonic service on July 16, 1932, and the building, which included a post office, was completed and occupied the following year. In 1978, the post office moved to a new downtown facility. Over time, the remaining tenants required additional space and an annex designed by Barganier Davis Sims Architects Associated, a Montgomery firm, was completed in 2002. In 1992, the building was renamed the Frank M. Johnson Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse to honor one of the country's most distinguished judges who presided there for nearly three decades. President Dwight Eisenhower had appointed Frank M. Johnson Jr. to the position of district judge for the middle district of Alabama in 1955. Johnson ruled on a series of cases challenging Alabama's systematic racial discrimination. In 1956, Johnson ruled that segregated seating on Montgomery's buses was unlawful, justifying the Montgomery bus boycott. He also ruled in 1965 that it was legal for the Civil Rights march from Selma to Montgomery to proceed. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter elevated him to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, on which he served until he was reassigned to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 1981. Johnson assumed senior status in 1991 and remained active until his death. In 1997, the Annex received the Citation Award from the American Institute of Architects Committee on Architecture for Justice. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, and in 2015 it was additionally designated a National Historic Landmark. Architecture The building is located on a parcel of land bounded by Lee, Court, Clayton, Catoma, and Church streets, and the historic Montgomery Bus Station, where a mob attacked the Freedom Riders in 1961. The rising terrain and trapezoidal block give the building a dramatic and commanding site that is intensified by dignified and impressive architecture. Architect Frank Lockwood, Sr., designed the building in the Renaissance Revival style of architecture. The building's design conveys the dignity and stability of the federal government, which was particularly important during the Great Depression. It does not, however, contain excessive or exuberant ornamentation considered inappropriate for a somber period in American history. The quality materials and craftsmanship inspired confidence as citizens witnessed this major construction effort. Characteristics of the style include the rusticated first story, arched openings, tile roof, and columns and pilasters. The building is five stories tall and has an essentially U-shaped footprint with an interior lightwell. The first level is clad in large rusticated limestone blocks atop a granite base, and the upper stories are covered in smooth limestone ashlar. The rear elevation is clad in limestone, with the interior of the lightwell clad in buff-colored brick. The symmetrical principal facade faces Church Street. It is dominated by two pediments at each end that are supported by four monumental engaged Doric columns. A frieze with incised triglyphs and a dentil (rectangular block) course is found beneath the pediments. The Lee Street elevation features a colonnade of eight Doric columns, while the Court Street elevation contains three-story pilasters. Entrances have bronze doors with pediments decorated with eagles and floral scrolls. Round-arch openings on the first story have articulated voussoirs. Remaining windows on the upper stories are rectangular; those on the second story are topped by either carved surrounds or pediments. The shallow hipped roof is covered with red terra-cotta tiles. A penthouse originally used as a weather station occupies the roof. The interior boasts an elaborate L-shaped public lobby on the first floor. The floor is covered with travertine marble trimmed in green Maryland marble. Walls are clad in Briar Hill, Ohio, sandstone, and ceilings are coffered plaster with gold leaf. Original brass postal service windows and bronze grilles remain. The most significant interior space is the U.S. District Courtroom, where Judge Johnson presided, on the second floor. Limestone arches surround the windows. A stone niche behind the judge's bench is painted with white stars on a blue field. A stenciled wood ceiling, designed in the Italian Renaissance style, tops the room. It was repainted and re-gilded in the 1970s. A fourth-floor appellate courtroom is paneled in black walnut, which was also used in judges' chambers in the original building. Other original interior spaces include elevator lobbies, judges' chambers, and the district law library. Terrazzo and marble floors, marble wainscot, bronze elevator doors with bas-relief panels, and bronze radiator grilles are found throughout the building. The Annex, which was completed in 2002, has a radial design that is stylistically compatible with the original building. The Annex contains judges' chambers, district courtrooms, and bankruptcy courts. Between 2002 and 2006, the original building was renovated and the interior spaces reconfigured to accommodate the needs of the court.

It borders Sm√•land, V√§sterg√∂tland, N√§rke, S√∂dermanland and the Baltic Sea. In older English literature, one might also encounter the Latinized version, Ostrogothia. The corresponding administrative county, √ñsterg√∂tland County, covers the entire province and parts of neighbouring provinces. Heraldry From 1560, √ñsterg√∂tland was represented with two separate coats-of-arms seals until 1884, when the current one was granted. The coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: \\"Gules a Griffin with Dragon Wings, Tail and Tongue rampant Or armed, beaked, langued and membered Azure between four Roses Argent.\\" Geography Typical √ñstg√∂ta plains From west to east, in the middle parts, extends the √ñstg√∂ta Plain (√ñstg√∂tasl√§tten). It is largely agricultural. In the southern part of the province, the terrain becomes marked by the south Swedish highlands, with hills and countless lakes. The northern parts are also hilly, and are otherwise dominated by forests. Outside the eastern shore of √ñsterg√∂tland lies the √ñsterg√∂tland archipelago, the islands and islets of which cover an area of . The Br√•viken bay continues further into the country. Some of the more notable islands are Kors√∂, Gr√§ns√∂, Ark√∂, Djurs√∂, Yxn√∂, Finn√∂, Emt√∂, F√•ng√∂ and Stora √Öl√∂. Traditionally, the region is divided into two halves, east and west of the river St√•ng√•n (√ñstanst√•ng and V√§stanst√•ng respectively), which flows from the south into Lake Roxen at Link√∂ping. The eastern part of G√∂ta Canal traverses the province from the Baltic Sea at Mem to Lake V√§ttern at Motala. *Highest mountain: Stenaboh√∂jden, 327 meters (1,073 ft) *Largest lake: V√§ttern (second-largest lake of Sweden)  Towns  The Palace in Finsp√•ng Cities and the year of their now defunct royal charter. *Link√∂ping (1287) *Mj√∂lby (1922) *Motala (1881) *Norrk√∂ping (1384) *Sk√§nninge (approximately 1200) *S√∂derk√∂ping (approximately 1200) *Vadstena (approximately 1400) Today, the largest city in the province is Link√∂ping, with Norrk√∂ping second. Sk√§nninge is one of the oldest areas but small; Vadstena is also small. Additional towns without a royal charter that have emerged in the 20th century are Finsp√•ng and √Ötvidaberg. History The church tower at Bj√§lbo The earliest mention of √ñsterg√∂tland (the Ostrogoths of Scandza) appears in the Getica by the Goth scholar Jordanes. The traditions of √ñsterg√∂tland date back into the Viking Age, the undocumented Iron Age, and earlier, when this region had its own laws and kings (see Geatish kings and Wulfings). It is said that the famous Viking warrior Beowulf may likely have been from what is now the √ñsterg√∂tland region. The region kept its own laws, the √ñstg√∂talagen, into the Middle Ages. √ñsterg√∂tland belonged to the Christian heartland of the late Iron Age and early medieval Sweden. The Sverker and Bj√§lbo dynasties played pivotal roles in the consolidation of Sweden. The province has about 50,000 ancient remains of different kinds. Some 1,749 are, for instance, grave fields. Industry was formerly most significant in the cities of Norrk√∂ping (industries include Ericsson), Link√∂ping (where SAAB has aircraft factories where the Gripen fighter is produced), Finsp√•ng (metal works), and Motala (mechanical industries). Since the 13th century, Swedish princes and princesses in some dynasties have been created dukes and duchesses of various provinces. Since 1772, these are only honorary titles. There have been several Dukes and Duchesses of √ñsterg√∂tland. The current duchess is Princess Estelle since her birth in 2012. Local lore from Lake Sommen in southern √ñsterg√∂tland tells that a mythical cow called Urkon or Sommakoa will kill any crowned king that visits the district of Ydre. Reportedly Urkon already killed legendary king Frode. As Frode was passing through Ydre, Urkon escaped and persecuted him, when he thought to have left Ydre and thus being safe the cow slayed him.  Culture   Local accents  Formerly the √∂stg√∂ta or dialect spectrum were considered true g√∂ta dialects, but is nowadays considered being a transition area between true g√∂ta dialects and svea dialects. The dialects are still used in rural areas, but in the cities, the Standard Swedish is spoken with a certain √∂stg√∂ta accent. The accent √ñstg√∂tska can be distinguished from Standard Swedish just by accent and pronunciation of vowels ad sje- and the- sounds, which makes √ñstg√∂ta accent an eastern variety of the G√∂taland accent. In some parts bordering to S√∂dermanland, a variety of the Svealand accent is spoken.  Sights  The Provincial Museum in Link√∂ping In √ñsterg√∂tland several older churches are still standing and many castles and palaces are open to the public. Eken√§s Castle, one of the best preserved renaissance castles in Sweden, has belonged to the families Sture and Ban√©r. L√∂fstad Castle has its origin in the early 17th century, having belonged to the von Fersen family. Vadstena Castle, built by the Royal Vasa dynasty 1545‚Äì1620, is a combined fortress and renaissance castle. Vreta Abbey was the first convent to be established in Sweden, dating from the early 12th century, while Vadstena Abbey was the dominant convent in Medieval Sweden. Notable is also the ruins of the Alvastra Abbey near mountain Omberg and Lake T√•kern. The cathedral in Link√∂ping is the second largest church in Sweden and is very well preserved from the Middle Age. The G√∂ta Canal crosses the province East-West with several locks and the Kinda Canal connects the lakes in the southern parts of the province with the central plains. √ñvralid Manor was the last home of Nobel Prize laureate Verner von Heidenstam 1925‚Äì40. There are several museums in all parts of the province, for example the Swedish Broadcasting Museum, the open-air museum Old Link√∂ping, Swedish Air Force Museum, Sancta Birgitta Convent Museum, Museum of Work and the Motala Motor Museum. The R√∂k runestone is one of the most famous runestones, featuring the longest known runic inscription in stone. It can now be seen by the church in R√∂k (between Mj√∂lby and √ñdesh√∂g, close to the E4 and Lake V√§ttern). It is considered the first piece of written Swedish literature and thus it marks the beginning of the history of Swedish literature.

Lowdermilk worked with the Belgian Relief Effort (B.R.E., active 1914‚Äì1916 in Belgium and France) after World War I, in China in the 1920s to help avert famine, with the Soil Conservation Service, in fascist Italy in the 1930s, in the United States, and in Mandatory Palestine planning land and water use. In the latter he was impressed by the advanced techniques that the Zionist settlers, and later the State of Israel, took to develop water efficient agriculture and land use. A 1944 outline of local water development became known as the \\"Lowdermilk plan\\" and was of importance for the later National Water Carrier of Israel.

He served in World War I as an engineer and in the Belgian Relief Commission (1917‚Äì1918). He has been active as Flood control engineer and scientist in China and was Assistant Chief of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, US Department of Agriculture. He served as a President of the American Geophysical Union (1941‚Äì1944).  Positions and style  Lowdermilk's assumptions about soil conservation had a strong focus on cultural background. He was a conservationist influenced by George Perkins Marsh.Earth Repair: A Transatlantic History of Environmental Restoration, Marcus Hall University of Virginia Press, 2005 His public speeches and popular books contained various allegation to religious and historical evidence and legends. Compare: \\"Thou shalt inherit the holy earth as a faithful steward conserving its resources and productivity from generation to generation. Thou shalt safeguard thy fields from soil erosion, thy living waters from drying up, thy forests from desolation, and protect thy hills from overgrazing by the herds, that thy descendants may have abundance forever. If any shall fail in this stewardship of the land, thy fruitful fields shall become sterile stony ground or wasting gullies, and thy descendants shall decrease and live in poverty or perish from off the face of the earth. The Eleventh Commandment written and broadcast over the radio by Dr. Lowdermilk in Jerusalem during June 1939 was dedicated to the Palestinian Jewish villages whose good stewardship of the earth inspired this idea.\\"Lowdermilk, Walter C.

According to Drury: The Historical Guide to North American Railroads etc, 1994, cited in Wabash Railroad, the \\"North Missouri ran into financial difficulty in 1871; it was succeeded in 1872 by the St. Louis, Kansas City and Northern Railroad.\\" In preparation for the 1904 World's Fair, an additional sixteen mounds were destroyed. The mounds in Forest Park were mapped and excavated and had human remains associated with them. A group of mounds was near the St. Louis Art Museum and some were near the golf course. Today, about 80 mounds are preserved in the nearby Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site directly across the Mississippi River. Sugarloaf Mound is only one of about 40 mounds that remain in St. Louis. The mounds were constructed by Native Americans that lived in the St. Louis area from about 600-1300 A.D, the same civilization that built the mounds at Cahokia. Sugarloaf Mound is on the National Register of Historic Places. Sugarloaf Mound The mound got its name in the 18th century when St. Louisans noticed the shape resembled the loaves that sugar was transported in. Although the mound has not been excavated, it is assumed that the mound was used for burials. Sugarloaf Mound house. Sugarloaf Mound measures approximately in height, north/south and east/west. The mound overlooks the Mississippi River, where Interstate 55 meets South Broadway. It is now located entirely within the incorporated City of St. Louis, but used to be on the border between St. Louis and the formerly autonomous city of Carondelet. In 1809 the mound was used as a survey landmark when St. Louis was incorporated. A residence was constructed abutting Sugarloaf Mound in 1928, and portions of the mound were also impacted by a quarry and the construction of Interstate 55. Although suppressed in some online municipal records, the Sugarloaf Mound house was standing and still bore a mailing address of 4420 Ohio Street as of March 2013.http://www.stlouis-mo.gov/data/address- search/index.cfm?addr=4420%20%20%20%20%20OHIO%20AV&stname;=OHIO&stnum;=4420&parcelIdOnly;=27090000500&firstview;=true The home and land was purchased by the Osage Nation in 2009 from a private owner, with the stated intention of preservation.

She has been in love with her brother Link's best friend James for as long as he can remember. She is often invited to come along with Link and James to hang out and James says that when Ellen grows out of her crush on him, it will \\"break his heart.\\" A friend from school asks Ellen what she thinks it's like that her brother and James are \\"like a couple.\\" In order to understand the speculations that Link and James are ‚Äúlike a couple,‚Äù Ellen researches the topic of homosexuality. After her research, Ellen comes to believe that homophobic attitudes and behaviors are due to ignorance. Thus, Ellen concludes that being gay in a contemporary society should be accepted.

Karl Neumann, commanding officer of UC-67, was tried for sinking the hospital ship at the Leipzig War Crimes Trials. The German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court) found him not guilty. Neumann admitted torpedoing the ship but pleaded that he was obeying orders issued by the German Admiralty. The German Government had asserted that the Allies were using hospital ships for military purposes and declared on 19 March 1917 that German submarines could attack hospital ships not complying with several German conditions. The court held that Neumann believed the order to be a lawful reprisal and therefore was not personally responsible for the sinking.

Description ACB logo Acknowledged as the first regional initiative to save the ASEAN‚Äôs rich but highly threatened biodiversity, ACB is a continuation of the ASEAN Regional Centre for Biodiversity Conservation (ARCBC), which was a joint co-operation project of the ASEAN and European Union (EU), and hosted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines. Funding the centre From 1999 to 2004, ARCBC successfully established the bridge that fostered strong collaboration among ASEAN Member States (AMS) and between ASEAN and EU partner institutions, and gained recognition in the regional and global arena for biodiversity. A year later in 2005, the ASEAN and EU agreed to establish the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity to carry on the work of the completed ARCBC project. The Financing Agreement inked between EU and ASEAN provided the necessary funding for the establishment of ACB. The Centre was established primarily to facilitate co-ordination and co-operation among AMS on the sustainable use and conservation of biological diversity. The Agreement on the establishment of the Centre was signed by the Environment Ministers of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam on behalf of their respective governments. Government Relations The National Biodiversity Centre represents Singapore in the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity and is the national agency involved in biodiversity conservation and research in Singapore. Launch ACB was launched at the 9th Informal ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on 27 September 2005. The Agreement also established the ASEAN Biodiversity Fund with voluntary contributions of the AMS, other governments and organisations as approved by the Governing Board. The Fund is to be utilised to meet the expenses of the Centre and its various initiatives. The President of the Philippines Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has recommended to the Senate President and Members of the Senate the ratification of the Host Country Agreement (HCA) between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity. Signed on 8 August 2006 in Manila, the HCA provides that the Philippines shall be the Host Country for the ACB which is currently headquartered at the University of Philippines in Los Ba√±os, Laguna. Subject to concurrence by the Senate, the Philippine Government will later grant immunities and privileges to ACB and its staff. The Department of Environment and Natural resources (DENR), the Department of Finance (DOF), the Bureau of Immigration (BI), the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC), Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), and the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (UPLB) have endorsed the ratification of the HCA. Focus and Scope Dr. Ahmed Djoghlaf, executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), calls ACB \\"a unique mechanism that uses the bottom-top approach to deal with the biodiversity loss problem.\\" Now on its 41st year, the ASEAN has resolved to further strengthen its commitment to protect its biodiversity from degradation. \\"As part of the ASEAN action to save the region‚Äôs biodiversity, the countries declared 27 areas as ASEAN Heritage Parks and designated 1,523 protected areas based on the World Conservation Union (IUCN) category,\\" Executive Director Rodrigo Fuentes said. He added that \\"promoting national and regional cooperation to address measures related to environmental agreements, and establishing a regional database containing an inventory of the region‚Äôs biological resources are also part of the action to curb biodiversity loss.\\" Now on its third year, ACB reinforces its efforts to engage more sectors and stakeholders in the quest to save the region‚Äôs biodiversity.

Boyd (November 2, 1914 ‚Äì December 20, 2011) was an entomologist, botanist, editor, teacher, photographer, filmmaker, writer, and naturalist, best known for his close association with the Pine Barrens of New Jersey spanning more than 70 years.  Background  Born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1914, Boyd spent much of his early life on small farms in three suburban communities northeast of the city. An avid Boy Scout, by the time of his graduation from high school in Billerica, MA, in 1932, he had earned every nature merit badge in the Boy Scout Handbook. He attended the University of New Hampshire for two years before transferring to Boston University, where he received a bachelor of science degree in biological sciences with an emphasis in botany (1938). A lifelong learner with a fascination for the biological and natural sciences, he later earned a master of science degree in entomology from the University of Delaware (1979).  Career  Shortly after his graduation from Boston University, Boyd went to work for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), moving with his wife, Doris (nee Fowler), to the Philadelphia area in 1938. He had his first exposure to the New Jersey Pine Barrens through numerous insect collecting trips in the fall of that year. In 1969, after 31 years as an executive with BSA, he retired, at which time he became increasingly active in his two primary areas of interest: the Pine Barrens and entomology. Following his retirement, Boyd became prolific as an educator, conservationist, and writer. With Doris as photographer, from 1966‚Äì1976 the Boyds produced and presented films through the National Audubon Society Wildlife Film Tours. From 1970-1990, he was an instructor at the Conservation and Environmental Studies Center (now known as the Pinelands Institute for Natural and Environmental Studies) at historic Whitesbog Village, then sponsored by Glassboro State College. In the late 1980s and early ‚Äô90s, he was an adjunct instructor at the college, developing and teaching a course on the ecology of the Pine Barrens. He was a lecturer on Pine Barrens ecology for both Burlington County College (1990s) and the Pinelands Teacher Institute run by Pinelands Preservation Alliance (PPA; late 1990s to early 2000s). He was renowned and sought after for his workshops and field trips focusing on diverse aspects of Pine Barrens biology, ecology, and conservation. Boyd's reputation as an educator and conservationist was closely tied to his work as a scientist and researcher. Beginning in 1974, he spent nearly 30 years as the editor of the serial scientific publication, Entomological News, published by the American Entomological Society (AES), and he served as president of the AES from 1977‚Äì1981. For much of his adult life he was considered one of the U.S.‚Äôs leading experts on tiger beetles, a significant focus of his entomological research. He served as vice president and executive board member of the New Jersey Audubon Society (NJAS) from 1975‚Äì1983,New Jersey Audubon Society Author list and as chair of NJAS's Advisory Committee for the Rancocas Nature Center, which he helped establish, from 1977‚Äì1980. He was president of the Burlington County Natural Sciences Club from 1988‚Äì1990. Beginning in 1989 he served as a trustee of PPA.Field Guide to the Pine Barrens of New Jersey About the Author (BACK COVER) In 1980, Boyd was presented with the Paul S. Battersby Award by the Audubon Wildlife Society. In 1989, he was presented with the Silver Beaver Award by the Camden County Council, BSA. In 2002, he was presented with the Medal of the Garden Club of New Jersey (GCNJ), the organization's highest honor. In 2004, he was one of two premiere inductees into the Pine Barrens Hall of Fame, established by PPA to honor heroes of Pine Barrens protection. In 2009 he was honored for his leadership in New Jersey Pinelands conservation and education at the 4th annual Lines in the Pines symposium. Howard and Doris Boyd, who predeceased him in 2009 at age 94, were married for over 70 years and were survived by two children, five grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren. The couple were longtime residents of Tabernacle, New Jersey, Burlington County, within the Protection Area of the Pinelands National Reserve. At the time of his death at age 97, on December 20, 2011, Howard P. Boyd was celebrated for his influential work in educating the public on the importance of protecting the New Jersey Pine Barrens from the dangers of human development.  Books by Howard P.

Belize‚ÄìTaiwan relations are foreign relations between Belize and Republic of China (Taiwan). Bilateral relations between the two countries have been maintained since 1989. History William Quinto, a Belizean businessman of Chinese descent and a supporter of Belize's People's United Party, began lobbying then-Prime Minister George Price via his mutual acquaintance Said Musa for Belize to establish relations with Taiwan in the 1980s. Then- Taiwanese ambassador to Guatemala Gene Loh came to Belize in May 1984 and met with Quinto and Price to discuss the possibility of establishing relations, but Guatemalan leader Rodolfo Lobos Zamora objected, and after Manuel Esquivel of the Belizean opposition United Democratic Party took power in the election late that year, the plans were put aside. In the coming years, Quinto would put up the funds for Musa (by then Minister of Education), Minister of Foreign Affairs Harry Courtney, and Vice Minister Robert Leslie to go to Japan and Hong Kong in order to meet with Loh again. However, it would not be until after the 1989 election when the PUP regained power that Belize and Taiwan established relations. At that point, Belize only had three overseas missions, in London, Washington DC, and at the United Nations in New York City; Musa, who by then had become Minister of Foreign Affairs, told Quinto that if he did not go to Taipei to fill the position of ambassador, there would be no one else to take the job, and thus he went. Quinto remained Belize's ambassador to Taiwan until 2008, when he retired. His subordinate, charg√© d'affaires Efrain R. Novelo, was promoted to full ambassadorial rank to replace him.

FA members are men and women of all ages. Some have been obese; others have been severely underweight, bulimic, or so obsessed with food or weight that normal life was difficult or impossible. The common denominator uniting members of FA is addiction and a relationship with food that parallels an alcoholic's relationship with alcohol. The program offers the hope of long-term recovery, evidenced by members who have continuously maintained a normal weight and healthy eating for periods of twenty-five or even thirty years. FA was established in 1998 by former members of Overeaters Anonymous.Benoit Denizet- Lewis (2009), America Anonymous: Eight Addicts in Search of a Life, Simon & Schuster. , As of 2011, the organization consisted of over 500 local groups and over 4000 members in 6 countries, Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2012, FA published Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous. Definitions Food addiction is defined in FA as \\"an illness of the mind, body, and spirit for which there is no cure\\". As is the case with other addictions, food addiction involves physical craving and an ever-increasing dependence upon and struggle with a substance (food). The manifestations of food addiction vary. Overeating, under-eating or self- starvation, bulimia (including exercise bulimia), and extreme obsession with weight or food are among the symptoms of this addiction. Abstinence in FA is the parallel of sobriety in A.A. Abstinence is a planned, disciplined way of eating that leads to the addict's release from food cravings, obsession, and self-abuse. Abstinence is simple and clear, but it is difficult to sustain continuously over the course of a lifetime. FA believes food addicts have an allergy to flour, sugar and quantities that sets up an uncontrollable craving. The problem can be arrested a day at a time by the action of weighing and measuring our food and abstaining completely from all flour and sugar. FA defines abstinence as weighed and measured meals with nothing in between, no flour, no sugar and the avoidance of any individual binge foods. Sponsors are FA members who are committed to abstinence and to living the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions to the best of their ability. Sponsors share their program up to the level of their own experience.  Meetings  FA Meetings are central to the FA program of recovery. Meetings break the isolation that is part of the disease of food addiction and provide the opportunity for newcomers and members to learn from abstinent speakers who share their experience, strength, and hope. Members attend three meetings each week and those with 90 days of abstinence from food addiction share at a group level. Meetings are open to all FA members and those who are interested in learning about the program for themselves or for others whom they think might find FA helpful. Literature The FA book, Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous describes the possibility of long-term, continuous recovery from food addiction offered by Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous (FA), a program based on the Twelve Steps pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous. The book begins with a description of the experience of food addiction and its symptoms, which can include obesity, extreme thinness, bulimia, exercise compulsion, or a normal weight maintained at the expense of debilitating obsession. Most of the book consists of individual accounts of food addiction and FA recovery, some from members with over thirty years of sustained, one-day-at-a-time success. The volume includes a doctor's perspective, a chapter for family and friends, and a discussion of each of the Twelve Steps. Additionally, FA publishes several pamphlets, a periodical known as connection and produces audio recordings from successful members. Demographics and results A self-published survey of FA membership in 2011 showed 80% of members had lost 25 lbs. or more, and of those, 50% were at their goal weight. At that time, 33% of FA members had over 13 months of recovery from food addiction, and 22% had between 3 and 30 years with no return to food addiction. History In the early 1980s, the FA program began to take form within the context of Overeaters Anonymous (OA), another twelve step program. At that time, in the Chelsea, Massachusetts, area several OA meetings began to embrace a set of distinctive practices. The meetings were united by a shared definition of abstinence; the requirement that speakers at each meeting have a minimum of 90 days of continuous abstinence; the practice of doing the Twelve Steps in AWOL groups; and the belief that overeating, under-eating, bulimia, and other food-related, self- destructive behaviors are symptoms of the disease of addiction. These meetings were popularly called or criticized as \\"90-day meetings\\". Over time, it became clear that the program of the \\"90-day meetings\\" was distinctive from that of OA. Further, this program had grown. Members moved from the Boston area to Michigan, Florida, Texas, New York, California, Australia, and Germany, taking their recovery with them and establishing meetings in communities where they lived. In 1998, a small group gathered to discuss the possibility of establishing a separate program. \\"Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous\\" was launched later that year. The organization was legally incorporated in 1998. In May 1998, FA consisted of 18 meetings with approximately 177 members. By 2001, the program had grown to 122 meetings, with almost 1,000 members. The first business convention, held to coordinate FA service to newcomers, took place that year. Organizational and financial structure Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous, Inc. is the umbrella entity that supports meeting groups and FA individuals around the world. It is internally known as \\"WSI\\" (for World Service Incorporated). WSI is led by thirteen elected trustees (members of FA) and is headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts. FA meetings are also supported and united by incorporated regional associations (intergroups) and smaller, unincorporated regional affiliations (chapters). Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization that is primarily funded through contributions given by members of FA. The acceptance of bequests or donations from non-members, outside organizations, and anonymous donors is prohibited. Individual members are restricted to donations or bequests of no more than $2,000 in a year.

Usually built to scale, a 3D floor plan must include walls and a floor and typically includes exterior wall fenestrations, windows, and doorways. It does not include a ceiling so as not to obstruct the view. Other common attributes may be added, but are not required, such as cabinets, flooring, bathroom fixtures, paint color, wall tile, and other interior finishes. Furniture may be added to assist in communicating proper home staging and interior design.  Purpose  3D floor plans assist real estate marketers and architects in explaining floor plans to clients. Their simplicity allows individuals unfamiliar with conventional floor plans to understand difficult architectural concepts. This allows architects and homeowners to literally see design elements prior to construction and alter design elements during the design phase. 3D floorplans are often commissioned by architects, builders, hotels, universities, real estate agents, and property owners to assist in relating their floor plans to clients.  Construction  A 3D floor plan is built utilizing advanced 3D rendering software, the same type of software used to create major animated motion pictures. Through complex lighting, staging, camera, and rendering techniques 3D floor plans appear to be real photographs rather than digital representations of the buildings after which they are modeled. It is also the presentation of building floor-plan in an advanced manner, bringing it to real life views.  Technology  WebGL allows many companies to provide their users with unique 3D experiences right in their web browser. In addition, since 2014, WebVR helps make Virtual Reality experiences accessible to wider audiences. 3D floor plans can now be visited via Google Cardboard or various VR headsets.

They play in the Ardal Leagues North West, which is in the third tier of the Welsh football league system. Founded in 1883, they are given the nickname \\"The Quarrymen\\" due to the quarry history around the town. The Quarry Men play their home games at Cae Clyd.  History  Football has been played in the slate stronghold of Blaenau Ffestiniog since the 1880s when clubs like Festiniog Town, Blue Stars, Festiniog Juniors and Festiniog Athletic played regular friendlies. Ffestiniog became founder members of the Cambrian League in 1896 but football during this period was rarely covered in the press. At the turn of the century Blaenau's population was over 10,000 and such was the support for football that a local league was formed. 1906 saw the first appearance of a Blaenau side in the senior leagues when Ffestiniog Town entered the North Wales Coast League, winning it in 1912‚Äì13. Reforming after the First World War as \\"Blaenau Ffestiniog Comrades of the Great War FC\\" the club grew and under the name Blaenau Ffestiniog FC. From their venture into the Welsh National League (1921‚Äì30), through the North Wales Combination to the previous incarnation of the Welsh Alliance ‚Äì the Welsh League (North) the club won their fair share of silverware. The highlight was the 1971‚Äì72 season when they won the Welsh League, North Wales Coast Challenge Cup, Alves Cup and Cookson Cup. During the late 1970s CPD Blaenau Ffestiniog FC, continued their policy of hiring semi-professionals from the Liverpool or Wrexham areas to form their first team squad. Those locals with an interest in playing regularly had therefore no outlet except as a reserve team run by the club on and off. The players drifted off to sign for clubs outside the town; this was unacceptable to many. The senior club flirted on and off with a reserve side for locals but when the decision was made at the end of the 1979‚Äì80 season to drop the reserve team for financial reasons matters came to a head. On 17 July 1980 when a meeting was held at the North Western Hotel to discuss the formation of a new football club. Chaired by former Bolton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion star Gwilym Roberts the meeting was a great success and the present BLAENAU AMATEURS FC was formed and officials elected to administer the club. Gwilym Roberts was elected as manager for the first season and the club successfully applied for membership of the Vale of Conwy Football League, gaining entry to Section A. Aided by numerous cash donations the club started its first playing season away at Conwy British Legion. The first match ended in success, a 5‚Äì1 win for the Amateurs, but the club took time in establishing itself and it was not until the 1983‚Äì84 season that the club gained its first honour in the form of the League's Frank Tyldesley Trophy which they successfully retained the following season and regained in 1986‚Äì87. They had to wait until 1987‚Äì88 for their first Vale of Conwy League title which they won by two points from Penmaenmawr in a very tight finish. Having completed the season as runners-up the previous year, it was an even greater pleasure to take the championship unbeaten and to complete the double by winning the League's Challenge Cup in a final against near neighbours Dolwyddelan. This success, coupled with the fact that they were by now amongst the top clubs in the Vale of Conwy League, prompted an application to join the Gwynedd League. The application was successful and their membership of that League commenced at the start of the 1988‚Äì89 term. They became established members of the Gwynedd League but silverware proved very elusive with a mid table finish the norm. Due to financial problems the club resigned from the League in 1996 and operated back in the Vale of Conwy League where they had been active with a reserve side. In their third season in the VoC they took the title and having recovered their financial stability gained promotion back to the Gwynedd for the 1999‚Äì2000 season. They reached their first Cup Final in that same season but lost to Pwllheli FC in the Eryri Shield final. Four seasons later saw the Amateurs win their first Gwynedd League trophy beating Beaumaris Town in the final of the President's Cup, retaining it in 2004‚Äì05 by beating Nantlle Vale. That season saw them get their name on the Gwynedd Cup for the first time by beating Nefyn United in the final.  Successful years  The first successful season was the 1987‚Äì88 term when the club won the Vale of Conwy League title by two points from Penmaenmawr in a very tight finish. Having completed the season as runners-up the previous year, it was an even greater pleasure to take the championship unbeaten and to complete the double by winning the League's Challenge Cup ‚Äì then sponsored by the North Wales Weekly News ‚Äì in a final against near- neighbours Dolwyddelen. This success, coupled with the fact that they were by now amongst the top clubs in the Vale of Conwy League, prompted an application to join the Gwynedd League. The application was successful and their membership of that League commenced at the start of the 1988‚Äì89 term. The 2008‚Äì09 season has proved to be their best ever with the club winning the Gwynedd League championship for the first time. Their away form was outstanding going the whole season unbeaten but not without its cost. Injuries began to plague the first team squad as goalkeeper 'Spens' Hughes broke his leg, wing-back Aled Owen sustaining a long-term knee injury, creative midfielder John O'Donovan suffering a niggling hamstring problem, striker Gareth Roberts missing the season end with an ankle injury and Ceri Roberts carrying a calf strain throughout most of the second half of the season. Manager Brian Vaughan, who took over the reins at the beginning of the season had to rely heavily on young reserve players like Karl Kavanagh and Rhys Jones to fill his squad and they deserve great credit for their commitment and dedication in support of the first team squad. Keeper Pete Jones came out of retirement, cracked a rib and came back again to help them win the President's Cup for the third time by beating Llangefni Town Res. 2‚Äì1 at Porthmadog.

Genetically inherited traits and conditions are often referred to based upon whether they are located on the \\"sex chromosomes\\" (the X or Y chromosomes) versus whether they are located on \\"autosomal\\" chromosomes (chromosomes other than the X or Y). Thus, genetically inherited conditions are categorized as being sex-linked (e.g., X-linked) or autosomal. Females have two X-chromosomes, while males only have a single X chromosome, and a genetic abnormality located on the X chromosome is much more likely to cause clinical disease in a male (who lacks the possibility of having the normal gene present on any other chromosome) than in a female (who is able to compensate for the one abnormal X chromosome). The X-linked form of MTM is the most commonly diagnosed type. Almost all cases of X-linked MTM occurs in males. Females can be \\"carriers\\" for an X-linked genetic abnormality, but usually they will not be clinically affected themselves. Two exceptions for a female with a X-linked recessive abnormality to have clinical symptoms: one is a manifesting carrier and the other is X-inactivation. A manifesting carrier usually has no noticeable problems at birth; symptoms show up later in life. In X-inactivation, the female (who would otherwise be a carrier, without any symptoms), actually presents with full-blown X-linked MTM. Thus, she congenitally presents (is born with) MTM. Thus, although MTM1 mutations most commonly cause problems in boys, these mutations can also cause clinical myopathy in girls, for the reasons noted above. Girls with myopathy and a muscle biopsy showing a centronuclear pattern should be tested for MTM1 mutations. Presentation This condition is found almost always in male infants. It is one of the severest congenital muscle diseases and is characterized by marked muscle weakness, hypotonia and feeding and breathing difficulties. Genetics This condition is caused by mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene which is located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq28). Many clinicians and researchers use the abbreviations XL-MTM, XLMTM or X-MTM to emphasize that the genetic abnormality for myotubular myopathy (MTM) is X-linked (XL), having been identified as occurring on the X chromosome. The specific gene on the X chromosome is referred to as MTM-1. In theory, some cases of CNM may be caused by an abnormality on the X chromosome, but located at a different site from the gene MTM1, but currently MTM1 is the only X-linked genetic mutation site identified for myotubular or centronuclear myopathy. Clinical suspicion for X-linked inheritance would be a disease affecting multiple boys (but no girls) and a pedigree chart showing inheritance only through the maternal (mother‚Äôs) side of each generation. Research Audentes Therapeutics is developing an experimental gene therapy to treat the condition. A clinical trial was halted in 2020 after two boys participating in the trial died of liver inflammation and sepsis.

Early life Born in Dunedin Waddell attended Otago Boys' High School and then Canterbury College in the evening to prepare for, and win, the first New Zealand government military scholarship. In 1895 he became the first New Zealander to pass the open examination for an officer's commission in the British Army.W.

During this period he faced prejudice from his fellow officers in part because of his colonial origins.'Waddell, Lieutenant-Colonel James', in The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Military History, I. McGibbon (Ed.), 2000, Auckland: Oxford University Press, p.572. Other factors reportedly contributing to his ostracism included his small build (5 foot tall) and a university background not shared by his fellow officers. A Board of Inquiry ordered the retirement of a senior officer involved in the incident.New Zealand Herald 14 February 2015 French Foreign Legion The regiment was transferred to India, and it was here that Waddell met and married a French woman. She helped him earn the unusual honour for a foreigner, of a direct appointment as an officer in the French Foreign Legion. While the majority of the rank and file of the Legion were non-French, only a small number were able to become officers, and then normally after first reaching the rank of sergeant and becoming naturalised Frenchmen. Waddell resigned his British Army commission, obtained French citizenship and was appointed as a sous-lieutenant (second lieutenant) in the French Army on 25 April 1900. Between 1900 and 1914 Waddell undertook two tours of duty in Indo-China and served in the Sahara, Algeria and Morocco.

Seeger was a member of Waddell's Battalion. Later, Waddell was in command of the 2nd Battalion of the R√©giment de Marche de la Legion etrangere (RMLE) and was involved in the successful capture of Aubervie during the Nivelle Offensive in April 1917. In August 1917 his Battalion played a leading role in the RMLE's assault at Verdun which saw the capture of Cumi√®res-le-Mort-Homme. The RMLE in this action captured some 680 prisoners, eight artillery pieces and numerous machine guns. Some 2.5 km of enemy trenches were captured.French Military Records After this action, Waddell was transferred to command a training camp involved in training elements of the US 2nd Infantry Division. He was brought back into action to command a Battalion of the 169th French Infantry Regiment during the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918. He won a further two Croix de Guerre citations during this battle before being wounded. By the end of the War, Waddell had been awarded the Croix de guerre seven times.

This feature was introduced into the language in version 5.0. The feature provides a typesafe mechanism to include constants into code without having to reference the class that originally defined the field. It also helps to deprecate the practice of creating a constant interface (an interface that only defines constants then writing a class implementing that interface, which is considered an inappropriate use of interfaces.Java Practices) The mechanism can be used to reference individual members of a class: import static java.lang.Math.PI; import static java.lang.Math.pow; or all the static members of a class: import static java.lang.Math.*; For example, this class: public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\\"Hello World!\\"); System.out.println(\\"Considering a circle with a diameter of 5 cm, it has\\"); System.out.println(\\"a circumference of \\" + (Math.PI * 5) + \\" cm\\"); System.out.println(\\"and an area of \\" + (Math.PI * Math.pow(2.5, 2)) + \\" sq. cm\\"); } } Can instead be written as: import static java.lang.Math.*; import static java.lang.System.out; public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { out.println(\\"Hello World!\\"); out.println(\\"Considering a circle with a diameter of 5 cm, it has\\"); out.println(\\"a circumference of \\" + (PI * 5) + \\" cm\\"); out.println(\\"and an area of \\" + (PI * pow(2.5, 2)) + \\" sq. cm\\"); } }  Ambiguity  If two static members of the same name are imported from multiple different classes, the compiler will throw an error, as it will not be able to determine which member to use in the absence of class name qualification. For example, the following code will fail to compile: import static java.lang.Integer.*; import static java.lang.Long.*; public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(MAX_VALUE); } } In this case, \`MAX_VALUE\` is ambiguous, as the \`MAX_VALUE\` field is an attribute of both \`java.lang.Integer\` and \`java.lang.Long\`.

Located in Colombo, on the southwestern shores on the Kelani River, it serves as an important terminal in Asia due to its strategic location in the Indian Ocean. During the 1980s, the port underwent rapid modernization with the installation of Cranes, Gantries and other modern-day terminal requirements. Currently with a capacity of 7 million TEUs and a dredged depth of over ,Port of Colombo the Colombo Harbour is one of the busiest ports in the world, and ranks among the top 25 ports. It is also one of the biggest artificial harbours in the world handling most of the country's foreign trade. It has an annual cargo tonnage of 30.9 million tons.Colombo Port records highest cargo throughput in 2008 The port is also the naval base for Sri Lanka Navy Western Fleet under the Commander Western Naval Area (COMWEST). The Port of Colombo is home to the second tallest building in South Asia and is the center for many commercial interests.  History  Colombo Harbour MV Logos Hope ship berthed at Colombo harbour in 2015 Early history The Port of Colombo was known to Roman, Arab, and Chinese traders more than 2000 years ago. By the 8th century, Arab Muslim traders settled in Colombo as a base for their trade for that part of the world. Today, they make up the local Sri Lankan Moor community. Medieval history Among the users of the port, China, India and Persia were among the first people to use the harbour. In 1505 the Portuguese first discovered the Port of Colombo when first arriving to the island. In an effort to protect the coast from invaders the King of Kotte at the time, Parakamabahu VIII made a treaty with the Portuguese giving them the right to trade cinnamon from the island, and receiving full authority of the coastline. The Portuguese established a trading post in the port but they soon expelled the Muslims and began building a fort in 1517. In order of protecting their interests in coastal India the Portuguese Knew that controlling the island was vital, and so took advantage of royal rivalries between the Kingdoms. However, when the King of Sitawaka, Mayadunne, invaded the Kotte Kingdom and forced the Portuguese into retreat they retreated into the Port of Colombo, besieging the city many times. When the Kotte kingdom fell to the Kingdom of Sitawaka, the Portuguese were able to control the entire coast, making the Port of Colombo their capital. That area of the city is still called \\"Fort\\". In 1638 the Dutch empire signed a treaty with Rajasinghe II of Kandy for monopoly over the island's trade goods and in turn promising help in the Kandyan King's war effort with the Portuguese. In 1656 the Portuguese were eventually defeated through a terrible siege which ended with only 93 Portuguese survivors leaving the fort. The area captured by the Dutch was given back to the Sinhalese king, however continued to control the area and the rich cinnamon lands. Until 1796, The Port of Colombo was also the capital of the Dutch Maritime Provinces controlled by the Dutch East India Company. British Ceylon and Independence The Port of Colombo fell to the British in 1796, when they first arrived on the island. However it remained a Kandyan Kingdom military outpost until it was surrendered in 1815. The Port was made the capital of the new British crown colony called Ceylon. The British decided to build houses and civilian buildings rather than making it into a military centre, giving birth to the modern Port of Colombo. In 1865, the Municipal Council was created by the British in the Port of Colombo in an effort to teach the local population self-governance. The Colombo Municipal Council was practically the Legislative Council of Ceylon, meeting for the first time in 1866. In 1912, the Port was converted into a sheltered harbour, and the Colombo Port Commission was established in 1913. Much of the city was planned during the British occupation of the Port of Colombo. The Port saw dramatic changes when the country gained its independence in 1948. The Queen Elizabeth Quay was opened in 1954, while 16 alongside berths, transit sheds and warehouses were completed. In 1958 The Port Corporation was founded. Sri Lanka's economy began to improve, even though it had influences of Portuguese, Dutch and British cultures while its own had been repressed. 1980 to 2000 The Sri Lanka Ports Authority was created in 1980. The harbour underwent a major transformation to handle containerised cargo in the early 1980s, with two being built by the end of the 1980s and three more in the early 1990s. Due to this, and its strategic location amidst trade routes, the port became more attractive to main line shipping than any other port in the region. After the introduction of private sector operators, it consolidated its position as a major regional hub port for transshipment cargo in the late 1990s. The main channel of the port was deepened to 15 meters, while it also reached the one million mark for annual handling of container TEUs in 1996. In 1997 the Oil Berth was opened and container traffic made it to the 1.5 million TEUs mark. 1998 saw the opening of a new container terminal while 1999 saw a new container yard begin operation. The Oluvil Lighthouse was commissioned, and the Oluvil Maritime Training Center opened also in 1999. The South Asia Gateway Terminal began operations, and a new 50 thousand DWT berth was constructed. 2000 to Present Colombo Harbour in August 2013 A third berth at Galle Regional Port was started in 2000, while the Peliyagoda Container Freight Station was opened. The second phase of the North Pier development started, and the port opened a one-stop documentation center opened its doors. In 2002, the multi-purpose Ashraff Quay was inaugurated, while the new Customer Service Center for LCL and breakbulk cargoes was opened in the same year. 2003 saw the Unity Container Terminal and the Colombo Port Maritime Museum open. In 2004 the Port handled 2.2 million TEUs of containerized cargo, which increased to 2.45 million TEUs in 2005. At present, the port handles 15% of transshipment cargo in South Asia.Colombo South Harbour Development Project However, in early 2009, the container throughput of Nhava Sheva Harbour surpassed that of Colombo. However in 2016 Colombo port surpassed Nhava Sheva Harbour and become the largest and busiest container port in South Asia.China Government announced plans to purchase most of the Colombo South port for $1.7 billion. Although the deal was completed on 2014. The other terminals and the 5,000 acre industrial zone in the harbour were to be controlled by the SLPA.  Expansion project  In 2008, the port commenced a large-scale expansion project at a cost of US$1.2 billion, which is expected to dramatically increase the port's capacity and capabilities. The project, which was headed by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and built by the Hyundai Engineering & Construction Company, was completed by 11 April 2012. The expansion project consisted of four new terminals that are 1200m in length and can accommodate 3 berths each, alongside a depth of (which can be deepened to ). The channel width of the harbour is to be 560m and depth of 20m, with harbour basin depth of 18m and a 600m turning circle. It increases the annual container handling capacity from 4 million TEUs to approximately 12 million TEUs. It is also able to accommodate larger container vessels, carrying around 22,000 TEUs. The first terminal was awarded to the China Merchants Holdings (International) - Aitken Spence consortium on 16 September 2010.Sri Lanka Aitken Spence-China Merchant consortium gets terminal deal LBO, 2010-09-16 The new terminal is planned to be operational by First Quarter 2013.New Colombo port terminal on stream soon Sunday Times, 2010-09-19 Colombo South Container Terminal CSCT The 2.4 million TEU capacity Colombo South Container Terminal, the first terminal under new expansion in the Port of Colombo is built by Colombo International Container Terminals Ltd., (CICT), a joint venture company between China Merchants Holdings (International) Co., Ltd.

A portion is now a second main track on the BNSF Railway's Southern Transcon.  History  The Illinois General Assembly chartered the Chicago and Illinois River Railroad on February 28, 1867 to build a railroad from Chicago through Lisbon and Ottawa (the latter on the Illinois River) to the Mississippi River opposite Keokuk, Iowa, with a branch in the vicinity of Streator.An act to incorporate the Chicago and Illinois River Railroad Company, approved February 28, 1867 An amendment passed March 24, 1869 removed the requirement to serve Lisbon and Ottawa.An act to amend an act entitled \\"An act to incorporate the Chicago and Illinois River Railroad Company\\", approved March 24, 1869 Construction began in 1873 on a route south of the Illinois River between Chicago and Streator, but in 1875 it ran out of money and leased the unfinished line to the Chicago and Alton Railroad. The grade southwest of the Mazon River crossing at Gorman was sold to the Chicago, Pekin and Southwestern Railroad that year, and the Alton opened the railroad between Joliet and the Mazon River on July 1.Henry V. Poor, Manual of the Railroads of the United States, 1876-77, p. 271 The Alton bought the property at foreclosure sale on September 4, 1879, and in 1881 built a connecting line from Coal City south to its main line at Mazonia (near Braceville), giving it two tracks between Chicago and Odell.A. T. Andreas, History of Chicago from the Earliest Period to the Present Time, 1886, Volume III, p. 205 Beyond the Mazon River, the Chicago, Pekin and Southwestern completed the line to Pekin on May 21, 1876, and obtained trackage rights over the Chicago and Illinois River to Joliet.Henry V. Poor, Manual of the Railroads of the United States, 1880, pp. 754-755 Successor Chicago and St. Louis Railway, however, opened a parallel line to Chicago on December 21, 1885,Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1887, pp. 407-408 and the old Chicago and Illinois River line between Coal City and the Mazon River was subsequently abandoned. In 1905 the Alton and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe) began operating these two parallel tracks as a joint double-track line between Joliet and Pequot, just northeast of Coal City. At some point, Alton successor Illinois Central Gulf Railroad (ICG) sold the line between Plaines and Pequot to the Santa Fe for continued use as a second main track. When the Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway (CM&W;) bought most of the old Alton in 1987, it acquired only a short piece of the ex-Chicago and Illinois River between Joliet and Plaines, as well as Pequot-Coal City and the Coal City-Mazonia connection.Michael W.

Due to its proximity with China, Japan had long been familiar with gunpowder. Primitive cannons seem to have appeared in Japan around 1270, as simple metal tubes invented in China and called Tepp≈ç (ÈâÑÁ†≤ Lit. \\"Iron cannon\\"). They don't seem to have been used extensively however, and cannon usage would only become major after the arrival of the Portuguese in 1543.Perrin p.93 A few light cannon pieces were used at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, but the first cannons entirely made by the Japanese were cast a few months after the battle. They were bronze two-pounders, about 9 feet long, and were delivered to the warlord Oda Nobunaga.Perrin, p.19 The first Japanese matchlock guns were designed by the Japanese after Tanegashima Tokitaka bought two matchlock guns from Portuguese adventurers who were aboard a Chinese junk ship in Tanegashima. Within ten years of its introduction, over 300,000 tanegashima firearms were reported to have been manufactured.The connoisseur's book of Japanese swords Quick-firing breech-loading swivel guns, were also used and manufactured by Japan. Such guns were in use in Western warships, and mounted at the bow and sterns to devastating effect, but the Japanese used them also in fortifications.Perrin, p.29 After 1601 and the reunification of Japan under Tokugawa Ieyasu and the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, a policy of seclusion was progressively enforced, leading to the expulsion of foreigner and the interdiction of trade with Western countries other than the Dutch from 1631. Meiji restoration and modern era The French-built , flagship of the Imperial Japanese Navy at the Battle of the Yalu River (1894), used a Canet gun. Following the Meiji Restoration, Japan would pursue a policy of \\"Rich country, strong army\\" (ÂØåÂõΩÂº∑ÂÖµ), which led to a general rearmament of the country. During the 1877 Satsuma rebellion artillery was widely deployed, and an average of 1,000 artillery shells were fired every day.Perrin, p.76 Makeshift wooden cannons were again seen on the \\"rebel\\" side of this conflict, and during popular upheavals in 1884.The making of modern Japan by Marius B. Jansen p.386 Japanese artillery would then be used effectively during the Sino-Japanese war (1894‚Äì1895), and the Russo- Japanese war of 1905. The Imperial Japanese Navy enjoyed a spectacular development, allowing for the implementation of ever-larger artillery pieces. The Imperial Navy was the world's first to mount guns (in Kong≈ç), guns (in ), and only the second Navy ever to mount guns (in the Yamato class).In Evans, Kaigun Before and during World War II, Japan deployed a variety of artillery pieces, such as the heavy Type 89 15 cm Cannon or the Type 96 15 cm Howitzer (1936) .

Raja Tahir Raza Khan became an international lawyer, and Raja Masud Raza Khan was a psycho-analyst of international repute, and many of his books are still being used as text- books at leading universities in the UK, US and France. Tahir and Masud were settled in London. His maternal first cousins include Air Chief Marshal Agha Zulfiqar Ali Khan, Lt Gen Agha Saadat Ali Khan, Lt Gen Agha Nek Muhammad and Senator Dr Nighat Agha. General Anwar's only son, Engr Raja Idrees M. Anwar was Chief Research Officer and Director General of the National Institute of Electronics. His eldest sister's granddaughter is Dr Maleeha Lodhi.  Education  After early schooling at Lahore, young Anwar Khan was selected as a cadet at the age of 12 years, in the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College (RIMC) in Dehra Dun (India). He was in the Kitchener Section, as were some of his elder brothers. He became the ‚ÄúCadet Captain‚Äù (Senior Prefect) and was awarded ‚Äòcolours‚Äô in cricket and hockey, and won the ‚ÄòBest Athlete‚Äô cup. It was reported a few years ago, that some of his athletic records at RIMC remain unbroken. He was also awarded the ‚ÄòSilver Medallion‚Äô for efficiency in swimming by the Royal Life Saving Society London. He obtained the Chiefs College Diploma and stood first in all the ‚Äòcadet colleges‚Äô in India, for which he was awarded the ‚ÄúSir Pratap Singh Memorial Prize‚Äù. A very keen photographer, he took photographs whilst at RIMC with his own camera at the opening ceremony of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehra Dun. These became the official photographs of IMA, because the ones taken by the professional photographer came out bad owing to some problem with the pro-camera. He obtained the ‚ÄòCivil Engineering‚Äô degree with ‚ÄòHonours‚Äô from the Thomason College of Civil Engineering, Roorkee (India), and was awarded the ‚ÄúOlympic Cup‚Äù for representing the college at all games, namely; Cricket, Hockey, Football, Tennis and Squash. The principal described him as ‚Äúa rare combination of brain and brawn‚Äù. In February 1934 he was selected for the 4th batch at Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehra Dun. He passed the 1st Class P.T. and was awarded the ‚Äúsilver spurs‚Äù in horse-riding, and represented the IMA in cricket and athletics. He was awarded the ‚ÄúNorman Gold Medal‚Äù for standing first in the final examination and was runner-up for the Sword of Honour award, when he passed out on 3 June 1936. However, his seniority in the army was considered from 1 November 1935, as British cadets at Sandhurst did 18 months course, as compared to 30 months at IMA Dehra Dun.  Army Service  He was the first Muslim to be selected for Engineers, and posted to 31 Field Troop in the King George's Own, Bengal Sappers and Miners Roorkee in July 1936, where he did a ‚ÄúBasic (Combat) Engineering Course‚Äù. He volunteered for the South Waziristan operations where he served at Wana from Jun-Sep 37 in the 4th Field Company, and learned practical road and bridge making during operations. The local pathans admired him and were very pleased to see a Muslim working as an Engineer officer. Subsequently, he served in various Engineer units of the 7th Division, with postings and operational duties in Rawalpindi, Batrasi, Shinkiari and Nowshera. He was in 5 Field Company at Rawalpindi from Aug 39 to Jul 40, 7 Field Company from Sep 40 to Mar 41. Adjutant 7th Division Engineers from Mar 41 to Feb 43. Lt Col H. Barker was the Commander Royal Engineers for both Troops and MES Rawalpindi and 7 Division camp at Batrasi Camp, Hazara. The roads and water supply were built by him in two months for Div HQ Batrasi, one brigade at Bakrial, one brigade at Hamsherian and British gunners at Shinkiari. In Dec 42, the 7th Division crossed on a country boat bridge built by Engineers at the site of now Tarbela Dam and camped at Nowshera. In Jan 43 the 7th Division moved to Chindwara in Central India for training in jungle warfare, as Rommel had been defeated in North Africa, and no more desert warfare was anticipated. From Feb-Jul 43 he attended the Command and Staff College Quetta and was awarded PSC on graduation. During World War II, he spent 3 years in the Burma operations in 23rd Engineer Battalion and was ‚Äúmentioned in despatches‚Äù for his service and was promoted to Lt.Col. During this period he was involved in various military combat engineering operations, such as building roads, wooden (tank crossing) bridges, forward airfields, river jetties etc. in Arakan-Akyab area in 1944 and from Assam right through Burma to Rangoon. In Arakan-Akyab area, along the sea, they were a SEAC unit, where tank wooden crossings were often damaged by ‚Äúlifting‚Äù at high tide. He was 2nd in-command to Lt Col Sandeman and built roads, bridges and jetties for inland transport. During a voyage from Chittagong towards Akyab a tornado hit their small ship, with waves going over the ship, it developed a list of 15 degrees for about 20 minutes, but luckily the eye of the storm abated, and they sailed safely to the shore. After a year, 23 Engr Bn was shifted to Assam and came under 15 Corps, and made bridges roads and forward airfields, enabling the troops to advance to Rangoon. He was promoted to Lt.Col on 23 Aug 45 at Toungoo, on the way to Rangoon, where he rebuilt the bombed out Mingladon (Rangoon) airfield in 21 nights, whilst keeping it operational during daytime. On return from Burma in Nov 46 he did a special Commander Royal Engineers‚Äô (CRE's) course at Roorkee and was posted as Garrison Engineer Meerut in Jan 47 for four months training. After this he was appointed Asst Comdt of the Bengal Sappers and Miners (S&M;) Roorkee to prepare for Partition. On 12 August 47, he went to Rawalpindi and Sialkot with his Commandant Col Conner for reconnaissance, and celebrated Pakistan's Independence on 14 August 47 at Sialkot. On 16 Aug 47 he started his journey back to Roorkee (now in hostile India) by train from Rawalpindi, which was diverted from Lahore to Ludhiana via Ferozpur. All stations en-route were full of armed belligerent killers, but luckily the train was not attacked along the way. From Roorkee he went to New Delhi on 3 Sep 47, for the sharing of Engineer property. E-in-C India agreed that Pakistan's share of one-third of the total should only be from Roorkee, which included the mess silver. (Later India-Pakistan Joint Defence Council changed the rules, but by then we had taken most of our share). On 7 Sep 47 when he and his family went to Willingdon airport (Delhi) for flying to Lahore, timely information allowed them to leave the airport just before the biggest killing of Muslims at the airport. He returned to the airport an hour later, but another miracle saved him during a renewed killing attack. This process was repeated on subsequent days, but on 10 Sep 47 he and his family (wife and young son) were safely evacuated to Karachi from Palam airport (Delhi), and then to Rawalpindi by PAF aircraft. He moved to Sialkot and established the new Engineer Centre. Meanwhile, back at Roorkee, Maj J. A. Faruqi (later Major General) arranged to send Pakistan's share of equipment etc. to Sialkot. Later in Oct 47 an MT convoy headed by Capt Tufail Ahmed (later colonel) brought most of Pakistan's share from Roorkee to Sialkot. The Indians stopped the convoy and ordered it to be unloaded near Amritsar (as according to the new rule, MT was not to be moved across borders). After a vehement and heated argument with the Indians, the convoy was eventually allowed to go through to Lahore. Pakistan's Corps of Engineers was now fully established and the new motto was ‚ÄúRooheh-Rawan‚Äù. The Engineers Centre and School of Military Engineering (SME) were set up at former British barracks in the north of Sialkot. Both became fully functional in a very short time. The big task was to integrate the Bengal S&M; with the Bombay S&M; personnel, but the ‚ÄúPakistan feeling‚Äù was so strong and overwhelming, that unity was soon achieved. Their first task was in dealing with Indian excursions on the border. During this period Lt Col Anwar was the Asst. Commandant of the Engineer Centre and SME. After a year the Comdt Col Conner went on long leave and he acted as Comdt from 7 Jul 48 to 22 Nov 48 as a full Colonel. (Later as Dy E-in-C he moved both the Centre and School to Risalpur, to ensure training on bridging rivers etc.). On Connor's return, being the senior most Pakistani engineer officer he was posted to GHQ for training ---- Five months as AAG(org) in AG's branch (22 Nov 48 ‚Äì 6 May 49) and then GSO I (SD) for four months in GS branch, directly under Maj Gen Hutton. The property division with India was again argued, because of the new Joint Partition Council rules and E-in-C (Gen Sir Millis Jefferies), Col Connor and Col Anwar flew to New Delhi in Apr 49, but the final decision was to observe a ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù. For further training he was posted on 1st Sep 49 as CMES Rawalpindi - in those days covering: Pindi, Abbottabad, Murree, Jehlum, Sargodha, Mianwali and Attock. In early 1950 he was posted as Dy E-in-C in the rank of Col. The then E-in-C, Maj Gen Veitch, made him fully responsible for all future planning of officers and men. For training purposes he was sent in March 51 to School of Military Engineering (SME) Chatham (UK), Military College of Science, Loughborough College (UK), Survey training centre (UK), Transport training centre (UK) and BAOR (West Germany). He was promoted to Brigadier in 1951. In 1955 he went to Jordan, as head of a mission from Pakistan, at the marriage of King Hussein. Subsequently, he visited Damascus and Beirut. In 1956 he visited USA Corps of Engineers Centre at Fort Belvoir and the Waterways Research Centre at Vicksburg. During the period as Dy E-in-C he fixed the ratio of 75% Engr officers and 25% civilian officers in the Military Engineering Service (MES). Later his perseverance to get the degree at Military College of Engineering (MCE) Risalpur, proved successful at a conference of all the Vice Chancellors of the then universities in Pakistan. He strived very hard to establish a world class university of engineering and technology near Rawalpindi ---- A dream that has eventually been realised as the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST). He also made and arranged to implement the difficult decision, to remove or transfer to other arms, any engineer officer found unfit for the Corps of Engineers. All Azad Kashmir roads and bridges were planned by him and work executed by the Corps of Engineers. A road had been planned to be built along the Indus River through Chilas and Gilgit, but for many months no progress was made on the project because Pak PWD, NF PWD and AK PWD said that it was not possible to build it. Gen Veitch asked him (Brig Anwar) to consider if the project could be implemented by the Corps of Engineers. He accepted the challenge, and sent Maj Safdar and a captain as a reconnaissance party, and they walked through dangerous territory until they reached Chilas. From there they took a jeep to Gilgit and reported that it was indeed a difficult but a feasible project. The Secretary Communications Mr Khursheed said that he could only allow them to spend Rs 75 lakhs on the project. The Corps of Engrs started work on building the road. This was one of his most significant achievements, as he was personally involved in planning, designing and supervising the building of a ‚Äújeep road on a 3 tonner alignment‚Äù, along the Indus River through Chilas and Gilgit, within the meagre budget of only Rs 75 lakhs. This road was eventually widened and extended to China as the Karakoram Highway - a superb feat of engineering by any international standards. (This task was accomplished by FWO, a special force later raised for such projects by the Corps of Engineers). He also contributed towards the building of all military cantonments, especially at Wah, Kharian and Multan. Similarly he provided technical advice for Satellite Town Rawalpindi and the new capital city of Islamabad. He was promoted to Maj Gen in 1957 as E-in-C -- a post he held for 8 years. Under his command the Corps of Engineers became one of the finest bodies of professional combat engineers anywhere in the world. This was proved initially, when Pakistani Engineer officers who participated in military engineering courses in the US, were in the top 10 percent of the class. They were competing with officers from other countries as well as US army engineer officers. The fact was further vindicated when retired and serving officers of the Corps of Engineers excelled in whichever assignment they were given, and in any military or civilian organisations they subsequently joined. On 1 May 1965 he retired from the Army, and Maj Gen J.A. Faruqi took over.  Other distinctions  After retiring from the Pakistan Army, Maj General Anwar Khan was subsequently appointed Managing Director and Chairman of the Oil and Gas Corporation for four years, during which oil was struck at Tut near Taunsa, DG Khan, and gas near Karachi and in the then East Pakistan. Despite strong resistance from some quarters, he bought a large industrial plot in 1968 in I-9 Islamabad at a rate of Rs 10/- per sq yd, and a commercial plot in the Blue area for HQ office at an equally low rate. The value of this urban property is extremely high today. His strategy and mission at OGDC was to make Pakistani engineers, technologists and scientists learn and apply the skills and technologies required for attaining the highest level of competence and expertise, in all disciplines and specializations including the petroleum industry. This strategy continues to be driven by the current day OGDCL. He was one of the founders of the Institute of Engineers Pakistan (IEP), and later elected as its President three times. He used to get the maximum number of votes from East-Pakistanis, and was one of those West-Pakistanis who were very highly admired and respected by them. He was made a Life Fellow of IEP and later given the Lifetime Achievement Award for his many contributions to the engineering profession. For many years he was the President of the Rawalpindi Division Cricket Board and the Rawalpindi Division Hockey Board, and responsible for nurturing world class players and sportsmen. He captained the Pakistan Army Cricket Team (as a brigadier in the 1950s), and continued to bowl at an extremely fast pace, more accurately than most others who were many years younger to him, during the time when the test cricketer Imtiaz Ahmed was captain of the Pakistan Airforce Cricket Team.

W. Sawyer) (1911‚Äì2008) was a mathematician, mathematics educator and author, who taught on several continents. Life and career Walter Warwick Sawyer was born in St. Ives, Hunts, England on April 5, 1911. He attended Highgate School in London. He was an undergraduate at St. John's College, Cambridge, obtaining a BA in 1933 and specializing in quantum theory and relativity. He was an assistant lecturer in mathematics from 1933 to 1937 at University College, Dundee and from 1937 to 1944 at University of Manchester. From 1945 to 1947, he was the head of mathematics at Leicester College of Technology. In 1948 Sawyer became the first head of the mathematics department of what is now the University of Ghana. From 1951 to 1956, he was at Canterbury College (now the University of Canterbury in New Zealand). He left Canterbury College to become an associate professor at the University of Illinois, where he worked from winter 1957 through June 1958. While there, he criticized the New Math movement, which included the people who had hired him. From 1958 to 1965, he was a professor of mathematics at Wesleyan University, where he edited Mathematics Student Journal. In the fall of 1965 he became a professor at the University of Toronto, appointed to both the College of Education and the Department of Mathematics. He retired in 1976. Sawyer was the author of some 11 books. He is probably best known for his semi-popular works Mathematician's Delight and Prelude to Mathematics. Both of these have been translated into many languages. Mathematician's Delight was still in print 65 years after it was written. Some mathematicians have credited these books with helping to inspire their choice of a career. Sawyer died on February 15, 2008, at the age of 96.W. W.

Its estimated reserves are 520 million metric tons of oil and 95 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Production was launched in August, 2009. The field is operated by Russian national oil company Rosneft through its subsidiary Vankorneft.  History  The Vankor Field was discovered in 1988. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the development license for Vankor was issued to Eniseineft and the development license for Vankor North was issued to Taimyrneft, both controlled by the Anglo-Siberian Oil Company. Yukos managed to take control of part of Vankor through a complicated financial scheme, but did not manage to start production. In 2001, London-based Sibir Energy made a takeover bid to the Anglo-Siberian Oil Company to gain access to Vankor field. The bid was rejected. In 2002, TotalFinaElf wanted to buy 52% of the Vankor field development project, but the deal was not closed because of legal difficulties. In 2003, the Anglo-Siberian Oil Company was acquired by Rosneft as the result of a public bid on the London Stock Exchange, and the deal with Total was canceled. Currently, the field is being developed and operated by Rosneft's subsidiary CJSC Vankorneft. On 9 November 2014 the China National Petroleum Corporation purchased a 10-percent stake in ZAO Vankorneft. The field was officially launched on 21 August 2009. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin attended the launch. Putin said the oil produced at Vankor will be fed to pipelines under construction to China and the Baltic Sea.  Reserves  The Vankor field has oil reserves , of which are proved reserves, and 95 billion cubic meters of natural gas. The estimated production capacity is . Rosneft expected to produce 3 million metric tons () of oil at Vankor in 2009 and 11 million metric tons () in 2010. By August 2014 the production was 442,000 barrels per day.Vankor Production Facilities The front-end engineering and design of the oil field facilities was done by SNC-Lavalin. The project comprises 1,685 infrastructure facilities, including an oil treatment line, a 210-megawatt gas turbine power station, and tank farm with capacity of 140,000 cubic meters of crude oil.  Transmission  Oil from the field is transported through the Rosneft-owned Vankor‚ÄìPurpe pipeline to the Transneft-owned trunk pipeline's tie-in point in the village of Purpe in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District, where it will be fed to Transneft's transmission network. The Vankor‚ÄìPurpe pipeline is long and it has a capacity . It was built by Purneftegaz, a subsidiary of Rosneft. From there, it is planned that most of the oil will be fed to the Eastern Siberia‚ÄìPacific Ocean oil pipeline as also supply Rosneft's westward export, including through the BPS-2 pipeline. Natural gas would be transported to the nearby-located Lukoil's infrastructure and further to the Gazprom transportation system.  Effects on the economy  Vankor is one of Rosneft's most important projects, and one of the largest industrial projects in Russia. The field is important for the development of the oil and gas industry and Russia's economy at large. According to Rosneft, more than 80% of equipment bought for the project was made in Russia. The Vankor project employs more than 450 contractors and sub- contractors and 12,000 construction workers and 2,000 vehicles were employed at the peak of construction work. Overall tax payments during the project lifetime will amount to 4.5 trillion roubles at an oil price of US$60 per barrel.

Pamplin Music reported turning a profit in 1999 as well as being in the top five Christian music record labels. Despite this, Pamplin closed at the end of 2001, shuttering both its production and distribution operations. Pamplin focused on the pop, soft rock, and R&B; market segments. For other segments, they used sublabels. Red Hill Records, established in 2000 with A&R; handled by Dan Michaels (according to Billboard), focused on electronic and pop music, and was generally aimed at the youth market. Organic Records was their label for alternative and modern rock artists. Cathedral Records and Crossroads served the gospel market segments. Cathedral did not close with the other sublabels, and established distribution through New Day Distribution. Distribution While previous releases from parent company Pamplin Entertainment such as the Bibleman series had used existing distribution channels, with the establishment of Pamplin Music, the company began distributing its own material.

Its tagline is: \\"Jon Aldrich is about to come face to face with the most terrifying force known to man...his parents.\\" It earned a Razzie Award nomination for Selleck as Worst Actor. Plot The film tells the story of Jon Aldrich, a successful stockbroker who is living a good life with a wife and kids until he comes across his elderly father who suffers from dementia, and has accidentally burned down his own house. Jon tries to get his sister, Arlene (who has two sons of her own but is an irresponsible gold digger), to take care of their parents, but she won't even open the door. As a result, his father, Harry, and his mother, Mildred, have to move in with him and his family. That is the moment that his good life starts going downhill. The company Jon works for was apparently doing illegal things which he knew nothing of, but no one believes him therefore he loses his job. The problems for him continue to mount up as Harry continues to cause all kinds of trouble and, as a result of it, the family becomes broke. His wife, Audrey, moves out with the kids, and they lose everything except their apartment. Furthermore, as a result of his severe senility, Harry continues to unintentionally injure Jon, causing him to get hearing loss, a broken hand, and a broken foot when a car runs over it. He also loses a testicle. Plus, Harry puts the lives of Jon's kids and himself in danger at one point by jaywalking in an intersection one morning while trying to take them for a walk with him without letting anyone know. As a result of the whole mess, Jon slowly starts to lose his own sanity, but in a brief moment of regaining his own Harry tells him that he never wanted to be a burden on him but he soon slips back into his state of dementia, where he is just happy all the time and often yells out \\"McDonald's\\". Jon talks with Mildred who also says that she and Harry never wanted to be a burden on him. She then tells him that they have discussed it, and they want him to help them die so he can collect the insurance money. He is totally against this at first but after a while he changes his tune. Somehow ending up agreeing to volunteer to it, Jon helps his parents try to commit suicide many unsuccessful times and halfway through the attempts Arlene shows up on his doorstep with both of her corpulent sons in need of a place to live. He refuses at first because she would not even open the door for them but he eventually caves in and lets them stay. She also joins in on the attempts to help their parents die, hoping for a cut of the insurance money. Her attempts are also unsuccessful. Things slowly start looking up for Jon as Audrey eventually shows up to tell him that she was wrong for leaving and how much she loves the fact that he was willing to take in both of his parents. Upon her arrival she realizes all the injuries he has suffered since she saw him last, including the missing testicle. As they are reconciling he realizes that Arlene and his parents are gone and he knows they are going to try to commit suicide again with her help, so he tracks them down in an attempt to stop them which he successfully does, but not without facing a bit more injury. Jon eventually gets their lives on track. He and Audrey buy a house and his parents move in with them. Arlene is now with a man who knows how to handle her bad behaving children. At the end we finally find out that Harry hasn't been yelling \\"McDonald's\\" because he was hungry, but because he bought stock in McDonnell Douglas years and years ago, meaning he is worth tons of money. Cast Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with 20 reviews, the film has a rare approval rating of 0%meaning no favorable reviews whatsoeverreceiving an average rating of 2.5/10. Noted the Los Angeles Times, \\"If gays and lesbians think they're getting a bad rap in the movies, consider the filmic lot of the elderly. First \\"Stop! or My Mom Will Shoot,\\" now \\"Folks!\\". Where are the Gray Panthers when you need them?\\" The New York Times noted that its screenwriter \\"is best known as the screenwriter of \\"Where's Poppa?\\" and he may be aspiring to comparably dark humor. But \\"Folks\\" tries to be tender and vicious simultaneously, and that makes for an impossible mix. A more mean-spiritedly funny actor might have carried this material better, but Mr. Selleck strives for the cuddly rather than the caustic. Mr. Ameche, mugging furiously, affects a jaw-jutting blank look and even props his chin on Mr. Selleck's shoulder occasionally for quasi-comic effect.\\" The film was not a box office success. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"C+\\" on scale of A+ to F.

The tube was used for underwater repair and for ship salvage. In 1912 Williamson, while working as a reporter, used the device to make underwater photographs in Norfolk Harbor. He then expanded the photosphere, which he named Jules Verne, and used it to create motion pictures, starting first in the Bahamas. Williamson created a film company, the Submarine Film Corporation. Their first feature film came out in 1914 and was entitled \\"Thirty Leagues Under the Sea\\" starring Williamson in a fight with a shark. The Submarine Film Corporation would also partner with other companies such as Thanhouser Company. J. Ernest Williamson and his brother George M. Williamson would shoot and develop the film using their photosphere which was then finalized and distributed by others.

Franchising of the brand commenced in 2004, with individual outlets closely resembling the original design. The first franchised outlet was established in Mosman Park by Warren Reynolds, who was instrumental in the expansion of the franchise to additional Perth locations. Sporting a distinctive design, reminiscent of an oversized coffee cup, the stores have the standard corporate livery of white, green, and purple.

The man then used his finger to scoop the juice off the boy and lick it. He then paused, and said 'delicious sticky boy'.\\" The ad was criticized as ‚Äúviolent, messy, and disgusting‚Äù.

Football career Soye was born in the Govan area of Glasgow and trained as an electrical engineer. After playing Junior Football for Rutherglen Glencairn, Soye moved to Belfast where he had a trial with Belfast Celtic before joining Distillery at the end of the 1903‚Äì04 season. In his one season at Distillery, his 14 goals helped the Whites win three trophies, the Irish Cup, the City Cup and the County Antrim Shield when he scored in the Final. In the summer of 1905, he moved to southern England to join Southampton of the Southern League. The \\"Saints\\" were anxious to regain the Southern League title which they had taken six times in the eight years up to 1904, but had finished in a disappointing third place at the end of the 1904‚Äì05 season. He made his debut away to Norwich City on 9 September 1905 when he played at inside-right in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Although Soye was only 5 ft 8 in tall, he was \\"muscular and clever enough to avoid the more robust challenges\\". He soon became an established member of the side, helping the forwards Fred Harrison and Harry Brown to score, as well as contributing the occasional goal himself, including both goals in a 2‚Äì1 victory against Queens Park Rangers on 4 November. As the season progressed, his form trailed off and by the end of January, he had lost his place to Frank Jefferis. At the end of the season, Southampton finished as runners-up, five points behind champions Fulham. In May 1906, he moved to Newcastle United of the Football League First Division, together with his Southampton teammate, Harry Brown. At St James' Park, Soye was unable to break into the first-team on a regular basis, with Scotland international James Howie well settled in the inside-right berth. Although Newcastle won the Football League championship in the 1905‚Äì06 season, Soye made only one appearance followed by six appearances, with two goals, in the following season. He spent the entire 1907‚Äì08 season in the reserves and, after only seven first-team appearances in three years, he returned to Scotland. In May 1909, he was part of the deal which brought Wilf Low to St James' Park for a fee of ¬£800 from Aberdeen. At Pittodrie, Soye made his debut scoring in a 3‚Äì0 defeat of Port Glasgow Athletic and soon became an established member of the team, settling into the right-wing position. Over the next six seasons, Soye made over 200 league and cup appearances for the \\"Dons\\" and was also \\"capped\\" by the Scottish Football League against the Southern League on 2 October 1911. The outbreak of the First World War brought his career to a close.

The story concerns a young mother who has lost her husband and son in a car crash and the guilt and self-reproach she has to go through as a consequence of her loss. Plot summary Julia Piper lives alone in her London apartment after having lost her son and husband in a car crash. Julia's relationship with her mother is not a loving one. Her mother blames Julia for the accident, and Julia blames herself. Unwilling and unable to confide in anyone about her feelings Julia keeps to herself and distances herself from her surroundings. Julia makes a living as a cleaning lady and one of her clients is Sylvester Wykes, publisher and divorcee. When they eventually meet, Sylvester immediately is fascinated by the young and unapproachable woman. But, haunted by guilt and self-reproach, Julia is not interested in entering into a relationship with Sylvester. Instead, unable to talk to anyone about her loss, Julia keeps her feelings to herself and becomes increasingly reserved and isolated. In addition to her grief, Julia is being stalked. Ever since the funeral she has been terrorized by a stranger who keeps following her and makes phone calls late at night, pushing her closer to the edge. Characters * Julia Piper: Widow. Mother of Christy and used to be married to Giles. She is the daughter of Clodagh May. * Mrs Clodagh May: Julia Piper's mother and Christy's grandmother. * Madge Brownlow: Clodagh May's neighbour, friend and gossip. * Giles: Deceased.

Julia Piper's and Giles's son. Major Themes In the wake of her son's death Julia Piper is being tortured by irrational guilt. Her husband was a hopeless driver who had been banned from driving, and Julia blames herself for not having been there to drive them. She also feels guilty about associating her beloved son with her husband, Giles, (whom she hated): \\"...he had Giles's hair, Giles's eyes, Giles's mouth, Giles's expression, his gestures! He was Giles in miniature. The likeness has grown in my mind until it is monstrous and I cannot see my little boy any more\\".Mary Wesley, An Imaginative Experience, Vintage, UK, 2007, 9780099499091, p. 235. As always in Wesley's fictional universe the mother-daughter relationship is a bitter one. Clodagh (Julia Piper's mother) openly admits that Julia is \\"the regretable result\\" of her short marriage to Julia's father, and: \\"I do not regard her as my daughter\\".Mary Wesley, An Imaginative Experience, p. 60. It's no wonder that Julia left home when she was sixteen. When Julia has been raped, and finds out that she is pregnant, her mother insists that Julia marries Giles (her rapist), to save her from the social disgrace an illegitimate child would be.

The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 35937. History De Polslpootpoldermolen was marked on a map of Utingeradeel dated 1849. The mill was then known as the Spookmolen. In 1947 it was decided to replace the mill with an electrically powered pump. Permission was sought to demolish the mill but this was denied, as it was again in 1952. The mill was repaired in 1961 and 1971. On 13 November 1972 the mill was blown down in a storm. It was restored in 1976 at a cost of f80,000. At this time it was owned by the Gemeente Boarnsterhim and stood at Ulbe Twijnstrawel 21, 8491 CD, Akkrum. The mill's condition again deteriorated under the ownership of the Gemeente Boarnsterhim. Concern was expressed about its condition by the Monumentenzorg and De Hollandsche Molen. Stichting Molens de Leeg Midden was formed and took over the mill. Plans were made to rebuild it at a new location. The mill was dismantled in 2003 and rebuilt at its new site. This was completed in June 2004 and the mill was renamed the Mellemolen. (Click on Geschiedenis\\" to view.) The work was carried out by Fabrikaat Hiemstra of Tzummarum. Description Mellemolen is what the Dutch call a Spinnekopmolen (English: Spider mill). It is a small hollow post mill with an octagonal roundhouse. The four Common sails, which have a span of are carried on a wooden windshaft which is about long. (Click on Technische gegevens\\" to view.) The mill had a cast iron windshaft before the 2004 rebuild. The millwright replaced it because he did not like the use of a cast iron windshaft in a Spinnekop. The brake wheel has 35 cogs, It drives the wallower (17 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft, which is contained within the post of the trestle. At the lower end of the upright shaft, the crown wheel (30 cogs) drives the Archimedes' screw via a gearwheel with 33 cogs. The Archimedes' screw is made of wood.

Based at Oak Harbor, Washington and operated regional passenger flights in the Puget Sound area. History The airline was founded a Oak Harbor Airlines by Jerry Petterson and Wes Lupien (the owner of Oak Harbor Airport) in March 1971. In May 1974, it shortened its name to simply Harbor Airlines. In the early 1980s, the airline served the Puget Sound area of Washington state. In the mid-1970s, the airline's fleet comprised five BN-2A Islander craft. By the early 1980s, an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante had been added to the fleet. By 2001, these had been replaced with five Cessna Grand Caravan. In 1996, the company was bought by Richard Boehlke and subsequently moved its headquarters from Oak Harbor to Gig Harbor. Over the following years, Harbor Airlines encountered a series of financial problems, which culminated in being evicted from Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport (the most important destination in its route network) in March 2001 due to unpaid bills worth . The airline reacted by relocating its flights to nearby Boeing Field. In a 1999 ranking of regional and commuter airlines by total passenger enplanements, Harbor Airlines ranked 40th out of 50. In early May 2001, Harbor Airlines suspended all flight activities and its then 100 employees were dismissed. The company's bankruptcy also affected Oak Harbor Airport, of which Harbor Airlines was still the owner. Route network Upon closure, Harbor Airlines offered scheduled flights from Seattle to Oak Harbor, Orcas Island, Port Angeles and San Juan Island, and maintained codeshare agreements with Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. In the mid 1970s, destinations included Seattle, Oak Harbor, Bellingham, and Hoquiam in Washington State; and Astoria and Portland in Oregon. Hoquiam began as a destination in July 1974 when Harbor took over a route from Hughes Airwest, but was discontinued in January 1975 due to lack of business. In 1979 and 1981, destinations which could be reached directly from Seattle were Bellingham, Oak Harbor and Mount Vernon. An international route to Canada, linking Seattle (via Bellingham) with Vancouver, was inaugurated on June 12, 1981. Accidents and incidents Harbor Airlines suffered one fatal accident, which occurred on December 26, 1974 in snowy weather conditions. Flight 308, a Britten-Norman Islander (registered N66HA) en route from Seattle to Oak Harbor crashed in Riverton, Washington four minutes after take-off, killing four of the six occupants (the pilot and three passengers) on board. A fourth passenger died of their injuries several days after the crash while in hospital. This was an urban crash, landing in the middle of a street and striking power lines on its way down. During the subsequent investigation, an unknown substance was found inside the pitot tubes of the aircraft, which had caused unreliable airspeed readings.

The Gaudo Culture is an Eneolithic culture from Southern Italy, primarily in the region of Campania, active at the end of the 4th millennium BC, whose typesite necropolis is located near Paestum, not far from the mouth of the river Sele.Bailo ModestiI G., Salerno A. (Eds), 1998, Pontecagnano II, 5. La necropoli eneolitica, L'et√† del Rame in Campania nei villaggi dei morti, Annali dell'Istituto Orientale di Napoli, sezione di Archeologia e Storia Antica, quad. n. 11, Napoli Its name comes from the Spina-Gaudo necropolis. Objects of this culture are known and have been recovered since Antiquity. During the 5th century BC and/or the 4th century BC, for example, Greek settlers deposited daggers made of flint probably from graves in an ancient sanctuary at the site of Paestum.Aurigemma S., Spinazzola V., Maiuri A., 1986, I primi scavi di Paestum (1907-1939), Ente per le antichit√† e i monumenti della provincia di Salerno, Salerno In the 18th century, objects were also recovered by scholars. For example, a flint dagger and a vase were brought from Italy to England by William Hamilton and are now in the British Museum.Barfield L. H., 1985, Sir William Hamilton‚Äôs Chalcolithic Collection, in Swaddling J., Papers of the Sixth British Museum Classical symposium 1983, p. 229-233  The Necropolis  Grave Though there are some earlier paleolithic findings at the Gaudo site, about one kilometer from more famous Greco-Roman ruins at Paestum, the Gaudo culture is associated primarily with the better established neolithic necropolis. This necropolis occupies about 2000 m¬≤ and contains 34 separate tombs. It was discovered late in the year 1943, during the Allied campaign in Italy, when the construction of the Gaudo Airfield unearthed some of the tombs. A British officer and archeologist, Lieutenant John G. S. Brinson, proceeded to conduct a scientific excavation of the tombs and recorded his findings in a notebook now held in the National Archeological Museum of Naples. Each tomb is roughly hewn out of rock in an \\"oven-shaped\\" design, with either one or two burial chambers of a somewhat oval shape, with a low, curved ceiling, each containing multiple human skeletons in the fetal position, either on their sides or on their backs. The tombs were accessed by a more or less circular shaft from above, at the bottom of which was a kind of vestibule or antechamber. There is evidence that the Gaudo funeral rites would have been carried out by a team of people, and after the conclusion of the rites, the tomb would have to be sealed off by a large stone. The Gaudo people would apparently use tombs repeatedly, perhaps for different generations of people. It has been seen that the body of the most recently deceased would always be placed at the back of his burial chamber, with the previous tenants of that chamber placed beside him. The corpses would be accompanied by fine ceremonial ceramic pots in various forms, such as the \\"askoi\\", the curious double \\"salt cellar\\", as well as weapons: arrowheads, spearheads, and knives of flint or copper. These accessories were probably symbols of rank. Study of the arrangement of bones and accompanying artifacts has led researchers to believe that the Gaudo society was structured into different family groups or warrior clans of some kind. It is curious that in the access shafts and antechamber of the Gaudo tombs, pottery was also found, but this was of a much coarser grade, a simpler form, larger dimensions, and was sparsely decorated. Unfortunately, since the Gaudo people are known almost exclusively through their tombs, little is known about the many other facets of their culture, which may have been equally fascinating. Some other Gaudo sites are known throughout Campania however, such as what is thought to be a Gaudo dwelling in Taurasi, and the necropoles at Eboli and Buccino. A large collection of Gaudo artifacts is on display at the National Archeological Museum of Paestum.

The song details a day's work for a sheep shearer in the days before machine shears. Song The enduring popularity of this song reflects the traditional role that the wool industry has played in Australian life. The song describes the various roles in the shearing shed, including the \\"ringer\\", the \\"boss of the board\\", the \\"colonial experience man\\" and the \\"tar boy\\". After the day's shearing, the \\"old shearer\\" takes his cheque and heads to the local pub for a drinking session. The tune is the American Civil War song \\"Ring the Bell, Watchman\\" by Henry Clay Work and the first verse follows closely, in parody, Work's lyrics as well. It was actually originally named 'The Bare Bellied Ewe' and only became popular in the 1950s, more than half a century later. A set of blade shears The second verse in the original 19th- century song is as follows: :Click goes his shears; click, click, click. :Wide are the blows, and his hand is moving quick, :The ringer looks round, for he lost it by a blow, :And he curses that old shearer with the bare belled ewe. The usual chorus of the song is as follows: :Click go the shears boys, click, click, click, :Wide is his blow and his hands move quick, :The ringer looks around and is beaten by a blow, :And curses the old snagger with the bare- bellied yoe In June 2013 folklorist Mark Gregory discovered that a version of the song was first published in 1891 in the regional Victorian newspaper the Bacchus Marsh Express under the title \\"The Bare Belled Ewe\\" and the tune given as \\"Ring the Bell Watchman.\\" That version was signed \\"C. C. Eynesbury, Nov. 20, 1891,\\"The Bacchus Marsh Express 5 December 1891, Page 7. Accessed 2 March, 2014.

There was a shearers' strike in 1891 so the publication of the song in that year would have resonated with the Australian community.ABC Television, Click Go The Shears dates from time of shearers strike in 1890s. Accessed 2 March 2014. The song was next published in 1939 in two Australian newspapers and then in 1946 as a traditional song \\"collected and arranged\\" by Reverend Dr. Percy Jones, a professor of music. The lyrics vary widely; \\"bare-bellied yoe\\" (yoe is a dialect word for ewe) is often \\"bare-bellied joe\\" or even \\"blue-bellied ewe\\". The last line in the verse about the \\"colonial experience\\" man \\"smelling like a whore\\" is often bowdlerised to \\"smelling like a sewer\\" or completely rewritten. The song has been recorded by many artists, notably by the American folk musician Burl Ives in 1958 on his album Australian Folk Songs. Another version was recorded by the British folklorist A. L. Lloyd. In January 2014 Chloe and Jason Roweth sang the 1891 version of the song for an ABC Television story.

Career  In 1967 Trevor Spencer was a founding member of psychedelic pop- progressive rock group James Taylor Move. In 1969 he moved to Ham in England and after forming his first band, Quartet, he became a studio drummer for acts such as Cliff Richard, Marvin and Farrar and Olivia Newton-John. Quartet recorded one album with Decca records which remains unreleased but two singles were released on Decca: \\"Joseph\\"/\\"Mama where did you fail\\" (1970) F13072 and \\"Now\\"/\\"will my lady come\\" (1970) F12974. During the 1970s, he was a house songwriter for ATV Music London. In 1976 he was one half of Tarney-Spencer Band along with Alan Tarney (ex-James Taylor Move). They signed a ten-album deal with A & M Records, but met with little success and after three album releases, the group disbanded and discontinued their contract with agreement by the record company. In 1973 he was part of Cliff Richard's Eurovision song contest entry in 1973 along with John Farrar, Alan Tarney and Terry Britten with six songs in which \\"Power to all our friends\\" was chosen and came second.

He served as Bishop of Portland from 1906 until his death in 1924. Biography Louis Walsh was born in Salem, Massachusetts, to Patrick and Honora (n√©e Foley) Walsh. He attended Holy Cross College in Worcester for one year before entering the Grand Seminary of Montreal in Quebec, Canada. After attending the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, France, he furthered his studies in canon law and theology at Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta on December 23, 1882. Following his return to Massachusetts, Walsh served as assistant pastor at St. Joseph's Church in Boston's West End. In 1884 he became professor of church history, canon law, and liturgy at St. John's Seminary in Brighton. He was named the first supervisor of Catholic schools for the Archdiocese of Boston in 1887. He was also one of the founders of the New England Catholic Historical Society and the Catholic Educational Association. On August 3, 1906, Walsh was appointed the fourth Bishop of Portland, Maine, by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 18 from Archbishop John Joseph Williams, with Bishops Matthew Harkins and Thomas Daniel Beaven serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. During his tenure, he established several new parishes and schools, and renovated the cathedral. His tenure was also marked by a wave of immigrants from Poland, Italy, Slovakia, and Lithuania. He met vocal opposition from groups of French Americans over the ownership of parish property, leading Walsh to place six of their leaders under interdict. He supported the National Catholic Welfare Conference and founded the Maine Catholic Historical Magazine. Walsh's last years saw the rise of the Ku Klux Klan as a political force in Maine, and particularly in Portland. The Diocese's successful and expanding parochial school system became a Klan rallying point. Walsh personally led the fight against the Barwise Bill, a Klan-supported measure that would have prevented the Catholic Church from receiving state funds for any purpose. The measure, and two similar bills by State Senator (later Governor and U.S. Senator) Owen Brewster and Senator Benedict Maher, were defeated, the last in a statewide referendum.'\\"Bishop Walsh Warns of Danger from Enkindling Religious Hatred Fires\\", Lewiston Daily Sun, Feb. 8, 1923, p. 1 Walsh's successor as Bishop of Portland kept a much lower profile on Klan-related issues, however, allowing anti-Klan politicians to defend the church and Maine's Catholic population. After returning from a canonical visit to Rome and France in February 1924, Walsh was left exhausted and died two months later, aged 66.

There are many reasons for the confusion: some of the sonatas were originally written for other instruments, some have uncertain authenticity, some contain borrowings from other Handel works, and some were published (in an altered form) without Handel's knowledge. At least six of the sonatas are known to contain music written by Handel, although he may not have intended some of them to have been played by the flute. The main source of the sonatas is the c. 1730 publication Sonates pour un traversiere un violin ou hautbois con basso continuo compos√©es par G. F. Handel, allegedly by the Amsterdam publisher Jeanne Roger (who had died in December 1722), however the publication was made by the printer John Walsh. In 1732 Walsh published a revised version under his own name. Three sonatas attributed to Handel were published by Walsh in 1730 as part of a collection titled Six Solos, Four for a German Flute and a Bass and two for a Violin with a Thorough Bass. It was supposed that they were early works composed by Handel before 1703 in Halle but their authenticity is now considered doubtful. The supposition of the date has been proven unfounded, at least for the second sonata, three movements of which are arrangements of music known to have been composed by Handel after 1712. Of the eleven flute sonatas formerly attributed to Handel, only one (the flute sonata in E minor (HWV 379)) appears to have been intended for the flute as it exists in that form in Handel's autograph, and even that one is a hasty arrangement of movements from other works. The flute sonata in D major (HWV 378), which was attributed in a manuscript to Johann Sigismund Weiss (brother of the lutenist Sylvius Leopold Weiss), has been proffered as a work by Handel, however no autograph version by Handel is known to exist.

Poor, Manual of the Railroads of the United States, 1880, pp. 754-755 In 1875, the CP&SW; bought an unfinished grade between Streator and the Mazon River at Gorman from the Chicago and Illinois River Railroad (C&IR;), which it opened for operation on May 21, 1876, along with trackage rights into Joliet on the C&IR.; The CP&SW; was also known as the \\"Hinckley road\\" after president Francis E. Hinckley.Glenn Danford Bradley, The Story of the Santa Fe, 1920, pp. 259-262 The CP&SW; was sold at foreclosure on May 31, 1881 to Hinckley and reorganized on May 15, 1882 as the Chicago, St. Louis and Western Railroad. Another reorganization in March 1885 produced the Chicago and St. Louis Railway, which on December 21, 1885 opened an extension beyond the Mazon River, paralleling the old C&IR; to Joliet and continuing on to Corwith in Chicago,Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1887, pp. 407-408 from where it had trackage rights over the Chicago and Southern Railroad. Finally, in December 1886, new Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway subsidiary Chicago, Santa Fe and California Railway, bought the line as part of a project to extend the Santa Fe from Kansas City to Chicago, which, including the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad in Chicago from Corwith to near downtown Chicago, was completed on July 1, 1888. The new main line left the old Chicago and St. Louis at Ancona, making the Ancona-Pekin segment a branch line, the Santa Fe's only one in Illinois outside Chicago. The Santa Fe and Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) jointly acquired control of the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad (TP&W;), successor to the Toledo, Peoria and Warsaw Railway, in 1960,Moody's Transportation Manual, 1976, p. 111 and in January 1981 the Santa Fe bought the PRR's 50% share from successor Penn Central Corporation, merging it on December 3, 1983.Moody's Transportation Manual, 1992, p. 403 The TP&W; branched off the Santa Fe's Chicago line at Lomax, Illinois and headed east through Peoria (just north of Pekin) to Logansport, Indiana, and so this acquisition allowed the Santa Fe to abandon most of its Pekin Branch. However, the Santa Fe soon had second thoughts about the TP&W; merger, and in February 1989 a new independent Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway acquired the old TP&W;, as well a short remnant of the Pekin Branch between Crandall and Morton.Edward A.

History  In 1994, a Minnesota legislative mandate increased the demand for wind power in Minnesota. Buffalo Ridge's geography is well suited for wind power and it has been heavily developed for this purpose. The history of modern wind power activity on Buffalo Ridge can be split into four phases of construction. In 1994, the first wind farm cluster was built on Buffalo Ridge, northwest of the town of Lake Benton. This first cluster was built by the Kenetech Corporation and runs northwest to Lake Shaokatan; it consists of seventy-three wind turbines. The second phase occurred in 1998 when Zond Energy Systems built the next wind farm cluster near Hendricks, Minnesota. This farm consists of 143 Zond Z-750 wind turbines with each turbine standing high and weighing about . Each 750 kW turbine can deliver the annual electricity needs of approximately 250 homes. The third phase occurred in mid-1999 and added an additional one hundred megawatts of power to the existing output. In 2006, PPM Energy and Xcel Energy began construction of a one hundred and fifty megawatt project called the MinnDakota Wind Power Project.PPM Energy, \\"PPM breaks ground on MinnDakota wind farm for Xcel Engergy\\" This project adds sixty-seven more wind turbines to the Buffalo Ridge wind farm. It also adds turbines to the portion of Buffalo Ridge that is in Brookings County, South Dakota. The land where the wind farm resides is privately owned farm land. To acquire a piece of this land for the use of wind turbines, the wind developer rents or leases the plot of land from the farmer who owns the land. Small projects, less than two megawatts in size, are offered subsidies of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for power sold to utilities.  Birds, bats, and wind turbines  Concerns involved with wind turbines revolve around the affected bird and bat populations that surround the Buffalo Ridge area. A study featured in The American Midland Naturalist found that eighty-four to eighty-five percent of the seventy species of birds that live in the Buffalo Ridge area fly outside the range of the wind turbine blades. During a study conducted in 1996, by Western EcoSystems Technology, it was concluded that an estimated average of 1.4 birds were killed per wind turbine during the seven-month study. Another eight-month study was done in 1997 and found that 1.1 birds were killed per turbine. Also, available evidence from the \\"Interim Report: Bat Interactions with Wind Turbines at the Buffalo Ridge, Minnesota Wind Resource Area: 2001 Field Season,\\" shows that most bat mortalities caused by wind turbines occur during the fall to migrant and dispersing bats and not to resident breeding populations. It was concluded by this same study that 2.45 to 3.21 bats die per turbine which is lower than the number of bat deaths by lighthouses, communication towers, tall buildings, power lines, and fences.Mike Sagrillo,\\"Interim Report: Bat Interactions with Wind Turbines at the Buffalo Ridge, Minnesota Wind Resource Area: 2001 Field Season\\", In 1996, Western EcoSystems Technolygy was contracted by Northern States Power to create an avian monitoring program for Buffalo Ridge. Its primary goals for Buffalo Ridge were to evaluate the risks to avian species by monitoring the wind power development and its effect on the avian species while at the same time using that information to reduce avian mortalities on Buffalo Ridge. According to the studies, bird populations are in more danger from humans than from wind turbines.

After attending Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, he was ordained to the priesthood on July 4, 1903. He then taught Greek and French at St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield. On May 13, 1932, McCarthy was appointed Bishop of Portland, Maine, by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 24 from Bishop Maurice F. McAuliffe, with Bishops John Joseph Nilan and John Bertram Peterson serving as co-consecrators. His consecration was the first to be broadcast by radio in the United States. During the Great Depression, McCarthy used his power as a corporation sole to remove the burden of debt by offering the property holdings as security for a successful bond issue. By 1936 he had stabilized the financial situation of the diocese. In 1938, he purchased the former home of Morris McDonald as his official residence. He opened numerous elementary schools, high schools, and colleges during his tenure. He received Daniel Joseph Feeney as an auxiliary bishop in 1946, delegating much of the administration of the diocese to Feeny due to his own declining health.

It was developed in the 1980s by Kermit Ritland, as an alternative to the simplistic mixed mating model. The mixed mating model assumes that every fertilisation event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or outcrossing with a completely random mate. That is, it assumes that inbreeding is caused solely by self-fertilisation. This assumption is often violated in wild plant populations, where inbreeding may be due to outcrossing between closely related plants. For example, in dense stands, mating often occurs between plants in close proximity; and in plants with short seed dispersal distances, plants are often closely related to their nearest neighbours. When both these criteria are met, plants will tend to be closely related to the near neighbours with which they mate, resulting in significant inbreeding. In such a scenario, the mixed mating model will attribute all inbreeding to self- fertilisation, and therefore overestimate the extent of self-fertilisation occurring. The effective selfing model takes into account the potential for inbreeding to occur as a result of outcrossing between closely related plants, by considering the extent of kinship between mates. Ultimately, it is not possible to tease apart the two potential causes of inbreeding, and attributed the observed inbreeding to one cause or the other. Therefore, just as with the mixed mating model, in the effective selfing model there is only one parameter to be estimated. However this parameter, termed the effective selfing rate, is often a more accurate measure of the proportion of self-fertilisation than the corresponding parameter in the mixed mating model.

It depicts sheep shearers plying their trade in a timber shearing shed. Distinctly Australian in character, the painting is a celebration of pastoral life and work, especially \\"strong, masculine labour\\", and recognises the role that the wool industry played in the development of the country. One of the best-known and most-loved paintings in Australia, Shearing the Rams has been described as a \\"masterpiece of Australian impressionism\\" and \\"the great icon of Australian popular art history\\". It forms part of the National Gallery of Victoria's Australian art collection, held at the Ian Potter Centre in Federation Square, Melbourne. Composition One of at least seventy sketches Robert made in preparation for Shearing the Rams Roberts modelled his painting on a shearing shed at what is now called Killeneen, an outstation of the Brocklesby sheep station, near Corowa in the Riverina region of New South Wales. The property was owned by the Anderson family, distant relations to Roberts, who first visited the station in 1886 to attend a family wedding. Having decided on shearing as the subject for a painting, Roberts arrived at Brocklesby in the spring of 1888, making around 70 or 80 preliminary sketches of \\"the light, the atmosphere, the sheep, the men and the work\\" before returning to the station the following shearing season with his canvas.\\"National themes\\", Australian Impressionism. National Gallery of Victoria. Retrieved 29 March 2016. Roberts' work was noted by the local press with reports of him \\"dressed in blue shirt and moleskins ... giving the last finishing touches to a picture in oils about 5ft by 4ft.\\" Art historians had previously thought Roberts completed most of the painting in his Melbourne studio, using the sketches drawn in his time at Brocklesby. In 2003 however, art critic and historian Paul Johnson wrote: \\"Tom Roberts spent two years, on the spot, painting Shearing the Rams\\".Johnson, Paul (2003). Art. A New History, p. 579. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. New evidence was brought to light in 2006 that suggested that Roberts painted much of the work en plein air at the shearing shed itself. In 2006, The National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) conducted a scientific examination of paint left on a piece of timber salvaged from the now-destroyed shed, where it was thought that Roberts cleaned his brushes. The study confirmed that the paint, in a number of different shades, precisely matched the paint used in the painting. The senior curator of art at the NGV, Terence Lane, believes this is strong evidence that much of the work was done on location: \\"For me, that's evidence of a lot of time spent in that woolshed ... all those paint marks and the selection of colours indicates he spent so much time en plein air\\". The \\"smiling tarboy\\" at the center of the painting was modelled on local girl Susan Bourne, then 9 years old. In a seeming anachronism, the painting shows sheep being shorn with blade shears rather than the machine shears which started to enter Australian shearing sheds in the late 1880s. Art historian Terry Smith's suggestion that Roberts presented a deliberately historical vision of shearing has been questioned on account of there being no evidence that electric shears had been introduced to Brocklesby at the time of the painting's composition.Hoorn, Jeanette (2007). Australian Pastoral: The Making of a White Landscape. Fremantle Press. , p. 172 The young man carrying the fleece on the left of the painting alludes to the figure of Esau in Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise at the Florence Baptistery. The model for the smiling tar-boy at the centre of the picture, the only figure to make eye contact with the viewer, was actually a girl, 9-year-old Susan Bourne, who lived until 1979. She also assisted Roberts by kicking up dust in the shed to allow him to capture some of the atmosphere. The white and pink striped shirt of the central shearer carries the highest tonal point of the composition, and is identical to that of Will Maloney's in an 1887 portrait by John Russell, a close friend of Roberts who spent much of his career in France. The trio travelled Europe together in the mid-1880s, and when Maloney returned to Melbourne in 1888, Russell instructed him to show the portrait to Roberts. It has therefore been speculated that the shearer's shirt is Roberts' tribute to his friends.Gallaby, Ann; Sloggett, Robyn. \\"John Peter Russell‚Äôs Dr Will Maloney\\", Art Journal of the National Gallery of Victoria, no. 37, 2014. An x-ray study of the painting in 2007, taken while the painting was being cleaned, unveiled Roberts' original sketch of the central shearer. In that original sketch, the shearer was lacking a beard and was more upright; the change to a stooping figure makes the shearer appear more in control of the sheep, improving his role as the painting's focus. John Thallon, a Melbourne frame-maker, provided the frame for many of Roberts' paintings, including this one. History Photograph of a shearing shed outside Melbourne, taken by Charles Nettleton, c. 1880 Roberts was born in England in 1856 and migrated to Australia with his family in 1869, settling in Collingwood, a working-class suburb of Melbourne. A talented artist, Roberts attended classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School before returning to England in 1881 when he was selected to study at the Royal Academy of Arts. While touring Europe with Australian artist John Peter Russell, Roberts adopted the principles of impressionism and plein air painting and brought them back with him to Australia when he returned in 1885. With like-minded artists, he helped to form the \\"Heidelberg School\\" movement, a group of Melbourne-based impressionists who depicted rural life and the bush, with nationalist and regionalist overtones. The Australian colonies celebrated the centenary of European settlement in 1880s, and for the first time, Australian-born Europeans outnumbered the immigrant population. These and other factors fostered strong nationalistic feeling and intense discussion about Australian history, culture and identity. Seeking to develop a national art, Roberts chose agricultural and pastoral subjects that would symbolise the embryonic nation, such as bushranging, droving and shearing. In the 19th century, wool was a major source of wealth for the colonies, and by the 1870s, Australia had become the world's largest wool producer. Historian Geoffrey Blainey states that shearers of that era, like Jackie Howe, were seen almost as \\"folk heroes\\" with shearing tallies reported in local newspapers in a similar manner to sports scores. Shearers also inspired popular bush ballads around this time, such as \\"Click Go the Shears\\" and the poems of Banjo Paterson.\\"Bush songs and music\\", australia.gov.au. Retrieved 21 March 2016. According to Paul Johnson, Shearing the Rams, like works by Heidelberg School member Arthur Streeton, illustrates the tribute paid by Australian artists to their country: \\"[they] saw the country as a place where hard work and determination were making it the world's paradise\\". The painting itself is described by Johnson as a celebration of \\"the industry which produced the wealth\\" of Australia. Grosvenor Chambers, where Roberts made final touches to Shearing the Rams and first put it on exhibition Roberts finished Shearing the Rams in May 1890 and unveiled it at his studio at Grosvenor Chambers on Collins Street, Melbourne. There were immediately calls for the painting to enter a public gallery, with a Melbourne correspondent for the Sydney press stating, \\"if our national gallery trustees were in the least patriotic, they would purchase it.\\"\\"Melbourne Gossip\\". The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser (Sydney). 19 July 1890. p. 145. Retrieved 18 March 2016. Roberts wished to sell the painting to the National Gallery of Victoria, however this was opposed by key people at the gallery, including director George Folingsby and one of the trustees. Eventually he sold the painting to a local stock and station agent for 350 guineas; the agent displayed it in his office in Melbourne. The NGV finally acquired the painting in 1932--one year after Roberts' death--using funds from the Felton Bequest. The painting was rehung in a new, wider frame in 2002; according to the NGV conservators this was in line with Roberts' original frame, which had been trimmed down over the years as framing fashion changed. In 2006, the NGV began a major restoration of the picture, the first in over 80 years. The painting had slowly lost its cover as the natural resin used in the previous restoration gradually degraded. The restoration revealed much of Roberts' original colour palette as well as background details previously not recognised. After the painting was cleaned, Lane claimed that he \\"could see the way the space and light flowed across the back reaches of the shearing shed in a way we really hadn't been aware of before.\\" The painting is currently displayed with the NGV's Australian art collection in the Ian Potter Centre at Federation Square in Melbourne. Critical reaction The painting was initially generally well-received with Melbourne newspaper The Age reporting that it was a \\"most important work of a distinctly Australian character\\". Among the many visitors to Grosvenor Chambers to see Shearing the Rams were \\"practical men from the bush\\". \\"It is right\\", they reportedly said when asked about the work. One journalist explained:\\"Notes and Comments\\". The Argus (Melbourne). 24 June 1890. p. 6. Retrieved 5 June 2020. However, more conservative elements were critical of the work, with James Smith of The Argus, Melbourne's foremost art critic, commenting that the picture was too naturalistic: \\"art should be of all times, not of one time, of all places, not of one place\\", adding \\"we do not go to an art gallery to see how sheep are shorn\\". In response, Roberts defended his choice of subject, stating that \\"by making art the perfect expression of one time and one place, it becomes for all time and of all places\\". In its 1890 review of the painting, The Argus wrote that the shearers, \\"native and to the manner born\\", present \\"the physical characteristics of Young Australia\\". Art historian Chris Mcauliffe echoed this interpretation, calling the shearers \\"perfect specimens of manhood\\" who, in Roberts' vision, represented \\"the so- called 'coming man' of Australia\\".McCaullife, Chris (4 June 2010). Shearing the Rams. Interview on Bush Telegraph, ABC Radio National. More recent critics have remarked that it presents an idealised and nostalgic view of pastoral life in Australia, with no sign of the conflict then taking place between the newly unionised shearers and the squatters, which culminated in the 1891 Australian shearers' strike. However, the painting would eventually be considered as \\"the definitive image of an emerging national identity.\\" Legacy Roberts in his later years Shearing the Rams became one of the most well-known and loved paintings in the history of Australian art. The picture is widely recognised from \\"schoolbooks, calendars, jigsaw puzzles, matchboxes and postage stamps.\\" Parodies of the painting have been used in advertising campaigns for items such as hardware and underwear to express what one person described as \\"promoting what it means to be Australian today\\". The Australian cartoonist and social commentator Michael Leunig drew a reinterpration of the painting called Ramming the shears said to be \\"humourous (sic) and thought provoking in the questions it raises about Australian national identity\\". The \\"self-consciously nationalist\\" image of young white men has been appropriated by other artists on behalf of several excluded groups, including women and immigrants. Nyoongar artist Dianne Jones made an Indigenous claim for inclusion by inserting her father and cousin into the iconic painting. George Washington Lambert's Weighing the fleece (1921) has been called a riposte to Shearing the Rams. It has been suggested that George Washington Lambert's 1921 work Weighing the fleece was conceived as a riposte to Shearing the Rams with Jim Davidson stating that \\"Certainly it could not be more different in spirit: instead of the celebration of strong masculine labour, [Weighing the fleece] endorses wealth and the social order.\\" The photorealist painter Marcus Beilby won the 1987 Sir John Sulman Prize with a painting that also depicts shearers at work, this time in a modern shed using machine shears with overhead gear. Beilby was consciously inspired by Shearing the Rams when creating his own updated version, and gave his work the name Crutching the ewes to differentiate it, despite the fact that it does not depict men crutching sheep but rather shearing them. The impact of Shearing of Rams can also be seen in Australian cinema. Shots of a shearing shed in The Squatter's Daughter (1933) bear a strong resemblance to the one in the painting.The Squatter's Daughter (1933), Australian Screen. Retrieved 20 March 2016. The cinematography of the Australian New Wave film Sunday Too Far Away (1975), set on an outback sheep station, was heavily influenced by Shearing the Rams, among other Australian paintings. The work inspired New Zealand author Stephen Daisley to write his 2015 historical novel Coming Rain.Green, Sue (3 May 2015). \\"Coming Rain by Kiwi author Stephen Daisley: masterful\\", stuff.co.nz.

A re-enactment of the scene from the painting took place at North Tuppal station near Tocumwal, New South Wales in June 2010. Another life-size rendition of Shearing the Rams occurred in 2011 at Melbourne's Federation Square as part of the NGV's 150th anniversary celebrations.Plant, Simon (28 May 2011). \\"NGV brings art to life for birthday\\", Herald Sun.

The history of labour revolts often provides the historical basis for many advocates of marxism, communism, socialism and anarchism, with many instances occurring across the world in both the 19th and 20th centuries. Labour revolts in France The Canut Revolts in Lyons, France were the first clearly defined worker uprising of the Industrial Revolution. The First occurred in November 1831 and was followed by later revolts in 1834 and 1848. Following the closure of the national workshops after the 1848 revolution in Paris, there was an uprising in Paris involving 100,000 insurgents involved in a three-day battle with the army, volunteers and reserve forces. The Paris Commune in France (1871) is hailed by both anarchists and Socialists as the first assumption of power by the working class, but controversy of the policies implemented in the Commune helped the split between the two groups. Labour revolts in the United States The earliest revolts in the United States include the pockets of rebellion by slaves and servants acting together in actual uprisings or planned revolts throughout its colonial period. For instance, there was the case of the 1712 incident where 23 slaves who killed nine whites in New York to avenge their harsh treatment. Slaves have also joined farmers in several uprisings against the social system wherein royal authorities, proprietors, trading companies and large land owners were in charge. One of the most dramatic was the uprising in the Royal colony of Virginia in 1676 led by Nathaniel Bacon against the corrupt royal governor, Sir William Berkeley. The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the 1877 Shamokin Uprising occurred in the United States. It is considered the bloodiest labor-management confrontation in U.S. history. The uprising was in response to the railroad executives decision to cut wages and lay off employees due to the economic downturn caused by the panic of 1873. The strike began in July 1877 when workers of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad blocked railway traffic after the company imposed a 10 percent pay cut. It sparked similar movements among railroad workers everywhere and an estimated 100,000 workers joined the uprising nationwide. The revolt included riots and destruction of railroad property and was met with violent crackdowns. These Revolts led to the progression of labour movements in the United States, therefore in return led to fairer wages, better working conditions, and the overall well being of workers. The Battle of Blair Mountain in Logan County, West Virginia, USA (1921) was the largest organised armed uprising in American Labour History since the Civil War, and had a major impact on labour legislation in the United States. The confrontation was so violent that the then President Warren Harding ordered the aerial bombing of entrenched miner positions. Labour revolts in Russia, Germany and Eastern Europe The Revolution of 1905 in led to the creation of the Saint Petersburg Soviet or worker's council which became the model for most Communist Revolutionary Activity. The Soviet was revived in the Russian Revolution and the model was repeated in the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, The Bavarian Soviet Republic and the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Some revolutionary activity within the Eastern Bloc resembled Labour Revolts, such as the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the Polish 1970 protests although many communists would dispute this as 'Counter-Revolutionary' activity. Labour revolts in Great Britain A Red Clydeside was a period of labour and political militancy in the city of Glasgow, Scotland between the 1910s and the 1930s. Most famously, this resulted in raising the red flag in the Battle of George Square. Labour revolts in Spain *The Asturian miners' strike of 1934 Labour revolts elsewhere Some observers claimed that the protests of 1968 were part of a \\"revolutionary wave\\", with much of the activity motivated by students. *Gwangju massacre in South Korea, 1980 *The Nghe-Tinh Revolt 1930‚Äì31 French Indochina *Brazilian Anarchist Uprising 1917‚Äì18 *Saigon Commune, Vietnam 1945 See also *Proletarian revolution *General strike *Cuno strikes *Slave rebellion References External links *The Nghe-Tinh Revolt *1917‚Äì1918: The Brazilian anarchist uprising Category:Labor history Category:History of socialism ","title":"Labour revolt"},{"id":"24073767","text":"2001 World Cup can refer to: *The 2001 Alpine Skiing World Cup *2001 Baseball World Cup *2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens *2001 ISSF World Cup *2001 Speedway World Cup See also * 2001 Continental Championships (disambiguation) * 2001 World Championships (disambiguation) * 2001 World Junior Championships (disambiguation) ","title":"2001 World Cup"},{"id":"24073778","text":"\\"Media Blitz\\" is the fifth episode of the third season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation, and the 35th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 17, 2011. In the episode, the parks department tries to draw media attention for the upcoming harvest festival, but the press becomes fixated on Ben's past political mistakes. Meanwhile, Andy Dwyer takes on all of April Ludgate's errands with the hopes of convincing her not to move to Indianapolis. Written by Harris Wittels and directed by David Rogers, \\"Media Blitz\\" revolved largely around Ben's backstory as a child mayor who bankrupted his old town, which was originally a concept considered for series protagonist Leslie Knope. The episode was also what series co-creator Michael Schur called a \\"key moment\\" for April and Andy, ending a multi-episode subplot of April being angry with Andy for having been kissed by Ann in the second season finale \\"Freddy Spaghetti\\". \\"Media Blitz\\" featured guest appearances by comedians Matt Besser and Nick Kroll as morning zoo-style radio hosts \\"Crazy Ira and The Douche,\\" as well as appearance by frequent Parks and Recreation guest stars Mo Collins, Alison Becker, and Jay Jackson. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Media Blitz\\" was seen by 4.33 million household viewers. It marked the lowest rating for the season to date, and constituted a more than eight percent drop from the previous episode, \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\". \\"Media Blitz\\" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the performance of Adam Scott as Ben. Some reviews, however, found less effective a subplot about the uncertainty surrounding the romantic relationship of Ann and Chris Traeger, a state auditor played by Rob Lowe who is supposed to leave Pawnee for Indianapolis soon. Plot Leslie (Amy Poehler), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ben (Adam Scott) start promoting the upcoming Harvest Festival on several Pawnee media outlets, starting with the local morning zoo radio show \\"Crazy Ira and The Douche\\" (Matt Besser and Nick Kroll). The duo begin asking Ben questions about his time as a teen mayor in Partridge, Minnesota, having researched how he bankrupted the town. Ben responds awkwardly, stammering incomprehensibly and unable to defend himself to Crazy Ira and The Douche's taunts. Tom proposes dumping Ben from future media interviews, but Leslie insists they cannot because he is the only one who can handle complicated questions about its budget. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) accepts an offer from Chris (Rob Lowe) to move to Indianapolis to be his secretary. Andy (Chris Pratt) begs April to reconsider, offering to perform all the errands that she hates doing for a month. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to help, claiming that he does not want to lose April as an assistant while denying he cares about April and Andy's relationship. Ann (Rashida Jones) is increasingly frustrated that Chris has not asked her about coming to Indianapolis with him, and is concerned about where their relationship is headed. Unfortunately, Ben's past comes up again during Leslie's interview with newspaper reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep (Alison Becker), who asks why Pawnee should accept financial guidance from someone with a poor budget managing record like Ben. Tom and Ben go on the television show \\"Ya' Heard? with Perd\\" with Perd Hapley (Jay Jackson) in the hopes of recovering from the earlier debacle, but this interview is even worse, with Ben launching into a furious, incoherent rant when his past is brought up. As a result, several businesses consider pulling their sponsorships from the Harvest Festival. Leslie decides to use her upcoming interview on \\"Pawnee Today\\" with Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) to perform damage control. During the interview, Joan asks very biased questions about the festival and Ben's past. Annoyed, Leslie brings Ben on stage to give him a final opportunity to explain himself. Ben again begins to freeze up at the questions from people calling in, but he finally gets over it and vigorously defends himself. By the end, the questions switch back from Ben to the festival itself, making the media blitz a successful one after all. Chris tells Ann that after Indianapolis, he will be sent to a different city. The two agree they need to talk about the future of their relationship. Meanwhile, Andy's difficult day of running errands for April culminates with him getting arrested after April's sister Natalie (Minni Jo Mazzola) claims he is kidnapping her when he is merely picking her up from school. Ron approaches April and tells her that she should either forgive Andy or cut him loose, believing that she is only stringing Andy along and going to Indianapolis to spite him. When Andy returns, April finally forgives him and kisses him. Production \\"Media Blitz\\" was written by Harris Wittels and directed by David Rogers. Like all of the first six third season episodes, it was written and filmed almost immediately after the second season ended as part of an early shooting schedule due to Amy Poehler's pregnancy. However, although finished early in anticipation of a September 2010 release date, Parks was ultimately placed on hiatus until early 2011, many months after production on \\"Media Blitz\\" was already finished. \\"Media Blitz\\" featured guest appearances by Matt Besser and Nick Kroll as, respectively, \\"Crazy Ira and The Douche\\", the hosts of a Pawnee morning zoo- style radio show. Kroll is a stand-up comedian who had appeared in shows like Cavemen and The League, while Besser is a comedian from the Upright Citizens Brigade, a sketch comedy show and troupe which also featured Amy Poehler. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said the Douche was invented because the Parks and Recreation staff liked Kroll and tried to find a way to work him into the show. The episode also featured several appearances by several frequent guest stars, including Mo Collins as television host Joan Callamezzo, Alison Becker as newspaper writer Shauna Malwae-Tweep, and Jay Jackson as television reporter Perd Hapley. Much of \\"Media Blitz\\" revolves around the backstory of Ben Wyatt, which was introduced in the second season episode \\"The Master Plan\\", involving his attempts to rebuild his political career after a humiliating public spectacle as a teen mayor. This was originally a concept the Parks and Recreation creators considered for Leslie Knope's background, but they ultimately abandoned the idea. \\"Media Blitz\\" marked the end of a plotline between April and Andy that began with the second-season finale, \\"Freddy Spaghetti\\", when Ann kissed Andy just as April had agreed to start dating him. April had been angry with Andy ever since, and Andy had been desperately trying to win her back, culminating with the events in \\"Media Blitz\\". Schur called it a \\"key moment\\" for April and Andy, and said, \\"It's almost like Andy‚Äôs a Knight of the Round Table, and he‚Äôs got a lot of different obstacles that he‚Äôs got to overcome in order to win the love of a fair maiden.\\" The episode also continued a development of Ron Swanson's character as more of a father figure to his employees, particularly Andy and April, even though Ron himself outwardly claims not to care about affairs. This began in the episode \\"Flu Season\\", where Ron offered advice to Andy about winning April back, and continued in \\"Media Blitz\\" with Ron giving April advice that ultimately led her to take Andy back. Cultural references In one scene, Leslie claims she unsuccessfully tried to contact Oprah Winfrey, the popular billionaire television host, to seek publicity for the harvest festival. Upon failing to contact Winfrey, Leslie said, \\"I'm putting it out there, like The Secret, and hopefully she'll call me.\\" The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne that became a best-seller after it was featured on two episodes of The Oprah Winfrey Show. At one point, Tom reveals he shops for clothes at Brooks Brothers Boys, the chain of Brooks Brothers that produces clothes specifically for young boys. Several Pawnee residents in \\"Media Blitz\\" refer to using the search engine AltaVista, a site that had not been popular for several years, prompting Ben to ask, \\"Why does everyone in this town use AltaVista? Is it 1997?\\" The radio DJs Crazy Ira and The Douche play several sound effects during their show, and when Ben acts awkwardly during the interview, they play the sound effect used when Pac-Man is killed in the maze arcade games. Reception Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Media Blitz\\" was seen by an estimated 4.33 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with an overall 2.5 rating/4 share, and a 2.2 rating/6 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. It constituted the lowest rating for the season thus far, and more than an eight percent drop from the previous week's episode, \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\". The night \\"Media Blitz\\" was broadcast, almost all of the comedy shows in NBC's Thursday lineup lost viewership compared to the prior week. While viewership during Community remained flat, The Office, 30 Rock and Outsourced each saw all their lowest ratings of the season that night, suffering rating declines from the previous week of 6 percent, 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Reviews \\"Media Blitz\\" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the performance of Adam Scott, although some said the subplot with Chris and Ann was less effective. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook wrote, \\"Party Down vet absolutely stole the show on Parks and Recreation. ... Scott was a machine of mania, a dork gone wild, who gave the rapidly unraveling Ben just the right amount of crazy while completely cracking us up.\\" Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said \\"Media Blitz\\" continue a long period of excellent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the problems were resolved too quickly at the end of the episode. Sundermann said Scott's slightly over-the-top performance was made especially funny because he is normally such a straight man character. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Scott for his ability to be both a straight man and a more outrageously funny character, as during his meltdowns in media interviews. Sepinwall also complimented Aubrey Plaza's performance and said the overall episode was very funny, but that the main storyline was resolved too quickly. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the episode continued the development of the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons' Springfield. Poniewozik said \\"Media Blitz\\" also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the \\"Crazy Ira and The Douche\\" interview \\"maybe the most perfect scene P&R; has put together yet\\". Likewise, Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley \\"one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done\\". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, \\"then took it way over-the-top\\". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution. Zap2it writer Rick Porter, called the episode a \\"great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts\\" and wrote, \\"This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season.\\" Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, \\"If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early.\\" Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott, calling him a \\"current-generation Bob Newhart\\" and \\"one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys everything you need to know about what his character is thinking\\". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, \\"it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself\\". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, as well as how the writers have \\"smartly underplayed\\" the relationship between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the \\"weakest plotline of the season\\", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in \\"Media Blitz\\" were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\": \\"The laughs weren't as loud on \\"Media Blitz,\\" as it was more of a squirm-inducing half hour of television.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was \\"dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments\\", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said \\"was so damn sweet that I just couldn't resist it\\". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, \\"Did anyone else's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie‚Äôs face when Ben found his voice?\\" Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character. Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot, of which she said, \\"Wake me up when something actually happens.\\" References External links * \\"Media Blitz\\" at the official Parks and Recreation site  Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Parks and Recreation (season 3) episodes ","title":"Media Blitz"},{"id":"24073781","text":"The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (; CNRA) was an act passed in the 110th United States Congress and enacted on May 8, 2008.

History The Institute of Plant Industry was established in 1921. Nikolai Vavilov was the head of this institute from 1924 to 1936 and had, and still has, the world's largest collection of plant seeds. During the early 1930s, he became the target of the Lysenkoist debate and was exiled. The Institute's seedbank survived the 28-month Siege of Leningrad in World War II, where several botanists starved to death rather than eat the collected seeds. In 2010 the plant collection at the Pavlovsk Experimental Station was to be destroyed to make way for luxury housing. This was averted by order of President Dmitri Medvedev. Siege of Leningrad The Institute's extensive seed collection was an important target during the siege of Leningrad, Soviet officials took the time to evacuate the art from the city but neglected, or forgot to remove the world's largest seed collection. The scientists of the institute protected the seeds from the threats of the cold, the hungry residents of the besieged city, rats, and their own hunger. Twenty-eight of the botanists died during the siege, protecting their collection.

Overview The FEE is basic engineering which comes after the Conceptual design or Feasibility study. The FEE design focuses the technical requirements as well as rough investment cost for the project. The FEE can be divided into separate packages covering different portions of the project. The FEE package is used as the basis for bidding the Execution Phase Contracts (EPC, EPCI, etc) and is used as the design basis. A good FEE will reflect all of the client's project-specific requirements and avoid significant changes during the execution phase. FEE contracts usually take around 1 year to complete for larger-sized projects. During the FEE phase there is close communication between Project Owners and Operators and the Engineering Contractor to work up the project-specific requirements. Front-End Engineering focuses on technical requirements and identifying main costs for a proposed project.http://www.epicpackaginglines.com/lineevaluation/line-evaluation/ It is used to establish a price for the execution phase of the project and evaluate potential risks. It is typically followed by Detailed Design (or Detailed Engineering). The amount of time invested in Front-End Engineering is higher than a traditional quote, because project specifications are thoroughly extracted and the following typically developed in detail: * Project Organization Chart * Project Scope :* Defined civil, mechanical and chemical engineering :* HAZOP, safety and ergonomic studies :* 2D & 3D preliminary models :* Equipment layout and installation plan :* Engineering design package development :* Major equipment list :* Automation strategy * PFD - Process Flow Diagrams and P&ID; \\\\- Piping and Instrumentation Diagram * Project timeline * Fixed-bid quote Traditionally, all of these documents would be developed in detail during a design review after a quote has been agreed to. A company using FEE will develop these materials before submitting a quote. Front-end engineering is typically used by design/build engineering firms. These firms may operate in various industries including: * Automation * Process Industry * Chemical processing * Construction * EPC * EPCIC * Equipment design * Manufacturing * Pharmaceuticals * Petrochemicals * Process system design * Production line design * Refining * Machine Vision FEE Methodology FEE Methodology:http://www.asee.org/documents/sections/middle- atlantic/fall-2010/01-Teaching-Front-End-Engineering-Design-FEED.pdf FEE is a way of looking at a project before completing detailed design. There is no set way to conduct a Front-End Engineering study. Generally, FEE requires an engineer or a group of engineers to thoroughly and logically consider a proposed project. Example considerations may include: * Degree of automation ‚Äì depending on the application being considered, automation may or may not be appropriate. Determining the amount of automation in the project will help determine equipment, labor costs, layout, and design. * Rates and levels ‚Äì to hit a certain rate or level of, for example, production, a certain amount of equipment, materials, and automation may be required. Determining key rates and parameters will have great effect on overall project costs and timeline * Material specifications ‚Äì Not all materials work well together, or can withstand the physical application. A basic engineering discipline is determining materials of construction, material compatibility etc. * Standards and guidelines ‚Äì every industry has standards and guidelines, and many industries are regulated. Any equipment, production facilities, manufacturing lines etc. developed for these industries must meet these standards and regulations and can have major impact on costs/time to project completion * Assumptions, Exclusions, and potential problems: FEE seeks to identify potential problems, assumptions or exclusions that could affect the project during execution. Identifying these during the front-end planning stage so they can be accounted for is the goal of FEE. Feed also includes the outline and stages of Expansions to happen in future, although the timeline is not specifically stated for such expansions. In such cases, the plot area allocated for expansion at certain stage is usually not transgressed.

Their eponymous first album hit platinum in sales in India alone and consistently headed the Indian music charts in 1996. The duo have received numerous awards, notably the MTV Asia Viewers' Choice Award, 1996, and the US Billboard's Viewers' Award, 1996. On 19 November 1998, the Colonial Cousins released their second album, The Way We Do It. They also released their third album Aatma on 1 January 2001. They have scored two Tamil films, Modhi Vilayadu (2009), Chikku Bukku (2010). Their fourth album Once More was released in 2012. History  Formation It was during Lewis's jingles career that the idea of Colonial Cousins was conceived. Lewis had called in Hariharan to sing a jingle for him one evening in 1992. The lyrics for the jingle were late coming in. The restless Lewis began crooning something while strumming on his guitar, and Hari felt inspired to jam with an alaap. Being a ghazal singer in the Indian music industry for over two decades, Hariharan is well versed in Carnatic and Hindustani music. Besides releasing several ghazal albums, Hariharan has also lent his voice to many Hindi and Tamil films, and ended up winning several awards including the National Award as Best Singer for his song \\"Mere Dushman Mere Bhai\\" from the film Border. Debut album In October 1996, under Magnasound Label, the duo released their debut album self-titled Colonial Cousins. The album broke all records including hitting platinum sales in India. The duo also won the MTV Asia Viewer's Choice Award and then later on collected the US Billboard Viewer's Choice Award too. The song \\"Krishna\\" won the Star Videocon Award for Best Music Video. The style is essentially fusion, with a lot of songs opening with recognisable Hindustani or Carnatic ragas and then segueing into a more pop style. The musicians who worked on it range from Vishwa Mohan Bhatt to sessions musicians who have worked with the likes of Madonna, Boy George, Annie Lennox and other well-known Western musicians. It was the first Indian act to be featured on MTV Unplugged. The Way We Do It On 19 November 1998, their second album, a sophomore effort, The Way We Do It, was a continuation of, and a departure from, that first effort. The album was a continuation in musical terms to the extent that Lewis and Hariharan had done what they do best individually, and fused it into a format that enriches and complements each other. The album was also a departure sound-wise from their eponymous first album. While that has a softer sound to it, their second album was edgier and groovier. The album has some singles such as the title track \\"Way We Do It With You\\". Srinivas playing on it, \\"Dekhoon Main Jahan\\" penned by lyricist Javed Akhtar, \\"No Longer Mine\\" and \\"Lady\\". Aatma After two-and-a-half years in hibernation, Colonial Cousins, recorded their third album Aatma. Released in April 2001, on the Sony label, the nine-track album was a fusion of Indian vocals and contemporary instrumentation. Besides being busy in playback singing Hariharan had cut a ghazal album Kaash the previous year, while Lewis had been busy composing jingles and producing music. There is also a song \\"I Love You Girl\\" which Hariharan has dedicated to his daughter Divya. Once More In 2012, 11 years after their previous album, the duo came together to release their brand new album Once More. To launch their latest album, the duo took to the jostling promenade of Carter Road in the busy suburb of Bandra, Mumbai, in a musical ensemble that worked its way from Otters Club to the amphitheater, all along performing music from their new album on top of a 40-foot canter. The event concluded with the official unveiling of the album Once More. Modhi Vilayadu In 2009, the Colonial Cousins made a debut as music composers for Tamil film Modhi Vilayadu directed by Saran. The director of the film required a new trend of music and so roped in the Indipop duo thus opening doors for them to the Tamil Film Industry. Chikku Bukku Colonial Cousins scored their second soundtrack for the film Chikku Bukku (2010). Its audio was released on 13 August.

This rise is superimposed upon the late-night rise in cortisol which occurs before awakening. While its purpose is uncertain, it may be linked to the hippocampus' preparation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) in order to face anticipated stress. Description Shortly after awakening, a sharp 38‚Äì75% (average 50%) increase occurs in the blood level of cortisol in about 77% of healthy people of all ages. The average level of salivary cortisol upon waking is roughly 15 nmol/l; 30 minutes later it may be 23 nmol/l, though there are wide variations. The cortisol awakening response reaches a maximum approximately 30 minutes after awakening though it may still be heightened by 34% an hour after waking. The pattern of this response to waking is relatively stable for any individual. Twin studies show its pattern is largely genetically determined since there is a heritability of 0.40 for the mean cortisol increase after awakening and 0.48 for the area under the cortisol rise curve. Normally, the highest cortisol secretion happens in the second half of the night with peak cortisol production occurring in the early morning. Following this, cortisol levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during the first half of the night. Cortisol awakening response is independent of this circadian variation in HPA axis activity; it is superimposed upon the daily rhythm of HPA axis activity, and it seems to be linked specifically to the event of awakening. Cortisol awakening response provides an easy measure of the reactivity capacity of the HPA axis. Sleep factors * Waking up earlier in the morning increases the response. * Shift work: nurses working on morning shifts with very early awakening (between 4:00‚Äì5:30 a.m.) had a greater and prolonged cortisol awakening response than those on the late day shift (between 6:00‚Äì9:00 a.m.) or the night shift (between 11:00 a.m.‚Äì2:00 p.m.). However another study found that this greater response could be attributed to increased stress and impaired sleep quality before an early work shift (\\"when these factors were taken into account, the difference in CAR related to experimental condition was no longer significant\\"). * Naps: students taking a nap of one to two hours in the early evening hours (between 6:45‚Äì8:30 p.m.) had no cortisol awakening response, suggesting cortisol awakening response only occurs after night sleep. * Waking up in the light: cortisol awakening response is larger when people wake up in light rather than darkness. * Noise: there is no cortisol rise after nights with traffic-like low-frequency noise. * Alarm clock vs. spontaneous waking: there is no difference on days when people woke up spontaneously or used the alarm clock. * Aspirin has been found to reduce the response probably through an action upon ACTH. Individual factors * Morning types show a larger cortisol awakening response than evening types. * Those suffering fatigue show a low rise and flat plateau. * Those in pain: the response is reduced the more people are in pain. * The lower a person's socioeconomic status, the higher their response. This might link to the material hardship that occurs with low socioeconomic status. Stress Cortisol awakening response is larger for those: * Waking up to a working day compared to work-free weekend day. * Experiencing chronic stress and worry. * Overloaded with work. * In acute stress. People taking part in a competitive ballroom dance tournament had an increased cortisol awakening response on the morning of their competition day but not their non-competition one. * Worn down by burnout: some studies find an increased response, though other researchers find a decreased or normal response. Neurology Cortisol is released from the adrenal glands following activation by ACTH release from the pituitary. The ACTH release creating the cortisol awakening response is strongly inhibited after intake of a low-dose dexamethasone. This is a synthetic glucocorticoid and this inhibition allows the detection of the presence of negative feedback from circulating cortisol that controls to ACTH- secreting cells of the pituitary. In the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis the pituitary release of ACTH is regulated by the hypothalamus. This occurs through the hypothalamus's production of the hypophysiotropic hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone, the production of which is subject to circadian influence and the day/night cycle. In the cortisol awakening response, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is controlled by the hippocampus. For example, cortisol awakening response is absent in those with bilateral and unilateral hippocampus damage and hippocampal atrophy. Those with severe amnesia, and thus with presumed damage to the temporal lobe, also do not have it. Those with a larger hippocampus have a greater response. It's plausible also that the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the light-sensitive biological clock, plays a role in cortisol awakening response regulation. Function The function of cortisol awakening response is unknown but it has been suggested to link with a stress-related preparation in regard to the upcoming day by the hippocampus. One hypothesis is: \\"that the cortisol rise after awakening may accompany an activation of prospective memory representations at awakening enabling individual's orientation about the self in time and space as well as anticipation of demands of the upcoming day... it is tempting to speculate that for the CAR, anticipation of these upcoming demands may be essential in regulating the CAR magnitude for the particular day. The hippocampus is, besides its established role in long-term memory consolidation, involved in the formation of a cohesive construct and representation of the outside world within the central nervous system processing information about space, time and relationships of environmental cues. This puts the hippocampus in a pivotal position for the regulation of the CAR.\\" See also * Dawn phenomenon * Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis * Sleep References Category:Neuroendocrinology Category:Sleep physiology Category:Unsolved problems in neuroscience Category:Stress (biological and psychological) ","title":"Cortisol awakening response"},{"id":"24074128","text":"Get Ahead is a BBC Television programme that ran from 1958 to 1962 and offered a prize of ¬£5,000 () to a contestant's idea for an entrepreneurial project for a profitable business.

Biography Born in Milan, Colonello studied architecture in Milan with Gio Ponti and Ernesto Rogers. His first drew critical praise for his designs for La traviata at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in 1956. This was followed by designs for Arrigo Boito's Mefistofele at La Scala in 1958. He designed several more Milan productions, including Don Pasquale in 1965 and two productions for Margherita Wallmann: the premi√®re of Ildebrando Pizzetti‚Äôs Clitennestra in 1965 and another Don Pasquale in 1973. In 1962 Colonello made his United States debut at the Dallas Civic Opera with a critically acclaimed production of Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. He designed another production at that house following a year, Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. He worked for the Metropolitan Opera for the first time in 1964 when he designed a Jacobean Lucia di Lammermoor for Wallmann. He later designed two productions for Nathaniel Merrill at the Met: a 19th-century Luisa Miller (1968) and a gloomy Il trovatore (1969). Since 1964 Colonello has worked frequently as a scenic designer and director for the Teatro di San Carlo. His first production with the company was Roberto Devereux, again with Wallmann as director. He then designed and directed productions of Adriana Lecouvreur (1966), the premi√®re of Jacopo Napoli‚Äôs Barone avaro, and Samson et Dalila (both 1970), Carmen (1975), La Gioconda (1977) and I puritani and Luisa Miller (both 1988). Colonello's best work has been with the Arena di Verona Festival, beginning with a splendid Nabucco in 1962. In 1964 he designed and directed productions of Cavalleria rusticana and La boh√®me and designed a production of Mefistofele for director Herbert Graf. He then designed Carmen (1965), Rigoletto (1966), La forza del destino (1967) and Andrea Ch√©nier ( 1967). For the festival's 100th anniversary he staged Aida (1968) and later returned for a lauded production of Un ballo in maschera (1972). In 1984 he returned to design and direct I Lombardi.

History  LMS, 1869, p.14) CCCS traces its beginnings to the arrival in 1830 of missionaries sent by the London Missionary Society (LMS), accompanied by missionary teachers from Tahiti and the Cook Islands and a Samoan couple from Tonga. The LMS missionaries arrived at a time of fierce warfare and fighting between local chiefs. Weary of violence and bloodshed, they readily received the missionaries and their gospel of peace. Paramount chief, Malietoa Vainu'upo, of noble lineage accepted Christianity. All his followers and kinsfolk immediately followed suit. Similarly, Tui-Manu'a, the sovereign ruler of the Manu'a islands also embraced the LMS emissary. The Kingdom of Manu'a became a LMS and Congregational stronghold. Within a few years, virtually the whole of Samoa was converted to Christianity. Huge numbers of people from simple and noble lineage soon offered themselves for overseas mission work. In 1839, nine years after the arrival of the LMS, the first twelve Samoan missionaries left for mission work in Melanesia. Since then, Samoans continued to take the gospel message to other Pacific islands, e.g. Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Niue, Tokelau, New Caledonia, Rotuma, Solomon Islands, Wallis and Futuna. Many of these early Samoan missionaries never returned home; they occupy many of the unnamed and unmarked graves on islands throughout the Pacific. By the 1980s Samoan missionaries could be found in Africa, evangelizing on the streets of London, and in remote villages of Jamaica.  Establishment of a theological college  Malua Theological College was established in 1844, its main objective to teach and educate local students so that each village of Samoa would have a theologically educated pastor as spiritual leader. By the end of the 19th century, a pattern of ministry had emerged. It was modeled on the Samoan village structural organization and aimed at preserving, as much as possible, the value systems of the Samoan way of life. The church community functions in the same way as the village, where five main groups ‚Äì (titled men), spouses of , untitled men , unmarried women , and children ‚Äì each have their own individual and corporate roles and responsibilities for the maintenance of order and welfare. The village congregation is the basic unit of the CCCS with the pastor as the spiritual leader.  Church's focus  London Missionary Society, SƒÅmoa, 1949 The Samoan church during the missionary period engaged itself in the \\"social redemption of humanity\\". This vision was based on the church's understanding of God's sovereignty. It saw the divine purpose of redemption not in individual terms only but also in corporate, social and political terms. The newly acquired faith had its focus on the transformation of life and society. This legacy remains a motivating force in the nation's idealism as well as in the church's commitment to be active in social efforts.This social endeavor is evident in the sphere of educating the children of Samoa. The CCCS maintains a strong focus on the importance of education. The church operates five secondary schools, a girls' secondary school, a vocational fine arts school and one theological college. The CCCS maintains a steady annual enrollment of 3,000 students. (http://cccs.org.ws/index.php/education)  Relationships with other churches  Since the second half of the 20th century, the Samoan church has continued to forge ecumenical relationships with other churches locally, regionally and internationally. It has become an international church with eight districts (synod or diocese) outside Samoa: one in the United States, one in Hawaii, three in Australia and three in New Zealand. It has one congregation in Fiji and American Samoa. In the Independent state of Samoa alone the CCCS membership is over 70,000. In the U.S. Territory of American Samoa, the CCCAS has over 39,000 adherents. Samoan Congregational adherents account for nearly half of the Samoan population living abroad. When the London Missionary Society combined with other missions to create the Council for World Mission (CWM) in 1977, the CCCS became a part of this global missionary effort as well. An ecclesial schism took place within the Samoan church in 1980, with the American Samoa district withdrawing and forming the Congregational Christian Church of American Samoa (CCCAS). The CCCAS became a member of CWM in 1994. The 2012 CWM Conference was held at the CCCAS headquarters in Kananafou. Fellow church members from over thirty-one Churches with LMS affiliations converged upon Kananafou to share in Christian fellowship. Samoan Congregational churches continue to play an active role in participating in ecumenical efforts that outreach to the world. Bible Within the first years of mission work, the LMS missionaries developed a Samoan alphabet and put the language into written form. The setting-up of the first printing press in Samoa (1839), only the second in the Pacific region, was a mark of the missionary zeal to bring the people to understand the gospel through the written word. The London Missionary Society missionaries, working with prominent and well-versed Samoan orators in the local vernacular, translated the Christian Bible into the Samoan language, and this Bible translation, \\"O le Tusi Pa'ia\\", is still used today. It provides an important grounding in the philosophical usage of the Samoan language. By 1855 the translation of the Bible in Samoan was completed. The 1886 edition of the Samoan Bible was printed by the LMS in London. This edition used Roman numerals and the word, \\"Ieova\\", or Jehovah, in reference to the Lord throughout the Old Testament text. This edition is widely used among other Christian denominations that use the Samoan language. In 1839, the LMS missionaries introduced a monthly journal, Sulu Samoa. The CCCS continues to print and provides online publication through its website - cccs.org.ws. The London Missionary Society established a printing press (firstly in the village of Avao, Savaii and later transferred their printing work to Malua, Upolu). In 1844 a theological college was established at Malua, on Upolu island. In addition to the theological college, Malua continues to be the main centre of the Congregational Christian Church in Samoa; with its main offices in the main town of Apia, Samoa. The Congregational Christian Church in American Samoa (CCCAS) has its headquarters and theological training seminary at Kanana Fou (New Canaan) compound on Tutuila Island in the US territory of American Samoa.Malama Meleisea, Lagaga: a short history of Western Samoa (editorips@usp.ac.fj, 1987) , References External links * Official website of the Christian Congregational Church of Samoa Category:Religion in Samoa Category:Religious organizations established in 1839 Category:Congregationalism Category:1830s establishments in Samoa ","title":"Christian Congregational Church of Samoa"},{"id":"24074183","text":"View of the Binnenhof across the hofvijver from the Lange Vijverberg in 1900 View from the Korte Vijverberg of the west side of the Mauritshuis museum, the little tower or Torentje, and the north part of the Binnenhof along the east side of the Hofvijver Similar view from the Korte Vijverberg by night The Hofvijver (; ) is a pond in the centre of The Hague, Netherlands. It is adjoined in the east by the Korte Vijverberg (road), in the south by the Binnenhof and the Mauritshuis, in the west by the Buitenhof and in the north by the Lange Vijverberg (road). In the middle there is a small island with plants and trees which has no name, it is usually referred to as \\"the island in the Vijverberg\\".  History  The term pond is actually a misnomer, as the Hofvijver has its origin in a natural dune lake fed by the Haagse Beek (Hague Creek, originally Dunecreek) and the, nowadays muted, Bosbeek (Forestcreek) from the Haagse Bos (Hague Forest). The Haagse Beek still feeds the Hofvijver and so the pond is directly connected to the dunes in Kijkduin. In this dune lake there was an island (not the current island in the Hofvijver) on which Willem II built his palace in 1248. Other sources say he built his palace alongside the pond and created a moat around it. The city of The Hague celebrated its 700 years of existence in 1948, suggesting that the city itself bases its origin on the building of the palace by Willem II in 1248. Count Albert decided on the rectangular shape in the 14th century. In the 17th century quays were constructed, and in the 19th century the pond was elongated. Up to around 1800 the Binnenhof was still encircled by a moat and was only accessible by bridges. The island in the Vijverberg, as known in its present form, was only created around 300 years ago. How or why it was created is unknown. In the centre of the island stands a flagpole and the island itself counts a number of trees and small plants. It is not open to the public. Alongside the island there is a fountain set in the water. On a number of demonstrations the island has been occupied, and there have been banners displayed on the island.  Present  Nowadays the Hofvijver is adjoined in the west by the Buitenhof, but until the 19th century that side was adjoined by houses. The pond is encircled by fairly high quays, but is very shallow on some points. In 2004 an underwater gate was built to make sure that nobody could swim to the prime minister's office without being detected. His office, the Torentje (\\"Little Tower\\"), adjoins the Hofvijver as it is located on the Binnenhof. On the bank across from the Binnenhof (Lange Vijverberg) there is a statue of Jantje (Little John) pointing to the Binnenhof. 'Jantje' probably refers to John I, Count of Holland who died at the age of 15 years, and features in a well known Dutch children's song about The Hague. Located next to the Vijverberg are several museums, like the Mauritshuis, the Gevangenpoort (Prison Gate), the Hague Historical Museum and the Gallery Prince William V.

Rus-M was being developed by TsSKB-Progress, beginning in 2009. The program was halted in October 2011,, restarted in 2012 and finally cancelled in August 2015.  History  In spring of 2009, TsSKB-Progress won a government contract to develop a new launcher for Russia's human space program. The project was featured in MAKS 2009 Airshow, and preliminary design of the vehicle was expected to be submitted to the Russian space agency Roscosmos by August 2010.  Requirements  Safety requirements put forward by Roscosmos emphasized that the launcher design is to be extremely reliable; safe abort options for crewed vehicles must be available at any stage of flight, and vehicle departure from the launch pad must be guaranteed for the case of an emergency during an early stage of the launch sequence. The launcher was planned to provide a basis for a future heavy launcher capable to carry a payload of 5060 tons, as well as for a super-heavy design lifting 130150 tons.  Description  Four variants of Rus-M were planned for development. Each version would use a variable number of common cores as the first stage and boosters, each powered by a single Energomash RD-180 rocket engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen. Two upper stages were planned. The first would have used four RD-0146 hydrolox engines developed by Chemical Automatics Design Bureau. The second option would have been a kerosene fueled stage common with Soyuz-2. The first version of the rocket was to use three first stage cores, inseparably bolted together, with an RD-0146 powered second stage. It would have been able to lift a cargo or satellite payload of 23.8 tons to a 200-km, 51.7-degree circular orbit, a crew vehicle of 18.8 tons to a 135 by 400-km orbit, 7.0 tons to geostationary transfer orbit and 4.0 tons to geostationary orbit. The second variant would add two additional cores, and allow the strapon boosters to detach earlier in flight, boosting payload capacity to 35 tons. Version 3 would use stretched tanks on the booster cores, increasing payload again to 50 tons. Version 4 would fly with only a single core, and a Soyuz 2-derived upper stage.  Development  TsSKB Progress was responsible for overall project leadership, system integration, second stage development and production. First stage development was to be led by Makeev KB Mash, while NPO Avtomatiki was to provide the rocket's flight control system.

These captives were forcibly deported, some of them were converted and some were killed. The estimated numbers of the captives vary according to different sources, from 500 (according to Punganuri) to 85,000 (according to B. L. Rice). During the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1789‚Äì1792) 5,000 Coorg men along with their families, amounting to 12,000 people escaped from prison in Seringapatam (Srirangapatna) and came back into Coorg. Background Tipu Sultan (1750‚Äì1799), the architect of the Seringapatam Captivity Hyder Ali's invasion The conquest of Coorg, by Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore and father of Tipu Sultan, lasted 3 months and eight days. The fort of Coorg surrendered in 1765 and the Raja had previously fled into Malabar region. Hyder conquered Coorg from its king and placed his garrison in its capital Madikeri (Mercara). He gave gifts to the twelve barons who had been under the king, levied money from them and returned to his capital Seringapatam (Srirangapatna) in Mysore. When Hyder Ali unexpectedly invaded Coorg, some Coorgs were assembled on a wooded hill when Hyder's troops encompassed it. Hyder offered five rupees for every head of a Coorg (Kodava) that was brought before him. After some time when his soldiers brought him 700 heads, Hyder got the carnage stopped. Coorg was again invaded by Hyder in 1773 at the invitation of Linga Raja who claimed the throne for his nephew Appaji Raja against Devappa Raja of Horamale. In 1774, Devaya (Devappa Raja of Horamale) the Raja of Kodagu (called 'Coorgman' or 'Koduguwala' by Punganuri) rebelled, made his escape and hid in Basavapatnam (a place located between Chitradurga and Ikkeri). He was traced, caught and imprisoned in Srirangapatna. Hyder had him punished and had eminent men hanged. After occupying the country, Hyder gave it to Appaji Raja, the leading man, appointed him the 'Raja of Great Coorg', collected annual tribute and established a garrison there under a Commandant. Appaji died in 1776 and Linga Raja, his uncle, succeeded him. Linga Raja died in 1780 leaving behind his young sons, the eldest being (Dodda) Vira Rajendra. As they were young, Hyder became their guardian and took over Coorg completely. Instead of setting a son of the previous Raja, Hyder Ali made a priest (Subbarasaya) the ruler in Coorg. The Coorgs were enraged with this and hence revolted in June 1782. Hyder got the princes removed from Madikeri (Mercara) to Goruru (in Hassan region) so as to deprive the Coorgs of a rallying point. Rebellion during Tipu Sultan's reign The Coorgs had rebelled and driven out the Sultanate's forces. When Tipu became ruler of Mysore he ordered the princes removed from Goruru and placed in Periapatam (Periyapatna in Mysore). Then he sent Hyder Ali Beg and Raja Kankeri to suppress the Coorg rebels. At first they achieved some success but were then defeated by the Coorgs. Beg fled while Raja Kankeri was killed. In 1785 Tipu marched into Coorg and defeated the stiff resistance of the rebels. Tipu occupied Mercara renamed it Zafarabad, appointed Zain ul Abidin Mahdavi (also called Zain-ul-Abedin Khan Mehdivi) the faujdar in charge of Coorg and Tipu returned to Seringapatam (Srirangapatna). But when Tipu left, two Nairs (Munmate and Ranga) came to Coorg, occupied it and prepared to take Mercara. They incited the Coorgs and rebellion again broke out in Kodagu that same year (1785). The faujdar then appealed to Tipu for help. In response Tipu sent some troops with general Janulabdin (also called Zain-ul-Abidin Shushtary or Zain-ul-Abedin Shustri) into Coorg to the Faujdar's relief. (According to Moegling,p. 95 and Tarikh-i-Coorg, 15,000 soldiers were sent but according to Kirmani,p. 292 2,000 soldiers were sent) They were defeated at Ulugulli village by 4000‚Äì5000 Coorgs. Janulabdin reached the fort at Mercara but finding it hard to hold on he tried to escape to Bettadapura in Mysore. While retreating, at Ulugulli he again suffered a loss, the rebels pursued him, captured his baggage and killed many of his men. The fleeing army of Tippu Sultan left behind a large cache of arms and ammunition, including cannonballs imported from France. Captivity by Tipu Sultan A dungeon at Srirangapatna during modern times. Those Hindus (chiefly among Kodavas and Nairs) and Christians (chiefly among Mangalorean Catholics) who refused to embrace Islam were imprisoned in such dungeons. Coorgs held captive On hearing of his general's plight, Tipu collected another army, left Seringapatam and came into Coorg in October 1785. Tipu marched into the region through Aighur pass. He came to terms with the Coorgs and camped for six weeks in Ulugulli in the neighbourhood of Mercara where he celebrated Muharram. After Muharram Tipu proceeded to Mercara. Troops and provisions were dispatched to relieve the garrison of Mercara. Tipu had also been to Talakaveri (Thul Kaveri, according to Kirmani) where he camped for a while. The Queen of Cannanore came to visit him in Talakaveri and pay her tribute money to him. Tipu then camped at Devatu Parambu. He first negotiated with the Coorgs worked an amicable settlement and made them feel secure. But then suddenly Tipu seized men, women and children and carried them captive to Seringapatam (Srirangapatna) in Mysore. Tipu sent out detachments under four generals: Lallee the Frenchman, Husain Ali Khan, Mir Mahmud and Imam Khan in different directions to crush the Coorgs (Kirmani p. 297). Tipu gave the task of implementing the orders to Runmust Khan, the Nawab of Kurnool. This task was accomplished when a surprise attack was launched upon the Kodava Hindus who were besieged by the invading army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains. The Coorgs had fought with great courage but were defeated and a large number of them had been taken captive. The actual number of Kodavas that were captured in the operation is unclear. The British administrator Mark Wilks gives it as 70,000, Historian Lewis Rice arrives at the figure of 85,000, while Mir Kirmani's score for the Coorg campaign is 80,000 men, women and child prisoners. Forced conversions Thousands of Kodavas were seized and held captive at Seringapatam. They were also subjected to forcible conversions to Islam, death, and torture. Tipu Sultan's return from Coorg to Srirangapatna his capital took place in January. When Tipu arrived in Seringapatam, all the prisoners taken in Coorg were made Musalmans and styled Ahmadees (Ahmadis). According to Wilks, in one day on an auspicious moment Tipu had the great mass of Coorgs circumcised. There Tipu separated them into groups and made them Muslims. The young men were all forcibly circumcised and incorporated into the Ahmedy Corps. They were trained and made to form 8 Assad Ilahi (Asadulai) and Ahmadi Risalas (or regiments). Among the leaders of the captives, Mumoti Nair died and Ranga Nair was made Muslim and appointed as an officer. Mohibbul Hasan, Prof. Sheikh Ali, and other historians cast great doubt on the scale of the deportations and forced conversions in Coorg in particular. Hassan says that it is difficult to estimate the real number of Coorgs captured by Tipu. He argues that little reliance can be placed in Muslim accounts such as Kirmani's Nishan-e Haidari; in their anxiety to represent the Sultan as a champion of Islam, they had a tendency to exaggerate and distort the facts: Kirmani claims that 70,000 Coorgis were converted, when forty years later the entire population of Coorg was still less than that number. According to Ramchandra Rao Punganuri the true number of converts was about 500.Hasan, The History of Tipu Sultan, pp. 362‚Äì363 Deportations A soldier from Tipu Sultan's army, using his rocket as a flagstaff. To prevent further uprisings the Coorgs had been transported to Mysore. Wilks says that the prisoners were about 70,000. According to Punganuri, only about 500 souls (men, women and children) whom Tipu caught in Coorg were all made Asadulahi/Asadulai (converts) and sent (captives) to Bangalore, Seringapatam, Chitradurga, Colaram, Hosakote and Nandidurga in different groups. According to Kirmani, 80,000 Coorgs were captured and deported. Tipu had transplanted Kodavas outside Coorg and into Mysore while he brought people from elsewhere into Coorg. In the place of the deported Coorgs were brought new settlers from Adwani in Bellary. They were settled on farm lands and advanced loans. But some of them returned to Mysore because the climate of Coorg did not suit them. Nagappayya, a nephew of Subbarasaya, was appointed Faujdar in charge of Coorg. But these measures failed to crush the Coorgs who rose in rebellion again. With Coorg depopulated of its original inhabitants, Tipu sought to islamize it with Muslim settlements. To this end, he brought in 7,000 men from the Shaikh and Sayyid clans, along with their families. However, this attempt proved to be partly successful, as many of them were eventually slain or fled after Tipu lost Coorg. The Coorg capital of Madikeri had been renamed to Zafarabad. The Muslim descendants of the Kodavas who were forcibly converted into Islam, after Tipu Sultan's army on various forays into Coorg had captured them and thrown them into the Seringapatam prison, are called Kodava Maaple. Nagappayya Nagappayya, Subbarasaya's nephew who was in-charge of Coorg (Kodagu), was found guilty of corruption and so condemned to the gallows by Tipu. He then fled and found refuge with the Kote Raja of nearby Waynad in Malabar. In December 1788 Vira Raja (Dodda Vira Rajendra, son of Linga Raja) the Kodagu Raja who was detained at Periyapatna escaped with help from his Coorg friends. A dispute rose between the Kodagu Raja and Kote Raja who was aided by Nagappayya. Nagappayya however was later captured by the Kodagu Raja. Meanwhile, the Kodagu Raja also engaged Tipu's troops and send them away from Coorg, its extremes being Bisle ghat in the North to Manantvadi in the South. By defeating Tipu he repossessed himself of his kingdom. Further captures In 1789 Tipu sent Gulam Ali, Gaji Khan and Darvedil Khan with troops into Coorg by way of Siddhesvara. They took up strong positions in Coorg, seized grain, men, women and children while burning houses that they pillaged. They set fire to the Padinalkanadu temple. Later the 'Maleyalam' (Malabar) people joined the Coorgs. Tipu sent Gulam Ali into Malabar but en route Gulam was attacked by the Coorgs. Gulam managed to reach Malabar where he burnt down the Payyavur temple and attacked that region. When Tipu was marching against the Nairs at Calicut who had become rebellious, he heard of another rebellion in Coorg. He sent a force towards Coorg under Burhan ud Din and Sayed Hamid. Tipu himself marched through Tamrachadi pass and entered Malabar where he halted. There he ordered some of the inhabitants to be made Asadulai (captured and converted), placed Officer Ghafar in command there and had a wooden fort or stockade built. Related Letters Mark Wilks has described Tipu as an Islamic fanatic. In a letter to Runmust Khan, in early 1786, Tipu himself stated: Col. Kirkpatrick translated Tipu's letters into English. At one time he writes: \\"There are 500 Coorg prisoners, who must be thrown, in parties of fifty, into ten forts, where they must be dealt with in such a manner as shall insure their death in the course of a month or twenty days-such of the women as are young must be given to Musselmauns; and the rest, together with their children, must be removed to, and kept in confinement, at Seringapatam, on a small allowance.\\" In another place he writes: \\"By the favor of the Almighty and the assistance of the Prophet, we have arranged and adjusted the affairs of the Taalik of Zufeerabad in the most suitable [and satisfactory] manner; the tribe of Koorgs, to the number of fifty thousand men and women, having been made captive, and incorporated with the Ahmedy class.\\" The dead among the Coorgs were also ordered to be made Muslims. To Meer Zynul Aabideen (Mir Zain-ul-Abidin), he writes: \\"You are, in conjunction with him, to make a general attack on the Koorgs; when, having put to the sword, or made prisoners of, the whole of them, both the slain and the prisoners are to be made Musulmans.\\" To Budruz Zuman Khan he writes > What you write, concerning the death of five hundred Koorgs from the small- > pox, is understood. The whole country [thereabouts] is covered with > underwood. They [i.e. the Koorgs] must be kept where the climate [literally, > the water and air] may best agree with them. Again to Budruz Zuman Khan he writes > You will also make a daily allowance of one pice to such of the children of > the Koorgs, between five and ten years old, as you may think proper. The following is a translation of an inscription on a stone found at Seringapatam, which was situated in a conspicuous place in the fort: Escape of the captives In 1790, Dodda Vira Rajendra signed a treaty with the British, who promised to protect his kingdom against Tipu's onslaught. In 1792, Coorg became independent of Mysore once again. Eventually, Kodagu backed the British troops and Tipu fell on 4 May 1799. According to the 1799 Asiatic Annual Register, the Assud Illahee (Asadulai) of Srirangapatana (Seringapatam) were converts and of two kinds: Ahmadis who were Carnatic Christians and the Mohammadies who were Coorgs. Wilks also speaks of the Asadulai. During the Mysore War (1789‚Äì1792) in 1791, one night the British attacked the Sultan's army which fled. That day the Asadullai (converts) who were seized at Coorg and other places along with the Neze Cardar (lancers) all numbering ten thousand people escaped with their weapons to Coorg. Tipu's batteries were taken and there was confusion among Tipu's troops during that nightly encounter. According to Moegling, 5000 Coorgs, who had been carried away by Tippu with their wives and children, altogether 12,000 souls, made their escape and returned to their native country (Coorg). These Kodava Muslim converts remained Muslims as they could not be reconverted to Hinduism, even if they had so desired. Their descendants, many of them now inter-married with the Mappilas and Bearys, are known as Kodava Maaple and constitute a very small minority in modern Kodagu. In spite of their change in faith, they maintained their original Kodava clan names and dress habits and speak Kodava language, although now they do follow some Mappila‚ÄìBeary customs also. Arabic and Persian Inscriptions Record The treatment of the prisoners of Tippu Sultan's Coorg and Mangalore campaigns is recorded in the Arabic and Persian inscriptions on the south wall of the mosque at Seringapatam, dated 1787 AD Inscriptions (Arabic) (Persian) English Translation God Almighty hath said :‚Äî\\"And he caused such of those who have received tho Scriptures, and assisted the confederates, to come down out of their fortresses, and he cast into their hearts terror and dismay: a part of them you slew, and a part you made captives ; and God caused you to inherit their land, and their houses, and their wealth, and a land on which you had not trodden; for God is Almighty.\\" After the flight of the infidels it was ordered that war should be continued with the Bani Khuraiza,^ as they had assisted the confederates, breaking their league with the Muslims. The Muslim army besieged them for fifteen days and nights and reduced them to distress. They came down at the order given them by Saad bin Maaz, who adjudged that the males should be put to the sword, the women and children made slaves, and their goods divided among the Muslims. The Prophet (the blessing and peace of God be on him !) addressing Saad, said, \\"0 Saad Maaz‚Äîyou have pronounced that which the Most High had ordered above the seven skies.\\" God refers to this event when He says that He brought them out of their fortresses as they had assisted the confederates and protected them. These were believers in the Old Testament, namely, Jews. God cast into their hearts terror of the Prophet and his army, and those who were killed numbered between seven and nine hundred, and their women and children were made slaves. You inherited their land, gardens, fields and houses, their fortified places, and their property consisting of money and cattle. All these were given you by God. And this saying likewise applies to the Kliaiber, to Turkey, or to Persia. It is also spoken in order that whatever country the Muslims may hereafter be in possession of, until the last day, may also be included in the above passage. God is almighty.

Dhara was born on 2 March 1911 in Tikarampur (near Tamluk) in Mahisadal in the present Purba Medinipur district into a Hindu family. He was involved in political activities from his school days. He completed his education from Vidyasagar College in 1937. Later, in 1940, he participated in the Satyagraha movement of Gandhi. In August 1942 he played the lead role in launching an anti-British movement in undivided Midnapore. The movement helped to free Tamralipta from British rule and a free government was formed in this region on 17 December 1942. Vidyut Bahini, of the parallel Government of Tamluk was also commanded by him. As a member of Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar, which is better known as Tamralipta National Government, formed during the 1942 August Movement, Dhara held the portfolios of War and Home. During the period of British governance, Dhara spent 12 years and 4 months in prison. After independence of India, Dhara won several elections, which included the Mahishadal seat of West Bengal Assembly in 1962, 1967 and 1969. In 1962, he was the winner of the Assembly poll as a Congress candidate. He also created the Bangla Congress in 1966. In 1967, Prafulla Sen was defeated at Arambagh by another Gandhian Ajoy Mukherjee, who became chief minister of West Bengal after Prafulla Chandra Sen. Architect of Ajoy Mukherjee's victory at Arambagh was Narayan Ch Ghosh the then student's leader there. Dhara had inspired students of Arambagh unfolding his image as commander of Vidyut Bahini. In 1967, he had won the poll as a candidate of Bangla Congress. He also served the state government as Industry and Commerce Minister. He had published a book titled Ken ei banya written by Narayan Ch Ghosh for circulation in the lower Damudar basin. Reading noted book people there were very much agitated and took effective role against Congress. Later, Ajoy Mukherjee with some of his closest colleagues, such as Pranob Mukherjee, joined Indian National Congress leaving Dhara - his long term associates. Ajoy Mukherjee had pushed Pranab Mukherjee to be State Minister in the Indian Cabinet. In 1977, from the Tamluk constituency, Dhara was elected to the Lok Sabha as a candidate of the Janata Party. Dhara stepped back from politics in the 1980s and involved himself in social work. He died on 28 January 2011, at the age of 100, owing to prolonged sickness.

It is a brick house in the Greek Revival architectural style built in two different stages in the mid-19th century. It shows the strong influence of Minard Lafever, a prominent contemporary practitioner of the style, although its own architect is not known. For many years it was owned by descendants of Sanford E. Church, a local politician who was prominent statewide. Since 1930 it has been the headquarters of the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). In 2002 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The Tousley-Church House is located in an lot on the northeast corner of North Main and Linwood Avenue, in the section of the village of Albion north of the Erie Canal (now part of the New York State Barge Canal), in the Town of Gaines. The terrain is level. The surrounding neighborhood is residential, with most houses dating to the late 19th or early 20th centuries. Mature trees on the front lawn provide shade. A narrow sandstone walk leads from the sidewalk on North Main to the house's main entrance. An unpaved parking area in the rear is accessed through a curb cut on Linwood. Exterior The house, the only building on the property, consists of three sections, a main block and south wing, both brick, and a frame rear wing to the east. The main block is a one-and-a-half-story structure on a fieldstone foundation with an ashlar limestone water table. The brick above is laid in common bond. It rises to a wide wooden frieze below the hipped roof surfaced in bitumen, pierced by four brick chimneys near the corners. In the southerly two of the three bays on the west (front) facade, the windows are set off by plain stone sills and lintels with black wooden louvered shutters. The wide frieze is topped with a dentil molding topped by bead and reel molding. Above the windows are grilles in the shape of Greek keys with hinged windows behind them. The north bay has a small projecting portico sheltering the main entrance. The steps leading up to it and its deck are made of large gray limestone blocks. Wide cheek walls on either side of the stairs have a quarter-round profile following the steps' fall line to identical square stone pedestals topped with cap blocks, currently holding large flower pots, identical to the plinth blocks underneath the two wooden fluted Ionic columns supporting the portico's hipped roof. It has an elaborate entablature with cornice, frieze, dentilled taenia and architrave. The gutter is surrounded on three sides by a gutter with acroteria topped with an anthemion. Two engaged pilasters with Tuscan capitals support the roof at the rear. The south wing is only one story in height, but has similar treatments to the main block, with less decoration. A full porch spans the west facade, where a secondary entrance is located in the middle of its three bays. It is also floored in gray limestone with similar steps, but is supported by Doric columns, backed at the wall by similarly treated pilasters, with a plain frieze. A three-sided bay projects from the south wall. On the east, the one-and-a-half-story frame wing's foundation has been partially replaced by stone-faced concrete block and stuccoed over. The stairs to its entrances on the south and east are also concrete. A small gabled canopy is over the east door. Its windows are smaller than those on the rest of the house. The roofline has a boxed cornice with raking fasciae. Interior The main entrance, framed by square pilasters, sidelights and a transom with a pattern of repeating semicircles set in a rectangular border, holds a stained and varnished door with recessed panels decorated in a leaf-and-dart pattern. It opens into an entrance hall with a switchback stair, its open stringers decorated with a scroll relief. The newel at the base consists of a square bottom with a round turned post carved in an acanthus leaf relief pattern. It is capped in a carved acanthus scroll. Narrow turned balusters support the handrail, and four Doric columns support the landing and upper run. The windows in the entrance hall have wide casings with backband trim, shouldered architraves and thick cap moldings. A large plaster ceiling medallion, with a floral rosette including two strings of striated petals inside a ring of alternating acanthus and small rosettes, holds an acorn-globe light fixture on a chain. At the rear of the entrance hall is a former bedroom. Its fireplace has a black marble Italianate mantel and cast iron firebox. South of the entrance hall is a large room with 11-foot-9-inch () ceiling occupying the rest of the main block. It is elaborately decorated as well, starting with a one-foot (30 cm) three-member molded baseboard running around the room's entire perimeter. The door and window surrounds are more detailed than the ones in the entrance hall. Their architraves have a regularly spaced row of rosettes, and their cap moldings have a scroll relief surrounded by freestanding anthemia. The architraves' rosette motif is repeated on the black marble mantel, with a cast iron surround inside it done in reed-and-tie molding. Three more acorn-globe light fixtures hang from the ceiling by chains. The second floor has three large rooms with sloped plaster ceilings, following that of the roof above. A paneled double door connects to another large room in the south wing. It has a lower ceiling and more restrained decoration ‚Äî the window and surrounds are a flat casing with molded backband A Colonial Revival fireplace with exposed brick mantel is in the center wall of the projecting bay. The east wing contains the kitchen and a woodshed. It has seven-foot () plaster ceilings with walls finished in rough plaster. On the east wall is an early 19th-century cooking fireplace and baking oven with wooden Federal style mantel. The oven is behind two wooden doors. The doors have narrow casings with beaded Federal style backbands. There is a small pantry in the northeast corner. The woodshed, on the east, has an earthen floor below the kitchen's floor level. History John Lee, a resident of nearby Barre who came north for the business opportunities presented by the canal, built what is today the south and rear wings around 1840. The kitchen fireplace and oven, woodshed, and the door and window casings reflecting the transition between the Federal and Greek Revival styles are the most prominent remnants of this house. In 1848 he and his wife sold the house, then on a lot, to Orson Tousley. A son of one of the county's earliest settlers, Tousley had run a tavern in Clarendon until 1837, when he began speculating in real estate and pursuing various other business ventures, including the contract for widening the canal through the county and some of the early railroad construction in the area. He served in several public offices in Clarendon, including town supervisor around the time he bought the house. In the next decade he enlarged and renovated the house, adding the new main block. The previous main block, now the south wing, was converted to a hipped roof to harmonize with the larger portion. Like most of those made affluent by the canal and its business in the area, he embraced the newly popular Greek Revival style. In particular Tousley's alterations and new construction, with its intricate and elaborate decoration both inside and out, show the influence of Minard Lafever and his pattern books of the time. Tousley died in 1863, leaving the house to his young daughter Florence. Three years later she married George Church, son of Sanford E. Church, former lieutenant governor and chief of New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals. George himself would serve as deputy superintendent of insurance and deputy state treasurer. The Churches only major change to the house was the addition of the projecting bay on the south wing's south wall, around 1870. Florence Church lived into her eighties, becoming one of the 25 founding members of the local Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) chapter when it was established in 1925, serving as its regent. She died shortly thereafter, and bequeathed the house to her son Sanford T. Church, who had gone into the law and served as a judge locally for many years. He and his wife, also named Florence, sold the house to Emma Reed Webster in 1929 for $2,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) more than the small mortgage remaining on it. They stipulated that the extra money would be donated to the Orleans DAR, and the county historical society, to start an endowment in the Church family name. Two months later Webster, who was not a member of the chapter and later moved to Utica, donated the house to the DAR. To adapt it for use as an organizational building, she paid for the installation of central heating and carpeting to conceal the concrete floors she had poured, the removal of an exterior woodshed and other outbuildings once shown on the map, the addition of the fireplace and chimney in the south wing bay, and the combination of the five rooms in the main block and south wing into two large meeting spaces. She also gave the chapter furniture including a hundred chairs, and an electric range in the kitchen. When she died she also left the chapter an endowment. There have been no other alterations to the house since, and it has remained the local DAR chapter's building.

Mr John Hyacinth Power: 1884-1964. In Hart, R. (ed) 2007. Chapters from the past: 100 years of the McGregor Museum, 1907-2007. Kimberley: McGregor Museum Born in Waterford, Ireland on 2 November 1884, Power emigrated to South Africa in 1904 to take up a post as school master at Kimberley's Christian Brothers‚Äô College (now known as St Patrick's College). From 1920 he headed the South African School of Mines (later the Northern Cape Technical College). Early association with the McGregor Museum  Although Power would succeed Maria Wilman as museum director only in 1947, his close association with the museum began at the time of its inception in 1907. From 1917, moreover, he became the museum's honorary curator of reptiles and amphibians, herpetology being the field in which he achieved wide renown as a regional specialist. He had been encouraged in this direction by Dr Louis P√©ringuey, Director of the South African Museum in Cape Town. The first of some forty publications he wrote in various fields appeared in the Annals of the South African Museum in 1913. Amongst the specimens he collected are type specimens that are housed at the McGregor Museum, including Bufo poweri which was named in his honour. He also collected enthusiastically in other fields of museum science, notably archaeology, being one of the most prolific donors in this field over many decades. A major Acheulean site on the farm of Pniel on the Vaal River near Kimberley is known as ‚ÄúPower‚Äôs Site‚Äù. Director of the McGregor Museum in Kimberley Power succeeded Wilman as Director of the McGregor Museum in 1947 and oversaw major expansion and changes in the administration of the institution during the decade that he was at the helm. These included the erection of a new building across the road from the original McGregor Museum, made possible by a generous donation by the daughter of Alexander and Margaret McGregor, Helen Jessie Crawford. De Beers lent its support as well. Here Power was responsible for a set of state-of- the-art natural history dioramas, constructed with the help of artist Nellie Steenkamp. Just months before his retirement in 1958 the Cape Provincial Administration took on the McGregor Museum as a Province-Aided institution, providing an annual grant for the running of the museum, and paying the salaries of its still small staff at public service levels. The Board of Trustees continued to run the museum as it had from the start, but was now able to look to the appointment of extra professional staff. For instance, Dr Gerhard Jurgen Fock was appointed at the McGregor Museum in 1958 as South Africa's first professional full-time museum archaeologist. Fellowships Power was recognized for his contributions to science by being made a Fellow of the Royal Society of South Africa, in 1931. In the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London. He was also a Fellow of the Linnaean Society.

They were subjected to forcible conversions to Islam, death, and torture. The Nairs were treated with extreme brutality due to their strong adherence to the Hindu faith and martial tradition. The captivity ended when Nair troops from Travancore defeated Tipu in the Third Anglo-Mysore War. It is estimated that out of the 30,000 Nairs put to captivity (including women and children), only a few hundred returned to Malabar alive. North Malabar was divided into the Nair principalities of Chirakkal, Kadattanad, Kottayam, Kurangod and the Moplah principality of Cannanore which owed nominal allegiance to Chirakkal. South Malabar was divided between the Zamorin of Calicut and the Raja of Cochin. Nairs under Hyder Ali The period of Sultan of Mysore Hyder Ali conquest of Malabar between 1766 and 1793 was met with stiff opposition from the local Nairs. In 1766, he marched into Palakkad and Malabar, followed by another march into Malabar via Thamarassery ghat in 1767. Hyder quickly understood the Nair psyche and caste pride and decided to use it to facilitate conversions. To this end, he deprived Nairs of caste privileges, equating them to Paravas, prohibited them from carrying arms, and outlawed them. Furthermore, he offered privileges back to anybody who converted to Islam. This forced some Nairs and many members of the Hindu community to adopt Islam, and resulted in the first appearance of Islam in the Malabar countryside. Humiliated by these perceived slights imposed by the Sultan, the Nairs rose in rebellion. They harassed isolated block-houses set up by Hyder, raided, pillaged, and destroyed stores and munition dumps. Ayaz Khan was a Nair from Chirakkal who had been taken prisoner by Hyder during the latter's Malabar campaign of 1766. He became a Muslim and was enlisted in the Asad-i-Ilahi (new converts) troops. Finding favour with Hyder Ali, in 1779 he became Governor of Chitaldroog and in 1782 of Bednur. The British approached him and he rejected their overtures, but after Hyder's death he agreed to support them and handed over Bednur to them. Nairs under Tipu Sultan Related Letters Tipu Sultan (1750‚Äì1799), the architect of the Seringapatam Captivity In his letter to the Governor of Bekal, Budruz Zaman Khan, in the year 1200 AH (1785 AD), Tipu approved of forced conversions of Nairs: In May of the same year, an order was sent to the Faujdar of Calicut, Arshad Ali Baig, pertaining to the treatment of a Nair dissident: Proclamation In 1788, Tipu issued a proclamation to the Nairs of Malabar, wherein he outlined his new scheme of social reform: His proclamation was met with widespread resentment and consequently, the Hindus of Malabar rose in rebellion. Due to fear 30,000 Brahmins fled to Travancore. The Kottayam and Kadattanand Rajas sought protection from the English East India Company. In November 1788, Tipu's forces attacked Calicut and captured the Karanavappad of Manjeri. Their assaults were met with resistance by the Nairs of Calicut and southern Malabar led by Ravi Varma and other princes of the Padinjare Kovilakam. Tipu set 6,000 troops under his French commander, M. Lally to raise the siege, but failed to defeat Ravi Varma. Captives The following year in 1789 Tipu sent Gulam Ali, Gaji Khan and Darvedil Khan with troops into Coorg by way of Siddhesvara. where they took up strong positions, seized grain, men, women and children while burning houses that they pillaged. They set fire to the Padinalkanadu temple. Later the 'Maleyalam' (Malabar region) people joined the Coorgs. Tipu sent Gulam Ali into Malabar but en route Gulam was attacked by the Coorgs. Gulam managed to reach Malabar where he burnt down the Payyavur temple and attacked that region. That same year (1789), when Tipu was marching against the Nairs at Calicut who had become rebellious, he heard of another rebellion in Coorg. He sent a force towards Coorg under Burhan ud Din and Sayed Hamid. Tipu himself crossed the Tamarasseri(Tamrachadi) Ghat and entered Malabar region. There he ordered some of the inhabitants to be converted (made Asadulai), placed Officer Ghafar in command there and had a wooden fort or stockade built. Tipu had halted in the Malabar to enforce his proclamation. General orders were issued to his army that 'every being in the district without distinction should be burned, that they should be traced to their lurking places, and that all means of truth and falsehood, force or fraud should be employed to effect their universal conversion'. The Raja of Cherkal (Chirakkal, Kannur) fled to Tellicherry but when he was intercepted he killed himself. Then his body was dragged round the camp and hung from a tree. Tipu besieged the Kadattanad Raja's fortified palace at Kuttipuram, and 2,000 Nairs‚Äîforced to surrender after a resistance of several days. Several Rajas and wealthy land owners fled to Travancore, where the Dharma Raja helped them to rehabilitate themselves in their new surroundings. On the other hand, Nairs retreated into the jungles where they engaged in guerrilla warfare against the invading Mysorean army. Tipu further organised a regular and systematic hunt for Nairs. He then proceeded to Cannanore and after celebrating the marriage of his son with the daughter of the Ali Raja, marched along the coast of Chowghat. He then made arrangements for the administrative reorganisation of the province, and retired to Coimbatore, leaving a permanent occupying force to frighten and subjugate the local population.

It was the terminus of the Bexhill West branch of the Hastings Line. It was opened by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway and was operated by the Southern Region of British Railways on closing. The station building still survives as an antiques house. The trackbed and site of the now demolished platforms are now occupied by commercial industrial buildings. History A branch line was ceremonially opened between Crowhurst and Bexhill on 31 May 1902 by the nominally independent Crowhurst, Sidley & Bexhill Railway Company which had been promoted by the Earl De La Warr together with other local businessmen and landowners. The line had the backing of the South Eastern Railway which ran services to the nearby and St Leonards stations. The branch would offer a quicker route to Bexhill than that already provided by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway whose own Bexhill station on the Hastings to Brighton line had opened more than fifty years earlier. The new Bexhill terminus would be from , while the LB&SCR;'s station was from Victoria. The branch was absorbed by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway in 1905. The new Bexhill station was situated in a valley on the west side of Bexhill which had not yet been developed. It was approached by a new road named \\"Terminus Road\\" to distinguish it from the \\"Station Road\\" which served the LB&SCR;'s station. A lavish station building was constructed which reflected the SER's ambitions for the line. Designed by C.S. Barry and C.E. Mercer, it was built of yellow and red brick and Bath Stone dressing. Welsh slate was used on the roof which is crowned by a clocktower, and the main entrance features a block-moulded pediment which was carved in situ. The symmetrical building comprised a large and airy booking hall, ticket and parcels offices, a waiting room and ladies toilet, as well as the stationmaster's and inspector's offices. At a right angle to the building stands a smaller block which contained a refreshment room, gents' toilet, porters' and lamp rooms.Harding, P., pp. 23-24. Two and island platforms were provided, those to the east (nos. 1 and 2) covered by a glass canopy extending to a distance of and also covering the concourse between the tracks and building. The uncovered platforms 3 and 4 were rarely used; platform 4 never in fact received any track and platform 3 was soon covered by grass. A glass canopy also coThe station buildings were lit by electricity, whereas the platforms by gas. A goods depot was opened on London Road opposite the York Hotel, where a brick shed measuring by was erected. Despite the shorter route to London and the impressive station buildings, passengers continued to prefer the LB&SCR;'s more centrally-located station. In 1917, the Railway Executive Committee ordered the closure of the branch from January 1917. Although goods services began again from November 1917, full passenger services were not restored until March 1919. The 1923 grouping led to the SE&CR; becoming part of the Southern Railway which renamed the LB&SCR; station \\"Bexhill Central\\" whilst the SER's station became simply \\"Bexhill\\" and finally \\"Bexhill West\\" in November 1929.Course, E. (1974), p. 202. The Southern arranged for most main line services through to include three corridor coaches for Bexhill West to avoid the need to change trains, but this still failed to tempt passengers on to the branch. In 1930, consultants engaged by Bexhill Town Council recommended the construction of a link line between the two lines, but nothing came of this nor of the proposal in 1937 to electrify the line at the same time as the Hastings Line. Although now very much referred to as a branch, the line temporarily took on main line status when services on the Hastings Line were temporarily diverted to Bexhill West between 27 November 1949 and 5 June 1950 while Bo-peep tunnel was closed for partial reconstruction. Emergency bus services ran from Crowhurst to St Leonards, Hastings and Bexhill West. Services on the East Coastway Line terminated at . The line's push-pull trains were replaced in June 1958 by two- car diesel-electric units which connected with the London to Hastings diesel- electric units at Crowhurst. Sunday services were withdrawn from January 1960. The line's demise was confirmed by its inclusion in the Beeching Report, and it finally closed to all traffic from 15 June 1964.Harding, P., pp. 16-17. Present day The track was lifted in 1965 and the bridge over Down Road and Little Common Road demolished in 1967. Bexhill West station building has survived and is now occupied by Eras of Style antiques. The adjoining former refreshment rooms are now a pub and restaurant, and the engine shed forms part of the light industrial estate now occupying the former trackbed to the rear of the station.White, H.P.

It is a Greek Revival style home built between 1830 and 1833 alongside the Erie Canal. It has an unusual structural system consisting of stacked horizontal wooden planks, similar to that used by the contemporaneous Benjamin Franklin Gates House in Barre. It remains mostly intact today. In 2008 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Buildings and grounds The house is located on a 10-acre (4 ha) lot on the east side of Fruit where it bends westward at the canal and becomes Dublin Road. It is roughly one mile (1.6 km) west of Medina, midway between the village and the Niagara County line. To the south of the house, on an embankment along the north bank of the canal, is the Canal Trailway, a public path for pedestrians and bicyclists on the canal's former towpath. Across the canal is Telegraph Road (NY 31E), the main route between Medina and Middleport to the west. Other houses are across Fruit Avenue, slightly to the north. Around the house are mature maple and locust trees. There are large lawns in front and back; a driveway leads back to Fruit from the north (rear) of the house. In the woods to the northeast is an old smokehouse, considered a contributing resource to the house's historic character. The remainder of the property is wooded, with pines joining the hardwoods. Most of the surrounding area is wooded, giving way to worked fields to the north and east. The house itself has a two-story, three-bay main block with wings on either side. All sections are sided in clapboard and have asphalt roofs. The main block and two-story east wing have hipped roofs; the one-and-a-half-story west wing is gabled. A small gabled garage wing projects north from the east wing. Its structural system is referred to variously as horizontal-plank frame, stacked plank or plank-to-plank. The clapboard is affixed to layers of planks stacked solid. Usually planks were used, staggered to form a plaster key (fastening). They are spiked or pegged together at the corners, windows, doors and other spaces. At the corners of the south (front) facade, wooden Doric pilasters, their capitals starting at the architrave line created by the simple wooden lintels on the second-story windows, frame the building. Above the windows is a wide frieze where paired brackets support overhanging eaves. Both wings have hipped-roof full-length porches. They are supported by hand-turned Doric columns with molded capitals. The east wing roofline is also bracketed. The main entrance is in the easternmost of the three bays. It is surrounded by a paneled enframement with an eared entablature that goes to the sill of the window above. Inside two pilasters frame the door and its long vertical sidelights. Above their decorated crosspiece is a transom. The door opens into the main block's central hallway. To its south is the main stair with a simple handrail and balustrade. Two large parlors are to the west. The west wing's first floor is given over to the living room; the east is the kitchen wing. On the second story are four bedrooms and a bathroom. The west wing's bedroom has a vaulted ceiling. Wide plank pine floors are used all over the house. All original finishes are of carved cucumber tree wood. The door and window surrounds are simple molded shouldered architraves and the baseboards are wide molded planks. History Christopher Servoss came west with his family from Montgomery County in the early 1820s to capitalize on the opportunities created by the canal. He bought from the Holland Land Company, including the current parcel, and built a log cabin. In 1830, with the help of carpenters and masons who had worked on the canal, he began building the house for him, his family and his second wife. It was finished by 1833. Why they used the unusual horizontal-plank system, generally found elsewhere in the Northeast and in neighboring areas of Canada, is not known. It was believed to retain heat better and protect against wind gusts in the harsh winters the region was known for. Since they required less skill and more material to build than regular timber frame houses, they may have been well-suited for newly settled areas where skilled carpenters and joiners were not available but where wood and the sawmills to process it were abundant. Combinations of both these theories may have motivated the Servosses. The direct access to lumber in large quantities via the canal may have made it even more economical. For over a hundred years the house remained with Servoss's descendants. Very few alterations were made, although the lot was gradually subdivided and sold off. In 1940, it was sold out of the family. After several other owners, it passed in 1952 to its present owners, who have been active in restoring and preserving it.

Shortly before it convened, the iconophile Patriarch Nikephoros I was deposed by Emperor Leo V the Armenian in favour of the iconoclast Theodotos I. Theodotos presided over the council, which reinstated iconoclasm, repudiating the Second Council of Nicaea and reaffirming the decisions of the Council of Hieria of 754. Although the meeting had been convened at the behest of the iconoclast Emperor, much of the Iconoclast effort was driven by other clerics, including the later patriarchs Antony I and John VII.

Len was born on 27 February 1899 at St Roy's Road, Tottenham N17. His father, Thomas Hughes, was a general labourer and his mother was Ellen Hughes. On 19 July 1915, Len started a 5-year apprenticeship to Edmund Henry Matthew of D. Matthew & Son, Tariff Road, Tottenham as a Journeyman Brushmaker. He did not complete the apprenticeship, as he was conscripted to the army in 1917. He was probably sent to the training battalion of his county regiment for basic military training. In February 1918, Len was transferred to the Machine Gun Corps (MGC). After six weeks specialist training and short leave, he was posted overseas in April 1918. In France, he was allocated to joint 24th Battalion MGC, a uni of 800 men fielding 64 Vickers machine guns, which was the machine gun element of the 24th Division. on 14 May 1918, Len was hospitalised in 7th (Canadian) General Hospital at Etaples with PUO, commonly known as Trench Fever. He was later wounded (believed to be gassed) and was awarded the British War and Victory Medals. He was released from the army 15 February 1919. He married Edith Elizabeth Lomax (1900 - 1982) on 18 September 1921 and they had one child, Winifred Joan Hughes, who died in 1983. Len was an able all-round sportsman and, as a professional footballer, was employed through the 1920s & much of the 1930s, which enabled him to support his family during the depression whilst many others struggled. However, this was at a very modest level and during his time playing for first division Burnley, the family lived in back- to-back millworkers' houses. Nothing like the palatial living of top-flight footballers of today, but secure by comparison with many of his contemporaries. During the football season, Len and his family lived in the town he played for, but during the summer they often returned to Tottenham. After retiring from professional football, Len became a school caretaker and groundsman, working for Rowland Hill School, Tottenham and lived at the cottage in the grounds. A cigarette smoker throughout his life, Len contracted lung cancer, which became systemic and he died at the Cottage on 19 August 1958.

After trials, the Blackburn Ripon was preferred, though the Harrow played a significant role in the development of automatic slots. Development In early 1924 the Air Ministry specification 21/23 was issued, calling for a two-seat replacement for the Blackburn Dart capable of acting as a torpedo or conventional bomber over short ranges as well as having 12-hour reconnaissance capability. The Harrow, initially known as the Type E but retrospectively as the H.P.31 when the company introduced numerical designations in 1924, was Handley Page's tender. They were successful, receiving an order to build two prototypes. The Harrow was essentially a single-bay biplane, though there was an additional pair of interplane struts at the extremities of the centre section. The wings had the same span and constant chord and neither sweep nor stagger. Both upper and lower wings had outboard ailerons and inboard flaps, the latter ending at the centre section. Both wings also had leading edge slats along their full length. The outer sections of these were linked to downward movement of the ailerons and the inner sections to the flaps. The lower wing was flat but the upper carried 4.5o of dihedral so the gap increased quite noticeably along the span. As usual with carrier-borne aircraft, the wings folded at the centre section. The wings were fabric-covered; one difference between the two prototypes was that the second had metal wing spars, another that its slats could be operated independently. It was powered by a single water-cooled Napier Lion engine, initially a 470 hp (350 kW) mark V, mounted as low in the nose as airscrew ground clearance allowed so that the top of the fuselage could fall away in front of the cockpit for the best views during high-incidence carrier landings. There was a front-mounted radiator immediately beneath the propeller shaft. The pilot sat below the upper wing just behind the rear spar and with a cutout for visibility. The observer/gunner's position was close behind the pilot for ease of communication, since he had to do the work of navigation on long flights away from the carrier that had been traditionally assigned to a third crew member. Behind them the fabric-covered fuselage carried a conventional tail with horn-balanced control surfaces, though the incidence of the whole tailplane could also be adjusted. The Harrow had to have a clear space below the fuselage to allow torpedo dropping. The main legs were attached to the front spar at the ends of the centre section, and pairs of bracing struts ran from the stub axles to the lower fuselage longerons. Snap link hooks were fitted to the inner ends of the axles to engage with the longitudinal arrester wires of the time. The specification required that the land undercarriage could be replaced rapidly with floats. These were long, single stepped and fitted with water rudders, built by Short Brothers. Second prototype The first flight of the Harrow was made by Hubert Broad on 24 April 1926. A number of minor issues emerged from the early flying programme, but one consistent theme was that of engine overheating. By the end of May the Harrow was taking off and landing on HMS Furious as part of the specification competition. It went to RAF Martlesham Heath for further Air Ministry specification tests late in August. In December it was replaced there by the second prototype which had first flown on 30 October 1924. By the spring of 1927 it was clear that the Blackburn Ripon was preferred, and in June the second prototype was returned to Handley Page rather than going forward to the seaplane trials, chiefly because of its persistent overheating. Nonetheless, Handley Page gained funding for a Harrow Mk II using a more powerful Napier Lion XI engine producing 530 hp (395 kW) in the first prototype airframe. This engine was housed in a slimmer, more pointed cowling with a semi-circular cross-section radiator under the nose. At the same time drag was reduced and rudder and elevator lightness improved by lowering the rear fuselage decking and with it the gunner's position. Later in the summer a Lion XA was fitted, together with a larger, square radiator. Further modifications to the Mk II followed with the addition of dihedral to both wings, a slimmer nose and retractable side radiators like those on its competitor, the Ripon II. There were further modifications to flaps and slots before the aircraft went back to Martlesham to compete against the Ripon II and the Avro Buffalo II, performing torpedo dropping trials before going to Felixstowe as a floatplane. Here it proved unsatisfactory, suffering water spray damage, and was written off charge in August 1928. During the late summer of 1927 the second prototype had been involved in continuing the series of Air Ministry tests of slats previously conducted on the Hendon III. It used the latest version of automatic wingtip slats and was hailed as a great success and a sure defence against the inadvertent spin. It was retired at the end of September.

He was given the sobriquet Morotheodoros (ŒúœâœÅŒøŒ∏ŒµœåŒ¥œâœÅŒøœÇ) meaning \\"Theodore the Fool\\", by the Greek chroniclers after his repeated failed usurpations. First usurpation In circa 1188, Theodore, likely already the ruler of his native Philadelphia, secured the allegiance of the larger part of the city's inhabitants, but also of the surrounding areas of Lydia and the support of the Armenian communities in the Troad. He then proclaimed himself emperor in opposition to Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185‚Äì1195 and 1203‚Äì1204), and even minted his own silver coinage... As the revolt gained ground, its progress alarmed Isaac so much that the emperor marched against Theodore in person. After some initial skirmishes, Theodore was besieged in Philadelphia (June 1189), but then Isaac learned of the rapid approach of the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa (r. 1155‚Äì1190) who was on his way to take part in the Third Crusade. This made Isaac anxious to conclude the war against Theodore, and so he agreed to pardon Mangaphas, on the condition that the usurper submitted himself to Isaac and agreed to lay aside the imperial symbols and surrender hostages. He was then allowed to retain control of Philadelphia as its governor.. In circa 1193 (or possibly 1190), however, Basil Vatatzes, the doux of the Thracesian theme and megas domestikos of the Byzantine army, forced him to flee to the court of the Seljuk Turks at Iconium. There, the Sultan Ghƒ´yƒÅth al-Dƒ´n Kaykhusraw (r. 1192‚Äì1196 and 1205‚Äì1211) allowed Theodore to enroll troops among the nomadic tribes, and with these bands he ravaged the frontier lands of the Byzantine Empire in 1195‚Äì1196. In late 1196, the new emperor, Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195‚Äì1203), bought Mangaphas from the sultan, on condition that his life was to be spared, and that he would not spend the rest of his life in prison. He remained in prison for an unknown period of time before he was released (at any rate before 1204) and returned to Philadelphia. Second usurpation In the chaos of the Fourth Crusade and the eventual fall of Constantinople in 1204, a number of individuals took advantage of the situation to proclaim themselves independent or lay claim to the vacant imperial throne. Mangaphas may have returned to Philadelphia before or after the fall of the city, and quickly re-established his dominant position there, founding an independent state in the area. After securing Philadelphia, he decided to take on Henry of Flanders, one of the Crusader chieftains and future Latin Emperor (r. 1206‚Äì1216), who was encamped at Adramyttium and who was attempting to crush the remaining Byzantine resistance in Anatolia. Although he managed to take Henry by surprise, his forces were no match for the Latin heavy cavalry and were crushed at the Battle of Adramyttium on 19 March 1205.. Retreating back to Philadelphia, he remained there until his remaining territories were overrun by Theodore Laskaris of Nicaea in 1205. Nothing more is heard of him, and it is presumed that he died in captivity in the Nicaean court. Surname Theodore's surname, Mangaphas, is not Greek, and represents perhaps a Hellenized form of the Turkish mankafa meaning fool or idiot. It is hence possible that it was not his actual surname, but a translation into Turkish of his Greek sobriquet Morotheodoros, which then was adopted by the later Greek chroniclers. There is, however, also evidence for the existence of other members of the Mangaphas family in the 11th and 13th centuries independently of Theodore. In addition, a number of silver coins found in a hoard in Aphrodisias, and which is commonly attributed to Mangaphas, seems to include \\"M[angaphas]\\" as if it were his proper surname.

Ameliaranne books This series of 20 children's books was published between 1920 and 1950 by George G. Harrap of London. It was unusual as it involved eight different individual authors working with a single illustrator. Ameliaranne Stiggins was the oldest daughter of a poor washerwoman, Mrs Stiggins who also had five other children. There is no mention in the Ameliaranne cannon of a \\"Mr Stiggins\\". The stories are simple tales of a young girl faced with a new or difficult situation that requires her to use some imagination and ingenuity to resolve. The books are remarkably consistent, given their different (all female) authors, but their real strength and the source of their lasting appeal are the charming illustrations by Susan B Pearce. The text is quite limited in the books and the narrative is largely carried by the very effective and expressive illustrations. The following Ameliaranne books were all published by George G. Harrap, London. Most were reprinted, some with alternative titles. *Ameliaranne and the Green Umbrella by Constance Heward (1920) *Ameliaranne keeps Shop by Constance Heward (1928) *Ameliaranne, Cinema Star by Constance Heward (1929) *Ameliaranne in Town by Natalie Joan (1930) *Ameliaranne at the Circus by Margaret Gilmour (1931) *Ameliaranne and the big Treasure by Natalie Joan (1932) *Ameliaranne's Prize Package by Eleanor Farjeon (1933) *Ameliaranne's Washing Day by Eleanor Farjeon (1934) *Ameliaranne at the Seaside by Margaret Gilmour (1935) *Ameliaranne at the Zoo by K.L.

Biography Gompertz was born into a large and wealthy family of London diamond merchants, the fifth son of his father Solomon Barent Gompertz's (1729 ‚Äì ) second marriage. Being Jewish, Gompertz and his siblings were not allowed to attend university and instead received an informal education. Gompertz was a vegan and opposed to humans intentionally using animals for human interests in any way. He refused to wear leather or silk and declined to ride in coaches due to the suffering of the horses.Preece, Rod. (2011). Animal Sensibility and Inclusive Justice in the Age of Bernard Shaw. UBC Press. p. 207. He was the inventor of a multitude of inventions‚Äîincluding the expanding chuck‚Äîmainly designed to reduce animal suffering. In 1821, Gompertz invented an improved velocipede, an early form of bicycle. His machine was powered by pulling on the steering handles, which drove a rack and pinion mechanism, which in turn rotated the front wheel.See:  * He was one of the founding members for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals, attending its inaugural meeting in 1824. He published his first book: Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes, in the same year, which covered his ethical views on animals.For the SPCA and the 1824 publication, see Nash, Roderick (1989). The Rights of Nature: A History of Environmental Ethics. University of Wisconsin Press, p. 223. Gompertz acted as the SPCA's second Honorary Secretary, before resigning in 1833, after the governing committee objected to Gompertz's promotion of \\"Pythagorean doctrines\\", which held that the feelings of animals and humans were of equal value. The committee had created a resolution that limited membership in the SPCA to Christians. Since Gompertz was a Jew, he was forced to resign. Gompertz went on to found the Animals' Friend Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which he ran until 1846, after which he resigned to care for Ann, his terminally ill wife. The society was welcoming to evangelicals and Quakers. His wife died in 1847 and he spent the remainder of his life writing and speaking about animal rights and welfare and inventing. In 1852, he published his second book on animals Fragments in Defence of Animals. He died from bronchitis at his home in Kennington Oval, on 2 December 1861 and was buried in the graveyard of the local church.

Hill, USMC, Service #1,000,000 Jack Warner Hill (1928‚Äì1987) was a member of the United States Marine Corps who bears the distinction of holding Marine Corps enlisted service number one million (1,000,000).National Personnel Records Center, Military Operations Branch, \\"Service number index and registry of retired, deceased, and discharged military personnel\\" (2007) Hill served a total of two enlistments in the Marine Corps, one during World War II, resulting in a discharge due to lying about this age upon enlistment (similar to Calvin Graham), and the other briefly before the outbreak of the Korean War. After his military service, Hill lived until 1987; where he was killed in an automobile accident.United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Freedom of Information Act Inquiry (May 2010) First induction and enlistment scandal Hill was issued his number upon induction into the Marine Corps on July 8, 1944, at the height of World War II and during a time period when the United States Marine Corps was heavily engaged in several bloody battles in the Pacific Ocean. The issuance of the one millionth Marine Corps service number was a sensation in the media and was reported by several major newspapers, including The New York Times.\\"One Millionth Marine Enlisted\\", The New York Times, July 10, 1944 Hill's induction into the Marines later became something of a scandal as it was revealed that the induction board which had drafted him had done so without a check into his background, based on verbal statements only from Hill and his parents. It was then discovered that Hill had made false statements to the induction board and was only sixteen at the time he was drafted. The Marine Corps quietly discharged him in December 1944 after only five months of service.\\"Selective Service Rolls\\", 1944, United States Selective Service System Second enlistment Hill reenlisted on October 17, 1946, now truly at eighteen years of age, and served three and a half years of duty before being discharged a second time in June 1950. During his second enlistment, he held his previous service number of one million, although the post-World War II media took little interest. Hill's final rank was that of Corporal and his only military decorations were the National Defense Service Medal (NDSM) and the World War II Victory Medal. Both of these medals were never presented to Hill during his service, but were considered \\"automatic\\" due to the time periods in which he served ‚Äì the World War II Victory Medal for service between 1941 and 1946 and the NDSM for service after June 27, 1950 during the era of the Korean War. Hill in fact only qualified for the National Defense Service Medal by three days of service as he was discharged on June 30, 1950. The One Millionth Marine Although Hill is cited in Marine Corps history as holding service number one million, the honor of actually holding the one millionth service number technically falls to #1,020,001 since Marine enlisted service numbers start at #20,001.National Personnel Records Center, Instruction Memo 1865.20E, \\"Service Number Information\\", 14 April 1988 The actual holder of the one millionth Marine enlisted service number was Private First Class Edgar Patrick Wibbenmeyer, who was issued #1,020,001 on 11 August 1945.United States Marine Corps Personnel Support Branch, Quantico, Freedom of Information Act Inquiry, August 2009 Even this claim is slightly dubious, however, since between 1920 and 1940, the Marine Corps left approximately forty thousand service numbers un-issued, meaning that the \\"true\\" one millionth service number would be slightly higher than #1,060,000. Hill was also never the one millionth Marine, as some of the newspapers referred to him by, since the Marine Corps had been in existence for over a century and a half before Hill's entry, with service number 1,000,000 simply the result of the service number system invented in 1920.

It was equipped with a swivel for easy rotation and was loaded by inserting a mug-shaped device called a chamber or breech block, filled with gunpowder and projectiles. It had a high rate of fire, as several chambers could be prepared in advance and quickly fired in succession and was especially effective in anti-personnel roles.

Brandes, T.B.G., LII (1910) The guns were loaded with mug-shaped chambers, in which gunpowder and projectile had been filled in advance. The chamber was then put in place, blocked with a wedge, and then fired. As the loading was made in advance and separately, breech- loading swivel guns were quick-firing guns for their time.Perrin, p. 29 An early description of a breech-loading swivel gun puts the weight of the gun at , equipped with three chambers for rotations, each in weight, and firing a lead shot.Turnbull p. 106 The guns had a disadvantage: they leaked and lost power around the chambers, but this was compensated by the high rate of fire as multiple chambers could be prepared in advance.Turnbull p. 105-106 Breech- loading swivel gun could fire either cannonballs against obstacles, or grapeshot against troops.Firearms: a global history to 1700 by Kenneth Warren Chase p.143 A Japanese breech-loading swivel gun of the time of the 16th century, obtained by ≈åtomo S≈çrin. This gun is thought to have been cast in Goa, Portuguese India. Caliber: , length: . Ming bronze cannon with open breech. During the Middle-Ages, breech-loading swivel guns were developed by the Europeans also partly as a cheaper alternative to the very expensive bronze cast muzzle-loading cannons, as bronze was many times more expensive than iron. As cast iron was not yet technologically feasible for the Europeans, the only possibility was to use wrought iron bars hammered together and held with hoops like barrels. With this method, a one piece design was very difficult, and a fragmental structure, with separated chamber and barrel was then selected.Firearms: a global history to 1700 by Kenneth Warren Chase p.143 Tudor Warships (1): Henry VIII's Navy Angus Konstam p.34 Gustavus Adolphus at Munich, 1632. Around 1500, Europeans learnt how to cast iron, and shifted their cannon productions to one-piece iron muzzle-loaders. China started to adopt European breech-loading swivel guns from 1500 onward, limiting at the same time the production of their own muzzle-loaders, because of the high effectiveness of the breech-loading swivel gun as an anti- personnel gun, which to them was more interesting than the sheer power of a cannonball.Firearms: a global history to 1700 by Kenneth Warren Chase p.143 Usage of the breech-loading swivel gun continued in Europe however, with, as early as the 17th century, characteristics very similar to the modern machine- gun or mitrailleuse.HISTORY AND DESCRIPTIVE GUIDE OF THE U.S. NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON COMPILED BY F.

Length of tiller: 315 mm. Widest part: 190 mm (at the base ring). alt= Breech-loading swivel guns were used to advantage at the bow and stern on warships, but were also used in fortifications.Perrin, p. 29 Breech loading cannons were used in Majapahit conquest (1336‚Äì1350). Prior to this, the Javanese acquired gunpowder technology from 1293 Mongol invasion.Song Lian. History of Yuan. The cannon is called Cetbang and can be configured as stationary gun or swivel gun, mounted on various vessels of Majapahit navy. At that time soldiers of other kingdoms in the Nusantara archipelago fought using melee weapons in an elevated platform in their ships called Balai, while also trying to board enemy vessels. Loaded with scattershot, the cetbang is very effective to counter this type of fighting. In China and Japan, breech-loading swivel guns were brought after China defeated the Portuguese in the 16th century. At the Battle of Xicaowan in 1522, after defeating the Portuguese in battle, the Chinese captured Portuguese breech-loading swivel guns and then reverse engineered them, calling them \\"Folangji\\" or \\"Fo-lang-chi\\" (‰ΩõÈÉéÊ©ü ‚Äì Frankish) guns, since the Portuguese were called \\"Folangji\\" by the Chinese. A shipwreck in 1523 apparently brought the gun to China, but the transmission may have occurred earlier.Turnbull p. 106 Views diverge on whether the origin of the cannon is Portuguese or Turkish. There was a confusion whether folangji was supposed to be the name of a people (the Portuguese) or name of a weapon. In fact the word folangji represent 2 different words with different etymology. The term folangji as a weapon is related to the prangi carried in Ottoman galleys and farangi used by Babur. The word folangji as an ethnonim (Frankish or Portuguese) is unrelated. The Ottoman prangi guns may have reached Indian ocean before either Ottoman or Portuguese ships did. In the History of the reign of Wan Li (Ëê¨Âé≤ÈáéÁç≤Á∑®), by Shen Defu, it is said that \\"After the reign of Hong Zhi (1445-1505), China started having Fu-Lang-Ji cannons, the country of which was called in the old times Sam Fu Qi\\". In volume 30 about \\"The Red- Haired Foreigners\\" he wrote \\"After the reign of Zhengtong (1436-1449) China got hold of Fu-Lang-Ji cannons, the most important magic instrument of foreign people\\". He mentioned the cannons some 60 or 70 years prior to the first reference about Portuguese. It was impossible for the Chinese to get hold of the Portuguese cannons prior to their arrival. Pelliot viewed that the folangji gun reached China before Portuguese did. Needham noted that breech- loading guns were already familiar in Southern China in 1510, as a rebellion in Huang Kuan was destroyed by more than 100 folangji. In Japan, ≈åtomo S≈çrin seems to have been the first recipient of the guns, possibly as early as 1551. In 1561 the Portuguese, allied with Otomo in the Siege of Moji, bombarded rival Japanese position, possibly with swivel guns. In the Battle of Takaj≈ç in 1587, ≈åtomo S≈çrin used two swivel guns obtained from the Portuguese. The guns were nicknamed .Turnbull p. 106 In the later portions of the Ming dynasty (mid 16th century onward) it appears that these type of guns were the most common and numerous type of artillery used by the Ming forces. a great deal of variation of such cannons were produced, and it appeared in pretty much all of the conflicts of this time, including the Imjin War. Until the introduction of heavy Dutch cannons in the early 17th century, there were even attempts by the Ming to make large heavy versions of such guns. Other countries also used swivel guns. In Bali, such a gun was found in the possession of the Raja of Badung, and is now located in the Bali Museum. Numerous such guns were also used in Northern Africa by Algerian rebels in their resistance to French forces.Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e, Paris. Breech-loading swivel guns were also used extensively in Southeast Asia as early as the 16th century, apparently even before the arrival of the Portuguese and Spanish there, and continued to be in use as a preferred anti-personnel weapon as late as the 20th century. The Americans fought Moros equipped with breech-loading swivel guns in the Philippines in 1904. In early 20th century, Chinese junks were armed with old- fashioned swivel guns, both muzzle-loader and breech-loader. The breech- loading guns were called \\"breech loading culverin\\" by Cardwell, they were long with bore. These guns were fired using percussion cap mechanism. Dyer c. 1930 noted the use of cannon by Makassan trepanger in Northern Australia, in particular the bronze breechloader with bore. Steel rifled breech-loading swivel guns are known which were manufactured by the United States towards the end of the 19th century, and used in colonial theaters such as in Madagascar.Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e exhibit Gallery File:Early breech loaders.jpg|Breech-loading swivel guns, 15-16th century.

The type genus is Dawsonoceras, named by Hyatt in 1883. Morphology Dawsonoceratidae are michelinocerids (Orthocerida) with the internal pattern of the Michelinoceratidae except that the siphuncle segments, which are generally tubular, are constricted at the septal foremina (the openings through with the siphuncular tissues pass). This feature is also found in Silurian Kionoceras, but less developed. Septal necks are short and generally recumbent. The type genus, Dawsonoceras and its close relative Dawsonocerina are further characterized by having orthoconic shells with conspicuous annulations, covered by transverse, scalloped or festooned lirae which in some are also longitudinal. Annulations consist of narrow encircling ribs that may be somewhat oblique, separated by generally wider areas in between Genera The Dawsonoceratidae comprise six known genera, Dawsonoceras, the type, Anaspyroceras, Calocyrtocerina, Dawsonocerina, Metaspyroceras, and Palaeodawsonocerina. Anaspyroceras, named by Shimizu and Obata (1935) and Metaspyroceras, named by Foeste (1932), were previously included in the orthoceratid subfamily Leuroceratinae, which is no longer considered a valid taxon, and reassigned to the Dawsonoceratidae. Anaspyroceras and Metaspyroceras differ from Flowers definition of the Dawsonoceratidae in that the septal necks are othochoanitic rather than recumbent and siphuncle segments are without noted constrictions. Calocyrtocerina, named by Chen (1981) was originally included in the Paraphragmitidae of Flower and K√ºmmel 1950.

It is located in Putrajaya's Precinct 3, opposite the Palace of Justice. Construction began since April 2004 and was fully completed on August 2009. It was officially opened by the 13th Yang di- Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin on 11 June 2010. The mosque was built to cater to approximately 24,000 residents including the government servants working around the city center as well as areas within Precincts 2, 3, 4 and 18. Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin Mosque's area is twice that of Putra Mosque, which is located 2.2 kilometres north. Features \\"Iron Mosque\\" at night. The \\"Iron Mosque\\" features a district cooling system, and fans or an air conditioning system. The mosque employs \\"architectural wire mesh\\" imported from Germany and China, which is also constructed at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium in Madrid and the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris. The main entrance is strengthened with glass reinforced concrete to increase the integrity of the structure and uses fine glass to create an illusion of a white mosque from afar. The path towards the mosque crosses a skyway known as the Kiblat Walk which stretches an area of 13,639 m¬≤. This skyway contains landscaping adapted from the ancient castles of Alhambra. The interior is decorated with Al-Asmaul-Husna calligraphy of the Thuluth variation. The entrance to the main prayer hall is adorned with verse 80 of Sura Al-Isra from the Qur'an.Sejarah dan Latarbelakang Masjid (in Malay). Masjid Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin. Accessed 12 June 2010 There is a mihrab wall made of 13-meter- high glass panel imported from Germany inscribed with two verses from Sura Al- Baqarah on the right and Sura Ibrahim on the left. The mihrab wall is designed so that no light will be reflected, creating an illusion that the verses are floating on air. The 40-feet-long edges of the mosque's roof are able to shelter the people praying outside of the main prayer hall from rain.

When it was released in 1948, it became Fulson's first hit. When B.B. King recorded the song in 1951, it became his first hit as well as one of the best-selling R&B; singles in 1952. \\"3 O'Clock Blues\\" effectively launched King's career and remained a part of his concert repertoire throughout his life. The song was included on his first album, Singin' the Blues and since has appeared on several King albums, including a remake in 2000 with Eric Clapton for the Riding with the King album. Original song Lowell Fulson recorded \\"Three O'Clock Blues\\" during his first recording session for Oakland, California-based record producer Bob Geddins in 1946.In 1938 Monkey Joe recorded a different \\"Three O'Clock Blues\\" (Vocalion 04294). Fulson, who sang and played guitar, was accompanied by his brother Martin on second guitar. The duo produced several country blues-style songs after World War II. According to music historian Ted Gioia, the song lyrics start out \\"as an insomniac's lament, but end up with a weepy farewell more suited to a suicide note\\": By the time of the record's release two years later in 1948, Fulson's style had already evolved into a West Coast blues style typified by his hit recordings for Downbeat and Swing Time Records, such as \\"Every Day I Have the Blues\\" and \\"Blue Shadows\\". Nonetheless, \\"Three O'Clock Blues\\", became a hit and reached number six in the R&B; chart. B.B. King rendition Recording and composition B.B. King recorded \\"3 O'Clock Blues\\" for RPM Records around September 1951. The recording took place at an improvised studio in a room at the Memphis YMCA and the resulting audio quality was lower than recordings by Sam Phillips, who had recorded King's previous singles. Nonetheless, writer Colin Escott notes that the song \\"clicked where the others hadn't [perhaps due to] the new found drama and urgency in B.B.'s singing [and] the interplay between his voice and guitar, heard for the first time on record\\". The mingling of these two elements was brought to the forefront by the distant, subdued sound of the accompanying musicians. King's version is a slow (65 beats per minute) twelve-bar blues notated in 12/8 time in the key of C. Blues historian Robert Palmer sees King's guitar work on the song as showing his T-Bone Walker influences, \\"though his tone was bigger and rounder and his phrasing somewhat heavier\\". He borrowed Walker's technique of repeating a pitch on neighboring strings by sounding a note then sliding up to the same pitch on the successive lower string. This method allows the player to shift to higher position while creating a unique effect that emphasizes \\"tonal contrast\\". King also used melisma, a vocal technique found in gospel music, in which he bends and stretches a single syllable into a melodic phrase. Unlike Fulson, King used a full backing arrangement, including a horn section (including Evelyn Young on saxophone) and Ike Turner on piano. Charts and recognition \\"3 O'Clock Blues\\" was released by RPM Records in December 1951, and by December 29 it had entered Billboard magazine's Rhythm and Blues charts. The single spent a total of 17 weeks on the charts, including five weeks at number one. \\"3 O'Clock Blues\\" launched B.B. King's career and gave him his first opportunity to perform in front of a national audience. Due to the song's success, he began performing in the big theaters, such as the Howard Theater in Washington and the Apollo in New York, with a significant increase in his weekly earnings, from about $85 to $2,500.Kostelanetz 1997, p. 146. It sparked a touring schedule that continued throughout King's career. In 1956, the song was included on King's first album, Singin' the Blues. It has remained in King's repertoire and he has recorded several versions of the song, including a 2000 release with Eric Clapton for their Riding with the King album. In 2020, the Blues Foundation inducted \\"3 O‚ÄôClock Blues\\" into the Blues Hall of Fame as a \\"Classic of Blues Recording\\". The induction statement described it as \\"the first record to amply capture the emerging brilliance of both his [King's] singing and guitar playing talents\\".

History The \\"Temple of the Sibyl\\" at Pu≈Çawy, also known as the Temple of Memory, opened in 1801. The structure was modeled after the similar monopteral \\"Temple of Vesta\\" at Tivoli, Italy, the site of the Tiburtine Sibyl, which was well known throughout Europe in engravings. The Pu≈Çawy temple, designed by Polish architect Chrystian Piotr Aigner, memorialized Polish history and culture, and the glories and miseries of human life. Items kept in the Temple of the Sibyl included the Grunwald Swords and a large \\"Royal Casket\\" containing portraits and personal items of Poland's monarchs and queens. During the November Uprising of 1830‚Äì31, the museum was closed. Izabela Czartoryska's son Adam Jerzy Czartoryski evacuated surviving collections to Paris, France, where he housed them at the H√¥tel Lambert. His son W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czartoryski later reopened the museum in 1878 in Krak√≥w, in Austrian Poland, as the Czartoryski Museum. Prus In 1884, the Temple of the Sibyl was used by the Polish writer Boles≈Çaw Prus as the setting for his micro-story, \\"Mold of the Earth.\\" The story's action takes place adjacent to the Temple, where there is a boulder overgrown with molds. At a certain moment the boulder magically transforms into a globe. In his one-and-a-half-page micro-story, Prus identifies human societies with molds that, over the ages, blindly and impassively contest the surface of the globe. He thus provides a metaphor for the competitive struggle for existence that goes on among human communities.Christopher Kasparek, \\"Two Micro-Stories by Boles≈Çaw Prus,\\" The Polish Review, 1995, no. 1, p. 99. In 1869, then-22-year-old Boles≈Çaw Prus had briefly studied at the Agricultural and Forestry Institute that had been established on the old Czartoryski estate at Pu≈Çawy.Edward Pie≈õcikowski, Boles≈Çaw Prus, p. 147.

During his career he held a variety of commands and visited several countries receiving Soviet military aid.  Early life  Kutakhov was born on to a Russian family in Malokirsanovka village. His father died in 1918, but with the support of his older brothers he began to attend school. After completing his seventh grade of school in Taganrog in 1930 he trained to become a tram driver, but soon after completing training in 1933 he developed an interest aviation, so until 1934 he worked as a mechanic at an aircraft factory. Shortly before entering the military in mid 1935 he graduated from the Taganrog Industrial Institute. One year after graduating from the Stalingrad Military Aviation School in November 1938 he entered combat in the Winter War, having earlier been assigned to the 7th Fighter Aviation Regiment as a flight commander. On 24 December 1939 he was shot down by friendly fire from Aleksey Storozhakov, who mistook his Polikarpov fighter for a Finnish plane. However, he managed to bring his crippled I-15b over Soviet territory to make a forced landing. While the plane was damaged beyond repair, Kutakhov was soon able to return to flying with his unit, tallying 131 sorties by the end of the war and rising to the position of deputy squadron commander. He then trained to fly the I-153 fighter and later the MiG-3 until the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. World War II Upon the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Kutakhov was deployed to the warfront with his unit as a deputy squadron commander, but by July he was reassigned to the 145th Fighter Aviation Regiment (later renamed as the 19th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment in April 1942). Later that month he gained his first aerial victory, having shot down an Fieseler Fi 156 Storch. He did not gain any further aerial victories until 1942, having switched to flying the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3, although all aerial victories he gained while flying that plane were shared. In mid 1942 he began flying the Bell P-39 Airacobra, which he gathered the remainder of his shootdowns on. By the time he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 17 February 1943 he had been promoted to the position of squadron commander and totaled 262 combat sorties. Later that year he saw several very intense aerial combats; as a result he was shot down on 27 March, but he survived due to his parachute, and then on 21 June he allegedly shot down the Messerschmitt Bf 109 piloted by Heinrich Ehrler, forcing him to escape by parachute and be evacuated by a rescue plan, although the incident is not mentioned in German or Western sources. In May 1944 Kutakhov was promoted to commander of the 20th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, after which he flew in combat much less due to his seniority, but nevertheless he gained one last aerial victory in December that year (a Bf 109). By the end of the war he accumulated 327 sorties, participated in 63 dogfights, and was credited with at least 12 solo aerial victories, seeing combat in the battles for Leningrad, Karelia, Murmansk, the Arctic, Svir-Petrozavodsk, and Petsamo-Kirkenes. Postwar After remaining in command of his regiment until November 1948, he went on to attend the Lipetsk Higher Officer Tactical Flight Courses of the Air Force, which he graduated from in 1949 before being assigned as deputy commander of the 175th Fighter Aviation Division; the unit was based in East Germany, where he held a variety of postings until 1955. In December 1950 he was promoted to commander of the 145th Fighter Aviation Division, which he remained in command of until transferring to the post of deputy commander of the 71st Fighter Aviation Corps; later he became its commander in December 1953, and in 1954 he was promoted to the rank of general-major. Two years later he left the unit to attend the Higher Military Academy, which he graduated from in 1957. From then until October 1959 he served as deputy commander of combat training in the 30th Air Army, after which he became the 1st Deputy Commander. From August 1961 to July 1967 he commanded the 48th Air Army, and from then to March 1969 he served as the 1st Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force. In that post he was tasked with overseeing the development process of new flight technology. In February 1969 he was promoted to the rank of Marshal of Aviation, and the next month he became the commander of the Soviet Air Force. In that position, which he remained for the rest of his life, much of his time modernizing and re-equipping the Soviet Air Force with newer aircraft, and he strongly supported the creation of long-range radar systems. In 1982 he visited Syria with his colleague Koldunov to assess the damage caused by the Israeli attack that took out many Soviet-made aircraft, Operation Mole Cricket 19, in addition to visiting Egypt on several occasions, including to evaluate the damage inflicted on Egyptian Aviation by the Israeli Air Force during the later phase of the War of Attrition. For his role in revamping the air force he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union a second time on 15 August 1984, on his 70th birthday. However, he died of a severe stroke on 3 December 1984 before he received his second gold star medal and was buried in the Novodevichy cemetery. The medal was presented to his widow Valentina in January 1985. Throughout his career he totaled 2300 flight hours, flying various jets including the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, and Sukhoi Su-7; he did not give up flying until the age of 60.

Background Alington was Head Master of Eton from 1917 to 1933.Card, Tim. \\"Alington, Cyril Argentine (1872‚Äì1955)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 22 Aug 2009. Lyttelton was an Eton master from 1908 to 1945.The Times, obituary of Lyttelton, 2 May 1962, p. 16 Both men were classicists, but both had a deep love of English literature, which they sought to pass on to their pupils. In choosing the poems for their anthology, Alington and Lyttelton adopted the following principles: *to exclude poetry likely to be beyond the grasp of boys;Alington and Lyttelton, p. vii *to exclude poetry which might appeal to the young but would be repugnant to them in later life; *to exclude blank verse (\\"partly because blank verse is appreciably harder to learn by heart, and partly from a desire to keep the book within reasonable limits\\"); andAlington and Lyttelton, p. viii *to include favoured excerpts from long works.Alington and Lyttelton, passim The book was first published by Macmillan in London in 1925, with a second impression in 1927 and a third in 1938. Poems selected Following their declared wish to awaken boys' metrical sense, the editors grouped their selections into seven sections, the heroic couplet, the octosyllabic couplet, the sonnet, the trochaic metre, the dactylic or anapaestic metre, classical metres, and miscellaneous.Alington and Lyttelton, p. xv The sections, and the poems within them, are introduced with brief background notes, putting them in context. ;The heroic couplet This section begins with excerpts from Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales and continues with works or parts of works from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries, ending with two anonymous parodies, possibly written by one or both of the editors. In addition to works by the famous names of English poetry, there are verses by lesser-known writers such as Thomas Tickell, and by an American, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. ;The octosyllabic couplet For the second section, the editors chose to begin with less well-known verses by Chaucer than The Canterbury Tales: The Hous of Fame and The Book of the Duchesse. They include a short example of euphemism by John Lyly, and continue with a mixture of famous and less famous writers, the latter including Thomas Carew, Richard Crashaw and Charles Churchill. The final poem in this section is \\"Leisure\\", by W. H. Davies: \\"What is this life if, full of care, We have no time to stand and stare.\\" ;The sonnet The celebrated writers of English sonnets are included: Philip Sidney, Michael Drayton, William Shakespeare and John Milton, with later offerings by William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats. The editors also include works by poets less known for writing sonnets, including George Meredith, William Morris and Rupert Brooke. The section ends with Brooke's \\"The Soldier\\": \\"If I should die, think only this of me, That there's some corner of a foreign field That is for ever England\\". ;The trochaic metre The editors introduce this section by admitting that \\"the trochaic metre has not by itself played an important part in our literature ... Tennyson wrote 'Locksley Hall' in trochaics because Mr Hallam told him that the English people liked the metre, but it is very doubtful if he was right.\\" There are fewer poems in this section by the best-known names in English poetry, but Alington and Lyttelton include William Blake's \\"The Tiger\\" and Rudyard Kipling's \\"A Smuggler's Song\\": \\"Five and twenty ponies, Trotting through the dark\\". ;The dactylic or anapaestic metre Though agreeing that the metre is \\"almost indispensable for comic purposes\\", the editors also selected serious examples, by among others Matthew Prior, Isaac Watts and Robert Browning ‚Äì \\"The Lost Leader\\": \\"Just for a handful of silver he left us, Just for a riband to stick in his coat\\". Nonetheless the poet most represented in this section is Edward Lear, with \\"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat\\", \\"The Quangle Wangle's Hat\\" and \\"How Pleasant to Know Mr Lear\\". ;Classical metres In their introduction to this section, the editors acknowledge that English hexameters and pentameters are, by the nature of modern ideas of scansion, not strictly comparable with classical examples. They extend this caveat to other modern languages: \\"Goethe's pentameter 'Habe ich Rose-strumpf gehasst and Violet- strumpf dazu' is probably the worst ever written in any language.\\" The English specimens they print include works by Tennyson, Arthur Hugh Clough and Charles Kingsley. ;Miscellaneous The editors admitted, \\"Our classification of metres is confessedly of the roughest, and the large section headed 'Miscellaneous' is in itself a confession of our humility if not of our ignorance\\". Once again they begin their choice with Chaucer, who is followed by a large selection of English, Scottish, Irish and American verse in a wide variety of metres and shapes. In this section, Alington and Lyttelton included poets as diverse as Edmund Spenser, the two Sir Walter Raleighs, Ben Jonson, Robert Herrick and twentieth-century poets including John Masefield and W. B. Yeats, alongside writers of comic verse such as A. D. Godley and W. S. Gilbert, who is represented by three lyrics from the Savoy Operas. This is the largest section of the anthology, and it was praised by the reviewer of The Manchester Guardian as the most likely to fulfil the editors' wish to attract young people's interest.\\"New Books\\", The Manchester Guardian, 18 June 1925, p. 7 Reception Reviewing the book in 1925, The Manchester Guardian wrote, \\"The book is indeed a treasury of great and beautiful things, and there are very many that the ordinary boy can hardly help liking. But ... the appeal of the Restoration and Augustan satires, of the Elizabethan sonnets, and of Myers's 'St Paul' is hardly to the ordinary boy. Indeed, it is the compilers' own conviction that 'many boys are definitely hindered from appreciating poetry by being introduced too soon to poems the beauty of which is beyond their grasp.' What then of Drayton's great sonnet, or Meredith's 'Lucifer in Starlight', or Donne's 'An Anatomy of the World', or Keats's 'Ode to a Nightingale', or Browning's 'My Last Duchess', to mention no more?\\". In 1959, the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis wrote of the book, \\"There can never have been a better anthology for stirring boys' enthusiasm\\".Hart-Davis, letter of 8 March 1959 Lyttelton replied, \\"It is, I think, out of print now, and never had very much of a sale. Macmillan's didn't do much about it and I always maintained that its title was against it, but Cyril Alington insisted on it. It is true the relevance of it is not very clear. My copy always opens at 'Little Orphant Annie' which I tried to eliminate, but Cyril was mysteriously keen on it. One or two reviews rightly derided it, but mostly such reviews as the book got were quite cordial. One infuriated me. I did practically all of the stuff about the poems and poets, and some ass regretted that readers should be 'told what to think about them'. As no doubt you (and everyone else with eyes) saw, the main gist was to record what had been thought or said about them, very often inviting readers to differ\\".Hart-Davis, letter of 12 March 1959 Notes References *Alington, C A, and G W Lyttelton (ed).

It was also known as the Addison Act after Minister of Health, Dr Christopher Addison, the then-Minister for Housing. The Act was passed to allow the building of new houses after the First World War, and marked the start of a long twentieth-century tradition of state-owned housing in planned council estates. Background The 1919 Act followed on from the Town Planning Act 1909 and the 1917 Tudor Walters Committee Report into the provision of housing in the United Kingdom; the latter commissioned by Parliament with a view to post-war construction. In part, this was a response to the shocking lack of fitness amongst many recruits during World War One, attributed to poor living conditions; a belief summed up in a housing poster of the period \\"you cannot expect to get an A1 population out of C3 homes\\" referring to military fitness classifications of the period. Content It provided subsidies to local authorities and aimed to help finance the construction of 500,000 houses within three years. Section 41 (1) provided that the London County Council could build houses outside the County of London. This provision was used to build 'out-county' estates, such as Becontree. Not all of the funding was ultimately made available and only 213,800 homes were built under the 1919 Act scheme. However, under the provisions of successive housing Acts between 1919 and 1939 local authorities built a total of 1.1 million homes.

The government reacted with three major pieces of legislation in 1575, 1579 and 1592. The kirk became a major element of the system of poor relief and justices of the peace were given responsibility for dealing with the issue. The 1575 act, enabled through a Convention of the Estates, was modelled on the English act passed two years earlier and limited relief to the deserving poor of the old, sick and infirm, imposing draconian punishments on a long list of \\"masterful beggars\\", including jugglers, palmisters and unlicensed tutors. Parish deacons, elders or other overseers were to draw up lists of deserving poor and each would be assessed. Those not belonging to the parish were to be sent back to their place of birth and might be put in the stocks or otherwise punished, probably actually increasing the level of vagrancy. Unlike the English act, there was no attempt to provide work for the able-bodied poor.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 166-8. In practice, the strictures on begging were often disregarded in times of extreme hardship.R. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603-1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , p. 143. This legislation provided the basis of what would later be known as the \\"Old Poor Law\\" in Scotland, which remained in place until reforms in 1845.R. Mitchison, The Old Poor Law in Scotland: the Experience of Poverty, 1574-1845 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), . Later development Most subsequent legislation built on the principles of provision for the local deserving poor and punishment of mobile and undeserving \\"sturdie beggars\\". The most important later act was that of 1649, which declared that local heritors were to be assessed by kirk session to provide the financial resources for local relief, rather than relying on voluntary contributions.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 96.

The spot was named after the River Ilse, which rises on the highest mountain in the Harz, the legendary Brocken, and flows through the romantic Ilse valley to Ilsenburg. As early as 1871 a hotel appeared in the Ilse valley by the name of Princess Ilse, which enjoyed great popularity. The timber-framed building burned down in 1887, but was rebuilt and extended several times. In 1978 it was completely torn down. Several hundred metres below the site of the old hotel there is still a spring, called Princess Ilse, from which a mineral spring flows. Prinze√ü Ilse is also the title of a romantic play in five acts from the days of the old Celle dukedom, which appeared in 1926 near Str√∂her in Celle and had been published by Karl Dassel and Karl Tolle. Prinzessin Ilse by contrast is the name of a fairy tale from the Harz by Marie Petersen, which first appeared in print in 1850. In this story, Princess Ilse loses her way whilst riding to the chase with her father, King Ilsing, and comes at nightfall to the gates of the fairy world, ruled by the fairy queen. The queen meets her kindly and invites her to the crystal palace. The legend was further reflected in Heinrich Heine's Die Ilse. References *Toofie Lauder.

The station is currently owned by Kasa Family Limited Partnership. Translator History KRBA began broadcasting on May 3, 1938 at 100 watts of daytime only power, operating on 1310 kilocycles in the AM radio band. A License to Cover was issued for the facility on June 15, 1938. It is the first broadcast facility to be licensed in Lufkin-Nacogdoches. The facility increased power to 250 watts unlimited hours on July 13, 1939. During an industry wide frequency reallocation procedure under the NARBA agreement, on March 28, 1941 the station's operation was moved by the FCC to 1340 kilocycles. On February 15, 1966, KRBA's daytime power was increased to the current 1 kilowatt. The broadcast studios have been in three location in KRBA's history, all of which are located in downtown Lufkin. The original site was on the 2nd floor above the Cash Drug Store, which was later part of the Perry Building. Cash Drug Store burned down in 1941 causing the owner, Darrell Yates, to move the studio to the location of the old Rogers Drug Store. In January 1956, the studios were again moved to the present location on Cotton Square. The transmitting site and antenna has continuously been located on the Old Nacogdoches Highway, which is now Spence Street in Lufkin, since the construction of the station in 1938. KRBA's original programming attempted to present something on the air for everyone in Angelina County. From 1938 through the early 1940s, the station regularly broadcast news, dramatic programming, musical transcriptions of all varieties, and live preachers of various denominations. The 1950s and 1960s would continue with a variety format, though dramatic programming would be fazed out over time, with more programs directed towards housewives & farmers, and a direct request musical program called \\"Song and Dance Parade\\" would begin to lead the format in the \\"Rock n' Roll\\" direction, which became a major part of the station's legacy. KRBA's \\"Tunes and Tempos\\" played Rhythm and Blues, and would introduce African-American radio announcers to the local audience in the 1950s and 1960s. Spanish musical programming would be introduced for the first time on the station in 1968. KRBA began moving to a more consistent Country and Western format in the mid 1970s, though it would also continue with the traditional gospel programs that had become a KRBA trademark since 1938. The programming variety would be enhanced by Darrell Yates when he signed on the first FM sister station to KRBA, as 99.3 KDEY Lufkin on July 27, 1978. That station now operates as KYBI \\"Y100\\", since moved to 100.1 MHz, and remains the FM sister of KRBA to this day. May 3, 2018, marked the 80th year of continuous operation for the heritage KRBA in the Lufkin-Nacogdoches market. It is currently owned and operated by Kasa Family, L.P.. Kasa Family requested an FM translator for KRBA, which was granted by the Federal Communications Commission and issued a Construction Permit to build a 250 watts Class D facility on Channel 281 (104.1 MHz), April 18, 2018. The construction permit, which will bring KRBA programming to the FM dial, expires on April 18, 2021.

Journal of Paleontology 81(6):1266-1283 Whether Rioceras is assigned to the Baltoceratidae and therefore to the Orthocerida or to the Ellesmeroceratidae depends on the definition of each. Flower placed Rioceras in the Baltoceratidae when he proposed the genus since it lacks diaphragms in the siphuncle which for him was a defining character of the family. Kr√∂ger removed Rioceras to the Ellesmeroceratidae on the basis of its inwardly thicked connecting rings which produce concave segments, a defining character of that family as emended. Flower did point out in his original diagnosis that Rioceras has moderately thick connecting rings \\"of ellesmeroceratoid aspect\\" Morphology The shell is usually long, and may be straight (\\"orthoconic\\") or gently curved. In life, these animals may have been similar to the modern squid, except for the long shell.

In 1910, he created the Cities Service Company, a utility holding company that later became the Citgo Petroleum Corporation. Business career Doherty was first hired by the Columbus Gas Company at the age of 12. Rose reportedly wrote years later, \\"I could not get along in school...and under expulsion a large part of the time I was supposed to be in school.\\" He made such a favorable impression with his knowledge and devotion to work that CGC management assigned him to take charge of a subsidiary company, a declining utility in Wisconsin. By the age of 20, he held the title of Chief Engineer at CGC. In June 1899, the Emerson McMillan & Company, a financial company that invested in utility companies, had sent one of its senior executives, George T. Thompson, to the Denver Gas & Electric Company as president. Thompson died on October 1, 1900, McMillan asked Doherty to replace Thompson. On October 18, Doherty became acting president and treasurer of the Denver Gas & Electric Company. In 1905, he started Henry L. Doherty & Co., which provided technical and financial consulting services to utility companies. In 1910, he founded his own holding company, Cities Service, which held the stock of energy companies he had bought previously. Cities Service bought the holdings of Theodore N. Barnsdall, founder of Barnsdall Oil Company, in 1912. In 1916, he established the Doherty Energy Research Laboratory Co. (DORELCO) in Bartlesville, Oklahoma to advance his theories about field unitization as a means of oil conservation and as a location to train petroleum geologists and engineers. He received numerous awards and recognition for his contributions to the development of scientific methodology in the petroleum industry. In 1924 he instigated the creation of the Federal Oil Conservation Board by President Coolidge. Doherty was awarded the Franklin Institute's Walton Clark Medal in 1931. In 1969, Columbia University added his name to the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory, after he made a large contribution. Doherty eventually had controlling interests in 150 firms, which collectively served 9,000 locales in the U.S. and Canada, and a cumulative 600,000 stockholders. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) required that a company like Cities Service divest itself of either its electric utility holdings or its other energy companies. Cities Service chose to sell off its utilities and remain in the oil and gas business. The first steps to liquidate investments in its public utilities were taken in 1943 and affected over 250 different utility corporations. Personal life Doherty's motorized bed Before founding Cities Service, Henry Doherty moved to New York City, where he lived atop an office building at State and Liberty Streets, now the site of 1 Battery Park Plaza. The suite had a gym, squash court and motorized bed that slid out onto the terrace. Clearly, he was already beset with recurring rounds of arthritis. He nearly died in 1927 from complications of the disease, but recovered with the help of a friend, Grace Eames. Grace was a widow, and married Henry in December 1928. A New York Times article said that he had bought several properties in Manhattan for redevelopment, but most of the projects were delayed because of these bouts. One of the projects completed for Doherty was a 60-story skyscraper initially named for its street address, 70 Pine Street. It was topped by a tower containing six smaller floors that would contain Doherty's private residence.

Kelly said ‚ÄúI always want my plays to have tension; whether the audience hates it or loves it is up to them, but I never want them to be bored.‚Äù Synopsis Helen and her husband Danny are celebrating the news that Helen is newly pregnant with their second child with a quiet night in, but it is interrupted by Helen's brother Liam, who arrives covered in blood claiming to have found a young lad injured on the street. When Liam's recollection of the event begins to change under questioning, suspicions are aroused followed by increasing concern that he may have been more involved than first thought. Liam explains the events stage by stage, causing him to accidentally reveal that he committed a racially motivated hate crime. Helen coerces Danny to intimidate Liam's victim in order to prevent him from going to the police. When Danny and Liam return, Helen orders Liam to leave their home. Danny, shaken by what he's done and disgusted by Helen's morally bankrupt behaviour over the course of the night, tells Helen he wants her to abort her pregnancy. Characters  * Helen was orphaned after a fire and brought up in care with her brother Liam. She is Danny's wife and is newly pregnant with her second child. * Danny is Helen's husband. * Liam was orphaned after a fire and brought up in care, and is grateful to his sister believing that she is the reason they were never separated. * Shane is Helen and Danny's five-year-old son.

Its type is Rhabdiferoceras annuliferum. It was assigned to Baltoceratidae by Flower (1964) and Hook and Flower (1977).R. H. Flower. 1964. The Nautiloid Order Ellesmeroceratida (Cephalopoda).

Late Canadian (Zones J, K) cephalopod faunas from Southwestern United States. New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources 32:1-56 Morphology Rhabdiferoceras is a rod-bearing baltoceratid with undulations on the dorsal side of the ventral siphuncular rod that correspond to the segments of the siphuncle. Septal necks are very short, connecting rings are layered and are slightly expanded and gently convex from the outside. The genotype, Rhadiferoceras annuliferum Flower is known only from sectioning a limestone block, presumed to be of Cassinian age from the Pogonip Group from the northern end of the Ely Springs Range, Nevada. The siphuncle is rather large, in proportion, and slightly removed from the venter, considered a baltoceratid aspect. We can only guess at what the animal may have been like or as to its habits. As an orthocerid it may have had 8 or 10 long arms or tentacles projecting from its head, as found in modern squids, belemnites, and indicated for Upper Ordovician Orthonybyoceras and Silurian Michelinoceras.

In 1985 she graduated from the Hacettepe University State Conservatory, School of Theater. In that year, she began to work at the Adana State Theatre as an intern. After two years she was charged with a duty in Ankara at the State Theatre and performed in numerous plays such as: Laundry, Ferhad and Sirin, A Noisy and Clamorous Story, Death, Istanbul Efendisi, Last of the Red Hot Lovers, Skylight, From War to Peace, From Love to Quarrel, Love Kills, The Government Inspector, A Place in the Middle of the Earth. In 2003 she moved to Istanbul to work at the Istanbul State Theatre. In 2004 she performed in The Government Inspector (N. V. Gogol) as Anna Andreyevna. She won an Afife Theatre Award for Best Supporting Actress in Comedy. Besides her theatre career, Zerrin Tekindor also studied painting as a special student at the Bilkent University School of Fine Arts between 1990-1994 in the Halil Akdeniz Workshop. The heroes of many plays are settled on her canvas as Tekindor's figures by using mixed technique. With their costumes, actions, lines, and even with their appearances under the stage light, they become paintings, being filtered through Tekindor's interpretation who is also part of that particular action on the stage. Zerrin Tekindor has a son with actor √áetin Tekindor. At present, Zerrin Tekindor continues her career as an actress and a painter in Istanbul.

It uses magnetic and electric fields operating in a vacuum to focus the electrons released from a photocathode by incoming light onto a collection of silicon diodes. It is a photon-counting instrument, so most useful for weak sources. One of digicon's advantages is its very large dynamic range and it results from the short response and decay times of silicon diodes.  Development  In 1971, E.A. Beaver and Carl McIlwain successfully demonstrated a way in which silicon diodes can be used in digital tube by placing a silicon diode array that contained 38 elements in the same chamber as a photocathode. The design and manufacture of the Digicon tube is attributed to John Choisser of the Electronic Vision Corporation. Digicon detectors were used on the original instruments for the Hubble Space Telescope, but are very rarely used in new designs, where CMOS active-pixel detectors can achieve the same performance without the need for large electric fields or complicated vacuum assemblies. For instance, there were two pulse- counting Digicon detectors in the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph installed on the Hubble Space Telescope from 1990-97, used to record ultraviolet spectra. Digicon is also used in digital imaging such as the case of a scanning gage using Digicon imaging tube, which generates a two- dimensional view with high spatial resolution when an object is scanned past the Digicon.

It works by having the equal but opposite spherical aberration of the objective it is designed to correct (usually a spherical mirror). Types Meniscus correctors are used as full aperture correctors, most commonly in a Maksutov telescope sub type called the Gregory or ‚Äúspot‚Äù Maksutov‚ÄìCassegrain telescope. They are also used in the Bouwers meniscus telescope. There are Maksutov variations that use the same principle but place the meniscus lens as a sub-aperture corrector near the focus of the objective. There are other sub-aperture meniscus corrector catadioptric telescopes such as the Argunov‚ÄìCassegrain telescope and the Klevtsov‚ÄìCassegrain telescope. Invention The idea of using the spherical aberration of a meniscus lens to correct the opposite aberration in a spherical objective dates back as far as W. F. Hamilton‚Äôs 1814 Hamiltonian telescope, in Colonel A. Mangin's 1876 Mangin mirror, and also appears in Ludwig Schupmann‚Äôs Schupmann medial telescope near the end of the 19th century. After the invention of the wide- field Schmidt camera in the early 1930s, at least four optical designers in early 1940s war-torn Europe came up with the idea of replacing the complicated Schmidt corrector plate with a simpler meniscus lens, including Albert Bouwers, Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov, K. Penning, and Dennis Gabor.Lens design fundamentals, by Rudolf Kingslake, page 313 All of these designs used full aperture correctors (a meniscus corrector shell) to create a wide-field telescope with little or no coma or astigmatism. Albert Bouwers built a prototype meniscus telescope in August 1940 and patented it in February 1941. His design had the mirror and meniscus lens with surfaces that had a common centre of curvature, called a \\"concentric\\" or \\"monocentric\\" telescope. The design had an ultrawide field of view but did not correct chromatic aberration and was only suitable as a monochromatic astronomical camera. Dmitri Maksutov built a prototype for a similar type of meniscus telescope, the Maksutov telescope, in October 1941, and patented it in November of that same year. His design corrected most spherical aberration and also corrected for chromatic aberration by placing a weakly negative-shaped meniscus corrector closer to the primary mirror. Dennis Gabor‚Äôs 1941 design was a non-monocentric meniscus corrector.Handbook of Optical Systems, Survey of Optical Instruments, by Herbert Gross, Hannfried Z√ºgge, Fritz Blechinger, Bertram Achtner, page 806 Wartime secrecy kept these designers from knowing about each other's design, making each invention independent.

Career Grassi began his career at youth teams of Parma, before making his professional debut in Slovenia, ending an 11-year stay with Parma. In the 2007/08 season, Grassi played for M√©rida UD. Grassi had a successful trial with Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen and was offered a one-year deal. He made his debut against Motherwell in August having come on as a substitute. During a Scottish League Cup match against Dundee on 24 September 2009, he suffered a triple cheekbone fracture. Grassi was released from Aberdeen on 1 July 2010. Since leaving Aberdeen, Grassi signed for Sorrento Calcio in July 2010 but left Sorrento, having made three appearance. On 31 January 2011, he was signed by Serie B side Triestina. However, Grassi left Triestina, having made no appearance. Shortly after leaving Triestina, Grassi joined Belgian side Brussels, whose team in Second Division in Belgian League . Grassi made his debut for the club, on the opening game of the season on 17 August 2011, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Oostende; two-month later on 15 October 2011, he scored his first goal in a 4‚Äì0 win over Wetteren but however, he received a red card. Eventually, Grassi played the next game after winning appeal, allowing him to play the next game. It couldn't get worse for Grassi on the next game on 23 October 2011 when Grassi scored an own goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Lommel United. At Brussels, Grassi made 33 appearance, established himself in the first team. He signed for Scottish Premier League side Dundee on 2 August 2012, subject to international clearance. He made his debut for the club in a 2‚Äì0 loss against St Mirren on 11 August 2012. Grassi would suffered a knee injury, having an operation, and resulted him out for six weeks Manager Barry Smith says he is not rushing for Grassi return from injury Eventually, Grassi made his return from injury in a 3‚Äì0 loss against Hibernian on 6 October 2012. After another appearance, Grassi once again suffered an injury after undergoing knee surgery again, resulted him out for two months. In February, Grassi made a recovery from injury and back in training. Later in the season, Dundee would soon suffer relegation to Scottish Championship and Grassi would be released by the club, making thirteen appearance in total. After leaving Dundee, Grassi moved to Cyprus by joining Aris Limassol, subject to a medical. One year later, he signed for VfL Osnabr√ºck.

The designers intend the system to provide almost full-time communication, even with satellites in low Earth orbit that often have reduced visibility from ground stations. It makes on-demand data available to, for example, rescue workers who want near-real-time satellite data of a crisis region. The system has been developed as part of the ARTES 7 programme and is intended to be an independent, European satellite system that reduces time delays in the transmission of large quantities of data. The programme is similar to the American Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System that was set up to support the Space Shuttle‚Äîbut EDRS is using a new generation Laser Communication Terminal (LCT) which carries data at a much larger bit rate: the laser terminal transmits 1.8 Gbit/s across 45,000 km (the distance of a LEO-GEO link), while the TDRSS provides ground reception rates of 600 Mbit/s in the S-band and 800 Mbit/s in the Ku- and Ka-bands. Such a terminal was successfully tested during in-orbit verification between the German radar satellite TerraSAR-X and the American NFIRE satellite.TerraSAR-X NFIRE test It is also embarked on the commercial telecommunication satellite Alphasat. Alphasat  Network  EDRS infrastructure will consist of two geostationary payloads (two further payloads are in the planning stage), a ground system consisting of a satellite control centre, a mission and operations centre, a feeder link ground station (FLGS), and data ground stations.  Space Segment  The first EDRS payload, EDRS-A, comprising a laser communication terminal and a Ka band inter-satellite link, was placed on-board Eutelsat commercial telecommunication satellite, called Eutelsat 9B (COSPAR 2016-005A). The satellite was launched in January 2016 by a Proton-M rocket and will be positioned at 9¬∞E.ILS to Launch Eutelsat 9B Satellite in 2015 A second EDRS payload was launched aboard a dedicated spacecraft. The EDRS-C (COSPAR 2019-049A), which is also carrying a laser communication terminal, was launched on 6 August 2019 and will be positioned at 31¬∞E. The satellite also carries a payload meant for commercial communication satellite use, the HYLAS 3 payload. Thus the satellite is sometimes referred to as EDRS-C/HYLAS 3 or something similar. The EDRS A and C form the initial core space infrastructure that provides direct coverage for LEO satellites over Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Poles. Two further spacecraft are planned to complement the system from 2020 onwards, affording a complete coverage of the Earth and providing long-term system redundancy beyond 2030.  Ground Segment  The ground segment of EDRS includes three ground receiving stations located at Weilheim, Germany, Redu, Belgium and Harwell, UK. The prime Mission Operations Centre will be in Ottobrunn, Germany, while a backup centre will be installed in Redu, Belgium.EDRS Operations Center The EDRS-A payload as well as the EDRS-C satellite will be operated by the German Space Operations Center (GSOC) of the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, Germany.  Operations  The first users for EDRS will be the Sentinel-1 and -2 satellites of the Copernicus Programme (formerly the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security or GMES). The Sentinel satellites will provide data for the operational provision of geo-information products and services throughout Europe and the globe. EDRS will provide the data relay services for the Sentinel satellites facilitating a rapid downlink of large volumes of imagery. Extensive further capacities on the system will be available for third party users. There are a number of key services that will benefit from this system's infrastructure: * Earth Observation applications in support of time-critical and/or data-intensive services; e.g., change detection, environmental monitoring. * Government and security services that need images from key European space systems such as Global Monitoring for Environment and Security. * Emergency response and crisis intervention applications that need information and data over areas affected by natural or man-made disasters. * Security forces that transmit data to Earth observation satellites, aircraft and unmanned aerial observation vehicles, to reconfigure such systems in real time. * Weather satellite services that require the fast delivery of large quantities of data around the world.  Implementation  EDRS is being implemented as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) between the European Space Agency (ESA) and Airbus Defence & Space (ADS, former Astrium).EDRS: An independent data-relay system for Europe becoming reality ESA funds the infrastructure development and is the anchor customer through the Sentinel satellite missions. ADS will carry the overall responsibility for the implementation of the space segment including launch, as well as the ground segment. ADS will then take over ownership of EDRS and will provide the data transmission services to ESA and customers worldwide.
