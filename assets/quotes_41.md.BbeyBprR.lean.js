She first appeared in the series fifteen episode \\"Green Ink\\", broadcast on 25 March 2014. Amy arrives at Holby City hospital to work as a Consultant pharmacist in the AAU department. She is also married to fellow character specialist registrar Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden). When not treating medical conditions Amy's stories have revolved around her marriage to Raf and their quest to have a child. The character undergoes IVF treatment in their attempts to conceive. Their relationship is marred with mistaken pregnancies and Raf being diagnosed with a condition affecting sperm quality. Writers developed a \\"love triangle\\" storyline and introduced doctor Harry Tressler (Jules Knight) for an affair. Amy becomes pregnant by Harry causing the eventual break-down of her marriage to Raf. He attempts to adjust to the idea of bringing up Harry's child. Amy gives birth to a son and they decide to move on with their lives. Amy made her final appearance during \\"Star of Wonder\\", broadcast on 16 December 2014. The character's infidelity story proved favourable with television critics for its entertainment value. Casting On the 23 November 2013, producer Simon Harper announced that Wendy Kweh had been cast as Amy Teo. He revealed that she was being introduced as the wife of fellow new character specialist registrar Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden). He added that the character would take the role of a consultant pharmacist working in the hospitals AAU department and \\"be at the centre of a very explosive storyline\\". To accommodate the introduction of the character changes were made to the set. Set designer Nicole Northridge hired the company Cardinal to fit real pharmacy equipment and a dispensary on the set, which Amy would use in her profession as a pharmacist. Development Characterisation Amy is described as a confident and loyal character and knows what she wants in life. Her main aim is to create a family unit as she and her husband Raf struggled to naturally conceive a child together. In an interview published by the BBC, Kweh said that Amy is an \\"extremely qualified\\" Consultant Pharmacist who has chosen to stay grounded and work alongside trauma united with doctors and consultants. Her aim is to offer these units \\"the best possible care in terms of drugs and treatment\\". Amy's strengths include her penchant for engaging with patients on both a medical and personal level to best address their needs. Kweh believed that her character was a \\"key member of the team\\" at Holby City hospital. She added that Amy \\"is perceptive, intuitive and particularly skilled at staying on top of everyone‚Äôs needs.\\" She can be bossy and takes a passionate approach to her career. Kweh enjoyed portraying these traits especially the opportunity to give orders to the male staff. But she added that while Amy has a strong personality her life does not run smoothly, which added an interesting side to the character. Marriage to Raf di Lucca Amy and Raf's marriage is described as intense. Kweh explained that \\"they are both achievers and treat each other as equals in the relationship. It‚Äôs what they like about each other.\\" But this can be problematic because one of them may be succeeding more and they become competitors sometimes. They find each other's competitive nature attractive but sometimes the opposite. Their main aim in their personal life is to have children. They had been committed to their work and left trying to start a family until they became older. Amy undergoes IVF to try and conceive their child but it is later revealed that Raf's sperm quality is causing the problem. Amy takes on her final round of IVF treatment. She convinces herself that she is pregnant and books an appointment with a consultant. He tells Amy she is not pregnant and the treatment has failed again. Instead of helping Amy through the ordeal, her husband lacks emotional support and chose to prioritise patient care over Amy's well-being. Writers used this predicament to cause a noticeable divide in their marriage. When Harry Tressler (Jules Knight) is introduced to Amy he feels an instant attraction. Harry notices that Amy and Raf are troubled about their unsuccessful attempts at IVF. Harry is keen to use their relationship problems to his advantage. Raf cancels a date with Amy to an upmarket medical dinner. Harry decides to offer to take Amy instead. As an Inside Soap reporter noted, Amy was in a vulnerable position and Harry deployed \\"his considerable charm\\" on Amy, in his attempt to steal her from Raf. When Amy is feeling hormonal about her IVF treatment she kisses Harry because she craves a \\"sense of connection\\". Kweh believed that Harry's there to be a connection between the two. She defended the infidelity explaining that \\"guys like Harry will always arouse some suspicion, but that doesn't mean their connection isn't real. Even cheeky boys have real relationships and sometimes the most awkward set-ups can lead to the most real connections.\\" For Harry the opportunity to snare Amy from Raf was a way to get revenge. Knight told Katy Moon (Inside Soap) that his character was unhappy that the more qualified Raf had more power in the work place. Harry does have moments \\"where his moral compass is spinning\\", but then lust takes over with their kiss and they have sex. The actor concluded that their affair would \\"wreak havoc\\" for Amy and Raf, which was Harry's original intention aside from his new found feelings of lust towards Amy. Kweh told a reporter from What's on TV that Amy avoids Harry because she feels guilty. Amy made a \\"terrible error of judgement\\" when she was at her most vulnerable. She tries her best to \\"play happy families\\" with Raf but then starts to feel dizzy, which prompts her to take a pregnancy test informing her that she is pregnant. The surprise storyline twist leaves Amy with a dilemma, she is finally pregnant but faces the prospect of ruining her marriage to Raf. Kweh stated that her first concern had now become Raf rather than having a child. Amy tells Raf about her pregnancy despite the chance it could be Harry's baby. She thinks about \\"miracle stories\\" about people having IVF and Amy hopes that Raf is the father. Kweh described Amy as \\"fearing the worst.... but hoping for the best.\\" Harry uses the opportunity to blackmail Amy into convincing Raf to help him advance in his career. Amy thought Harry was a true friend and feels stupid for believing his \\"nice bloke act\\". Harry makes an error with a patient's medication and Amy takes the blame. Raf notices the pair having secret discussions and becomes suspicious. When he suspects that one of them is lying about the medication error he confronts Amy. She takes him by surprise changing the subject and confessing to sleeping with Harry. McFadden told a What's on TV reporter that his character only wanted the truth about the medication, but Amy's confession is \\"100 times worse\\". He feels \\"utterly betrayed\\" and never in \\"a million years\\" would have believed Amy would sleep with anyone else. He also noted that Harry is the worst person Amy could have been unfaithful with. But the drama escalates when Raf realises Harry could be the father of Amy's baby and \\"it rocks his world.\\" He remains angry and feels foolish to have underestimated Amy's loyalty. McFadden stated that it was during these scenes he begins to wonder if Amy planned to sleep with Harry. He questions whether Amy \\"consciously tried to get pregnant\\" following months of failed fertility treatment. Raf pretends that the results of a paternity test indicate he is the father. But no test was taken and McFadden said that Raf lies to try and get Harry to back off from Amy. In July 2014, Knight and McFadden still did not know which of their characters was actually the father of the baby. On-screen the baby's biological father was kept secret until December 2014. Her actions have more serious consequences for Raf. He struggles to get over Amy's infidelity and begins to sabotage Harry's career, he even considers killing his rival. McFadden said that Raf cannot stand to see Harry succeeding in his career after he slept with his wife. He later explained that it was Amy who had gained viewer sympathy and understanding during the storyline. He had met a female viewer who condoned Amy's affair because of their own need to have biological children. But Male viewers had told the actor that Raf needs to forget about Amy and move on with his life. But McFadden's sympathy also lay with Amy, he said \\"she did what she had to do\\" to have the baby she always wanted. Conclusion to storylines As Amy nears the end of her pregnancy she asks Raf to be her birthing partner. Kweh told another What's on TV interviewer that her character is scared and considers her birthing plan. Amy is upset when Raf refuses and asks for a divorce. The actress assessed that Amy is \\"flummoxed\\" and caught \\"off guard\\", she genuinely believed that she and Raf were making progress to repair their relationship. Writers continued to involve Harry in Amy's baby storyline. Amy begins to feel unwell and Harry rushes to her aid. His caring nature confuses Amy who is vulnerable. Kweh believed that Harry confuses most people when they are vulnerable and he is \\"at his best and very worst\\". Her condition is checked over by Derwood Thompson (Ben Hull) who informs her that she is in premature labour. Amy's emotional state is worsened and \\"fears she'll never be totally ready for motherhood.\\" Kweh noted that \\"Fortunately, she can cover some of her vulnerability; she's had to so many times this year already.\\" As the birth is complicated she is forced to have a Caesarean operation and Raf alongside Harry are present for the birth. Despite being there for Amy, she hears him state that he cannot forgive himself for his role in ruining their marriage. This gives Amy false hope. The actress concluded that Amy momentarily feels \\"hope and sadness\\". She feels sad because it took the birth of her child to make Raf realise that he does still care for Amy. Amy made her final appearance in the show during the episode titled \\"Star of Wonder\\", which was broadcast on 16 December 2014. Reception A reporter from the Sunday Mirror likened the love triangle storyline to a boxing match. They quipped \\"and in the blue corner, it's Harry, in the red, it's Raf. In the middle, looking a little stressed, Amy.\\" A South Wales Echo writer branded it the \\"Amy/Harry/Raf triangle of shame.\\" A South Wales Echo journalist quipped \\"the diagnosis for Raf and Amy's marriage is still pretty bleak after her affair\\". A Daily Record reporter included an episode centric to Amy's baby story in their \\"Pick of the day\\" feature.

Taxonomic History  Niebla sorocarpia was first recognized by Richard Spjut, accompanied by Richard Marin and Thomas McCloud, on 19 May 1986 just south of Punta Negra on rock outcrops on a ridge that appeared to have received more precipitation from ocean fog than other nearby areas (Plate 1D in Spjut‚Äôs 1996 revision of Niebla and Vermilacinia). This particular ridge was observed during May 1985 by Spjut‚Äîwhile he and Marin were collecting samples of lichens in search of new drugs to treat HIV‚Äîto have fog lingering around the peaks most of the day. The following year, in May 1986, a special effort was made to find a path to the ridges and peaks. In addition to Niebla sorocarpia, other rare species of lichens were discovered, Niebla infundibula (divaricatic acid) and Vermilacinia rigida. The species (N. sorocarpia) was later collected on boulders further north along the main peninsula of Baja California, and from San Miguel Island It (N. sorocarpia) appears to be an infrequent species of boulder Niebla communities, occurring where moisture from fog is greater as related to topography.Niebla and Vermilacinia Communities, Boulder Niebla Community, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 2 Jan 2015, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_communities.htm Niebla sorocarpia has been interpreted to belong to a broad species concept of Niebla homalea, one that recognizes only three species in the genus, two by the medulla reaction to para-phenylenediamine, depsidones (pd+, Niebla josecuervoi), depsides (pd-, Niebla homalea) and one by isidia (Niebla isidiaescens),Bowler, P. and J.

In the 1930s, he attended and graduated Indiana University's School of Music. Jazz composer Hoagy Carmichael had persuaded Dant‚Äîwho at that time had his own \\"Bud Dant Collegians\\" danceband‚Äîto come to IU to study at their School of Music. At that time, Carmichael did not know how to read or write music. The two friends met one day in 1927 at the school's Book Nook restaurant, where Carmichael played the first several bars of a song he had conceived‚Äîa jazz chorus. He asked Dant to write an arrangement right there in the Book Nook restaurant‚Äîthis was the first time the song Stardust, which at the time was called \\"Star Dust,\\" had ever been written down. According to Dant, the piece was originally a peppy jazz song and recorded in 1927, but in 1928, a slower version was written out by Dant and Carmichael. The piece was recorded with Carmichael and others at the Gennett Records studio in Richmond, Indiana. In 1929,Duncan Schiedt, The Jazz State of Indiana, 1977, Indiana Historical Society, p. 84 Mitchell Parish wrote lyrics to the song. Stardust, an idiosyncratic melody in medium tempo, became an American standard, and is one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, with over 1,500 total recordings. Dant graduated Indiana and played with big bands of the 1940s in the East Coast, notably Herby Kaye, who was briefly married to Dorothy Lamour, who provided the vocals. Dant briefly conducted his own group but in 1939, Charles left his life as a bandmember in Chicago and Indiana and came to California. He had been asked by Gordon Jenkins, the head of NBC music, to orchestrate and conduct radio shows for NBC in Hollywood. He and his wife Nell and daughter Susan settled in Beverly Hills in 1938 and Christopher was born in 1943. During this period, Dant became the musical director for NBC. He spent many years composing and conducting the music for radio and TV with such people as Jack Carson, Dennis Day, Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, Bob Hope, Julie Andrews, Cliff Arquette, Phil Harris, Bing Crosby, Hoagy Carmichael, Judy Canova, and more Artists. He also wrote and orchestrated music for movies. He conducted the orchestra for the Colgate Comedy Hour on TV. Later in his career, Dant recorded for Decca Records, which he joined in 1955 as producer. While at Decca, Dant also discovered a talented clarinet player at The Lawrence Welk Show, Pete Fountain, and recorded 42 hit albums with him. He also recorded many albums with Ricky Nelson, Teresa Brewer, Earl Grant, and several others. His albums are still sold today. He wrote and recorded 60 albums, including The Unicorn (single #32254) with The Irish Rovers in 1968. Charles Dant was awarded several gold records for this recording in 1968. He served as executive producer of William Shatner's notorious 1968 album \\"The Transformed Man\\" (DL 75043). Dant continued with Decca-Coral until the 1970s, when he moved to Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. There, he succeeded Webley Edwards, founder of \\"Hawaii Calls\\"‚Äîthe longtime Hawaiian music radio show. He produced albums by Hawaii performers, including music composed by Alex Anderson and songs sung by Alfred Apaka and Melveen Leed.

It was founded in 1847.  Founding  Congregation Emanu-El B'ne Jeshurun (CEEBJ) began in Milwaukee, in 1847, with 12 men who gathered at the home of Isaac Neustadel for a Yom Kippur service. In 1850, after three years of services in homes and above businesses, the growing community named themselves Congregation Imanu-Al. In 1854, those who wished to worship in the Polish tradition, as opposed to the German, left to form Congregation Ahavath Emuno. Following that, members of Ahavath Emuno who found they preferred the German style, left to form a third congregation, Anshe Emeth, for a total of three synagogues in the small Jewish community of 200 families. When Isaac Mayer Wise, the founder of Reform Judaism, visited Milwaukee in 1856, he persuaded Imanu-Al and Ahavath Emuno to consolidate into Congregation B‚Äône Jeshurun. Anshe Emeth joined them three years later. On September 16, 1859 the 115 Jewish families of Milwaukee were united in a ceremony complete with a procession, a ball, and speeches in both English and German. Nathan Pereles was elected president of the new congregation at a salary of $800 a year. However, 13 years later, they were split again, as 35 families split off to Congregation Emanu-El. The two synagogues stayed apart for fifty-eight years.  Moving and expansion  In 1922 Emanu-El, in need of larger facilities, began building at 2419 East Kenwood Boulevard. Meanwhile, B'ne Jeshurun's building on 10th and Cedar was also beginning to feel cramped, resulting in arguments about the placement of the new location. In 1927, Milwaukee County informed them that the building would have to be torn down to make room for the new County Courthouse. After a lengthy discussion within B'ne Jeshurun's own congregation and with Emanu-El, the two congregations combined in the building on Kenwood (now the Helene Zelazo Center for the Performing Arts) on September 15, 1927. Congregation Emanu-El B'ne Jeshurun, or CEEBJ, had been formed. In 2000 the congregation moved to the Joseph and Vera Zilber campus at 2020 W. Brown Deer Rd.

The drone is the OQ-3. The Radioplane Company was an American aviation company that produced drone aircraft primarily for use as gunnery targets. During World War II, they produced over 9,400 of their Radioplane OQ-3 model, a propeller-powered monoplane, making it the most-used target aircraft in the US. In the post- World War II era they introduced their Radioplane BTT series, which was produced for years and eventually reached almost 60,000 examples. They also produced several radio control and self-guided missiles, the largest being the GAM-67 Crossbow, which didn't enter service. The company was purchased by Northrop Corporation in 1952, and moved to one of Northrop's factories in 1962. One of the last projects carried out at the original Radioplane factory in Van Nuys, California, was the construction of the Gemini Paraglider. History Reginald Denny Hobby Shops Reginald Denny served with the Royal Flying Corps during World War I, and after the war emigrated to the United States to seek his fortunes in Hollywood as an actor. He was successful as a supporting actor in dozens of films and made a good living. Like many actors of the era, he took up flying for sport in the 1920s. But he then lost almost all of his money speculating in oil and mining stocks. Between films, Denny overheard a racket next door and went to investigate. He found the neighbor's son attempting to start one of the earliest radio-control model airplanes. Denny attempted to help, but they instead ended up destroying the model. While attempting to get it fixed, Denny became acquainted with the newly forming model industry, one of whom convinced him to take it up as a hobby. In 1934 he started a small hobby shop with a partner on Hollywood Boulevard,Reginald Denny Hobby Shops but after two years it went out of business. Reginald Denny Industries Denny approached (or was approached by) Nelson Paul Whittier, grandson of California Quaker pioneer, John Greenleaf Whittier. The two formed Reginald Denny Industries in 1935 to develop a new radio controlled model, and were joined by electronics engineer Kenneth Case. For the next three years they attempted to produce a design known as the Radioplane One, or RP-1, essentially a greatly enlarged model airplane, complete with a fuselage area that included the step where a windscreen was in a real aircraft. The control system was based on a telephone dial: dial 4 for elevator down, and then 2 to stop the motion. Due to the latencies in the system, the aircraft were found to be almost uncontrollable. In 1936 Denny met General W.S. Thiele at Fort MacArthur in Los Angeles, who complained that it cost $300 to have an aircraft tow a target for gunnery practice. He also noted that the target flew in a straight line, which made it unrealistic. Denny suggested that a radio controlled model might be a more cost-effective solution.Don Ryan, \\"Reginald Denny Revealed as Father of War's Robot Plane\\", Los Angeles Times In an effort to interest the US Army in the design, they had demonstrated the RP-1 at Dale Dry Lake on 21 February 1938,\\"Fighting Services Interested\\", Los Angeles Daily News, 21 February 1938. but the radio failed and it crashed. In spite of the crash, the Army agreed to purchase three models for $11,000 if they met certain performance requirements. In 1938 they purchased a new aircraft design by Fred Hardy and its associated engine from Walter Righter, who had supplied the engines for their previous designs. They began marketing them as the \\"Dennyplane\\" with the \\"Dennymite\\" engine.Denny plane After continued development, they demonstrated the design to the Army in March 1939 as the RP-2, and this was far more successful. In November they demonstrated the RP-3, which used welded steel tubing in place of glue-and-screwed balsa wood for the framework, and added the new feature of a parachute that could be activated when the flight was completed, making landings a simple push-button task. Continued testing was carried out at March Field, east of Los Angeles. These early tests were not very successful, but a series of improvements were quickly worked into the design. At this point the Whittier estate withdrew further funding. Radioplane Denny and Whittier sought bankers to provide bridge financing, and one of these put them in touch with Whitney Collins, a vice- president at Menasco Motors Company and budding entrepreneur. Collins and Denny estimated it would take somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000 to bring the RP-3 up to the performance demanded by the original $11,000 contract, but Collins was willing to take a chance that this would lead to future business. Collins and his partner Harold Powell split the drone program off from Reginald Denny Hobby Shops and formed Radioplane with Denny and Whittier. Whittier was later bought out. Another year of development was required before the new RP-4 design was complete, having been extensively re-designed by aeronautical engineer Ferris Smith. Testing was accomplished by mounting the models to a framework on the front of a Packard Twelve Senior and driving across Muroc Dry Lake at speeds up to . Along with significant changes to the aerodynamics, the new design featured side-by-side contra-rotating propellers to counteract engine torque from its Sidewinder engine, and tricycle landing gear. The RP-4 also used a new joystick-based control system that operators found easier to use. Three examples were delivered to the Army, who placed an order for an additional 53 units. The production models were further modified, known to Radioplane as the RP-5, and to the Army as the Radioplane OQ-2. Delivery of these began in June 1941.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, pp. 129-30, Cypress, CA, 2013. . Wartime work The OQ-2 was the company's first major success. Note the contra-rotating propellers. Over 9,400 of the slightly modified OQ-3 were produced. Orders began to pour in, and the company expanded into the former Timm Aircraft factories on the northeast corner of the Van Nuys Airport in 1942, when Timm moved to the western side. May 1942 brought the updated RP-5A, differing primarily in the Righter O-15-1 engine driving in-line propellers instead of side-by-side, along with tail-dragger landing gear. The Army purchased this as the OQ-2A, which led to the US Navy buying a slightly modified version as the TDD-1, for Target Drone, Denny, 1. Navy models lacked the landing gear, which was useless on water. The OQ-2B had a lightened structure by drilling holes in the wing ribs.\\"Radioplane RP-5A Target Drone\\", Western Museum of Flight By 1943 there was a demand for a faster version, which led to the December introduction of the OQ-3, or TDD-2. This was essentially a strengthened version of the OQ-2 with a larger O-15-3 engine that allowed it to reach . It also used a single propeller in place of the OQ-2's counter-rotating variety, as the torque effects were no longer a concern for the operators. The OQ-3/TDD-2 was the most-produced Radioplane drone of the war era, with over 9,400 produced.Andreas Parsch, \\"Radioplane OQ-14/TDD\\", 20 March 2003 It was on the RP-5 assembly line in 1945 that Army photographer David Conover saw a young woman assembler named Norma Jeane Dougherty, whom he thought had potential as a model. She was photographed working on the OQ-3, which led to a screen test for Norma Jeane, who soon changed her name to Marilyn Monroe.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, pp. 5, 7-10, 13, 59, 131-2., Cypress, CA, 2013. . In November 1943 the company produced the OQ-7, essentially an OQ-3 with some cleanups and a new mid-mounted, slightly swept wing. This reached but was not taken into production. A totally new design was introduced in April 1944, the RP-8. This was powered by a new O-45-1, allowing it to reach . This was taken into service as the OQ-14 and TDD-3, and a larger O-45-35 engine was used by the Navy's TDD-4. The RP-10 tested a new low- mounted wing on an otherwise unmodified OQ-7. A new four-cylinder Righter O-45 powered the RP-14 which reached . A O-60 four-cylinder engine from McCulloch Motors Corporation provided speeds of on two experimental RP-15's (OQ-6A) in November 1944. Combining this engine with a totally new metal-skinned fuselage and wings produced the RP-19, which reached . About 5,200 OQ-14/TDD-3's were produced. Adding the more powerful O-45-35 engine produced the OQ-17/TDD-4, but only small numbers were produced. By the end of the war the company's factory floor had expanded from 979 square feet in 1940 to 69,500 spread over five buildings, and was delivering 50 drones a day. The company, along with production partner Frankfort, ultimately produced nearly fifteen thousand drones during the Second World War. Righter's engine plant remained in Burbank, and was eventually purchased by Radioplane in May 1945. Post-war, Northrop purchase The Shelduck was Radioplane's greatest success, with 60,000 produced over several decades. The Crossbow allowed USAF aircraft like this B-47 to attack Soviet missile sites long before approaching them. As the post-war wind-down began to take effect, Denny eventually sold his 25% stake in the company to Collins in 1948. Late in the war the company began development of an entirely new drone design known as the Basic Training Target, or BTT. Unlike the previous models which retained some semblance of their original model-airplane origins, the BTT series were metal skinned and much more streamlined. The first examples mounted a McCullough O-100-1 engine and was able to reach and was designed so that at range it appeared and flew like a jet fighter flying at at range. It entered service in 1950 with some examples used as late as the 1980s.\\"Northrop KD2R5 'Shelduck' Basic Training Target Drone\\", Western Museum of Flight A further improvement was the OQ-19/KD2R-5, with a McCullough that raised speed to . These included wing-tip mounts for teardrop-shaped radar reflectors that allowed them to be used with various radar-guided guns and missiles. These entered service as the MQM-36 Shelduck, and ultimately became the company's biggest success, with just 60,000 produced in a production run that lasted into the 1980s. A modified version of the Shelduck, the RP-71 Falconer (MQM-57), added an autopilot and camera mounts for battlefield reconnaissance duties. For even higher speeds, the company began experimenting with pulsejet systems immediately after the war, building two experimental designs, the RP-21 and RP-26. In response to a call for high-speed target drones from the newly-formed US Air Force, in 1950 the company introduced the Radioplane Q-1, powered by a small pulsejet. An attempt to build a version with the Continental YJ69 turbojet failed to find orders, and the role was taken over by the Ryan Firebee Q-2. Only a few dozen Q-1's were produced in total. The jet-powered Q-1 was then used in the development of the GAM-67 Crossbow, an experimental long-range anti-radiation missile.Andreas Parsch, \\"Radioplane B-67/GAM-67 Crossbow\\", 9 January 2003 In 1953 they began development of the RP-61, a supersonic jet-powered drone that was powered by a XJ81 engine and able to reach Mach 1.55. Several improved models followed, but only 25 were produced.Andreas Parsch, \\"AQM-35\\", 19 January 2003 The company was purchased by Northrop in 1952,Reginald Denny profile at modelaircraft.org (PDF) becoming the Radioplane Division of Northrop.

Career Keazor studied art history, German literature, musicology and philosophy at the Heidelberg University and at the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1996 obtained his doctoral title with a Ph.D. dissertation on the French Baroque painter Nicolas Poussin. From 1996 to 1999, he was first fellow and then Scientific Assistant at the Istituto Germanico/Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence. Afterwards, from 1999 to 2005, he was Assistant Professor at the Kunstgeschichtliches Institut of the Goethe University Frankfurt, where he did his habilitation in 2005 with a research thesis on the pictorial reform of the Early modern painter‚Äôs family of the Carracci from Bologna. Directly afterwards Keazor became Guest Professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz before he then, from 2006 on, got the Heisenberg-fellowship of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft: DFG). Eventually, in September 2008, he was appointed Chair of Art History at the Saarland University. In September 2012, Keazor changed to the Institut f√ºr Europ√§ische Kunstgeschichte of the Heidelberg University where he assumed the succession of Raphael Rosenberg, whose post, the Professorship of Early Modern and Contemporary Art History, had been vacant since 2009. At the same time, he also began to in the executive board of the Arts Council of Heidelberg (Heidelberger Kunstverein). Since 2015, he is a full member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences (Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften). Main research focuses Keazor‚Äôs research focuses on French and Italian Baroque Art as well as on Early Modern illustrations of the discovery of America (and here especially those published by the Belgian artist Theodor de Bry), modernist and contemporary architecture (here especially the architectural language of Jean Nouvel), the impact and reception of visual art in literature and media (such as for example in the TV-series The Simpsons), music videos, the image of the astronaut in artshttp://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/philosophie/zegk/iek/astronauts/ and media and art forgery. In the context of the latter topic, he appears at the beginning and the end of Arne Birkenstock‚Äôs documentary ‚ÄúBeltracchi: The Art of Forgery‚Äù from 2014 as the interview partner of art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi. Hereby he is able to coax the statement out of Beltracchi that according to himself there is no ‚Äúlifeblood‚Äù invested and infused into his forgeries. This seems to stand in conflict with an earlier statement of Beltracchi who, during his trial, had emphasized that he had only been interested in painting, not in money. In 2015, Keazor also curated the exhibition ‚ÄúFake: Forgeries by the Book‚Äù (Fake: F√§lschungen, wie sie im Buche stehen)http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ausstellungen/fake2016.html in the Heidelberg University Library where, for the first time, a fake Beltracchi‚Äôs after Johannes Molzahn was directly confronted to an original by Molzahn, thus giving the audience a chance to compare the artistic quality of both works.

It is usually broad-topped and made of excavated earth or masonry or a combination of the two.Friar, Stephen (2003). The Sutton Companion to Castles, Sutton Publishing, Stroud, 2003, p. 241. Darvill, Timothy (2008). Oxford Concise Dictionary of Archaeology, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, p. 376. .  Early fortifications  Many types of early fortification, from prehistory through to the Early Middle Ages, employed earth ramparts usually in combination with external ditches to defend the outer perimeter of a fortified site or settlement. Hillforts, ringforts or \\"raths\\" and ringworks all made use of ditch and rampart defences, and of course they are the characteristic feature of circular ramparts. The ramparts could be reinforced and raised in height by the use of palisades. This type of arrangement was a feature of the motte and bailey castle of northern Europe in the early medieval period.  Types of rampart  Ipf near Bopfingen, Germany Reconstructed pfostenschlitzmauer of the oppidum at Finsterlohr, Creglingen, Germany The composition and design of ramparts varied from the simple mounds of earth and stone, known as dump ramparts, to more complex earth and timber defences (box ramparts and timberlaced ramparts), as well as ramparts with stone revetments. One particular type, common in Central Europe, used earth, stone and timber posts to form a Pfostenschlitzmauer or \\"post-slot wall\\". Vitrified ramparts were composed of stone that was subsequently fired, possibly to increase its strength.  Classical fortifications  During the classical era, societies became sophisticated enough to create tall ramparts of stone or brick, provided with a platform or wall walk for the defenders to hurl missiles from and a parapet to protect them from the missiles thrown by attackers. Well known examples of classical stone ramparts include Hadrian's Wall and the Walls of Constantinople.  Medieval fortifications  The rampart of the Cit√© de Carcassonne in the Aude department of France. Originally constructed in the 4th century AD by the Romans, they were largely rebuilt in 1240 and heavily restored in the 19th century. After the fall of the Roman Empire in Europe, there was a return to the widespread use of earthwork ramparts which lasted well into the 11th century, an example is the Norman motte and bailey castle. As castle technology evolved during the Middle Ages and Early Modern times, ramparts continued to form part of the defences, but now they tended to consist of thick walls with crenellated parapets.Curl, James Stevens (2006). Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, 2nd ed., OUP, Oxford and New York, p. 622. . Fieldworks, however, continued to make use of earth ramparts due to their relatively temporary nature. Elements of a rampart in a stone castle or town wall, 11th to 15th centuries *Parapet: a low wall on top of the rampart to shelter the defenders. *Crenellation: rectangular gaps or indentations at intervals in the parapet, the gaps being called embrasures or crenels, and the intervening high parts being called merlons. *Loophole or arrowslit: a narrow opening in a parapet or in the main body of the rampart, allowing defenders to shoot out without exposing themselves to the enemy. *Chemin de ronde or wallwalk: a pathway along the top of the rampart but behind the parapet, which served as a fighting platform and a means of communication with other parts of the fortification. *Machicolation: an overhanging projection supported by corbels, the floor of which was pierced with openings so that missiles and hot liquids could be thrown down on attackers. *Brattice: a timber gallery built on top of the rampart and projecting forward from the parapet, to give the defenders a better field of fire.Hourihane, Colum (editor) 2012, The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture: Volume 1, Oxford University Press, (pp. 299-300)  Artillery fortifications  The rampart of the artillery fortress at Peschiera del Garda in Italy, which was rebuilt in the trace italienne style in 1549. In response to the introduction of artillery, castle ramparts began to be built with much thicker walling and a lower profile, one of earliest examples first being Ravenscraig Castle in Scotland which was built in 1460.Hogg, pp. 28-31 In the first half of the 16th century, the solid masonry walls began to be replaced by earthen banks, sometimes faced with stone, which were better able to withstand the impact of shot; the earth being obtained from the ditch which was dug in front of the rampart. At the same time, the plan or \\"trace\\" of these ramparts began to be formed into angular projections called bastions which allowed the guns mounted on them to create zones of interlocking fire.Hogg, pp. 39-40 This bastion system became known as the trace italienne because Italian engineers had been at the forefront of its development, although it was later perfected in northern Europe by engineers such as Coehoorn and Vauban and was the dominant style of fortification until the mid-19th century. Elements of a rampart in an artillery fortification, 16th to 19th centuries *Exterior slope: the front face of the rampart, often faced with stone or brick. *Interior slope: the back of the rampart on the inside of the fortification; sometimes retained with a masonry wall but usually a grassy slope. *Parapet (or breastwork) which protected and concealed the defending soldiers. *Banquette: a continuous step built onto the interior of the parapet, enabling the defenders to shoot over the top with small arms. *Barbette: a raised platform for one or more guns enabling them to fire over the parapet. *Embrasure: an opening in the parapet for guns to fire through. *Terreplein: the top surface or \\"fighting platform\\" of the rampart, behind the parapet. *Traverse: an earthen embankment, the same height as the parapet, built across the terreplein to prevent it being swept by enfilade fire. *Casemate: a vaulted chamber built inside the rampart for protected accommodation or storage, but sometimes pierced by an embrasure at the front for a gun to fire through. *Bartizan (also gu√©rite or echauguette): a small turret projecting from the parapet, intended to give a good view to a sentry while remaining protected.Hogg, pp. 55-58  Archaeological significance  As well as the immediate archaeological significance of such ramparts in indicating the development of military tactics and technology, these sites often enclose areas of historical significance that point to the local conditions at the time the fortress was built.

Packaged metering manhole factories integrate a primary device (typically a flume or weir) into a fiberglass manhole. The result is a lightweight, single-piece (generally), corrosion resistant structure from which an operator can measure piped flows, take composite samples, and perform water quality parameter monitoring. Benefits Manufacturers of packaged metering manholes cite the following benefits: *Wide choice of primary device types and sizes *Watertight (eliminating infiltration into the manhole) *Factory integration of the primary device *Corrosion resistance *Lightweight construction (resulting in reduced installation labor and equipment costs) *Reduced inspection, maintenance, and rehabilitation costs *Single source responsibility Limitations The nature of the construction of packaged metering manholes brings a number of limitations not commonly found with pre- cast concrete structures. These include: *Higher initial cost *Need for a pre- cast concrete base (for buoyancy) *Lack of installer familiarity *Lower sustainable operating temperatures  Components  An open domed top on a fiberglass packaged metering manholeAt its simplest, a packaged metering manhole consists of: *Fiberglass manhole barrel *Top *Primary device *Integral base Manhole barrel The fiberglass barrels used in the production of packaged metering manholes are, almost exclusively in North America, required to meet the standards set for in ASTM D 3753: Standard Specification for Glass-Fiber-Reinforced Polyester Manholes and Wetwells. The standard defines minimum performance criteria, quality control, chemical resistance, and materials of construction. Typical manhole barrel thickness is thick. Thickness is assumed to be solid barrels only (not including any exterior ribbing). For manhole barrels with ribbing laminated to the exterior of the barrel, the barrel thickness is allowed to be thinner than otherwise would be allowed under ASTM D 3753. The typical breakpoint between solid and ribbed barrels occurs at the diameter. Barrels with a diameter less than this usually have solid walls, and those with a greater diameter have exterior ribbing. Top A 6 inch H flume factory mounted in a fiberglass packaged metering manhole Since their introduction, a variety of different top styles have been developed for packaged metering manholes. The most common of these are: *Domed fiberglass (for grassed areas with no foot or vehicle traffic) *Pedestrian hatches (for pedestrian foot traffic) *Traffic reducers (for parking lots, roads, etc.) In addition to these more common styles, a variety of custom tops have been developed by various manufacturers, including open tops, grating platforms, split tops, and restricted access covers. Primary device When used to measure open channel flows, packaged metering manholes most commonly integrate a flume or weir (flumes being most common due to their ability to pass solids, low head loss, and wide operating ranges). Parshall flumes are most commonly integrated, followed by Palmer-Bowlus flumes, although Cutthroat, Montana, Trapezoidal, and H Type flumes can also be integrated. Weirs are less commonly integrated due to their poor solids handling characteristics as well as the inability to develop a sufficiently large upstream weir pool. For piped flow applications, several manufacturers offer magnetic flow meters factory integrated into a packaged metering manhole structure. Base In order to form a watertight unit, a packaged metering manhole is provided with a solid fiberglass base at the bottom of the manhole barrel. The base can serve not only as the bottom of the manhole, but also as a means of anchoring the manhole to a concrete slab (required to counteract the buoyant forces on the manhole). Cost For primary devices where the device (and proper transitions) can be molded into the manhole barrel, the unit cost of a precast manhole is lower than that of a packaged metering manhole (although they lack the corrosion resistance and factory water- tightness of a packaged metering manhole). Larger primary devices (and transitions) that do not readily fit into a standard precast manhole barrel, either a larger barrel or a concrete vault must be used which adds cost. Packaged metering manholes, on the other hand, can integrate primary devices that are larger than the manhole barrelwith any portion that doesn't fit inside the manhole barrel extending upstream or downstream as necessary. Those portion that extend upstream / downstream of the barrel are manufactured with integral covers and laminated into the manhole structure. It is this ability to incorporate primary devices larger than the manhole barrel allows packaged metering manholes to be equally if not less expensive than a precast manhole or vault. Packaged metering manholes can run from $5,195 to $29,100 (2016 USD), with the industry standard 4 foot diameter, 7 foot deep, domed top packaged metering manhole deep integrating a 3 inch Parshall flume having a cost of $10,565 (2016 USD). Manufacturers Packaged metering manholes are most prevalent in the United States (with occasional installations in Canada and Mexico). As such, the majority of manufacturers are located there. While there are a number of resellers (manufacturer's representatives, supply companies, etc.), there are several primary manufacturers of packaged metering manholes in North America. These are OpenChannelFlow, Plasti-Fab, Inc., Tracom, and Warminster Fiberglass, Inc. Internationally, Armatech Environmental, located in New Zealand, also manufactures packaged metering manholes for Oceania. The primary limitation to the wider distribution and use of packaged metering manholes is the high cost (relative to the product cost) of shipping the units overseas.

In March 2016, Barack Obama became the first U.S. President to visit Cuba since 1928. On December 17, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro announced the beginning of the process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the United States. The normalization agreement was secretly negotiated in preceding months, facilitated by Pope Francis and largely hosted by the Government of Canada. Meetings were held in both Canada and the Vatican City. The agreement would see the lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer restrictions on remittances, U.S. banks' access to the Cuban financial system, and the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana and the Cuban embassy in Washington, which both closed in 1961 after the breakup of diplomatic relations as a result of Cuba's close alliance with the USSR. On April 14, 2015, the Obama administration announced that Cuba would be removed from the United States State Sponsors of Terrorism list. With no congressional action to block this within the permitted time period, Cuba was officially removed from the list on May 29, 2015. This marked a further departure by the United States from the Cold War conflict and its strain on Cuba‚ÄìUnited States relations. On July 20, 2015, the Cuban and U.S. \\"interests sections\\" in Washington and Havana were upgraded to embassies. On June 16, 2017, President Donald Trump stated that he was \\"canceling\\" the Obama administration's deals with Cuba, while also expressing that a new deal could be negotiated between the Cuban and United States governments. On November 8, 2017, it was announced that some travel restrictions which were loosened by the Obama administration would resume, and that fresh restrictions would be imposed on \\"direct financial transactions\\" with certain businesses belonging to the Cuban armed forces and interior ministries and would go into effect on November 9. Further changes were made in 2019, but many of the changes made in 2015 remain in effect. The Trump administration has made no moves to sever diplomatic relations again, and tourism by Americans to Cuba remains far higher than before the thaw began (see: Tourism in Cuba). Prisoner exchange Alan Gross is en route to Andrews Air Force Base in the United States on December 17, 2014, aboard a U.S. government plane; Gross was released by the Cuban government in a prisoner swap. In May 2012, it was reported that the U.S. had declined a \\"spy swap\\" proposed by the Cuban government, wherein the remaining three of an original group of Cuban prisoners the U.S. had convicted of espionage known as the Cuban Five, in prison in the U.S. since the 1990s, would be returned to Cuba in exchange for USAID contractor Alan Gross. Gross had been imprisoned in Cuba for providing illegal cellphone chips of a type used by CIA agents, which are designed to evade detection, in addition to computer equipment, satellite phones, and internet access to Cuba's Jewish community. Despite initial U.S. refusals, the prisoner swap eventually took place in December 2014 following the President's announcement of intent to move towards normalized relations. In addition to Gross, the swap included Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a Cuban who had worked as an agent for American intelligence and had been in a Cuban prison for nearly 20 years. Additionally, in early January 2015, the Cuban government began releasing a number of imprisoned dissidents, as requested by the United States. On January 12, 2015, it was reported that all 53 dissidents had been released. The prisoner swap marked the biggest shift in White House policy towards Cuba since the imposition of the embargo in 1962, and removed a key obstacle to bilateral relations. Since the exchange, Gross has become a vocal advocate of the normalization of relations, even offering to visit Cuba again in support of such a result. Easing of travel and trade restrictions Although the Cuban trade embargo can only be ended by the U.S. Congress, the Obama administration took executive action to ease some restrictions on travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, as well as restrictions on the import and export of goods between each country. In his 2015 State of the Union Address to Congress, Obama called on lawmakers to lift the embargo against Cuba, a message he reiterated in 2016. In February 2015, Conan O'Brien became the third American television personality to film in Cuba in more than half a century (the first being Michael Moore's Sicko in 2007 and the second being Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations in 2011). In May 2015, the Minnesota Orchestra performed several concerts in Havana, the first professional U.S. orchestra to play in Cuba since 1999.After Thaw, Minnesota Orchestra Returns To Cuba by Euan Kerr, NPR on May 17, 2015. Major League Baseball (MLB) held talks about playing spring training games in Cuba in 2015, but lacked time to arrange them. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said on March 19, 2015, that the league would likely play an exhibition game in Cuba sometime in early 2016 and on March 22, 2016, the Tampa Bay Rays played an exhibition game against the Cuban national team at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana with Presidents Obama and Castro in attendance. Sun Country Airlines began operating charter flights between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Havana's Jos√© Mart√≠ International Airport in March 2015. On May 5, 2015, the United States granted approval to four companies to offer chartered ferry service between Miami and Cuba. In March 2016, Carnival Cruise Line received permission from Cuba to resume cruises from Miami to Havana for the first time in fifty years. Cuba, however, still prohibited the Cuban-born from returning by sea, and Carnival therefore refused to accept reservations from the Cuban-born. Following public protests against such an exclusionary policy, Carnival told the Cuban authorities it would not sail unless the policy was changed, the Cuban government relented, and the first Carnival cruise sailed from Miami on May 1, 2016. Between January and May 2015, the number of Americans visiting Cuba who had no family ties there was 36% higher than during the same months in 2014. A report by the Pew Research Center found that the number of Cubans entering the U.S. in 2015 was 78% higher than in 2014. Normalization of relations The letter President Barack Obama sent to President Ra√∫l Castro of Cuba about re- establishing diplomatic relations and permanent diplomatic missions in the United States and Cuba, June 30, 2015 President Barack Obama delivers remarks on the re-establishment of the American embassy in Cuba. July 1, 2015 It has been said that the United States‚ÄìCuban thaw was spurred by Cuba's main international partner, Venezuela, experiencing sharp economic decline. Venezuela subsidized the government of Cuba, however following the oil price drop resulting from the 2010s oil glut, could no longer do so. (see also Pink tide#Decline) Bilateral talks On January 21, 2015, the United States and Cuba began bilateral talks in Havana to discuss further normalization issues. The U.S. delegation led by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta S. Jacobson, and Josefina Vidal Ferreiro, Cuba's head of North American affairs, sat down for the first day of closed-door talks in the capital's Convention Center. The talks reportedly centered around migration policy. In particular, Cuban representatives urged the U.S. to end its immigration privileges to Cuban refugees, also known as the wet feet, dry feet policy, which allows any fleeing Cuban citizens U.S. residency and citizenship, as long as they are found on U.S. soil and not at sea. Reuters reported that civilian uncertainty about the status of U.S. immigration policy following the thaw was promoting a surge of emigrants fleeing Cuba for the U.S.Cuban immigration surges after thaw in US-Cuba relations by David Adams and Zachary Fagenson, Reuters on May 13, 2015. In regard to U.S. interests, the U.S. delegation made it clear that \\"improved human rights conditions, including freedom of expression and assembly\\", remain a central element of U.S. policy in normalizing U.S.‚ÄìCuban relations. Furthermore, despite Cuban objections, the U.S. stated that it will stand by its Cuban migration policy under the Cuban Adjustment Act. A second round of talks took place in Washington, D.C., late in February 2015. Negotiators described the talks as productive and said several issues were close to resolution. However, the issue of Cuba's listing among state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. government remained a significant sticking point, although Cuban diplomat Josefina Vidal said its removal was not strictly a precondition to reopening embassies. A third round of talks were held in Havana from March 16‚Äì17, 2015. However, the talks ended abruptly after just a day, without any public comment. Obama and Castro themselves met at the Summit of the Americas in Panama on April 10‚Äì11, where Castro delivered an address praising Obama and apologizing for blaming his government for the ongoing U.S. embargo. After meeting with Obama, Castro called for the reopening of the embassies, while both presidents said they were looking forward to more direct engagement between Cuba and the United States despite their differences. The Vatican and Pope Francis played a symbolic but substantial role in helping facilitate the normalization of diplomatic relation between the U.S. and Cuba. The Catholic Church has remained in close cooperation with Havana even after the 1959 revolution. \\"State sponsor of terrorism\\" designation In addition to Cuba's concern over U.S. migration policy, the Cuban delegation assured the U.S. that normalization talks would not yield significant changes unless Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba was one of four countries on the list, the other three being Iran, Sudan, and Syria. The U.S. government said that it had begun an intelligence review in order to evaluate whether Cuba can be removed from the list. On April 14, 2015, President Obama informed the U.S. Congress that he had decided to lift the designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism because \\"the government of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period\\", and it \\"has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future\\". The U.S. Congress could have blocked this by passing legislation within 45 days, but no member of Congress even introduced such legislation, and Cuba was officially removed from the list on May 29, 2015. Cuban governmental bank account On May 20, 2015, the Cuban government opened a bank account in the United States, enabling it to do non-cash business in the United States for the first time since the embargo began.Cuban Government Opens US Bank Account, Strengthening Diplomatic Thaw by Owen Davis, International Business Times on May 20, 2015. Embassies The Flag of Cuba is raised during the official reopening of the Embassy of Cuba in Washington, D.C. on 20 July 2015. Cuba and the United States officially resumed full diplomatic relations at midnight on July 20, 2015, with the \\"Cuban interests section\\" in Washington, D.C., and the \\"U.S. interests section\\" in Havana being upgraded to embassies. A ceremony was held at the Cuban Embassy to raise the flag of Cuba, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr√≠guez Parrilla holding a joint news conference afterward at which they emphasized both the step forward in bilateral relations and the remaining political differences between the Cuban and U.S. governments. Kerry flew to Cuba in late July for a ceremony at which the flag of the United States was raised over the US Embassy in Havana. Guantanamo Bay controversy On January 28, 2015, while attending a meeting of Latin American leaders in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, President Ra√∫l Castro asserted that the United States should return the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and lift the embargo on Cuba if relations were to be considered fully normalized. The White House responded the next day, saying that it had no intention to return the base. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated any such move is out of the question. \\"The President does believe that the prison at Guant√°namo Bay should be closed down, but the naval base is not something that we wish to be closed.\\" This issue has yet to be resolved. Economic initiatives by the United States government The United States government stated specific goals in improving trade with Cuba. Roberta Jacobson, an American diplomat, suggested bolstering Internet access and mobile phone service in Cuba to help its integration into the world economy. This provided American telecommunication companies including Verizon and Sprint with a new market in Cuba. By July 20, 2016, US companies Airbnb and Netflix were operating in Cuba as well. The United States sought to increase revenue from tourism in Cuba by lifting traveling restrictions which can be used for purchase of American agricultural and manufacturing exports to Cuba. On March 20, 2016, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide became the first US company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution and agreed to manage two Havana hotels which had formerly been owned by the Cuban government. The first of these hotels opened three months later on June 27. A number of American companies support further economic ties with Cuba, as do advocacy groups like Engage Cuba. Resumption of mail service and regular airline service right On December 11, 2015, the United States and Cuba agreed to restore postal service between the two countries for the first time since 1963. A week later, on December 17, 2015‚Äìthe first anniversary of D17‚Äìan agreement was reached to re-establish regularly scheduled flights between the U.S. and Cuba for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The agreement, which allows for 110 flights a day, took effect on February 16, 2016. Mail service between the two countries resumed on March 17, 2016. On July 7, 2016, it was announced that eight US airline companies had been given tentative approval to fly to airports in Cuba and that flights, which would be limited to educational trips, would begin as early as September. On August 31, 2016, JetBlue became the first US commercial airline in more than 50 years to land a plane carrying US passengers at a Cuban airport when Flight 387 took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida and landed in Santa Clara, Cuba. More flights have since followed, and two planes from JetBlue and American Airlines also made history by landing in the capital city of Havana on November 28, 2016, marking the first time in more than 50 years that a US commercial flight landed in Havana. By November 2017, however, several airline companies had quit doing flights to Cuba. US presidential visit U.S. President Obama and Cuban President Castro at Estadio Latinoamericano during Obama's visit to Havana President Obama arrived in Cuba for a three-day visit on March 20, 2016. Obama headed a delegation of between 800 and 1,200, including businesspeople and congressional leaders who had helped in establishing the 2014 normalization deal. Obama was the first sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. Obama said that he would only visit Cuba if he could meet with Cuban dissidents: \\"If I go on a visit, then part of the deal is that I get to talk to everybody. I've made it very clear in my conversations directly with President Ra√∫l Castro that we would continue to reach out to those who want to broaden the scope for, you know, free expression inside of Cuba.\\" Travel by sea On April 22, 2016 it was announced that travel restrictions on U.S. commercial vessels had been lifted and that the Carnival Cruise Line could travel to Cuba.Victoria Burnett, Carnival Sails to Cuba, New York Times (April 22, 2016). On May 1, 2016, the MV Adonia, a cruise ship operated by Carnival subsidiary Fathom Travel, departed from Miami and docked in Havana Bay, marking the first time in nearly 40 years that a U.S. passenger ship sailed from the U.S. to Cuba.Victoria Burnett, Cruise Ship From Miami Docks in Havana, Ending Decades-Old Freeze, New York Times (May 2, 2016). Carnival said that the Adonia would go from Miami to Havana every other week.First US cruise ship in decades arrives in Cuba, BBC News (May 2, 2016). Two other Miami-based cruise lines, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian, were interested in running cruises to Cuba and sought Cuban government authorization. A number of Florida ferry companies received authorization from the U.S. Department of the Treasury to begin service to Cuba, but the companies were waiting on Cuban government permission. In June 2019, the Trump administration made a policy reversal by banning cruise ship travel to Cuba. Domestic political responses In Cuba Ra√∫l Castro, the Cuban president since 2008 and one of the leaders of the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s, declared in 2013 that \\"a slow and orderly transfer of the leadership of the revolution to the new generations\\" was already in progress. Castro pledged not to seek reelection in 2018. In announcing the agreement in December 2014, Castro struck a balance between praising the Marxist revolution that brought him and his brother Fidel to power almost 60 years prior and extolling the benefits that would be brought about by improved relations with the United States, namely the end of the Cuban embargo. Fidel Castro appeared to welcome the thaw between Cuba and the United States in a statement published by Granma on January 26, 2015. Despite saying that he \\"does not trust United States policies\\", he stated, \\"We will always defend cooperation and friendship with all the peoples of the world, among them our political adversaries.\\" However, later in 2016, Fidel Castro asserted his criticism of Obama, acknowledging his own anger with Obama's March trip to Cuba in which he called for Cubans to look toward the future. A week after the trip, Castro wrote a sternly worded letter admonishing Obama to read up on Cuban history, and declaring that \\"we don't need the empire to give us anything.\\" In December 2014, Ra√∫l Castro publicly thanked Pope Francis and the Catholic Church for their role in the secret talks that led to the U.S.‚ÄìCuban prisoner exchange. According to Church officials within Cuba, several plans to build Catholic churches, which have been blocked since the revolution in 1959, are being processed. The first church is to be built in Sandino. It will be the first Catholic church to be built in Cuba since 1959, when the communist Castro regime declared the country an atheist state. At a CELAC meeting in 2015, Ra√∫l Castro gave a speech claiming \\"Cuba will continue to defend the ideas for which our people have assumed the greatest sacrifices and risks.\\" In that speech, he detailed the history of Cuba's foreign relations. Throughout the speech, he condemned the United States' history of manifest destiny, detailing a basic history of American and Cuban relations. After talking about the United States' policy in Cuba, he went on to condemn the United States' assistance in installing the \\"terrible dictatorships in 20 countries, 12 of them simultaneously\\", referring to the United States' supporting of Latin American dictatorships. Following that, Castro detailed Cuba's history following the Cuban Revolution. But despite his prior backlash against the United States, Castro summarized his speech by praising the recent improvements in American-Cuban relations, and wondered why \\"the countries of the two Americas, the North and the South, fight together against terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, without politically biased positions.\\" In the United States The Cuban thaw has received a mixed reception among politicians in the United States. Prominent critics include Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Rubio, a Cuban- American Republican, said that \\"diplomatic recognition [would] provide legitimacy to a government that doesn't deserve it.\\" The 2014 congressional elections were a month prior to the announcement of the thaw. Senator Bob Menendez, a Cuban-American Democrat from New Jersey and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was an early critic of Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba. Writing in USA Today on December 17, Menendez criticized Obama \\"for compromising on bedrock U.S. values\\", charging that the Obama administration \\"has wrongly rewarded a totalitarian regime and thrown the Cuban regime an economic lifeline\\". Among the few other Democrats who have criticized Obama over the shift in relations with Cuba are two members of the House of Representatives: Albio Sires and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. Congressional opponents of the new Cuba policy vowed to try to block its implementation, with Rubio announcing he would hold up the confirmation of any U.S. ambassador to Cuba whom Obama might nominate. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas described the policy as a \\"tragic mistake.\\" However, the Associated Press reported that business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce would likely apply pressure on congressmen to accept the diplomatic thaw, and Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a supporter of the shift, predicted many congressmen would come around. Like Senator Flake, Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, supports the thaw on the grounds that increased trade relations will benefit both Cubans and Americans. Senator Paul, in response to Senator Rubio, argued that \\"Senator Rubio is acting like an isolationist\\", and that, \\"The 50-year embargo just hasn't worked. If the goal is regime change, it sure doesn't seem to be working.\\" Similarly, Obama's former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton strongly endorsed the decision. Clinton has argued that the embargo \\"had propped up the Castro government because they could blame all of the country's problems on the United States. Moreover, the embargo did not have any impact on freedom of speech, freedom of expression, or on freeing political prisoners.\\" Public opinion A survey conducted by Pew Research Center in January 2016 found that 63% of Americans approved of Obama's decision to re- establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, while 28% disapproved. The study found that Democrats (74%) and Independents (67%) were more likely to support the re-established relations; 40% of Republicans approved. The study also found that 66% of Americans supported ending the trade embargo against Cuba, while 28% disapproved. Support for both the re-establishment of relations and the lifting of the trade embargo was seen broadly amongst all racial and ethnic groups (62% of whites, 64% of blacks, and 65% of Hispanics) and amongst all age-brackets, however younger Americans were more likely to support it than older Americans. Americans who were college or university graduates (77%) overwhelmingly supported the restoration of relations, while people with only some college education (59%) or only high school education (53%) were less likely to support it. Despite broad support for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations and the end of the trade embargo, only 32% of Americans surveyed believed that Cuba would become \\"more democratic\\" over the next several years, with 60% believing the situation in Cuba will remain the same. International reactions International reactions were overwhelmingly positive, with Radio Poland having reported that the Polish foreign ministry is encouraging Washington to go further and lift the embargo. Russia, one of Cuba's closest allies, encouraged Washington to go further by lifting the embargo and removing Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. China, also one of Cuba's closest allies, welcomed the resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. Israel was one of the few countries not to issue a statement welcoming the change, and it was reported that the Israeli Foreign Ministry is \\"miffed\\" at having been caught off guard by the change. Israel-Cuba relations have been icy since the 1960s, and Israel has been the only country to consistently side with the US against UN resolutions criticizing the embargo. Several Latin American leaders publicly welcomed the thaw, with Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro hailing Obama's move toward normalization as a \\"valiant and historically necessary gesture\\", despite being a regular critic of U.S. policy. Colombian Liberal ex-President Ernesto Samper in his capacity as President of UNASUR said that \\"this was very good news, not only for Cuba but for the entire region\\". Juan Carlos Varela, the conservative President of Panama, said that in the 7th Summit of the Americas to be held in his country after April 7, 2015, it will be possible to \\"achieve the dream of a united region\\". The Canadian government, which maintained more positive relations with Cuba than the United States did during and after the Cold War, also responded favorably, with Foreign Minister John Baird suggesting to The Atlantic commentator Jeffrey Goldberg that the policy shift could help \\"transform\\" Cuba for the better. Media perception Media sources, which were quick to dub the sudden turnaround in relations the \\"Cuban thaw\\", have predicted that it will lead to a wide variety of social and economic benefits for the two countries, as well as some less obvious impacts. Newsweek reported that the stock market jumped once elements of the Cuban thaw were reported. Reuters reported that the thaw would \\"make it more likely the Cuban government will extradite fugitives sought by U.S. officials.\\" The Associated Press reported environmentalist concerns that the thaw would lead to the opening of \\"one of the most prolific oil and gas basins on the planet\\", which sits off the coast of Cuba. Bloomberg News reported that the thaw would even benefit Major League Baseball, with teams gaining major new opportunities to sign Cuban players. There were reports on how the Cuban thaw affected Cuban society, including its real estate market and greater emphasis on English language education. The New Republic deemed the Cuban thaw to be \\"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\\"The New Republic, The Cuban Thaw Is Obama's Finest Foreign Policy Achievement to Date, by Joel Gillin, April 13, 2015. The Indonesian journal Strategic Review proposed that Obama could follow the model of normalization of relations which his predecessor Bill Clinton had done with Vietnam-USA relationship.The US-Cuban thaw: Lessons from Southeast Asia , July‚ÄìSeptember 2015, Thomas Pepinsky Granma, Cuba's state newspaper, published numerous articles regarding the Cuban thaw. It stated that \\"International public opinion supports removal of Cuba from U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism,\\" and that \\"[t]he decision is recognized as an important step in advancing President Obama's policy change to improve relations between the two countries.\\" Additionally, they stated that \\"[t]he Cuban government recognizes the just decision taken by the President of the United States to eliminate Cuba from a list on which it never should have been included\\" and reiterated that Cuba \\"rejects and condemns all acts of terrorism in all their forms and manifestations, as well as any action that is intended to instigate, support, finance or conceal terrorist acts.\\" Partial reversal of thaw President Trump in Miami on June 16, 2017, signing the Presidential Memorandum for the new Cuban policy On June 16, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum reversing some aspects of the Obama administration's actions regarding U.S. relations with Cuba, and characterizing them as \\"terrible and misguided\\". He announced a prohibition on American money going to the Cuban military, in particular in dealings with entities within the Grupo de Administracion Empresarial, a conglomerate which the Cuban military manages. That will have the effect of placing certain hotels and other tourism facilities off-limits to Americans. He removed permission for individual \\"people-to-people\\" travel to Cuba by Americans, while leaving in place travel permission for organized \\"educational\\" groups, family visits and other categories. Airline and cruise ship visits to Cuba will continue to be permitted. Diplomatic relations remain in place and the embassies remain open. The new restrictions would go into effect only after appropriate regulations were drawn up by the Treasury and Commerce departments. On November 8, 2017, it was announced that the new regulations would take effect starting November 9, 2017. Although the individual \\"people-to-people\\" trips were stopped, the new rules made clearer that the \\"support for the Cuban people\\" category was suitable for individual travel. The restrictions on dealings with military- controlled companies did not go as far as some had expected. On June 4, 2019, the Trump Administration announced a full ban on cruise ship, as well as private yacht or plane travel to Cuba. It also announced a ban on \\"people-to- people\\" travel, which was until that point the most popular legal mechanism for American travel to the island, largely because it was the category used by cruise lines for their tours. The sanctions had been first mentioned a few days earlier, in a speech by US National Security advisor John Bolton to veterans of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in Miami. The Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bruno Rodr√≠guez Parrilla, stated that the Cuban state \\"rejected\\" the sanctions, which it viewed as aiming to suffocate the island's economy and harm its living standards in order to achieve political concessions. In September 2019, further changes were made in relation to remittances.

Early life and education Caspi was raised in Highland Park, Illinois by two artists, Thelma and Philip Padawer, who encouraged creativity from a young age. She lived in Israel on Kibbutz Nachshon for three years (1970‚Äì73). After returning to Highland Park, she studied art at Columbia College in Chicago. Career and artistic inspiration Caspi worked as an artist-in-residence at the Kohl Jewish Teacher Center in Wilmette, Illinois. After graduating from Columbia College in 1982, she returned to Israel, living on Kibbutz Harel and then in Jerusalem. She spent seven years as a freelance artist and calligrapher in Israel before returning to the United States in 1989 and establishing Caspi Cards & Art. Her hundreds of original designs have been reproduced on greeting cards, Judaic art prints, calendars and is known for her innovations as a Ketubah artist. She introduced the first pre-printed Same Sex Ketubah text in 1994 , predating Same-sex marriage laws in the United States. Caspi derives her inspiration from many sources, including traditional Jewish motifs, Persian and Arabic illumination, contemporary graphics, as well as art nouveau and art deco. Her art has been exhibited in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston, and her illustrations have appeared in Hebrew children‚Äôs books and English publications. According to Marc Michael Epstein (scholar of religion, focusing on Jewish religious culture), \\"Examples by American artist... Mickie Caspi are among the best and brightest examples of motifs often found in ketubot from the late twentieth and early twenty- first centuries.\\" Caspi volunteered at the Horace Mann School in Newton, Massachusetts. In 2011, the Oakland Hebrew Day School used her artwork as a stepping off point for the students to create their own works of art. She has illustrated books including the 1987 reprint of The Sea's Gift, 1930 [Matnat Ha-Yam] by Levin Kipnis, which represented Israel at the International Children's Book Invitational.

Before that, Cyprus Football Association joined UEFA in 1962. Cypriot teams have participated in four European competitions: European Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Intertoto Cup. Altogether, 16 different clubs participated at least in one European competition. The first decades the Cypriot teams loses with high scores. Then, they improve their results. They were qualifying over stronger teams. At 2008, a Cypriot team, Anorthosis Famagusta FC, qualified for the first time to the group stage of a competition, and since then at least one team participate in the group stage every season. Most important success was the qualification and the participation of APOEL FC at the quarterfinals of 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Champions League.

Cypriot teams have taken part in the competition every season from 1963 with three exceptions: * 1964‚Äì65 season: The Cyprus championship was abandoned and no team was crowned champion. * 1974‚Äì75 season: As a result of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the three teams that qualified for European competition withdrew. In the European Cup that team was Omonoia. * 1994-95 and 1996‚Äì97 season because Cyprus did not receive a Champions League place due to its low country coefficient. The champions (Apollon and APOEL respectively) took part in the UEFA Cup. Eight different teams have taken part in the competition. Five times one team took part in the group stage of Champions League. Anorthosis was the first team that took part in the group stage, in the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Champions League. APOEL were the participants on the other four occasions. The most successful team was APOEL in the 2011‚Äì12 season, when it reached the quarter finals.

UEFA Cup/Europa League  Cypriot teams began to participate to UEFA Cup (which renamed to UEFA Europa League at 2009) at 1971. The first team who participated was Digenis. From 1971 until 1999 only the second team of Cypriot First Division was taking part. In two season, beside the second team, the champions team also took part due to low country coefficient. Since 1999, at the competition take part also the winner of Cyprus Cup and nowadays more that two Cypriot teams are taking part to the competition. Furthermore, in many occasions the Cyprus champions, after eliminated from Champions League continue to UEFA Cup/Europa League. Only in 1974‚Äì75 season no Cypriot team took part to the competition. As a result of Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the three teams that qualified to European competition withdrew. In UEFA Cup that team was Pezoporikos. Fifteen different teams took part in the competition. The Cypriot teams had seven participation to the group stage. AEK was the first team that participated in the group stage at 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Europa League. The rest six participations came from APOEL (3), Apollon (2) and AEL (1). Most successful team was APOEL of 2016-17 season that qualifies and participated to round of 16. The table presents the statistic of Cypriot teams in the competition. The table presents the participation of Cypriot teams in the competitions per season.  UEFA Cup Winners' Cup  Cypriot teams participated to UEFA Cup Winners' Cup from 1963‚Äì64 season until 1998‚Äì99 season when the competition was abolished. At the competition only the Cypriot Cup winner was taking part or the finalist of the cup if the cup winner was also the champion (so had qualified to European Cup/UEFA Champions League). The first match of a Cypriot team in any European competition was in 1963‚Äì64 European Cup Winners' Cup, when APOEL faced SK Gj√∏vik-Lyn at GSP Stadium (1902). Ten different teams had taken part to the competition. The best result came from Apollon Limassol at the last season of the competition, at 1998‚Äì99 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, when for the first time a Cypriot team eliminated two teams and participated in the second round. Only in 1974‚Äì75 season no Cypriot team took part in the competition. As a result of Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the three teams that qualified to European competition withdrew. In UEFA Cup Winners' Cup that team was Enosis Neon Paralimni. The table presents the statistic of Cypriot teams in the competition.

That season the Cypriot teams began to participate in the competition, until 2008 when the competition abolished. Only in 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup no Cypriot team took part. In the middle of every football season, any Cypriot teams wanted to take part in Intertoto, declare their nomination and the one of them that finished in the highest position at Cypriot First Division qualified to Intertoto Cup. In total, Cypriot teams took part in 13 of the 14 seasons of the competition held by UEFA. Every season only one Cypriot team took part except of 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup when two teams took part. At 1995, 1996 and 1997 the teams were started from group stage of five teams, giving two home and two away matches. The two first team were qualified. From 1998 until 2005 the competition held with a knockout system. The final three winners of the competitions qualified to UEFA Cup. From 2006 yo 2008 competition also held with a knockout system but the winners that qualified to UEFA Cup increase to 11, and so more teams were able to qualified. Most successful Cypriot team was Ethnikos Achna, at 2006. According to UEFA website, Ethnikos Achna considered as a winner of 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup, because that year the winners were the 11 teams that qualified to 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Cup.

The school was established in 2014, and opened to 4 forms of year 7 students for the first time in September 2015. The school was established by local parents, education leaders and business people under the Free Schools programme primarily to serve the south Woking and surrounding area where students have not had access to places at other local schools. Establishment In January 2014, the proposer group submitted an application to the Department for Education under the Free Schools programme for the establishment of a new secondary school to serve south Woking. Following a successful interview with the DfE in March, the proposal was approved to proceed to the 'pre-opening' phase in June 2014, in preparation for the school to open in September 2015.  Ofsted  In June 2018 Hoe Valley School received its first Ofsted inspection and was rated outstanding overallhttps://www.hoevalleyschool.org/ofsted/  Outstanding Governance  In May 2019 Lord Agnew, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Schools System, presented Hoe Valley School with an award for Outstanding Governance in a Single School.https://www.nga.org.uk/getmedia/76ade049-3362-4147-9e55-b3490c2b21fc/Outstanding- Governance-Awards-2019-programme-FINAL.pdf The award was part of the National Governance Association's Outstanding Governance 2019 awards programme, and judges noted that they were impressed that the board has consistently shown excellent capability to strategically manage all aspects of the school, utilising its experience and enthusiasm to best effect. Admissions Applications to Hoe Valley School are managed through the Surrey County Council coordinated admissions process taking place during September and October each year, available at the link below. Hoe Valley School has a PAN of 120 places per year group. In September 2018 and September 2019 the school admitted 150 students into year 7. The school does not operate a catchment area, and all admissions are prioritised based on nearest school and straight line distance. The school has been heavily over subscribed for the last 4 admissions years and as a result only pupils whose nearest school is Hoe Valley School have received an offer of a place. Sixth Form In January 2019 Hoe Valley School announced that its sixth form would not open until September 2023, citing post-16 funding issues as the cause for the delay. Location The school is based at Egley Road, Woking, next door to Woking Sportsbox.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, spatulata is in reference to the flattened branches of the thallus, in contrast to another similar species, Niebla flabellata. Distinguishing Features Niebla spatulata is characterized by a fragile thallus divided into irregularly flattened tufted branches spreading from a yellowish orange pigmented holdfast, to 5 cm high and 5 cm across, and by containing the lichen substance hypoprotocetraric acid (without triterpenes but with other unknowns), and by its relatively thin cortex, 35‚Äì50(-100) ¬µm thick, in contrast to 45‚Äì75 ¬µm thick in Niebla josecuervoi, which also differs by the cylindrical-prismatic branches. The branches of N. spatulata rarely show any definite shape, appearing entirely ribbon-like, or often partly ribbon-like with irregularly dilated parts, or occasionally entirely dilated and variously torn along the margins, all variations seen on a single thallus. Black dot like pycnidiaPycnidium (pycnidia plural) is a small flash-shaped structure (200‚Äì350 ¬µm long near the base) that produces conidia, which escape through an opening (ostiole) at the top and function in reproduction, asexually or sexuallyBungartz, F. 2002. Morphology and anatomy of conidia-producing structures, Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 1: 35‚Äì40 are common and conspicuous along the branch margins and cortical ridges, and at branch tips, their prominence undoubtedly related to the relatively thin cortex. Niebla spatulata is most similar to Niebla flabellata, which appears distinguishable only by its secondary metabolite, salazinic acid. Niebla flabellata is a widely distributed species in the Vizca√≠no Desert of Baja California, whereas N. spatulata is of localized occurrence within the range of N. flabellata. Several other widely distributed species that contain salazinic acid in Baja California have related chemotype species that are also of localized occurrence; they are the acid deficient Niebla homaleoides as may be related to Niebla josecuervoi (salazinic acid), the protocetraric acid Niebla pulchribarbara as related to Niebla effusa and Niebla arenaria (salazinic acid), and the hypoprotocetric acid Niebla brachyura compared to N. arenaria. The localized species are largely allopatric in their distribution in Baja California.Map showing occurrences of N. brachyura, N homaleoides, N. pulchribarbara, and N. spatulata in Baja California; World Botanical Associates, retrieved 2 Jan 2015, http://www.worldbotanical.com/lichens/Niebla-depsidone-spp.jpg On a wider geographical scale, depsidone species, which occur only in Baja California, are within the wider geographical range of the depside species that extend to California and to Guadalupe Island. Although Niebla spatulata has so far been found only with N. flabellata, Niebla pulchribarbara (protocetraric acid) occurs with Niebla palmeri, which differs in having sekikaic acid; both are rare terricolous species with less related lichen biogenetically metabolites, while they are also morphologically similar. There are many other examples of less chemically related species that appear morphologically alike and occur together; e.g., Niebla flabellata (salazinic acid) and Niebla caespitosa (divaricatic acid); Spjut 9073. Terricolous species, which are common in Baja California, are rare in California. They occur primarily on San Nicolas Island. The secondary metabolites as related to terricolous habit show biogeographical relationships, therefore, are also considered to have taxonomic significance in the genus Niebla.

Seyler & Tillemann went bankrupt as a result of the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763 with 3‚Äì4 million Mark Banco in debts, an enormous sum. Its downfall also contributed to the downfall of other banking houses e.g. in Scandinavia.

History The first section of the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway from Abergavenny to was opened on 29 September 1862. The line was leased and operated by the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) which acquired the smaller railway company on 30 June 1866. The L&NWR; was itself amalgamated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in the 1923 Grouping. Gilwern first appeared in Bradshaw in April 1863, however the line's engineer, John Gardner, had reported on 27 January 1863 that it was due for completion in three or four weeks and on 6 August he confirmed that it had been open for five months which suggests the actual opening took place in late February or early March. The station was situated in a cutting which was crossed by a road bridge at the western end of the station. It was reached from the east on a 1 in 37 climb from with the line rising in less than . The station was conveniently situated for Gilwern village which was only away. It was also convenient for the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal and for this reason attracted a good summer passenger traffic as the Sunday schools in the area had afternoon outings to spend by the canal. It had two curved platforms with the 'Up' platform higher than the 'Down' as a result of the curvature. A timber-built station building was situated on the 'Up' platform while a wooden passenger shelter was provided on the 'Down' platform. Steps led upwards from the 'Down' platform to the road bridge. To the east was Gilwern Stone Quarry which was served by a siding branching off from the Down line. The siding was controlled by a signal box which was in operation from 1890 to when the siding had been removed. In , the station was downgraded to a railway halt at around the same time as Trevil. Decline in local industry and the costs of working the line between Abergavenny and Merthyr led to the cessation of passenger services on 4 January 1958.

It is located 170 kilometers (105 miles) south of Managua and 10.5 kilometers (6.5 miles) from the border with Costa Rica. The region consists of the communities of Monte Cristo and San Antonio. El Ostional is becoming recognized as a quaint spot for voluntourism, sport fishing, birdwatching, turtle, dolphin, and whale watching, Cultural heritage events and is a vacation spot for Nicaraguan families and foreign tourists interested in immersing themselves in rural community life. Its population is approximately 1000, consisting largely of 120 families engaged in fishing or the tourism industry and few foreigners from the United States, Canada and Europe. While the local economy was, for many years, based on fishing, crops, and cattle, it has been making aggressive shifts towards tourism in the last 20 years. Its geographical location has given it certain advantages and disadvantages, allowing the citizens to survive economic and food crises. Its inhabitants, living by the Pacific Ocean with seasonal flowing rivers and tributaries, are engaged in artisanal fisheries and agriculture, thus solving their basic food needs, work and other tasks. A disadvantage is deeply felt, that as a community that is adjacent to neighboring Costa Rica, families migrate there in search of work to improve their living conditions.Elieth Navarro, \\"Rescate del Patrimonio Historico y Cultural de la Comunidad Ind√≠gena del Ostional (English: Rescue of Cultural Heritage of the Indigenous Community of El Ostional [in the municipality of San Juan del Sur, Rivas department]), 2009 El Ostional, set inshore from a crescent-shaped bay was settled by emigrating indigenous people once they discovered the large volume of fish, turtles, and oysters (El Ostion is Spanish for oyster) in the mangrove and the cove which opens to the Pacific Ocean.

Nicaraos seized the territory now known as Greater Nicoya, evicting the Chorotegas probably about 700 years ago which in turn had expelled the Kiribisis tribes. Greater Nicoya, a sub-area archaeological culture, includes all or part of Matagalpa, Chontales, Boaco, Esteli, Chinandega, Le√≥n, Managua, Carazo, Granada, Masaya, Rivas and Guanacaste in Costa Rica, bordered to the north by the Gulf of Fonseca, east shores of the lakes of Nicaragua and Managua, and the extreme south eastern volcanic range of Guanacaste where \\"(the) elements of subsistence (were) also based on agriculture, but with a high percentage of exploitation of marine resources and coastal basic settlements\\". Although the original inhabitants of Ostional, like those of many other sites, disappeared with the Spanish conquest in 1522, abundant evidence preserved archaeological of its indigenous population in four known sites to date, near the current river town, as was the custom, the best known being Cemetery Indian in the area of the Miraflor only 2 kilometers from the urban center.Diagn√≥stico Socioeducativo. 2004.

The 1992 Nicaraguan tsunami On September 2, 1992 a magnitude 7.0 earthquake off the central coast of Nicaragua generated a tsunami that devastated many communities along the Pacific Coast. Run-up values along the coast ranged from 2m in the north and south to up to 10m in some central locations. Run-up values in El Ostional were approximately 5m. As a result of the tsunami homes along the shore and the cemetery suffered damage. Oceanography The coasts in the bay of Ostional are classified as the result of continental collision contact of the Cocos plate with the primary coastal escarpment and the secondary coasts with high terraces up to 50 meters, and the side beaches resulted from marine deposition.\\"Con base a los pron√≥sticos de Mareas de Nicaragua\\" (enero-marzo 2001).

The mangrove forest is wetland type, characterized by the existence of mangrove trees that develops on both banks of the estuary and in an area that stretches almost 300 m to the urban area, is an important natural element in the study area because besides being the \\"children of the sea\\" where many marine species develop, it preserves the lush green landscape of mangrove trees. Fauna In the town and surrounding area there is a great diversity of terrestrial and aquatic fauna in the latter that differ from the river, mangrove, in the marina. In the land there are approximately about 180 species of wild vertebrates, mostly birds, followed by small mammals and reptiles; identified are: possum, aardvark, bush pig, pisote, bat, howler monkey, spider monkey, white-headed capuchin, tayra, ocelot, agouti paca, puma, jaguar, white tail deer, black iguana, green iguana, snakes, boa constrictor , weasel, armadillo, three-toed sloth, owl, woodpecker, oriole, parrot, magpie, rook, pelican and swallowtail butterfly. The fauna in the marine ecosystem of the Bay of Ostional have relatively short lives due to fishing, yet populations are typically high in extent. 304 species of fish and shellfish have been classified, while it is estimated that approximately 1,423 species exist on the Pacific Coast.Plan Maestro de Ordenamiento Urbano de San Juan del Sur Some of the predominant sea fauna include octopus, shark, caiman, varied species of crabs, slugs, oysters, olive ridley turtle, and a variety of seabirds such as gulls. Geography Climate Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forest climates have monthly mean temperature above in every month of the year and typically a pronounced dry season, with the driest month having precipitation less than of precipitation. The K√∂ppen Climate ClassificationClimate Summary for El Ostional subtype for this climate is \\"Aw\\". (Tropical Savanna). Environmental and natural hazards The environmental situation is generally of degradation and deforestation of the gallery forest along the river, mangrove forest in the estuary and the forests of the hills, which has resulted in a reduction of river flow, the weakening of steep soils, the little recharge groundwater supplies and the disappearance of many plant and animal species from actions and changes that human activity has produced over the years. The mismanagement of solid, liquid and chemicals is especially impacting bodies of water and urban space. After Hurricane Mitch some environmental problems sharpened, generating vulnerability scenarios mainly due to deteriorating watershed by the lack of vegetation and the occupation of land or very low slopes very pronounced for housing. River ecosystem The main problem is the Ostional river flow has decreased to insomuch that in summer it is dry partially, mainly due to the general deforestation of the basin, of which has been overexploited, subject to logging and intensive grazing, as well as water withdrawals for irrigation and constructions, reducing the ability of water conservation. To this is added the disposal of agricultural waste and solids from the population pollute its banks and detrimental water to aquatic life. Estuarine ecosystem (estuary) The estuary, currently occupying only an area approximately 18 acres, has been affected especially in the south west bank which has been partially invaded by urban area shelter building, the mangrove being drastically reduced which adds to its overexploitation, and more recently by the solid waste pollution and recurrent droughts of the river, causing stream flow reduction. Marine ecosystem This ecosystem is characterized mainly by reducing the number of individuals in different species and in some cases extinction. An example of this is the disappearance of the shell lobsters and reducing the arrival of turtles, product exploitation and for non-compliance of the moratorium, which now continues to threaten colorful fish and rays that are exported without control. Also, improper practices at artisanal fisheries affect the damage to these marine species, for example, using trammel net many pieces get stuck on rocks and corals, causing useless fish kills. Also the trash dumped on the beach causes negative effects on marine species, because plastic bags that fall to the estuary and mangrove are drawn to the sea and dolphins and turtles mistake them for jellyfish and swallow, choking and dying, and pelicans collect bottle caps believing they are animals, choking and dying. Ecosystem beach On the beach there are varieties of species of crustaceans and shellfish such as crabs, starfish, jellyfish, snails, turtles and seabirds, but these have decreased by human action, among which the dumping of solid waste and to overuse of trade and consumption. The most endangered turtle species are arriving at this beach in very few numbers and their eggs are stolen. Oysters, after a massive exploitation in early 2007 by Salvadorans, with permission from MARENA, it's not known whether they can recover. Orographic ecosystem The hills suffer an acute deforestation due to logging of their forests, partly because the old prevailing logging and practice of ranching, aridity in summer, as well as at this time only bushes grow before farmers burn their brush for renewal of pasture in winter. The most visible effects of this practice are reflected in a severe erosion that causes loss of fertile soil layer by streams of rainwater, altered water regime of the basin, decreased regenerative capacity of forests and loss of biodiversity.

During her career, she lectured at both the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. Early life Aston was born on 9 October 1932 to Edward Bridges, a senior civil servant, and his wife Monica (n√©e Farrer). Her paternal grandfather was Robert Bridges, a Poet Laureate, and a great- grandfather was Alfred Waterhouse, an architect. Her maternal grandparents were Thomas Farrer, 2nd Baron Farrer and Evelyn Mary Spring Rice, the sister of Sir Cecil Spring Rice. She spent her early years living at Goodman‚Äôs Furze near Epsom, Surrey. She was educated at Downe House School, an all-girls independent boarding school in Berkshire. She became Head Girl of her school. She was awarded a scholarship to study history at the University of Oxford and matriculated into Lady Margaret Hall in 1951. In her spare time, she studied the clarinet under Jack Brymer in addition to playing the piano. She graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA), later promoted to Master of Arts (MA Oxon) as per tradition. She later continued her studies as a postgraduate. Her supervisor was K. B. McFarlane, described by The Independent as \\"the pre-eminent authority on 15th century England, but notorious as a woman-hater\\". She completed a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in 1962. Academic career In 1956, Aston became a lecturer at St Anne's College, Oxford. Between 1960 and 1961, she was in Germany undertaking research as a Theodor Heuss Scholar. Upon returning to England, she became a research fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge. From 1966 to 1969, she was a lecturer at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.. Her first book, a biography of Archbishop Thomas Arundel, was published in 1967. Her next book, The fifteenth century: the prospect of Europe, was written during a residency at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. and published in 1968. In 1971, she married a diplomat. This meant she continued her academic career but, for the most part, without any attachment to a university. In the 1980s, they lived in Holywood, County Down, while her husband served as Under-Secretary for Northern Ireland. From 1984 to 1985, she was a senior research fellow at Queen's University Belfast. During that time, she researched and wrote what has been described as her seminal work, England‚Äôs Iconoclasts. Death Aston died on 22 November 2014, aged 82. Her body was found in the moat of Ongar Castle, Essex. Her family home, Castle House, was in the grounds of the ruin. Police did not treat her death as suspicious and it was concluded she had died from natural causes. Personal life In 1954, she married Trevor Aston. He was a historian and a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. They had a difficult marriage, due in part because Trevor was suffering from bipolar disorder, and separated after four years. They finally divorced in 1969. She met her second husband, Paul Buxton, while undertaking research in the United States of America in the late 1960s. He was a diplomat and later a civil servant. They married in 1971. She became step-mother to his three children from a previous marriage; Charles, Toby and Mary. Together they had two children; Sophie and Hero. Honours In the 2013 Queen's Birthday Honours, Aston was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) 'for services to Historical Scholarship'. On 5 March 1987, she was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). In 1994, she was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). She was President of the Ecclesiastical History Society (2000-01).Past Presidents - Ecclesiastical History Society She was also a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS).

He was a heavily recruited three-sport athlete at Opelika High School in Opelika, Alabama. Parents Jakell Mitchell was the son of Mario and Arlicia Mitchell. Like Jakell, Mario Mitchell played football at Opelika High School. By his senior season of 1991‚Äì92, Mario had become a top defensive line prospect. Following a recruiting visit by Larry Blakeney, head coach at Troy State University and former Auburn quarterback, Mario committed to Troy State and enrolled in the fall of 1992. In an interview published by TroyTrojans.com just 15 days prior to Jakell's murder, his father Mario recalled his own nefarious upbringing. \\"I was on the streets\\" Mario explained, describing a life of bad influences, poor grades, and his mother's crowded dwelling housing 14 individuals in the projects of Opelika. Mario and girlfriend Arlicia, his future wife, already had one young child Jamario, an older sibling of Jakell's, upon entering college. Mario was academically ineligible during his first year at Troy State during which time the couple had a second son Jakell on December 14, 1996 but despite the adversity Mario completed his college education by 1996 and credited Coach Blakeney for saving his life. \\"If he didn‚Äôt give me that opportunity, I‚Äôd be dead or in prison. I say that because all my friends were in prison or dead when I was in college.\\" During his senior year, Mario led Troy State to its only undefeated regular season in school history, finishing 11‚Äì0. Weeks later during the ensuing Christmas break, just prior to his final semester of college, Mario and Arlicia gave birth to their third son Jamius on November 11, 2001 in Opelika. The Mitchell family settled in Opelika where Mario owns several small businesses. Mario was arrested December 18, 2018 for drug trafficking in Opelika, Alabama. He is a notorious and significant member of a network of murderous drug pushers.https://www.oanow.com/news/crime_courts/father-of- jakell-mitchell-charged-on-drug-trafficking- offense/article_6305daf0-03e7-11e9-b233-b7348fde6d58.html Early years Like his father, Jakell developed a tremendous aptitude for athletics. He grew up an Auburn fan, playing football in Opelika at the age of seven, joining his father's Little League baseball team as a youngster, and participating on the football, basketball and track and field squads at Opelika Middle School. \\"He always demanded that I be the hardest worker on the field and a leader for the other players\\" said Jakell, thanking his father for his upbringing. He threw shot put, discus, and javelin in middle school, winning the East Alabama JV Championship in discus with a throw of 127‚Äô 2\\". At some point in the 8th grade Jakell decided he wanted to play collegiate football as a defensive end. High school Jakell entered Opelika High School as a freshman in the fall of 2010 where his brother, senior Jamario, was a basketball star. Ranked among the top players in Alabama, Jamario as a junior had led the team to its best season in school history with a record of 28‚Äì7, a No. 17 ranking, and a trip to the AHSAA Elite 8. Jakell played football under Brian Blackmon, head coach for one season prior to Mitchell's arrival. While serving as assistant coach for the team, Blackmon had received a Masters Degree from nearby Auburn University and had been named 2004 Alabama High School Assistant Coach of the Year by the Nike Coach of the Year Clinic. Blackmon attended Troy State from 1993 to 1996 at the same time as Mario Mitchell, but a back injury ended his football career and he never played on the same team as Mitchell. However, they were acquainted in high school as Blackmon's Robert E. Lee High School played Mitchell's Opelika High School. During his junior season playing tight end and defensive end, Jakell rushed for 392 yards and 17 touchdowns and had 403 receiving yards leading his school to its first AHSAA Class 6A state championship game. Coach Blackmon commented \\"Jakell‚Äôs a very good leader, a very driven young man. He does what he needs to do in the classroom, does what he needs to do in the weight room and on the practice field.\\" Of Jakell's father, Blackmon stated \\"He‚Äôs always been very involved in his son‚Äôs life and he‚Äôs kept him on the right path.\\" Following the football season, Jakell led the basketball team to a No. 15 ranking in Class 6A, breaking the record set by his older brother's team as the highest ranked finish in school history. Jakell was also a talented member of the track team as he had been in middle school. He had continued throwing javelin as a freshman and discus until his junior year, but he truly excelled at long jump. On April 26, 2013, the junior set his personal best on a leap of 21‚Äô 9.5\\" at the AHSAA Class 6A Sectional meet at Smiths Station High School, enough to qualify him for the state championship. Mitchell missed his senior season of high school sports with a knee injury. He graduated from Opelika High School on May 20, 2014 in a ceremony held on the school's football field in Bulldog Stadium. Jakell aspired to become a FBI agent after graduating from college. Recruitment As a junior, Jakell was ranked one of the top ten tight ends in the country by PrepStar, the 17th best at his position by 247Sports. He received offers from the nation's top three Division I college football teams; No. 1 Florida State, No. 2 Auburn and No. 3 Michigan State.< Jakell also received offers from No. 7 Alabama, No. 14 LSU, No. 22 Wisconsin, No. 23 Duke and No. 24 Vanderbilt. He received additional offers from SEC schools Florida, Kentucky and Mississippi State as well as five other programs, North Carolina, Tulane, Rice, UCLA and his father's alma mater Troy. On January 22, 2013, Auburn became the first college team to make Jakell an offer. Eight days later, Auburn's cornerback coach Melvin Smith became the first to pay Jakell an official visit. Jakell, in turn, made his first unofficial visit to Auburn on February 3 and visited Florida two weeks later. That spring, Jakell was invited among top high school prospects from the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida to participate in the seventh Rivals Camp Series Presented by Under Armour held at Hoover High School outside of Birmingham. In an April 6, 2013 interview with rivals.com at the camp, Jakell stated that he preferred playing for an SEC school and listed Auburn and Florida respectively as his top two choices, adding Florida State of the ACC as his third choice, promising to make a decision by the summer. Jakell was recruited by Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee and tight ends coach Scott Fountain, considering Jakell their top recruit for the H-back position. He formally announced his commitment to Auburn on May 25, 2013, the first attendee of Auburn's fifth annual Big Cat Weekend recruiting camp to commit and the eighth overall Auburn commitment for the class of 2014. Fountain commented \\"He‚Äôs a fantastic athlete that is going to be able to do a lot for us.\\" Auburn Head Coach Gus Malzahn said \\"He‚Äôs a guy we identified when he was a junior. He can block, he can catch, he‚Äôs got a little bit of running back skills. We feel the sky is the limit for this guy.\\" Jakell would be one of three Opelika High School alumni on Auburn's roster that fall, the other two being star running back Corey Grant who graduated while Jakell was in middle school, and Jakell's high school teammate Stephen Roberts who would serve as a backup safety. After his recruitment and before his senior season of football began, on June 28, 2013, Jakell tore his right ACL during a 7-on-7 football camp. He had surgery on July 9, 2013. Karlous Cox, a friend of Jakell's since first grade, played in Jakell's place during Opelika's football season as the team finished with a 7‚Äì3 record and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs 21-20 by McGill-Toolen Catholic. Following his surgery, Jakell made his first of five unofficial Auburn visits during their national championship runner-up season on August 31, 2013 as the Tigers defeated Washington State 31‚Äì24. The last of those five visits came on November 30, 2013 as Jakell witnessed the legendary Kick Six game between Auburn and Alabama. Jakell signed an official letter of intent on February 5, 2014 and enrolled at Auburn on May 27. During Auburn's preseason workouts that fall, Jakell caught a 70-yard touchdown pass in the final scrimmage, the longest of the day. The decision was made to redshirt Jakell while he gained weight and trained to fill the tight end role played by Auburn's All-SEC senior C. J. Uzomah. Jakell selected Pre-Liberal Arts as his major. Death In the early morning hours of Sunday, December 14, 2014, shortly after midnight, Jakell was attending an off-campus party at the Tiger Lodge apartment complex at 202 West Longleaf Drive in Auburn, Alabama. The property features two gates at the main entrance accessible by passcode but unmanned by security guards. According to Jakell's girlfriend Ayanna Hughuley, he became engaged in a verbal altercation with Tyrone Rowe in the parking lot, allegedly regarding Rowe liking an Instagram photo of Mitchell's girlfriend nearly a year earlier, when Rowe's cousin pulled a handgun and opened fire, striking Jakell in the chest. She described Jakell falling to the ground and struggling to get up to run away before falling again, the gunman firing several additional shots as Jakell languished on the ground. Mitchell also had a gun, a 45-caliber glock, which he used to return fire in self defense based on later testimony. Witnesses reported hearing six to eight gunshots, bullets striking at least three vehicles and the wall of an adjacent residence as up to 100 partygoers scattered. An officer with the Auburn Police Department patrolling West Longleaf Drive quickly arrived on scene. He discovered Jakell with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest inside a vehicle departing the complex, presumably transporting him to the hospital, and was able to have Jakell transferred to an ambulance shortly thereafter. A 911 caller reported the shooting around 12:25 a.m. Jakell was pronounced dead not long after arriving at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika, 207 days after his high school graduation and 18 days before his 19th birthday. His high school coach Brian Blackmon was notified by 2:30 a.m. that morning and visited Jakell's mother Arlicia. At daybreak Jakell's red Dodge Challenger, with vanity plate \\"Jakell\\", was towed from the scene. Before leaving for college, Jakell's father had cautioned him to stay away from the negative influences of his hometown Opelika, but believed he would be safe inside the Auburn \\"bubble\\" within East University Drive that loops around the campus. From 2000 to 2012, Auburn had averaged a mere 2.2 homicides per year, so cases of murder were indeed a rarity. The tragedy was not the first involving the Auburn football team to occur at this location. The apartment complex was formerly known as University Heights, renamed the Tiger Lodge following a triple homicide on June 9, 2012 that took the lives of former Auburn players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips and injured active player Eric Mack. It was also not the first violent crime to occur in the area in recent days. An anonymous female reported that two days prior to Jakell Mitchell's death, two men broke into her apartment in an adjacent unit, holding a gun to her head and claiming exclusive rights to drug deals on that block. Suspect arrested At 10:45 a.m., ten hours after the murder, Tyrone Rowe's cousin 22-year-old Markale Deandre Hart of Camp Hill, Alabama, was arrested 25 miles north of Auburn in Dadeville, Alabama, with Auburn detectives working in coordination with the Tallapoosa County Sheriff Department and Jackson's Gap Police. Hart, a father of two infants, was charged with murder and held in the Lee County Detention Center in Opelika on $150,000 bond, an amount was later increased to $500,000. After the Hart family received death threats, they requested a reduction in bail so Hart could be moved to a jail in Tallapoosa County for safety reasons. He was transferred to Tallapoosa County Jail a few weeks later after his family posted a $500,000 property bond. His criminal record dated back to the age of 18 when he faced felony first-degree burglary and theft charges in 2010. On December 15, 2011, Hart was found to be in possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia and was again arrested, sentenced to two years of probation. In May 2012, Hart pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary as part of a plea deal and was ordered to serve six months of a six-year prison sentence with three years of probation which was active at the time of Jakell Mitchell's murder. Funeral and reaction A public viewing was held on Friday, December 19, 2014 from 2:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at Harris Funeral Home in Opelika. Mitchell's funeral was held the following day at noon at the Greater Peace Missionary Baptist Church in Opelika, just 1.2 miles from the football field where he played and graduated. Mitchell was buried in Garden Hills Cemetery in Opelika. A number of Auburn freshman football players carried the casket including Markell Boston, Myron Burton, Deshaun Davis, Roc Thomas, Justin Thornton and Sean White while the entire Auburn team was in attendance. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn commented \\"I‚Äôm devastated and saddened by the passing of Jakell Mitchell. My thoughts and prayers are with Jakell‚Äôs family and friends, who are suffering through this senseless tragedy.\\" Opelika coach Brian Blackmon tweeted: \\"The sadness I feel right now is overwhelming. My hope is in Jesus. My prayers are that Mitchell family will find Peace in Him also.\\" Even Auburn's bitter rival Alabama expressed condolences, coach Nick Saban stating \\"We feel horrible bad for Jakell Mitchell‚Äôs family. Fine young man that we recruited here.\\" Former Alabama player C. J. Mosley, a Baltimore Raven at the time, voiced his sympathies over Twitter with the tweet \\"rip Jakell Mitchell and praying for the #AuburnFamily.\\" Aftermath Many Tiger Lodge tenants, some unaware of the 2012 shooting, were so infuriated by the violence they asked to have their leases terminated without penalty. Dozens voiced their distress on Facebook. A 90-minute meeting with residents and ownership the day after Jakell's murder, which included parents of Tiger Lodge's student residents, was held in the property's clubhouse and became heated at times. Hart's gun was never found at the crime scene, while Mitchell's gun was found several feet away from his body. Asset Campus Housing, owners of the property billing themselves as \\"the largest privately owned student housing companies (sic) in the nation,\\" referred all media questions to the PR firm Threshold Agency. Spokesman Mark Evans commented \\"These kind of events happen sometimes and they would happen no matter where you are. We‚Äôre working with residents to take precautions to prevent these type of tragedies from occurring.\\" Lee County District Attorney Robert Treese sought to have Tiger Lodge declared a public nuisance. Jakell's high school friend Adrianna Tapscott organized a candlelight vigil on Facebook to be held Monday, December 15, in front of the Lee County Courthouse, a gathering that grew into hundreds of mourners. On January 1, 2015, on what would have been Jakell's 19th birthday, Auburn's football team played in the 2015 Outback Bowl and honored his memory by wearing No. 31 stickers on the right side of each helmet. Trial In October 2015, Markale Hart was indicted for murder by a Lee County grand jury. He pleaded not guilty in November 2015. The trial was set to begin in late 2016, but had to be postponed after witness Tyrone Rowe was deployed to Kuwait with the Alabama National Guard. The trial was rescheduled for June 12, 2017, and Hart was released on bail. On February 26, 2017, around 6:00 p.m., less than four months before the murder trial was scheduled to begin, Hart was arrested in Dadeville for DUI at twice the legal limit, possessing a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol, and receiving stolen property. When the postponed trial got underway in December 2017, the case against Hart was declared a mistrial after four days of deliberation as the jury was deadlocked. On February 9, 2018, Hart pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the Jakell Mitchell case to avoid a retrial, a deal that dropped all 2017 charges and gave him credit for time served in the homicide case. Hart was released from jail and given three years probation.

Polish Fourth Army, commanded by General Leonard Skierski defeated Soviet forces in the area of Kobryn (present-day Belarus). After the Battle of Warsaw, the Fourth Army was in early September 1920 transported eastwards, to guard the front along the rail line Bialystok ‚Äì Brzesc nad Bugiem ‚Äì Wlodawa. The Army consisted of the following units: 15th Infantry Division, 14th Infantry Division, 11th Infantry Division, and 16th Infantry Division. Facing them was newly created Soviet Fourth Army, consisting of two rifle divisions (48th and 57th), and 17th Cavalry Division. These units were supported by 19th and 55th Rifle Divisions, which had completed their concentration in the first half of September. After additional reinforcements brought from Russia, the Soviets had a numerical advantage along the frontline. General Skierski, aware of the Soviet plans, decided to forestall their advance, and ordered the 14th I.D. to capture Zhabinka on September 8. In the night of September ‚Äì11, the Polish 11th I.D. destroyed the Soviet forces near Malaryta, and after this victory, Skierski ordered an assault on Kobryn, which was defended by the Soviet 57th Rifle Division. The Poles entered the town in the morning of September 12, but the Soviets concentrated three divisions (55th, 57th and 19th), and in the night of September 15‚Äì16, attacked a gap between the Polish 14th and 16th I.D. The enemy captured a bridge over the Mukhavets River, and then attacked the Polish 57th Infantry Regiment. Heavy fighting ensued, but despite Soviet superiority, the Poles kept their ground. On September 16, regiments of Polish 16th I.D. were forced to retreat, but on the next day, after reinforcements had been brought, Polish soldiers recaptured the lost territory. In two days of fighting (September 16 and 17), the Poles lost 500 soldiers dead and wounded, and to draw the Soviets away from Kobryn, General Skierski created the Operational Group of General Michal Milewski to carry out a raid on Pruzhany. The town was captured in the night of September 18‚Äì19, but fighting there continued until September 22. Fighting over Kobryn and Pruzana tied down the whole Soviet Fourth Army, which removed the threat of the capture of Brest Fortress, and allowed the Polish Army headquarters to prepare an operational plan for the Battle of the Niemen River.

The loch trends in an east to west direction and is approximately in length. The loch and area around it form Forfar Loch Country Park. On the northern side of the loch there is a natural gravel projection which is named Queen Margaret's Inch or Saint Margaret's Inch. The projection was named after Queen Margaret, the 11th century Queen of Scots. Several historical structures have been located on the Inch including a crannog and a chapel. History A crannog named Queen Margaret's Inch once stood on the loch. It was exposed when the loch was drained in 1781. Several items were then retrieved including silver earrings, bone chess pieces and bronze objects. It is thought that around 1243 a cell of monks from Coupar Angus Abbey inhabited the Inch and that The Chapel of the Holy Trinity and several houses were built. St Margaret's Inch at Loch of Forfar Recreation and leisure The loch is a local centre for recreation and leisure activities including walking, sailing, canoeing, orienteering and fishing. The Forfar Loch Country Park Ranger Service provide a range of environmental activities and talks. The Forfar Sailing Club has its facilities on the Inch. There are several paths and trails in and around the loch all of which are marked and fully wheelchair accessible.

Mackenzie (born March 17, 1934) is an American sedimentary and global biogeochemist. Mackenzie applies experimental and field data coupled to a sound theoretical framework to the solution of geological, geochemical, and oceanographic problems at various time and space scales. He is identified closely with the book Evolution of Sedimentary Rocks co-authored in 1971 by Mackenzie with Robert M. Garrels, which reawakened and revitalized the scientific community to the ideas of the British geologist James Hutton that lay fallow for more than 150 years. Evolution of Sedimentary Rocks expanded on the theory of reverse weathering proposed by Mackenzie and Garrels in 1966.R. M. Garrels, F. T. Mackenzie, 1966, Chemical mass balance between rivers and oceans. American Journal of Science, 264, 507-525.  Life and career  Mackenzie earned a bachelor's degree in physics and geology from Upsala College in 1955. He went on to earn an M.S. degree in 1959 and his Ph.D. in 1962 in geological sciences and biogeochemistry from Lehigh University. His Ph.D. dissertation research dealt with a paleocurrent and environmental analysis of the ~ 140 Ma Cretaceous Lakota and equivalent rock units of the Western Interior of the United States.F. T. Mackenzie and J. D. Ryan, 1962, Cloverly-Lakota and Fall River paleocurrents in the Wyoming Rockies. Wyoming Geological Association Guidebook. Symposium on Early Cretaceous Rocks of Wyoming and Adjacent Areas, 44-61. Following completion of his Ph.D., Mackenzie went to work full-time for Shell Oil Company as an Exploration and Research Geologist. Two of his assignments at the time involved studies of the stratigraphy and structure of Ordovician carbonates in the Appalachian Mountains as targets for oil exploration and of the Devonian Marcellus Shale, which in recent years has become a horizon for gas production by fracking and a subject of strong environmental concern. Then in 1963, Mackenzie accepted a position as Staff Geochemist and Assistant Director at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR, now the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences). One of his tasks at BBSR was to manage Hydrostation S, the longest continuously occupied hydrostation in the world. In 1967 Mackenzie joined the faculty at Northwestern University becoming Full Professor and department Chair in 1971. Here between 1967 and 1981, he in association with colleagues Robert Garrels, Hal Helgeson, Abraham Lerman and his many graduate students and national and international colleagues published a number of classic papers involving an interdisciplinary range of scientific topics including early diagenetic processes of reverse weathering and controls on seawater composition, pore water geochemistry, kinetics and thermodynamics of mineral-water reactions, and modeling of Earth's surface environmental system over geological time. In 1981 Mackenzie left Northwestern and accepted an appointment in 1982 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he continues doing research and teaching until today, although in 2008, he became a Professor Emeritus of Oceanography and Geology & Geophysics. At the University of Hawaii, Mackenzie broadened his research and teaching program even more into the field of marine biogeochemistry, particularly into the biogeochemical interactions involving carbon and oxygen and the nutrient elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon between the land and coastal waters. He also investigated CO2 exchange in coastal marine waters, and the biogeochemistry and consequences of ocean acidification for reefs and other carbonate ecosystems. In 1997, Mackenzie founded the Bachelor of Science degree program in Global Environmental Science at the University of Hawaii in the Oceanography Department. Mackenzie is the author or co-author of nearly 300 scholarly works, and has written works with more than 200 co-authors.Mackenzie, Fred; Andersson, Andreas (2013). Geochemical Perspectives. The Marine Carbon and Ocean Acidification during the Phaneozoic Time. Mackenzie is also an ardent athlete, lifetime traveler, and mountaineer having climbed in many ranges of the world.  Fellowships, awards and honors  Mackenzie is a Fellow of the Mineralogical Society of America, the Geological Society of America, the Geochemical Society, the European Association of Geochemistry, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and is a Life Trustee of the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences.

The 1st Lithuanian‚ÄìBelarusian Division, which was part of the Polish Army, clashed with the Soviet Third Army. The battle took place in a forest near the town of Lida (current Belarus). It also is known as the Battle of Lebioda (after the local river) and the Battle of Papiernia (after the nearby village). During the Battle of the Niemen River, 1st Lithuanian‚ÄìBelarusian Division (General Jan Rzadkowski) was part of the so- called Northern Assault Group of the Second Army. Together with 1st Legions Infantry Division, and 2nd and 4th Cavalry Brigade, it crossed the territory of Lithuania, in order to attack the back of Soviet Third Army. On September 26, 1920, under heavy Polish pressure, Soviet forces began to retreat towards Lida. On the next day in the morning, General Rzadkowski ordered Minsk and Wilno Rifle Regiments to block the Lebioda river crossings, in order to cut off all routes of retreat. At the village of Wasiliszki, Minsk Regiment (1,100 soldiers) attacked Soviet 2nd Rifle Brigade. At 1 pm, Minsk Regiment, which was followed by Wilno Regiment (1,200 soldiers) and artillery, captured Papiernia, heading towards the river. At the same time, main forces of Soviet Third Army appeared in the same area. Polish 2nd Battalion captured Feliksow, forcing the headquarters of Third Army to flee. Before abandoning the village, Soviet General Lazarevich ordered 5th and 6th Rifle Divisions to attack Polish forces and recapture the river crossing. Due to the retreat, however, Soviet headquarters lost contact with the divisions. Several Soviet regiments attacked the Poles from west, forcing them to retreat to Krwawy Bor. After heavy fighting, the Soviets managed to seize the road towards Lida and began their retreat. At 7 pm, Polish Wilno Regiment appeared at Krwawy Bor, to join the tired soldiers of Minsk Regiment. United Polish forces attacked the enemy, and recaptured the river crossing. In the evening of September 27, General Rzadkowski found out about Polish capture of the city of Grodno, and concluded that main forces of Third Army were still fighting near Grodno. The Soviets, however, had left the city in the afternoon on September 26, and at app. 8 p.m., Soviet 56th Rifle Division approached the Lebioda river crossing, guarded by Polish regiments. One hour later, thousands of Soviet infantry attacked two Polish regiments, along a sector some 3 kilometers wide. Hand-to- hand combat ensued, with grenades and bayonets, in which Minsk and Wilno Regiments were overwhelmed by Soviet numerical superiority. Neither side captured prisoners, and the Soviets were determined to fight their way towards Lida. On September 28, at app. 1 a.m., Polish soldiers were pushed to Krwawy Bor, and the Soviets seized the road, along which their retreat continued. Despite Polish defeat, the battle disorganized and slowed the retreat of Third Army. General Lazarevich with his officers fled to Lida, where he was attacked by 1st Legions Infantry Division, and as a result, was forced to escape further east. Polish losses in the battle were 130 killed, 230 wounded and 410 missing. Several prisoners were shot by the Soviets in the forests near Lida. Exact Soviet losses are unknown, but they amounted to hundreds of killed and wounded, 1000 prisoners, 12 cannons and 15 heavy machine guns.

Biography  His father was a master watchmaker. He began his studies in 1778 at the \\"School of Drawing\\", then attended classes at the \\"Society of Arts\\" where he studied with Jean-√âtienne Liotard, among others.Biography @ Cabinet d'Expertise VLG. A trip to Italy from 1787 to 1788 had a lasting effect on his style. He had his first showing in 1789 at the Salon of Geneva, where he presented an √âtude d'apr√®s nature (Study from Nature). At the next Salon, he won the Grand Prize. In 1794, he was invited to Lausanne to work for Madame de Sta√´l. In 1799, he was named Director of the \\"√âcoles de dessin de la ville de Gen√®ve\\" and, the following year, became a member of the art society. From 1807 to 1813, he travelled throughout France, making contacts with fellow artists. From 1828 to 1829, he toured England and Scotland, receiving many commissions along the way and becoming enamored of the English \\"conversation pieces\\". He also favored a style known as \\"jusqu'aux genoux\\" (as far as the knees). After 1820, he eschewed detailed backgrounds in favor of simple tones that emphasized the face. Until then, however, many of his portraits were done in collaboration with the landscape painter Wolfgang-Adam T√∂pffer and the animal painter Jacques-Laurent Agasse. Created mostly for wealthy patrons, Massot would paint the figures while his associates would fill in the backgrounds with various props that symbolized the sitter. Perhaps because of this, very few of his paintings are signed and attribution is often difficult. It is believed that approximately 250 works are authentically his. Many prominent women were among his sitters, including Madame Recamier, the Empress Josephine and Queen Hortense. His sister Pernette was also a painter and engraver and is sometimes cited as his first teacher.

Though Michiel and Cunera ran a brewery in Haarlem, they remained friendly with Jan's family and Michiel was registered at the baptism of Jan's youngest daughter Aeffjen van Baersdorp on 8 June 1631 in the Oude Kerk.Amsterdam Kloek genealogy website Cunera died in Haarlem in 1640. Painting  The portrait was dated around 1635‚Äì1638, but since 2012 it has been attributed as a wedding pendant and thus is dated 1625. Similar to Hals' Portrait of a Woman Standing in Chatsworth House, this woman is wearing a wedding ring on her right forefinger, a figure-eight collar and lace wrist collars over sleeves that match her bodice, and a vlieger over a wheel-shaped fardegalijn. Her diadem cap lacks wings however and is more similar to the cap worn by Hals's Catholic sitter Catharina Both-van der Eem and by his brewer Aletta Hannemans. Unlike her colleague Haarlem brewer Aletta who is wearing a colorful skirt and ornamented wedding stomacher, Cunera is wearing a black skirt and her bracelets are black and white, which together possibly indicate mourning, probably for her mother. Also like Aletta, she is holding a wedding glove. Her stance with arm akimbo is striking and though a common stance for men in Hals wedding pendant portraiture, the only known woman in his oeuvre to stand this way. Her portrait was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote: \\"391. PORTRAIT OF A DUTCHWOMAN STANDING. M. 195. Three-quarter-length. She is turned three-quarters left, and looks at the spectator. Her left hand rests on her hip; her right hand holds a glove. She wears a black silk dress with a flowered pattern, a white lace-trimmed cap, a broad ruff, and lace wristbands. Canvas on panel, 46 inches by 36 inches. In the possession of the Paris dealer C. Sedelmeyer, \\"Catalogue of 100 Paintings,\\" 1899, No. 19. In the collection of the Marquis de Ganay, Paris.\\"catalog number 391 in Hofstede de Groot on Portrait of a Dutchwoman Standing Hofstede de Groot did not identify it as a pendant of Cunera's portrait, but he wrote of Michiel's portrait: \\"242. MICHIEL DE WAEL (?). B. 73; M. 83. Three-quarter-length, life size. He is seen in full face, and looks at the spectator. His right hand holds his gloves ; his left hand is pressed on his hip. He is in black with a broad-brimmed black hat. He has a fresh and ruddy face. Brown background. On the bottom of the frame is a coat-of-arms, bearing a bird facing right on clouds. On the top of the frame is a monogram composed of the letters, C, H, R, and G. There is apparently no evidence for the identification of the sitter as M. de Wael. [Pendant to 243.

This was later determined to be earlier information regarding the same portrait he included in his catalog as number 391. In 1974 Seymour Slive listed another painting, catalog 130, as a possible pendant, based on an attribution by W.R. Valentiner, but he found it doubtful, as Cunera is portrayed in a distinctively different style with her arm akimbo.Frans Hals, by Seymour Slive, 1974 a catalog raisonn√© of Hals works by Seymour Slive: Volume Three, the catalogue, National gallery of Art: Kress Foundation, Studies in the History of European Art, London - Phaidon Press, 1974 on Portrait of a Woman; catalog number 120, page 64 Slive agreed with her dress implies a date of 1625 but felt that fashions were worn for long periods and placed the painting on stylistic grounds in 1635.

History In 1898 the statutes of the League were drafted, entirely in Galician language.For the first time in a political organization. Waldo √Ålvarez Insua was elected as the president of the organization in 1899. It was one of the currents in which the Galician Regionalist Association bifurcated. The Galician League of A Coru√±a was liberal, while the Galician League of Santiago de Compostela was ideologically conservative. The league demanded autonomy for Galiza, conducting in 1897 a signature collection to ask for the same autonomy than Cuba and Puerto Rico. After 1900 the League had little activity, but survived until 1907. The official newspaper of the organization was the bilingual weekly Revista Gallega, directed by Galo Salinas. Thanks to an initiative of the League, and specially of Galo Salinas, in 1904 a monument to the Martyrs of Carral was built in the town of Carral. References *Beramendi, X.G. and N√∫√±ez Seixas, X.M.

His followers are known as Sultanias or Sarwarias. Life Sakhi Sarwar, the Great Sufi Saint was born in 1120 AD in the 12th century. His father's name was Zain-ul-Abedin and his mother's name was Ayesha. Sakhi Sarwar's father Syed Zain-ul-Abedin, along with his wife and survivors, had migrated from Baghdad. All this time, the family worked as farmers in Shahkot, Punjab. Sakhi Sarwar's father-in-law was the ruler of Multan. It is said that when his father-in-law gave his daughter's dowry, Sakhi Sarwar distributed it among the needy. Sakhi Sarwar died in the year 1181 and was buried in an area at the base of Sulayman Mountain in the Dera Ghazi Khan District. Baghdad is the city where he was blessed with the gift of khilafat by three illustrious saints: Gawth-ul-Azam, Shaikh Shahab-ud-Din Suhrawardi and Khwaja Maudood Chishti. After the arrival of Syed Ahmad Sultan also known as Sakhi Sarwar in the 12th century, Islam started spreading in the area. Due to his high moral values and humility, Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs have great respect for the saint's shrine and the town. Before independence of Pakistan in 1947, devotees from Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur areas would come to his main shrine to seek spiritual blessings.Devotees of varying faiths at Sakhi Sarwar Dawn (newspaper), Published 17 March 2006, Retrieved 20 May 2020 Shrines Nigaha The saint selected the town of Nigaha to settle down and live there. It is known as the ‚Äòlast place‚Äô because of the hostile geographical and climatic condition. According to Rose (1970), the buildings of the shrine consist of Sakhi Sarwar‚Äôs tomb on the west and a shrine associated with Guru Nanak Dev Ji on the north-west. On the east is an apartment containing a stool and spinning wheel of Mai Ayesha, Sakhi Sarwar‚Äôs mother. Nearby is Thakurdwara, and in another apartment is an image of Bhairon. Within the enclosures of the shrine are the tombs of Sakhi Sarwar, his wife, known as Bibi Bai, and of the jinn whom he had held in his power and who brought many miracles for him. Near the shrine at Nigaha, there are two other holy spots called Chom and Moza, both associated with Murtaza, the son-in-law of Sakhi Sarwar. At Chom, an impression of the former\`s hand was said to have been imprinted when he prevented a mountain from collapsing over the cave in which he had taken shelter. To the west of the outhouses and within the shrine enclosure are two dead trees said to have sprung from the pegs which were used for the head and heel ropes of Kaki, the saint‚Äôs mare. Other places Other shrines in his honor are situated at Dhaunkal in Wazirabad district, and also in Peshawar and Lahore. There are numerous shrines in the Indian Punjab where they are known as Nigaha. At some places, Sakhi Sarwar is worshiped along with Gugga and their common shrines along with other deities are known as Panj Pirs or Nigahas. The shrine of Baba Lakhdata at district Una in Himachal Pradesh is known as Chotta (minor/small) Nigaha where a large fair is organised every year. Worship His followers who visit the Pir‚Äôs shrine at Nigaha are known as sang who refer to each other as bharais. The drumbeating bards who act as professional guides and priests at local shrines are called pirkhanas. Members of a sang address each other as pirbhaior and pirbahin (brother or sister in faith respectively). Their halting points on the routes are known as chaukis (posts) where the pilgrims traditionally slept on the ground. Devotees unable to undertake the pilgrimage to Nigaha would attend at least one of the chaukis. If they could not, they went to any other village on the route for a night. Those who could not go anywhere at all slept on the ground at home for at least one night in a year. This ritual of sleeping on the ground instead of on a cot is called chauki bharna. Fairs Various fairs are held in the Punjab region. The shrine at Nigaha holds a week-long Baisakhi fair in the month of April. Fairs are also held at Dhaunkal in Gujranwala district during June/July, at Jhandon Wala Mela (fair of the flags) at Peshawar, and Qadmon Wala Mela (fair of the feet) at Lahore. A common ritual which is traditionally observed is to offer a raut, (a huge loaf prepared from 18 kilograms of wheat flour sweetened with jaggery weighing half that quantity) once a year on a Friday. The raut is traditionally prepared by a Bharai, who take one fourth of the rotas offering, the remaining being consumed by the donor family and distributed among fellow Sultanias (followers of Sakhi Sarwar). A famous fair known as \\"Chaunkian da Mela\\" is held in Mukandpur to commemorate Sakhi Sarwar's visit Balachaur, starting his journey from Rattewal and reaching Mukandpur where Sakhi Sarwar reportedly stayed for nine days. Since then, this fair is held in Mukandpur and lasts for nine days. A \\"Saang\\" starts from Rattewal and reaches Mukandpur. The leader of the \\"Saang\\" holds a flag which is called a \\"Togh\\".

The league consists of seven divisions, three for \\"first teams\\" and four for \\"reserves\\" and lower teams. The top division, Division One is just below West Wales Premier League, and therefore sits at level 5 of the Welsh football pyramid. History Formed in 1901 as the Swansea Junior League, the first organised league in the Swansea area launched a Senior League in 1903‚Äì04, followed in 1904‚Äì05 by a name change to the Swansea & District League. The league was suspended during World War One. During the 1921‚Äì22 and 1922‚Äì23 seasons, the league expanded to include a Gower Division and a Neath Division. At the outbreak of World War Two in September 1939 all local leagues in Swansea suspended football, but in October both the Swansea & District League and a second league, the Swansea Gwalia League approved a merger for the duration of the war years as the Swansea Gwalia Combination with the league operating two senior divisions. In May 1946 the leagues agreed a permanent merger, with the league to be known as the Swansea District Gwalia League. In the 1947‚Äì48, the league changed its name to the current league title of the Swansea Senior Association Football League.

Previous outbreaks had been confined to countries in Central Africa. Epidemiology West African Outbreak On 25 March 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Guinea's Ministry of Health had reported an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in four southeastern districts, with suspected cases in the neighbouring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone being investigated. In Guinea, a total of 86 suspected cases, including 59 deaths had been reported as of 24 March. Researchers generally believe that a one-year-old boy, Anchor cite of important article, do not remove later identified as Emile Ouamouno, who died in December 2013 in the village of Meliandou, Gu√©ck√©dou Prefecture, Guinea, was the index case of the Ebola virus disease epidemic. His mother, sister, and grandmother then became ill with similar symptoms and also died. People infected by those initial cases spread the disease to other villages. Although Ebola represents a major public health issue in sub-Saharan Africa, no cases had ever been reported in West Africa and the early cases were diagnosed as other diseases more common to the area. Thus, the disease had several months to spread before it was recognized as Ebola. Index Case The index case in Nigeria was a Liberian-American, Patrick Sawyer, who flew from Liberia to Nigeria's most populous city of Lagos on 20 July 2014. Sawyer became violently ill upon arriving at the airport and died five days later. In response, the Nigerian government observed all of Sawyer's contacts for signs of infection and increased surveillance at all entry points to the country. Sawyer was believed to have suspected he was infected with Ebola because he cared for his sister who died of the disease on July 8, he was hospitalised in Monrovia for fever and Ebola symptoms on July 17 before discharging himself (against professional medical advice) to fly to Lagos, where he lied to the staff of First Consultants Medical Centre that he had not had any exposure to anyone that had contracted Ebola. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-did-nigeria- quash-its-ebola-outbreak-so-quickly/ https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-did-nigeria-quash-its-ebola- outbreak-so-quickly/ Subsequent Transmission On 6 August 2014, the Nigerian health minister told reporters, \\"Yesterday the first known Nigerian to die of Ebola was recorded. This was one of the nurses that attended to the Liberian. The other five newly confirmed cases are being treated at an isolation ward.\\" The nurse was Obi Justina Ejelonu. The doctor who treated Sawyer, Ameyo Adadevoh, subsequently also died of Ebola. Others that died included Mrs Ukoh (a Ward Maid at First Consultants Medical Center), Jato Asihu Abdulqudir (an acquaintance of Sawyer, who was on the plane with him and carried his bag when he was ill), a private hospital doctor in Port Harcourt who was treating Jato and an elderly patient at the hospital that treated the private hospital doctor for Ebola. https://www.icirnigeria.org/flashback- crazy-man-patrick-sawyer-brought-ebola-to-nigeria-three-years-ago/ On 22 September 2014, the Nigeria health ministry announced, \\"As of today, there is no case of Ebola in Nigeria. All listed contacts who were under surveillance have been followed up for 21 days.\\" According to the WHO, 20 cases and 8 deaths had been confirmed, including the imported case, who also died.https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/nigeria-ends- ebola/en/ Four of the dead were health care workers who had cared for Sawyer. In all, 529 contacts had been followed and of that date they had all completed a 21-day mandatory period of surveillance. Outbreak successfully contained Nigerian health care workers at a training event, August 2014 On 9 October 2014, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) acknowledged Nigeria's positive role in controlling the effort to contain the Ebola outbreak. \\"We wish to thank the Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja, Nigeria, and the staff of the Ebola Emergency Centre who coordinated the management of cases, containment of outbreaks and treatment protocols in Nigeria.\\" Nigeria's quick responses, including intense and rapid contact tracing, surveillance of potential contacts, and isolation of all contacts were of particular importance in controlling and limiting the outbreak, according to the ECDC. Complimenting Nigeria's successful efforts to control the outbreak, \\"the usually measured WHO declared the feat 'a piece of world- class epidemiological detective work'.\\" The WHO's representative in Nigeria officially declared Nigeria to be Ebola free on 20 October after no new active cases were reported in the follow up contacts, stating it was a \\"spectacular success story\\". Relief contributions to West Africa On 14 August 2014 the Nigerian government said Aliko Dangote have donated $1 million to halt the spread of the Ebola virus outbreak. On 5 November 2014 volunteer medical workers arrived in Liberia and Sierra Leone from Nigeria. The first arrivals included 100 volunteers in Freetown, Sierra Leone and a further 76 in Liberia. Nigeria announced it would send 600 volunteers to help stem the spread of the disease.  Background: Healthcare in Nigeria  A hospital in Abuja, Nigeria's capital Health care delivery in Nigeria is a concurrent responsibility of the three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector.Rais Akhtar; Health Care Patterns and Planning in Developing Countries, Greenwood Press, 1991. pp 264 Nigeria has been reorganizing its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost. The Nigerian health care system is continuously faced with a shortage of doctors and nurses known as 'brain drain', because of emigration by skilled Nigerian doctors and nurses to North America and Europe. In 1995, it was estimated that 21,000 Nigerian doctors were practising in the United States alone, which was about the same as the number of doctors working in the Nigerian public service. Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as one of the goals of the government. Despite this, in the 2014 Ebola outbreak, Nigeria was the first country to effectively contain and eliminate the Ebola threat that was ravaging three other countries in the West African region. The Nigerian unique method of contact tracing became an effective method later used by other countries, such as the United States, when Ebola threats were discovered.  In popular culture  The 2016 Nigerian drama thriller film 93 Days tells the story of the treatment of Patrick Sawyer by Adadevoh and other medical staff, and the successful containment of the outbreak.

It features the Marvel Comics character Peggy Carter as she goes undercover to try clear the name of her friend Howard Stark. The episode is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. It was written by creators Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and directed by Louis D'Esposito who previously directed the Marvel One-Shots short film that inspired the series. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Carter from the film series, starring alongside James D'Arcy, Chad Michael Murray, Enver Gjokaj, and Shea Whigham. Markus and McFeely, the writers of several MCU films, had written the episode by January 2014. It was officially ordered that May. The episode contains several film connections: Dominic Cooper reprises his film role as Stark, Costa Ronin guest stars as the younger version of film character Anton Vanko, and archive footage from Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is used. The costume and visual effects teams focused on establishing an authentic 1940s New York setting for the episode. \\"Now is Not the End\\" originally aired on ABC on January 6, 2015, and was watched by 10.16 million viewers within a week. The episode was praised by critics for its period setting, relative independence from the rest of the MCU, and especially for the performances of Atwell and D'Arcy. Many critics stated that the episode was superior to ABC's previous Marvel television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. The visual effects for the episode received a nomination at the Visual Effects Society Awards. Plot In 1946 New York, a year after the apparent death of the love of her life, Steve Rogers, Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) Agent Peggy Carter is stuck doing administrative work while her male colleagues carry out field assignments. The latest case at the SSR is the hunt for Howard Stark, who has been branded a traitor for selling weapons-grade technology to U.S. enemies, and is now in hiding. Stark, a friend of Carter's from World War II, covertly meets with Carter to ask her help in clearing his name. He believes that his formula for molecular nitramene, which he says has been stolen, is about to be sold somewhere in New York. At the SSR, Carter learns from the crippled war veteran Agent Daniel Sousa that the chauvinistic and promotion-seeking Agent Jack Thompson is following a lead on club owner Spider Raymond, who is looking to fence Stark's inventions. Raymond indeed sells the formula to the silent Leet Brannis. Infiltrating the club in disguise, Carter breaks into Raymond's safe and discovers that the formula has already been turned into a weapon. By the time Thompson gets there, Raymond is dead, killed by a man in a green suit, who follows Carter back to her apartment and kills her roommate. Carter pushes him out a window, and notices that he has a scar on his neck where his voice box once was. After attempting to comfort her, Stark's butler Edwin Jarvis takes Carter to see Dr. Anton Vanko at Stark Industries, who deduces that the weapon was created at a Roxxon Oil refinery. Carter finds Brannis mass-producing the nitramine weapons at the refinery. Brannis also has a scar where his voice box once was, and by holding an electronic device to it is able to warn Carter that \\"Leviathan\\" is coming. Brannis drops one of the bombs, giving Carter 30 seconds to escape, and the subsequent implosion destroys the building. Carter and Jarvis get away safely, as does Brannis with a truck full of nitramene bombs. Later, Jarvis calls Stark to assure him that Carter is an excellent choice. Production Development On May 8, 2014, ABC officially ordered a series starring Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), as well as the Marvel One-Shots short film Agent Carter (2013). Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, writers of the Captain America films, had written a script for the first episode by January of that year, and at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con Marvel revealed that Louis D‚ÄôEsposito, who directed the One-Shot short film, would direct the episode. The title of the premiere episode was revealed to be \\"Now is Not the End\\" in December 2014. Casting Special guest star Dominic Cooper reprises his role of Howard Stark from other MCU projects. In December 2014, Marvel confirmed that the episode would star main cast members Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, James D'Arcy as Edwin Jarvis, Chad Michael Murray as Jack Thompson, Enver Gjokaj as Daniel Sousa, and Shea Whigham as Roger Dooley. The guest cast for the episode was also revealed to include Lyndsy Fonseca as Angie Martinelli, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, Andre Royo as Spider Raymond, James Hebert as green suit, Kyle Bornheimer as Ray Krzeminiski, Ashley Hinshaw as Colleen O'Brien, Carrick O'Quinn as tall bouncer, James Frain as Leet Brannis, Tim True as tipsy guy, Johnny Marques as bartender, Jeffrey David Anderson as short bouncer, James Urbaniak as scientist, Bill Kalmenson as Senator Webster, Lesley Boone as Rose, Costa Ronin as Anton Vanko, and Kevin Heffernan as Madison Avenue guy. Cooper reprises his role from The First Avenger and the Agent Carter short. Anton Vanko was previously portrayed by Yevgeni Lazarev in Iron Man 2 (2010); Ronin plays a younger version of the character. Gjokaj previously had a minor role in The Avengers (2012). Additionally, Chris Evans appears as Steve Rogers / Captain America via archive footage from The First Avenger. Design When Carter goes undercover in the episode, she wears a dress inspired by the evening dresses of the 1930s and 40s, which the script described as a \\"Veronica Lake look\\". For the character of Colleen O'Brien, series costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton saw her as a \\"hard working girl making just enough to get by. The war term 'Mend and Make Do' really applies to her.\\" The man in the green suit was a \\"tricky balance\\" for Ottobre-Melton, who needed a green that was not over the top but still made a \\"powerful statement\\". The final design was inspired by a real 1940s green double breasted suit that she found. Visual effects Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Base FX created the visual effects for the episode, with work by ILM including the creation of backdrops for the series, with matte paintings used, to depict 1940s New York. Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins Archive footage from Captain America: The First Avenger, including the apparent death of Captain America from the end of that film, is used throughout the episode, and the MacGuffin of the episode, molecular nitramene, is based on the Vita-Rays that were used to transform Steve Rogers into Captain America in the film. The Vita-Ray detector that Carter uses in the episode belonged to Dr. Abraham Erskine, who was portrayed by Stanley Tucci in The First Avenger. The Oil Refinery featured at the climax of the episode belongs to Roxxon Oil, a company that has appeared throughout the MCU. Release \\"Now is Not the End\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on January 6, 2015, as the first half of a two-part series premiere.

Critical response Hayley Atwell received praise for her performance as Peggy Carter Eric Goldman of IGN gave \\"Now is Not the End\\" a score of 8 out of 10, indicating a \\"Great\\" episode, and praised the Atwell's performance as Carter as well as her dynamic with D'Arcy's Jarvis. Goldman felt that the period setting was used well, despite the episode feeling \\"like a TV show compared to the Marvel movies (being a TV show and all)\\". He was happy that the series was telling its own story rather than attempting to be an important part of the overarching MCU storyline. Goldman did feel that Carter needed a more specific villain to fight, and hoped that would change quickly given the short episode count for the season. Alan Sepinwall at HitFix felt the series had learned from the mistakes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and stood as its own entity. He praised Atwell's performance, the visual/period style, and D'Arcy as Jarvis, but he felt that Carter's sexist colleagues were cartoonish, saying \\"not that sexism didn't exist in the era, but that it's a tough thing to dramatize from a modern perspective without feeling winky and smug. It's a dance many period dramas have to do, not always successfully, and while it would be foolish to pretend a woman like Peggy wouldn't have had to deal with these kinds of idiots all the time, Agent Carter is at its liveliest when the three stooges are nowhere to be seen\\". James Hunt with Den of Geek stated called the series \\"quite genuinely, brilliant. Everything that went wrong with Agents Of SHIELD goes right in Agent Carter. It looks fantastic, doing its level best to recreate 1940s New York on what is probably quite a low budget, and succeeding. It ties into the MCU in ways that feel natural ...There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and even the writing is strong, with compelling plots giving space to subplots which chug along at a nice pace.\\" He was positive about Atwell's performance, but praised D'Arcy as \\"the breakout star of the cast\\". Amy Ratcliffe of Nerdist concluded her review of the episode saying \\"Overall, Agent Carter didn‚Äôt open the door and tiptoe in; it busted through and took charge. Atwell is a magnetic force of nature and seems completely at home in the role, and she‚Äôs complemented by D‚ÄôArcy and Gjokaj.\\" She also felt that lessons had been learned from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and thought that all the work put into creating the period setting had paid off. Britt Hayes, reviewing for Screen Crush, felt the episode \\"fumbles a little, as most series do when they‚Äôre introducing us to a new world\\", but was positive of Atwell, D'Arcy, and the cinematography. Hayes' major issue was the score, which she felt \\"lingers a little too long and feels slightly tone deaf‚Äîit definitely cheapens the proceedings\\". Noel Murray, writing for The A.V. Club, graded the two-part premiere an 'A-', praising it as \\"retro-cool pulp thrills in fabulous outfits. Think The Rocketeer or Raiders of the Lost Ark, but with a dame instead of a dude.\\" Murray stated that the series' \\"greatest asset is Atwell, who takes a character that Marvel Comics has never really done much with before and makes it her own.\\" Oliver Sava, also from The A.V. Club, graded \\"Now is Not the End\\" an 'A-' as well, calling the series a gamble, but deciding that the first episode \\"surpasses expectations with its dynamic direction and fight choreography, clever writing, and hugely charismatic lead.\\" Other than Atwell's performance, which he called \\"confident, strong, and sassy\\", Sava was also positive about the writers and director, and overall found the first two episodes of the series to be superior to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Accolades \\"Now is Not the End\\" was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Photoreal Episode at the 13th Visual Effects Society Awards.

It features the Marvel Comics character Peggy Carter as she searches for a truck filled with imploding bombs, and is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Eric Pearson and directed by Joseph V. Russo. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Carter from the film series, and is joined by regular cast members James D'Arcy, Chad Michael Murray, Enver Gjokaj, and Shea Whigham. \\"Bridge and Tunnel\\" originally aired on ABC on January 6, 2015, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 6.91 million viewers. The episode received praise from critics, especially the performances of Atwell, D'Arcy, and guest star Lyndsy Fonseca, as well as Russo's direction, and the inclusion of the fictional radio drama, the Captain America Adventure Program. Plot Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) agent Peggy Carter declines an offer from her waitress friend, Angie Martinelli, to become her new neighbor, wishing to protect Angie from the dangers of her double-life as a spy. Searching for a Daisy Clover Dairy truck filled with extremely dangerous molecular nitramene bombs, Carter poses as a health inspector and visits the company, learning the name of the truck's driver, Sheldon McFee. SSR Chief Roger Dooley assigns Agent Ray Krzeminski the task of sifting through the remains of a Roxxon Oil refinery which was imploded by one of the bombs, while he and agents Jack Thompson and Daniel Sousa visit Roxxon CEO Hugh Jones, who notes a rivalry between himself and Howard Stark (the creator of the molecular nitramene formula, and current fugitive from the law) and brings up Stark's work with Vita-radiation. Dooley orders Thompson and Carter screen every Roxxon employee for Vita-radiation, in case the implosion was an inside job. During the screening process, Carter recognizes scientist Miles Van Ert, who had created the weapons for the mysterious Leet Brannis. Van Ert is arrested and tortured by Thompson until he reveals the name and location of McFee. Carter, trying to clear Stark's name without her colleagues and superiors knowing, reaches McFee with Stark's butler, Edwin Jarvis, first. A man in a green suit, who is hunting Brannis and the weapons, also learns of McFee's location. Carter defeats McFee, and convinces Brannis to go with her and Jarvis, but they are attacked by the man in the green suit. Carter fights the assailant, who mortally wounds Brannis. Carter, Jarvis, and Brannis leap from the truck and allow it, and the man, to drive over a cliff and into a lake. The impact causes the weapons to implode, signalling their location to the arriving SSR agents. Brannis draws a strange symbol in the dirt as a warning to Carter, before dying. Carter and Jarvis then leave before the SSR agents get there. Sousa finds a hotel key that belonged to the man in the green suit, and discovers a woman's footprints, not realizing that they are Carter's. Later, Jarvis stitches up Carter's wounds, and notes that she doesn't want to get close to anyone. He reminds her that she can't keep the world safe herself, and that even she must learn to rely on her friends sometimes. Carter then reconsiders Martinelli's offer, and moves into the Griffith Hotel, a hostel of sorts for single, proper women. Back at the SSR, Carter is relieved that the other agents have no evidence of what she has been doing, but unbeknownst to her, Krzeminski finds the license plate for Howard Stark's car that she and Jarvis had taken to the Roxxon refinery. Production Development At San Diego Comic-Con 2014, Marvel announced that Anthony and Joe Russo, who directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, would direct the episode. However, only Joe is credited, under the name Joseph V. Russo. The episode was written by Eric Pearson, who wrote the Marvel One- Shot short film Agent Carter. Casting In December 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Hayley Atwell, James D'Arcy, Chad Michael Murray, Enver Gjokaj, and Shea Whigham would star as Peggy Carter, Edwin Jarvis, Jack Thompson, Daniel Sousa, and Roger Dooley, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include Lyndsy Fonseca as Angie Martinelli, James Herbert as green suit, Kyle Bornheimer as Ray Krzeminiski, James Frain as Leet Brannis, Erin Torpey as Betty Carver (Radio Actor), Walker Roach as Captain America (Radio Actor), Greg Bryan as Daisy Clover Forman, Ray Wise as Hugh Jones, Meagen Fay as Miriam Fry, James Urbaniak as Miles Van Ert/White Haired Scientist, Devin Ratray as Sheldon McFee, Ralph Garman as Radio Announcer, Don Luce as Mob Boss, Jeff Locker as SSR Lab Tech, and Atticus Todd as Winston. However, Torpey, Roach, Bryan, Garman, Locker, and Todd did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Fonseca, H√©bert, Bornheimer, Frain, and Urbaniak all reprise their roles from the previous episode. Release Broadcast \\"Now is Not the End\\" was first aired in the United States as part of the two-hour series premiere on ABC on January 6, 2015. It was aired alongside the US broadcast in Canada on CTV. Home media The episode was released on Blu-ray and DVD along with the rest of the first season on September 18, 2015, as an Amazon.com exclusive. Reception Ratings In the United States the episode received a 1.9/6 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all households, and 6 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 6.91 million viewers. The Canadian broadcast gained 2.35 million viewers, the third highest for that day and the seventh highest for the week. Critical response Eric Goldman of IGN gave \\"Bridge and Tunnel\\" a score of 8 out of 10, indicating a \\"Great\\" episode, praising the chemistry between Atwell's Carter and D'Arcy's Jarvis, Fonseca's performance as Angie Martinelli, and the \\"fun, retro‚ÄìAlias vibe\\", while noting that the male agents \\"need fleshing out\\", and feeling that some of Carter's more slapstick humorous moments were \\"forced\\" and \\"out of character\\". Oliver Sava, writing for The A.V. Club, graded the episode an 'A-', feeling that Russo's involvement allowed the episode to \\"feel more like a direct continuation of the Marvel films\\" than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., calling the visual style \\"slick\\", and highlighting his close- quarters action sequences and use of the fictional Captain America Adventure Program. Sava also praised Atwell, saying \\"She‚Äôs confident, strong, and sassy, but isn‚Äôt invulnerable to pain ... Atwell fully embraces the multiple dimensions of her character to give the audience a well-defined lead to latch on to\\". Alan Sepinwall at HitFix, in reviewing the two-part premiere, stated that \\"The second hour of the premiere is a bit more convoluted than the first, and features enough flashbacks to events from the first that it may feel clumsy watching them in a row, as scheduled. But on the whole, Atwell is so good, and the show has so much fun with the period setting, that it's a really promising start for Agent Carter\\". James Hunt of Den of Geek was positive of the premiere, finding it superior to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and praising the performances of Atwell and D'Arcy. He concluded his review by stating \\"[Agent Carter]'s got the escapist joy that Marvel movies provide, but it's delivering them weekly instead of once every 6-8 months. If this did indeed grow out of fan support for [Carter], then Marvel is going to find itself with a huge number of very pleased fans on its hands.\\" Amy Ratcliffe at Nerdist praised Atwell and Carter's characterization, the intelligence of the \\"oblivious\\" male SSR agents, D'Arcy, and Jarvis' relationship with Carter. She called the Captain America Adventure Program \\"awful-but-wonderful-for-the-plot\\", and also praised the depiction of the period setting, specifically the color palette, the sets, the costumes, and the dialogue. Britt Hayes, reviewing for Screen Crush, felt that the episode \\"feels a little more loose\\" than the first \\"as the series settles into its rhythm without feeling the need to explain why it exists.\\" She was positive of the attention given to the supporting cast and characters, especially Whigham as Dooley and Fonseca as Martinelli.

Plot Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) agent Peggy Carter is acclimatizing to life in the Griffith Hotel, a strict women's-only hostel where men are not allowed above the lobby, while pretending to work at the telephone company, and secretly attempting to clear supposed traitor Howard Stark's name at night without the knowledge of her friends or colleagues. SSR chief Roger Dooley and Agent Krzeminski investigate a hotel room after having found a key while searching for Stark. They discover a typewriter with a long- range transmitter, while Agent Thompson discovers that the deceased Leet Brannis, who they had also found while searching for Stark, had apparently been killed two years earlier during World War II. Agent Sousa is investigating a license plate discovered in the remains of a Roxxon Oil refinery previously, and learns that it is registered to Stark. Thompson and Sousa visit Stark's Butler Edwin Jarvis, who has been secretly assisting Carter at the request of the now in-hiding Stark, and take him in for questioning regarding the finding of the license plate at a major crime scene. Thompson brings up that Jarvis, when serving in the British military before World War II, had been dishonorably discharged for treason, only escaping the death penalty by the influence of Stark's fortune. Thompson threatens to have Jarvis and his wife, Anna, deported, but before this threat can be used to get any answers out of Jarvis, Carter intervenes, faking incompetence in a calculated move that allows Jarvis to walk free, in turn losing any respect that she may have earned from her male coworkers. Carter and Jarvis then return to Stark's house, and search his vault, which had contained dangerous weapons that had been stolen by Brannis (Stark is deemed a traitor due to the fact that he could easily have sold the weapons on the black market himself). While following the sewer system below Stark's house, Carter broaches the subject of Jarvis's past with him, as she needs to be able to trust him if they are to work together. Jarvis explains that he had met Anna, who is Jewish, in Budapest whilst serving, and as War was breaking out, Jarvis's superior refused to save her from prosecution. Jarvis forged the general's signature in an attempt to save her himself, but was caught, and the two only escaped to live happy lives in America with the help of Howard Stark. At the end of the sewer pipe, the two find a ship in which Brannis had stored all of Stark's inventions. Jarvis anonymously tips off the SSR to their location, while Carter fights off an associate of Brannis' who was guarding the weapons. Using one of the weapons, Carter is able to subdue the man, but they are forced to leave him, a witness, there when the SSR promptly arrives. Dooley orders the weapons and the man all transported back to the SSR immediately, with Krzeminski taking the man. As they are driving, the man is about to break Carter's cover to Krzeminski, when they are attacked by an unknown assailant, who kills them both. The entire SSR office mourns Krzeminski's death, even Carter, who he had never treated well at all. Dooley explains that even though Howard Stark may have not pulled the trigger, this was all his fault, and Krzeminski would still be alive if it wasn't for his actions.

In the late 1990s, the Warship Preservation Trust acquired LCT 7074 and undertook minor restoration work but when the trust went into liquidation in January 2006, all restoration stopped. Salvage, restoration and display LCT 7074 was partly submerged at its mooring at East Float in Birkenhead, but following a ¬£916,000 grant from the National Memorial Heritage Fund (NHMF), the craft was salvaged by the National Museum of the Royal Navy during a two-day operation on 15 and 16 October 2014. Over 100 dives by Liverpool diving company Salvesen UK Ltd were required to enable her to be refloated. The LCT was raised and floated into the hold of the MV Condock, which transported the LCT to the BAE Systems Naval Dockyard, Portsmouth to undergo restoration. Restoration of LCT 7074 was completed in 2020, and she was moved in August to a permanent display at Portsmouth's The D-Day Story museum.

Online deliberation is a relatively new field. Online deliberation is very interdisciplinary, and includes practices such as online consultation, e-participation, e-government, Citizen-to-Citizen (C2C), online deliberative polling, crowdsourcing, online facilitation, online research communities, interactive e-learning, civic dialogue in Internet forums and online chat, and group decision making that utilizes collaborative software and other forms of computer-mediated communication. Work in all these endeavors is tied together by the challenge of using electronic media in a way that deepens thinking and improves mutual understanding. Open international conferences on online deliberation have been held at Carnegie Mellon University in 2003, Stanford University in 2005, and the University of California, Berkeley in 2008. The most recent conference was held at the University of Leeds, June 30 ‚Äì July 2, 2010. Attendees of the 2005 conference voted to create an international society for online deliberation, but no formal organization has yet been established. Other events of interest have been sponsored by the Online Deliberative Democracy Consortium.Online Deliberative Democracy Consortium  Definition  Over the past few decades, scholars across research traditions and areas have commonly identified at least two aspects in their definitions of deliberation: (1) a form of communication characterized by \\"the performance of a set of communicative behaviors that promote thorough group discussion\\"; and (2) the idea that individuals involved in this process of communication carefully weigh arguments and reasons for and against some propositions posed by others in the group. To be considered deliberative discussion, argue scholars, the communication and the involved interactants' behavior has to meet criteria established by the principles of political equality and egalitarian reciprocity. According to Habermas, deliberation is \\"an interchange of rational‚Äìcritical arguments among a group of individuals, triggered by a common or public problem, whose main focus or topic of discussion is to find a solution acceptable to all who have a stake in the issue\\". Halpern and Gibbs define deliberation as \\"a particular sort of discussion between at least two individuals in which (1) the form of communication emphasizes the use of logic and reasoning instead of power or coercion, (2) this reasoned engagement focuses on a social or political issue through which participants are able to identify solutions to a common problem, and (3) individuals are open to opinions and ideas expressed by others, and at the same time the communication between them is governed by rules of equality, symmetry and civility\\". Stroud and colleagues noted that many definitions of deliberation \\"share the basic idea that deliberation involves people exchanging views on a matter of public importance in a respectful manner, reasoning through their claims, and listening to the perspectives of others\\". The advent of the Internet and subsequently Web 2.0-based applications and especially social media have fostered discursive participation and deliberation online through computer- mediated communication.  Implications for democracy   Advantages  Political deliberation is critical to societal consensus-building. Online deliberation can have positive implications for the democracy. Research has found that social media can enhance civic participation and democratic decision-making. First, online spaces allow for more equal and decentralized communication as numerous users from diverse backgrounds connect. Participants have equal opportunities to express opinions, raise questions, and exchange information. Secondly, online tools constitute a more favorable channel for users to engage in rational-critical debate than traditional synchronous channels because users are able to compose messages at their own pace and will. Thirdly, the written and asynchronous features of online deliberation enable more reflexive, rational and argumentative conversations.  Disadvantages  Researchers have questioned the utility of online deliberation as an extension of the public sphere, declining the idea that online deliberation is no less beneficial than face-to-face interaction. Computer-mediated discourse is deemed impersonal, and is found to encourage online incivility. Furthermore, users who participate in online discussions about politics are found to make comments only in groups that agree with their own views, indicating the possibility that online deliberation mainly promotes motivated reasoning and reinforces preexisting attitudes.  Quality of Online Deliberation   Deliberative Norms  In the context of new media environment, researchers have evaluated the quality of online discourse based on criteria such as the presence of civility, relevance, genuine questions, and evidence to determine if the discourse meets the deliberative norms.  Factors Influencing online deliberation  In the context of comments posted to online news sites, the presence of a recognizable journalist engaging with commenters has been found to be associated with improved quality of deliberation with reduced incivility and increased evidence-based discourse, as compared with when no one engages with commenters or when an unidentified staff member from the news organization engages with commenters. Discussions surrounding news of health or abortion topics are more relevant but with fewer genuine questions posed than news of topics on education, crimes or guns, and economy. News of education topics has less uncivil and more relevant comments than the other news topics. People provide less evidence in their discourse when discussing news of economy topics as compared to the other news topics. Group size, volume of communication, interactivity between participants, message characteristics, and social media characteristics have also been found to impact online deliberation.  Online Political Deliberation  Deliberation can be defined as being the \\"act of thinking about or discussing something and deciding carefully\\" by the Merriam-Webster dictionary. In an online political setting, however, it is more complicated than only reaching a decision. Members need to contribute material with an intent for it to be discussed and responded to by others. Participants of online deliberation need to diligently analyze, review, and present the sources of their findings before any decisions can be made. A consensus has to be reached among members of which material to use based on relevancy and quality, and ability to accurately resolve the issue of which they are trying to find a solution to. Generally, participation in online deliberation forums has been low. This is an issue because representativity is poor and can be swayed towards meeting the wishes of those that participate, consisting of those who are well- educated, and so forth. There is also the possibility that the issues wouldn't even be considered if turnout remains so low. Low levels of influence not only repel legislative bodies, but also potential participants. However, large participation levels present the chance that members are beginning to solely chat on topics, not fully read and evaluate others' inputs. If a forum is deliberate and goal-oriented, and those who participate are forced to have to go through processes to get their opinions out, those who wish to simply chatter will be filtered out, and the forums will be left only with those seriously interested and involved in finding a solution, as explored by Cyril Velikanov in his \\"Mass Online Deliberation\\" paper.  Participatory Factors  Online deliberation Internet forums require participants to be able to work together comfortably in order to make the best possible deliberations. In order to do that, as Beth Noveck has put it, forums need to establish \\"physics\\" for groups, or rules and regulations have to follow in order for members to feel comfortable with one another. Once comfort is achieved, the environment groups are now in are their \\"culture,\\" and healthy conversations can now be made. Since participants do not communicate face-to-face, visual queues often make groups more self-aware. For instance, green and red lights can be implemented for when members speak, and therefore the group can visualize if a member isn't participating or involved, or if a member is too involved. This way, imbalances in groups can be avoided, such as gridlocked situations or communication flaws.  Work Management  Systems of \\"chunking work,\\" or, members self-selecting roles to play in their groups, help to keep work high quality and manageable. Collaboration becomes easier when people choose the way they want to work in whatever way suits them. When members select the method of working that is comfortable to them, they are more likely to remain interested in their subject and produce quality content for their group. If Internet forums can find a way to divide work in a way that members are most comfortable, their outcomes will be better produced.  Rating Systems  Rating systems are valuable to Internet forums because they police both participants and the content they produce to ensure quality material. If members can rate each other based on their collaboration or work produced, then they can more easily trust those who have high ratings to have quality product. The forums themselves can also see these ratings and be able to filter out inappropriate, irrelevant, or low-quality content. Members policing each other forces the members to be cautious and aware about the information they put out. Ratings help to regulate and organize the sites on a large scale, making it easier to sift through content even if there are large amounts of it.

The initial tool was written by Johannes Dahse and released during the Month of PHP Security in May 2010 as open-source software. The open-source version is released under the Lesser GNU General Public License and was maintained until 2013. In 2016, a new and rewritten version of RIPS was released as software product by RIPS Technologies, a high-tech company based in Bochum, Germany. The new RIPS product overcomes limitations of the open source tool and addresses industrial needs. Its novel analysis techniques were awarded, amongst others, with the Internet Defense Prize by Facebook. Open-Source Version (PHP) The open-source version tokenizes PHP code (lexical analysis) based on PHP's tokenizer extension and performs semantic analysis to build a program model. Based on previously analyzed variable assignments, it performs backwards-directed inter-procedural taint analysis of sensitive sinks. Its strength is the ability to scan PHP applications very fast for PHP-specific vulnerabilities. It supports the detection of 15 different vulnerability types, including Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion, and others. Detected vulnerabilities are presented in a web interface with the minimum set of affected code lines as well as a vulnerability summary. For each vulnerability, an integrated code viewer can be opened in order to highlight the affected code lines in the original source code for easy remediation. Furthermore, help is offered to understand the vulnerability and exploits can be generated automatically. The interface also offers a list of scanned PHP files, user-defined functions, and detected sources. The weakness of the open-source version are false positives due to no use of an abstract syntax tree or control flow graph. The lacking support for object-oriented PHP code can lead to false negatives. The latest stable release version is 0.54. Commercial Version (Java, PHP) The commercial version supports the analysis of PHP and Java code. It was built from scratch and leverages new code analysis techniques which are specifically tailored to the intricacies of each programming language and its features. It uses abstract syntax trees, control flow graphs, and context-sensitive taint analysis in order to accurately identify even complex security vulnerabilities that base on second-order data flow or misplaced security mechanisms. Further, it simulates each language's built-in features, libraries and frameworks to minimize false positives. It supports the automated detection of over 200 different vulnerability types, code quality issues and misconfiguration weaknesses. RIPS found critical security issues in popular open-source projects, including WordPress, Joomla, Magento, phpBB, Moodle and Roundcube. Contrarily to the open-source version, the commercial version supports all versions of Java (up to 11), PHP (up to 7) and Node.js, industry standards such as OWASP Top 10, ASVS, CWE, SANS 25 and PCI-DSS, and can be integrated into the software development life cycle. RIPS is available as on-premises software and as Software-as-a-Service.

The latter may represent hybrids with Niebla siphonolobaNiebla siphonoloba, retrieved 22 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_siphonoloba.htm#siphonoloba on mesa above Arroyo San Andr√©s and north of Punta Canoas on Mesa Camacho. The species (N. siphonoloba) also distinguished by containing the lichen substance sekikaic acid, with triterepenes Similar species are Niebla turgida that has divaricatic acid instead of sekikaic acid, and Niebla fimbriata that differs by the dark green thicker cortex, 100‚Äì150(-200) ¬µm thick, and by the one-sided development of secondary branches that easily break off where they attach to the primary branch. Taxonomic History Niebla suffnessii was recognized as a result of undertaking a taxonomic revision of the genus in regard to developing a lichen flora of Baja California, which began in 1986. It was first collected on the Vizcaino Peninsula on Cerro Elefante, 15 May 1986, the holotype (biology), Spjut 9567B, deposited in the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution, Museum of Natural History, Botany Department)United States National Herbarium, http://botany.si.edu/colls/collections_overview.htm and at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico. It was the only Niebla on the cinder cone. The species (N. suffnessii) was subsequently found on a mesa above Arroyo San Andr√©s with several other species that contain sekikaic acid, Niebla lobulata, Niebla siphonoloba, and Niebla usneoides, around Bah√≠a Santa Mar√≠a, and on mesas north of Punta Canoas with Niebla siphonoloba, Niebla marinii, and other related species. At this northern location it may prove to be another species that could be recognized by the sharply raised cortical ridges. Niebla suffnessii has also been interpreted to belong to a broad species concept of Niebla homalea; one that recognizes only three species in the genus, two by the medulla reaction to para-phenylenediamine, depsidones (pd+, Niebla josecuervoi), depsides (pd-, Niebla homalea). and one by isidia (isidium) (Niebla isidiaescens),Bowler, P. and J.

History  The Badass Teachers Association (BAT) is an American education activist organization. BAT was founded on June 14, 2013 by Priscilla Sanstead and Mark D. Naison. Mark Naison left BAT in April 2014. The BAT mission statement says that the organization was created to give voice to every teacher who refuses to be blamed for the failure of society to erase poverty and inequality through education. According to BAT, its members refuse to accept assessments, tests and evaluations created and imposed by so-called corporate-driven entities that have contempt for authentic teaching and learning. The BAT goals are to reduce or eliminate the use of high-stakes testing, increase teacher autonomy in the classroom and work to include teacher and family voices in legislative decision-making processes that affect students. BAT teachers engage in organized group actions such as phone calls, emails, or letter writing. As Sanstead claimed, \\"vexed teachers raising their hands quietly was not working. \\" BAT has a closed Facebook page with over 56,000 members, a Twitter feed with over 23,000 followers, a website, a blog, Facebook groups in every state, International Facebook groups for teachers, and special interest Facebook groups where members can go and \\"chat\\" about their special areas of expertise in education. BAT began as a Facebook group, but its current purpose is to organize education activism around the nation. BAT members present on panels at conferences, write op-eds that appear in local, national, and state news outlets, and organize protests/events. BAT has held two summer events to protest US Department of Education policies, and held a Teachers Congress in 2015. Some commentators have stated that BAT is \\"left leaning\\" organization in its political messaging. Activity * October 24, 2013 - On Long Island, New York, BAT Executive Director Marla Kilfoyle testified before a New York State Assembly hearing about how standardized testing had harmed her son, and stated that the Common Core Standards was a developmentally-inappropriate teaching method. * November 2, 2013 - In New Jersey, BAT Assistant Executive Director Melissa Tomlinson attended a campaign rally held by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Tomlinson asked Christie \\"Why, do you continue to spread the myth that our schools and teachers are failing?\\" Christie reportedly replied, \\"Because they are!\\" Christie also said: \\"I am tired of you people. What do you want?\\" This confrontation landed Tomlinson on the national news. * January 28, 2014 - In Renton, Washington, two members of the NEA BAT Caucus, Julianna Krueger Dauble and Becca Ritchie, attended a Board of Education meeting and read \\"statements of professional conscience\\". In these statements, the teachers said they would refuse to administer standardized tests to their students. * February 2014 - BAT reviveed the Twitter hashtag #Evaluate, which trended with stories of teachers performing work beyond their job requirements for students. * June 26, 2014- In Washington State, over 300 BAT teachers staged a protest during rush hour against the alleged influence of The Gates Foundation. Protestors alleged that the Foundation funds organizations that blames teachers and teacher unions for struggling schools. The protest was aimed at highlight links between childhood poverty and school performance. * July 28, 2014 - In Washington, D.C. over 500 teachers, parents and students staged a protest in front of the USDOE. The protest resulted in a 45-minute meeting with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. * October 27, 2014 - BAT responded to the cover of Time Magazine that purportedly labeled teachers as \\"Rotten Apples.\\" Time later printed aresponse to the BAT charges. * November 7, 2014 - The California BAT issued a statement in support of Ethnic Studies in California classrooms * November 9, 2014 - The Tennessee BAT co-hosted \\"Educating Nashville\\", an education forum featuring noted education historian Diane Ravitch. BAT stated that the goal of the forum was expose the hoax of education privatization. * November 28, 2014 - Members of the Washington State Badass Teachers Association plan a Boycott of Microsoft on Black Friday. * February 10, 2015 - Members of the Florida Badass Teachers Association protest an education summit held by Jeb Bush. FLBATS protest Bush's education policies that have been reported to be a massive failure in Florida. * June 23, 2015 - The Oregon State Badass Teachers Association led a protest against testing giant Pearson at their national conference held at the Hilton in Portland, Oregon * August 20, 2015 - The Ohio Badass Teachers Association take to social media to fight against the privatization efforts of Gov. Kasich in Ohio. They are recognized in the media for the creation of their Twitter hashtag #NeverVote4Kasich. * September 5, 2015 - Ohio Badass Teacher Dawn Neely-Randall makes strong national statement that she can no longer throw her students to the \\"testing wolves.\\" * October 17, 2015 - Members of the New York Badass Teachers Association co-host and help to plan a conference for educational justice titled Call to Educational Justice!! Lean In.  Policy Work In 2014/2015 The Badass Teachers Association teamed up with the American Federation of Teachers to conduct a Quality of Work Life Survey in order to study teacher working conditions. The Survey which had over 80 questions was completed by 30,000 teachers. The results found that 1 in 5 educators feel respected by government officials or the media. 14% strongly agree with the statement that they trust their administrator or supervision. 75% say they do not have enough staff to get the work done. 78% say they are often physically and emotionally exhausted at the end of the day. 87% say the demands of their job are at least sometimes interfere with their family life. As a result of this survey Senator Corey Booker and Senator Michael Bennet created the Booker-Bennet Amendment which was added to the Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The Act called for a comprehensive study of teacher workplace stress and working conditions. It would require that Title II funds be used to conduct and publicly report on educator workplace conditions. In the summer of 2015 The Badass Teachers Association conducted a \\"Lobby Day\\" in which over 60 appointments were made in Washington D.C. by BATs from over 25 states to speak with federal lawmakers about education policy and education decision making. At the event it was reported that BATs from New York, Washington State, Oregon, and Virginia occupied Senator Bernie Sanders office until his staff agreed to talk with organizers of the association about education policy. Sen. Sanders education liaison in Washington D.C. subsequently called BATs Executive Director Marla Kilfoyle to talk about education policy and procedures. The Badass Teachers Association created a caucus in the National Education Association (NEA) in 2014 which grew to over 200 members by 2015. They also created a caucus in the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) in 2016. Ongoing Efforts The Badass Teachers Association submitted an Amicus Brief in the case of Friedrichs vs. CTA in November 2015. BATs continue to appear frequently on radio stations and podcasts such as the Education Town Hall, Just Let Me Teach Radio, The Jeff Santos Show, and The Rick Smith Show.  Criticism  The group has been known to remove people from its Facebook group for challenging its message. It has removed members who disagreed with its leadership on certain issues and deleted messages that it found \\"inappropriate.\\" It also purged students from the group. Some critics have questioned the allegiances that the group has made with the Tea Party and related groups, as part of their shared opposition to issues like the Common Core State Standards Initiative. The organization defines itself solely as a \\"left leaning\\" organization.

Hartenberg. \\"Geschichte des Technischen Zeichnens by Franz Maria Feldhaus; Edmund Schruff.\\" in: Technology and Culture Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1961), pp. 45-49  Biography  Born in Neuss as son of a pharmacist, Feldhaus studied electrical engineering without receiving his degree. Later on the occasion of his 50th birthday in 1924 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the RWTH Aachen in recognition of his accomplishments in the field of the history of science. In 1928 he was elected full member of the French \\"Acad√©mie d'Histoire des Sciences.\\" Late 1890s Feldhaus started to work as inventor and doing odd jobs, while starting to be interested in the history of science. In his Mannheim Workshop for Precision Mechanics he described himself as engineer - this term at that time still unprotected. In 1900 he gave up his practical activities and worked henceforth as historian of science and freelance writer. Feldhaus told Willy Ley that he began writing books on the history of science because, while unemployed, he read books on the subject at the library and believed that he could write better ones. Feldhaus later attended lectures by Theodor Beck (1839-1917) in Darmstadt, who had published on the history of engineering. After his death in 1917 he inherited his estate and research in the field. Over the years Feldhaus built up without any government support an archive on the history of engineering, which became one of the largest private archives in Germany. In Heidelberg and later in Berlin Feldhaus built a private institute, entitled \\"Quellenforschungen zur Geschichte der Technik und der Naturwissenschaften\\" (Source research on the history of engineering and natural science) in 1909. He also founded the company Historia-Foto GmbH, which might have been the first commercial image archive in Germany. Immediately after the Second World War in 1945-46 Feldhaus was appointed Director of the National Museum in Neustrelitz. The last years of his life he lived in Wilhelmshaven. In 1959 Feldhaus posthumously received the Rudolf- Diesel-Medaille from the German Institute for Inventions. The poet and novelist Eva Zeller (born 1923) is one of Feldhaus' daughters.  Work   Lexikon der Erfindungen und Entdeckungen, 1904  Feldhaus' first publication was the Lexikon der Erfindungen und Entdeckungen, (Dictionary of inventions and discoveries) in 1904, which gave a timeline of inventions and discoveries in the fields of science and technology. This work was designed as reference, and not for educational purposes.Feldhaus (1904, p. v)  Institute for research in the history of engineering, natural science and industry, 1909/19  In 1909 Feldhaus founded the \\"Quellenforschungen zur Geschichte der Technik und Naturwissenschaften\\" InstituteBurkhard Dietz (1996).

Vol. 68 (1961), p. 724. A 1961 review about this work by R. S. Hartenberg in the Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education commented about this opening line, that :\\"...herein is the essence of graphics. The passing centuries have brought about new concepts and improvement in methods; nevertheless industry's need for the pictorial communicator will remain. Industry will continue looking for graduates equipped with a thorough understanding of graphic principles and with the skill required to execute neat and accurate drawings...\\"ASEE 1961, p. 724.) Hartenberg further explained, that the book primarily intents to give the interested layman a good survey. After an introduction it starts with a section \\"Earliest Time, Ancient Time and the Middle Ages,\\" which: :\\"... roughs out the course of drawing from the ice-age cave-paintings through the graphic arts of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Arabia to west European practice, commenting on media and tools. Attention is called to a device common to the civilized drawings, viz., that of showing important parts located in different planes swung into a single plane.\\" The section on the Technologist's Professions (p. 5) amplified, that development of the underlying concepts, as Hartenberg (1961) summarized: :\\"... in Homeric Greece, art and technology bore the same name (and stigma? ) instead of being placed in opposition at they are today. With the Romans all things that were built, from cities to engines of war, came under the concept of architecture (as with Vitruvius); the practitioners ‚Äî people of ingenuity and inventiveness ‚Äî were called architecti....\\" And furthermore: :\\"...We learn that Rome had an \\" engineering \\" school in 228, and that Harun al-Rashid founded a technical school in Baghdad in 807. The title of engineer appears in the twelfth century, its use spreading under the urgings of the Crusaders who needed military engineers to back and encourage their Faith. Leonardo da Vinci, that peculiarly gifted man, received an appointment as engineer, and perhaps set a style, for in later generations many who achieved fame as engineers and inventors came from the non-technical ranks of life...\\"  Selected publications  * Lexikon der Erfindungen und Entdeckungen: Auf den Gebieten der Naturwissenschaften und Technik. 1904. * Feldhaus' Buch der Erfindungen.

Jane Austen may have been influenced by her writings, taking the same names as some of Lady Mary's characters. Family and personal life Melville House, Lady Mary's birthplace Lady Mary Leslie was born at Melville House, Fife, Scotland on 8 May 1736, the youngest daughter of Alexander Leslie, fifth earl of Leven and Melville, by his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of David Monypenny. On 3 January 1762, Lady Mary was married to Dr. James Walker of Innerdovat, Fife. He was a physician based at Edinburgh's prison infirmary and heavily in debt. Though the marriage was unhappy, it was said to have produced ten children. At least half must have died in infancy; the Scots Peerage, followed by McMillan, asserts three sons and one daughter though other sources point to two Walker daughters, Isabella (Bell) and Elizabeth (Betzy). (A grandson, Baron Adolphe Thi√©bault, raised questions about the paternity of Lady Mary's children, in an 1863 history.) Lady Mary was estranged from Walker, who moved alone to Jamaica in the 1770s to take up a position there as a prison physician. Lady Mary turned to writing to provide for her family. She would later note to a friend that \\"with a family of young children‚Ä¶ abandoned by their father,\\" she was forced to \\"cloath, feed, and educate them\\". She thus needed to support herself, producing her first novel Letters from the Duchesse de Crui (1777). Lady Mary was introduced by her husband to George Robinson Hamilton and ‚Äì accounts vary ‚Äì sometime after Walker's death, (alternatively, without divorcing Walker) she went away with or married Hamilton, a cousin of Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton and owner of a sugar plantation in Jamaica. She took Hamilton's name, and she and George settled in Lille, France in 1782, where he is described as a cloth merchant and they as living in great style. Two of her daughters with Walker, Isabelle and Betzy, married respectively the dramatist Victor-Joseph √âtienne de Jouy and General Paul Thi√©baut. Again, accounts vary: Lady Mary had two daughters with Hamilton, or had at least one surviving daughter with Hamilton, Sophia Saint John Hamilton Alderson. George Hamilton died on 29 October 1797, and an analysis of his will demonstrates both that he and Mary were not married, and that James Walker was still alive in 1786. Hamilton made over all of his estate to Lady Mary, with the stipulation that the Jamaica estates were to be run for Mary's benefit by James Hope-Johnstone, 3rd Earl of Hopetoun and Alexander Leslie-Melville, 7th Earl of Leven (Mary's nephew). After Hamilton's death, Lady Mary lived near Amiens, where she was very close to the writer Sir Herbert Croft. Croft was an eccentric English scholar who had compiled dictionaries, and the two lived there together as friends. Her daughter Bell and son-in-law Jouy visited them often. Croft introduced her to his secretary, Charles Nodier. Nodier translated Munster Village and helped her write another book in French, La famille du duc de Popoli or The Duc de Popoli (1810). Despite her extensive holdings in Jamaica, little or no income was earned from them and the Croft household was poor. In 1815, (in alternate sources, at age 75) she went to Jamaica, as she believed she was being cheated financially out of some of her husband's estates, which had produced ¬£3000 per annum but were now yielding ¬£400. After her return ‚Äì Croft having died in April 1816 ‚Äì she lived with her daughter Sophia Alderson, who was widowed. Lady Mary died in Brompton, Middlesex near London on 28 February 1821, although some sources such as McMillan specify an 1822 date of death. The discrepancy may arise out of a delay in proving Lady Mary's will, which took until 5 July 1822 to be settled in favour of Sophia and her son Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie Walker. Her son James Walker, a Royal Navy officer, achieved the rank of Rear-Admiral. A final conjecture concerning Lady Mary and her daughter Sophia is made by Wicks, that Sophia may have had an illegitimate daughter in 1805, fathered by Ugo Foscolo, and that the child, Floriana, was adopted and raised by Lady Mary (leaving Sophia free to marry). On Mary's death, Floriana was entrusted to the care of her father, and some or all of Sophia's inheritance was directed to Foscolo to provide for Floriana. That Ugo and Sophia had a daughter is supported by Traversa; and analysed, doubted but not discounted by Vincent. If true, then a corollary is that Lady Mary and family lived for some time in Valenciennes, before moving to Amiens. Literary analysis Her most successful work, Munster Village (1778), centres on a utopian garden city and features themes of intellectual equality, especially in marriage. Historian Dorothy McMillan writes that \\"the novel was one of the earlier works of the period to feature an ideal community\\". Hamilton creates the village from scratch and it is populated by fallen women and females escaping disastrous marriages. The community survives because it is driven by the exchange of kindness. Christine Rees has termed it \\"a drama of family relationships\\" which features the strong \\"moral sentiment\\" common of many 18th century writers. However McMillan argues that \\"the writing is marred by sententiousness and relentless intellectual name-dropping\\". Contemporary reviews of her books were in the main very favourable. The Critical Review, edited by Tobias Smollett, met the publication of the Letters from the Duchesse de Crui with high approbation ‚Äì \\"the solidity of her remarks might do honour to those of the opposite sex\\" ‚Äì and were equally approving of Memoirs of the Marchioness de Louvoi. The Monthly Review commends the \\"just observations, useful reflections and pertinent allusions to natural and civil history\\" found in Memoirs of the Marchioness de Louvoi. However its review of The Life of Mrs. Justman is scathing, speaking of the \\"absurd, incoherent and contradictory political reasoning with which these volumes abound\\" and finding its best feature to be that 75 pages of the manuscript were destroyed by fire. Lady Mary's writings included discussions of philosophy, education and art. However, McMillan posits that her works \\"have little to offer modern readers\\" and The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English has critiqued her stories for plagiarizing from others. Alessa Johns also notes the plagiarism but argues that rather than be a self-serving attribute, it reflects Lady Mary's view of a \\"public- spirited will to share and democratize\\" ideas and a sincere form of flattery. Indeed, one of her characters in Letters from the Duchesse de Crui says to not call her \\"a plagiarist... from whatever author I may have borrowed them, I shall give their names, when I recollect them: but to trace the origin of my ideas, would be an endless task\\". Nevertheless, Lady Mary's views on marriage and equality show that she was advanced for her time period. She was a strong advocate of women's education. Hamilton's stories may have influenced Jane Austen, as the English author included several of Hamilton's names in her works: Bennet and Bingley in Pride and Prejudice, and Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility. Johns observes that Hamilton's feminist utopian ideas also influenced Mary Wollstonecraft and Catharine Macaulay. A collection of her papers is held by Yale University Library.

The final episode of The Colbert Report originally aired in the United States on December 18, 2014, on Comedy Central. In the episode Stephen becomes immortal after accidentally killing \\"Grimmy\\" during the opening of the segment of \\"Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.\\". This leads to Stephen singing \\"We'll Meet Again\\" in its entirety along with a large crowd of several recognizable figures, before meeting with Santa Claus, Abraham Lincoln, and Alex Trebek on the roof of the studio. In April 2014 Stephen Colbert was chosen to replace David Letterman as the host of Late Show on CBS. It was announced that day that The Colbert Report would conclude in December 2014, and Colbert would be retiring his conservative character when he hosts The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which premiered on September 8, 2015. Colbert said in advance, before the final week of the show aired, that it would be a special week \\"like every other week\\". The final episode was the highest rated episode of the series ever, and was the number one show on cable in its time slot. The final episode received generally positive reception including several tributes and positive reviews from critics. Synopsis The episode opens during the ending of the December 18, 2014, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart checking in with Stephen to \\"toss over\\" the show (a discontinued practice used earlier in the series run). Colbert does not acknowledge it being the final episode, but quickly has Jimmy start The Colbert Report, abruptly ending The Daily Show without closing credits or a Moment of Zen. The first segment begins with a news story about a \\"Mark 1 plumbing\\" truck now being used as an anti-aircraft gun in Syria. Colbert continues by announcing the winners of the auction for his desk and fireplace set from the show's one-on-one interview area, which collectively accumulated a total of $313,420 for the Yellow Ribbon Fund and DonorsChoose. He then starts the final installment of \\"The W√∏rd\\" segment with \\"Same To You, Pal\\", including a series of clips features memorable moments and ventures done by Stephen over the past nine years. After returning from a commercial break, Stephen begins the final installment of \\"Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.\\" The opening of the segment deviates right away when \\"Grimmy\\" tries to kill Stephen after watching him cheat in their chess match. Colbert draws his pistol Sweetness and kills \\"Grimmy\\" on the spot, throwing his pistol into the crowd with a fan getting it, leaving him without a guest and making him immortal. Returning from a commercial break Stephen explains he was going to say goodbye before ending the series, but now that he has become immortal, he realizes it would be meaningless and begins singing the song \\"We'll Meet Again.\\" Soon after he starts singing he is immediately joined by Jon Stewart, as the song proceeds the studio continues to fill rapidly with several recognizable figures who have been involved in the show throughout its run. After the song ends, the studio is now empty, with a painting without Stephen Colbert, and Stephen is on the roof of the studio questioning what he should do now. Santa Claus' sleigh suddenly lands in front of him; Santa is accompanied by a unicorn-hybrid Abraham Lincoln, and Alex Trebek, \\"the man with all the answers\\". Stephen agrees to join them, but worries that this means he will be gone forever. Trebek assures Stephen that they will always be there for the American people, when they need them the most. The episode ends with Colbert thanking everyone involved in the show throughout the run, and he calls upon Mavis Staples to help do so. Signing off with the words, \\"From Eternity, I'm Stephen Colbert,\\" he then throws the show back to Jon Stewart, paying homage to his character's beginnings on The Daily Show and hinting that the entire series was just a nine-year-long correspondent segment. Jon thanks Stephen for the report and introduces the Moment of Zen, which is a previously unaired clip of Stewart checking in with Colbert from June 3, 2010. After being told that the said footage will not be used on air, Stewart says, \\"let's go back into our funny characters ... Stephen, what are you doing?\\" To which Colbert mockingly replies, \\"Hi Jon, I'm getting angry at liberals\\". The show's closing credits were played out with the song \\"Holland, 1945\\" by Neutral Milk Hotel instead of the usual theme. He picked the song in honor of his father and two brothers who died in a plane crash. Background In 2012 Comedy Central renewed Jon Stewart's contract to host The Daily Show through the end of 2015 and Stephen Colbert's contract to host The Colbert Report through the end of 2014. Colbert intentionally had his contract synced up with David Letterman's contract to host Late Show with David Letterman on CBS, so they would both expire at the same time; so that in the event Letterman chose to retire Colbert would be available to take over the show. On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced on his show that he would retire in 2015. One week later on April 10, 2014, it was announced that Colbert was chosen to replace Letterman as the host of Late Show on CBS beginning in 2015. It was also announced that The Colbert Report would conclude at the end of 2014, and that Colbert will not be using his conservative character on Late Show. Comedy Central soon released a statement saying \\"Comedy Central is proud that the incredibly talented Stephen Colbert has been part of our family for nearly two decades. We look forward to the next eight months of the ground-breaking Colbert Report and wish Stephen the very best\\". Following the announcement, Colbert made a special surprise appearance in character on the April 23, 2014, episode of The Daily Show to announce that it has become clear to him that he has \\"won television\\" and changed the world, the goal he originally set out to do, and thus no longer feels the need to continue. He expressed interest in taking over Late Show after Letterman retires but couldn't because \\"they already gave it to some fat guy\\". In subsequent episodes following the announcement Colbert never directly mentioned moving to CBS (with the exception of a few subtle jokes alluding to it), differentiating the real world Colbert from the character. On the July 30, 2014 episode actor James Franco tried unsuccessfully to get Colbert to break character by mentioning the upcoming show. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert premiered on September 8, 2015. The Colbert Report was replaced on Comedy Central by The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore hosted by Larry Wilmore, a contributor for The Daily Show. The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore premiered on January 19, 2015. Production and broadcast When commenting on the final week of The Colbert Report Colbert stated \\"Our last week of shows are going to be really special, just like every other week\\". The closing credits offer an apology to Doris Kearns Goodwin (as part of a running gag on the series), and feature the song \\"Holland, 1945\\" by Neutral Milk Hotel, as a tribute to Colbert's father and two of his older brothers, Peter and Paul, who were killed in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 when he was 10 years old.

The ship has a capacity of 2,520 cars or 450 lorries. History The ship was built in 2000 at yard number 1161 by Tsuneishi Holdings Corporation, Nakatado District, Kagawa, Japan. The keel was laid on 3 December 1999 and the ship was launched as Maersk Wind on 1 May 2000 initially under AP M√∏ller, Singapore management. Management was transferred to AP M√∏ller-Maersk, Copenhagen, Denmark later in 2000. Management was transferred back in 2007. In 2008, the ship was sold to H√∂egh Autocarriers and renamed H√∂egh Osaka. The port of registry is Singapore. It has IMO number 9185463 and MMSI number 563248000, and call sign is S6TY. The ship has a maximum speed of . H√∂egh Osaka is owned by H√∂egh Autoliners and operated under the management of Wallem Shipmanagement, Singapore. January 2015 grounding The grounded ship in January 2015 On 3 January 2015 H√∂egh Osaka was loaded at Southampton, Hampshire, United Kingdom with a ro-ro cargo of buses, construction equipment and Range Rover cars in addition to some unspecified cargo already on board. More cargo was to be loaded at Bremerhaven, Germany, its next stop and then at Hamburg, Germany for more cargo and refuelling. This was a change from the normal route of Hamburg, Bremerhaven and then Southampton. A pilot embarked at 19:30 and the ship departed at 20:06. At 20:59, the ship made a starboard turn and entered the Thorn Channel travelling at . After entering the channel speed increased to . At 21:09, H√∂egh Osaka made a port turn at the West Bramble Buoy and developed a severe list. The pilot gave the order to stop engines at 21:10, and expressed doubts in respect of the metacentric height (GM) of the vessel. As the list increased, the ship's propeller and rudder came clear of the water. The ship grounded on the Bramble Bank off the Isle of Wight at 21:15, and settled with a list that would eventually reach 52¬∞. According to the owners they beached the vessel intentionally on the Bramble Bank in the Solent. At 21:19 the D-class inshore lifeboat from Calshot Lifeboat Station was called out. The tugs Svitzer Ferriby and Svitzer Surrey, in Southampton Water at the time, were also sent to the assistance of H√∂egh Osaka. A Severn- class lifeboat from Yarmouth and an Atlantic 85-class lifeboat from Cowes, Isle of Wight were called out. The second Calshot Lifeboat was then called out. A Coastguard AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter from RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus) was called out and the tug Apex was also sent to assist. At 21:54, Svitzer Ferriby arrived at the Bramble Bank and assisted in beaching the ship. One crew member broke an arm and a leg when he fell and slid for about in a corridor as the ship listed. A crew member jumped into the water as a lifeboat approached and was rescued. Six crew were winched aboard the helicopter from Lee-on-the-Solent and landed there. assisted in the coordination of the rescue efforts. A crew member from the Yarmouth Lifeboat was winched onto H√∂egh Osaka to assist with the evacuation. A Royal Air Force Westland Sea King helicopter was called out from RAF Chivenor. The National Police Air Service also sent a helicopter equipped with night vision equipment. All crew except pilot, captain and chief officer had been rescued by 00:15 on 4 January. All were evacuated at 02:09 because the vessel's list was increasing as the tide fell. The ship was carrying a cargo of 1,400 vehicles and about 70 pieces of construction equipment. Svitzer were appointed as salvers. A maritime exclusion zone was set up around the ship, and airspace below closed to aircraft within . An attempt to refloat the ship was scheduled for 7 January, but cancelled because more water than expected was discovered inside the vessel. The ship refloated without outside assistance later that day assisted by high tide and strong winds, taken in tow and moored approximately east at Alpha Anchorage, between East Cowes and Lee-on-the-Solent to await further salvage operations. On 22 January, H√∂egh Osaka was towed in to Southampton, salvage operations having reduced the list to 5¬∞. Return to service On 10 February, H√∂egh Osaka departed from Southampton for Falmouth, Cornwall to be repaired. The ship returned to service on 20 February 2015, sailing from Falmouth via Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea headed for Bar, Montenegro. Investigation The Marine Accident Investigation Branch opened an investigation into the accident. Its report into the incident was published on 17 March 2016. The investigation found that plans for the loading of the cargo had not been changed despite the change in itinerary. No calculation of the vessel's stability had been made, a practice found to be common across many operators' fleets. The weight of cargo on board had been underestimated, being 265 tonnes greater than estimated. The investigation found that although the cargo had shifted as a result of the ship listing, it was not the cause of the list. The ship's ballast water system was not fully serviceable, all but one of the gauges for each ballast tank were unserviceable, a situation that had existed since at least July 2014. It was possible to take manual readings of the amount of water in each ballast tank. The chief officer was in the habit of calculating how much water was transferred between tanks by timing the pumps and using their capacity of 7 tonnes per minute. Some of the straps used to secure the cargo to the deck were found not to meet regulations in force at the time, only being half as strong as they should have been.

It was designed by Eaton & Bates and built from 1902 to 1923. It is also known as Convent of the Annuciation and Red Hill Convent. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 March 2003.  History  St Brigid's Convent, Red Hill, was erected in 1902-03 for the Order of the Sisters of Mercy in Queensland, to a design by the architectural firm of Eaton and Bates. It occupies the site of an earlier, s private residence known as Kenilworth. The land on which the convent is situated was surveyed and alienated in 1865, as portions 608 and 609, parish of North Brisbane. At this period Red Hill was sparsely populated, the steepness of the hills deterring settlement initially, but from the 1870s, proximity to the town centre, the availability of cheap residential allotments in the valleys, and later the provision of a tram service through the district, encouraged residential development of the area. In 1877 the first St Brigid's Church was erected on the site of the present church on Musgrave Road. In 1881, Sisters of Mercy from All Hallow's Convent, Fortitude Valley, established a school at St Brigid's Church, travelling daily to Red Hill. The Sisters also undertook pastoral work in the Petrie Terrace- Red Hill district. On 9 June 1901, a new St Brigid's School was opened and blessed at Red Hill, adjacent to the Church, reflecting the expansion of residential settlement in the Red Hill district around the turn of the century. Although portions 608 and 609, on which St Brigid's Convent was erected in the early 1900s, were subdivided almost immediately after purchase from the crown in 1865, and changed tenure from 1866, it is possible that the first development of the site only took place after all six subdivisions of portion 608, with frontages to both Upper and Lower Clifton Terrace, were acquired in 1873 by Lydia Pigott, widow of Gayndah grazier Peter John Pigott. In December 1874 Mrs Pigott married Brisbane broker and merchant, William Horsley, and they appear to have been resident at Kenilworth, on Mrs Horsley's property on Clifton Terrace, by 1876. Extensive terracing on portion 608, still evident on the ground, is likely to have been developed as part of the grounds of Kenilworth. In 1889 Lydia Horsley acquired title to an adjacent block, subdivision 11 of portion 609. The Horsleys resided at Kenilworth until , and the house appears to have been rented out for several years prior to its acquisition by the Sisters of Mercy in May 1902, for the sum of ¬£1610. The Sisters commissioned architects Eaton and Bates of Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville, one of the more fashionable and prolific architectural firms of the day, to design their new convent. Sydney-trained architects George T Eaton and Albert Edmund Bates had formed a partnership in Rockhampton and developed a successful Central Queensland practice in the late 19th century, with branch offices established at Mount Morgan and Longreach by 1898, Clermont in 1900, Gladstone in 1901, Maryborough in 1902, and Townsville by 1902. Arthur B Polin of Sydney joined the partnership in Townsville , as Eaton, Bates & Polin. Early in 1902 their head office was moved to Brisbane, with branches retained at Rockhampton and Townsville. A branch also operated briefly at Toowoomba in the early 1900s. They entered and won many architectural competitions around the turn of the century, and undertook a wide variety of work, from hotels and commercial buildings to residences, hospitals and masonic halls. One of their most glamorous commissions was for the new Queen's Hotel (1901‚Äì04) at Townsville, won in competition. Eaton and Bates received many commissions from the Catholic Church, including churches at Barcaldine, Gladstone and Donnybrook, convents and schools at Mount Morgan, Gladstone and Geraldton and a school at Toowong. The firm also supervised construction of St Joseph's Cathedral, Rockhampton and the Church of the Sacred Heart, Townsville (1896-1902) (now the Sacred Heart Cathedral). Their style was eclectic, drawing upon both eastern and western classical traditions, with a particular emphasis on verandahs and pavilions - both as a decorative device and as a response to the warm Queensland climate. In mid-1902, Eaton and Bates called tenders for the erection and completion of brick convent buildings at Red Hill. Possibly initially known as the Convent of the Annunciation, the building was completed and occupied in 1903, with Sister M Thecla Kelleher, Head Teacher at St Brigid's School, as the first Superior. The building cost over ¬£3100 to construct, and it was furnished in 1903 for a little over ¬£500. At this period the north verandah was single-storeyed, a decorative picket fence defined the frontage of the property to Upper Clifton Terrace, and the front grounds contained several mature pines trees. In mid-1906, the Sisters acquired title to several blocks adjacent to St Brigid's Convent: subdivision 10 of portions 615 & 616 (20.6 perches ) and subdivisions 12 & 13 of por 609 (36.2 perches), parish of North Brisbane, county of Stanley, from the estate of Alexander Fraser. Subdivisions 12 and 13 extended the convent grounds along Lower Clifton Terrace. The northern upper floor verandah may have been added in 1923, when additions to the convent costing ¬£1140 were carried out. At its peak, St Brigid's Convent is likely to have accommodated 8 or 9 sisters, but no pupil boarders. The Sisters continued their pastoral work in the district, and in later years, several basement rooms and a small cottage in the backyard (since demolished) are understood to have been used as refuges or temporary accommodation for the homeless. Although St Brigid's School closed in the mid-1980s, several Sisters remained at St Brigid's Convent until the building was vacated by the Order in late 1999.  Description  Convent, 2009 St Brigid's Convent, located on the crest of Red Hill overlooking Brisbane city, is built into a sloping site which falls steeply between upper and lower Clifton Terrace. The building possesses strong landmark value, being a prominent element on the Red Hill skyline, and visible from Musgrave Road, which is a major arterial road. It fronts Upper Clifton Terrace to the west, and from the rear verandahs on the east; there is a magnificent vista over the city. The building is two-storeyed with a substantial sub-storey or basement at the rear, and is of brick construction, rendered externally and plastered internally. It has a galvanised iron roof with small ventilation gablets, but early cast-iron cresting and finials have been removed. Front and rear elevations each have a gabled projection on the southern end, which punctuate surrounding verandahs on two levels. The front gabled projection has three lancet windows on the upper level and on the lower level a further projection housing the chapel sanctuary; in this wall is a niche and statue, understood to be of Mary (Our Lady of the Annunciation). The rear gabled projection has a bank of three lancet windows on both ground and first levels. The galvanised iron verandah roofs are separate to the main roof. The west (front) and south (side)verandahs have decorative cast iron columns, balustrade and valances on both levels, incorporating ecclesiastical motifs of lancet and rose windows in the designs. The east (rear) verandahs originally had a similar decoration to both levels, but the balustrade has been removed from the upper verandah, which has been enclosed with aluminium-framed windows. The north (side) verandah, which originally was single-storeyed, has the same decorative cast- iron work on the lower verandah, but the upper verandah is enclosed with s weatherboards and timber casement windows. The basement level at the rear has a colonnade of lancet-shaped masonry arches. The front entrance, set to one side, has surrounding leadlights and cedar panelling. It opens into a wide vestibule, separated from the hallway by a rounded arch infilled with a glass and timber screen and door. A door to the right opens from the vestibule into a small front parlour. Beyond the screen is the staircase leading to the upper floor, and a central hallway running off to the right in a north-south direction, which leads to the chapel and original dining room at the southern end of the ground floor. This hallway is broad and also gives access to another front parlour and to a former rear parlour with a fireplace. The latter room has been converted into a dining room, and the rear (south) wall of this has been opened to allow access to the enclosed rear verandah, which is now a kitchen. The chapel has leadlight lancet windows along the south wall, and a lancet-shaped timber-panelled door which opens into a small vestry at the southwest end. The chapel is separated from the original dining room by folding timber (cedar) doors, which can be opened to extend the area of the chapel. There is a fine marble fireplace-surround with early tiles in the former dining room, and an early hearth and grate. The ground floor partitions are of load-bearing brick, plastered and painted. This plan form, materials and finishing is mirrored on the first floor, but here, in addition, some rooms have been partitioned with vertically-jointed timber to create small bedrooms or \\"cells\\", and bathrooms, especially above the chapel wing. A tall arched opening in the north side wall leads from the upstairs central hallway onto the enclosed north verandah, which is a s addition. This opening was originally a window, and evidence of this can be seen in the fabric. A narrow timber service staircase in the northeast corner of the verandah links both the ground and first floors to the basement, which contains the original kitchen and pantries. An opening in the southern wall of the kitchen appears to be associated with the operation of an early \\"dumb waiter\\", from outside the kitchen to the verandah adjacent to the dining room above. Part of the basement colonnade at the southeast corner of the building has been enclosed as temporary accommodation, and part of the main pantry, which runs north- south for the width of the building and behind the kitchen, has been enclosed at the north end as a bathroom, which is accessed from the outside. Joinery throughout is of cedar (some of which has been painted) and is substantial. The ground floor ceilings have pressed metal finishes, but the first floor ceilings are lined with narrow tongue and groove boards. The front parlours on the ground floor have step-out telescopic windows. The building sits on the high ground of a large, mostly grassed terraced block, with several mature eucalypts on the lower ground near Lower Clifton Terrace, a small front garden adjacent to Upper Clifton Terrace, and some perimeter planting along the south side of the block. The Upper Clifton Terrace frontage has a late 20th century brick fence with an extruded pipe railing, and there is a small steel-framed and steel-roofed carport in the front yard, to the southwest of the convent building. Immediately behind the building are the brick and concrete foundations of a small outbuilding, demolished fairly recently. The terracing follows the steep slope of the land down the hill, at the rear of the building. One set of concrete terrace steps survives, but three other early sets of steps between the terraces have been removed.  Heritage listing  St Brigid's Convent was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 March 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Brigid's Convent, erected in 1902-03, is important in illustrating the growth of Red Hill as a Brisbane dormitory suburb in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. St Brigid's Convent is a well-executed and largely intact example of a masonry Catholic convent of the late 19th/early 20th centuries, designed to take into account the warm Queensland climate. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of a convent building, reflecting a way of life for religious women that is now uncommon. It is a fine example of the ecclesiastical work of the important Queensland architectural firm of Eaton and Bates. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place is significant also as one of a body of substantial Catholic buildings erected on prominent hilltop locations in Brisbane in the first half of the 20th century - a policy aimed at creating an identifiably impressive public image for the work of the Catholic Church in Queensland. The place retains its substantial original grounds - including terracing associated with earlier s development of the site for residential purposes - and significant city vistas. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has social significance engendered by its aesthetic and landmark qualities, being a distinctive element of the Red Hill skyline for nearly a century, and contributing strongly to the complex \\"historical character\\" of the suburb. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place is significant also for its special association with the work of the Sisters of Mercy in Queensland, in particular their important educational and pastoral work in the Red Hill-Petrie Terrace district from the early 1880s.

It holds New Zealand's tallest lighthouse and since the maritime structure was fully automated in 1989, the island has been uninhabited. Etymology The name of the island is thought to be descriptive, with the shape of the island appearing like a dog, and the reef on the north-west corner of the island being locally known as the Dog's Tongue. The MƒÅori name (motu: island, and piu: to swing) refers to MƒÅori legend of a large pounamu turning into this island. Geography Bluff Hill Dog Island is low-lying and rocky, and its highest (natural) point is about above sea level. The size of the island is . Dog Island Lighthouse After long discussions, the island was chosen as Southland's first site for a lighthouse; the recommendation was made by the Invercargill Harbour Master to James Alexander Robertson Menzies, the first Superintendent of the Southland Province. The lighthouse was designed by James Balfour, at the time marine engineer to the Otago Provincial Council and later to the Colonial Government of New Zealand, at a total height of ; due to the low-lying nature of the island, the lighthouse had to be quite tall to be effective. The lighthouse on Dog Island was first operated in August 1865. There were originally three lighthouse keepers with their families on the island. The initial rotating light mechanism had to be wound up hourly, and in 1883, the principal lighthouse keeper died when he fell down the central shaft trying to attach weights to the mechanism. Later, only one keeper lived on the island with his family. The lighthouse was automated in 1989, and the island has since been uninhabited. The lighthouse is the tallest lighthouse in New Zealand, and one of its oldest. Due to its black and white stripes, it might be one of New Zealand's most distinctive lighthouses. The lighthouse is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I structure, with registration number 395. Despite the lighthouse, the steamer SS Waikouaiti ran aground on 28 November 1939 during dense fog and was wrecked. Due to its remote location, children could not attend school on the mainland, and supplies arrived by ship every three months. A landing strip was built so that fortnightly supplies could arrive by plane. Today There is no public access to Dog Island, but it can be seen from Bluff on a clear day. A Dog Island Motu Piu Charitable Trust has formed to work on heritage preservation and public education. As the island is free of introduced mammalian predators, the trust also plans to reintroduce native species such as tuatara, kiwi and Sooty shearwater to the island. Sarah Dowie, Member of Parliament for the electorate, is the current deputy chair of the trust. The trust's work was recognised in 2012 in the inaugural Environment and Conservation Awards. Cetaceans such as southern right whales can be spotted around the island during migration seasons.Department of Conservation, 2011, The right time for southern right whales.

The group was discovered and named by Matthew Flinders on 13 February 1802. The island group has enjoyed protected area status since the 1960s and since 2011, it been part of the Investigator Group Wilderness Protection Area. Description Ward Islands is an island group located about west by south of Cape Finniss on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, about west by south of the town of Elliston and about west north-west of the south west point of Flinders Island.DMH, 1985, chart 38 The group consist of two islands: Ward Island (also known as the NE islet) and South Ward Island (also known as the SE Islet). Ward Island covers an area of . It rises above sea level with a coastline consisting of cliffs and scree slopes, all described as being ‚Äòsteep‚Äô, to a summit at which has a relatively flat profile and ‚Äòwhich carries a crust of soil and a few diminutive sand dunes‚Äô. South Ward Island is described as ‚Äòa hump of rock and soil‚Äô which reaches a height of above sea level and which is located about to the south-east of Ward Island. Access to Ward Island (and presumably to South Ward Island) is reported as being ‚Äòcomplicated by the swell and the rocky coast‚Äô to the extent that in one instance, ‚Äòno safe boat landing sites could be found‚Äô. As a result, a survey carried out in 1980 used a helicopter to land survey personnel on Ward Island.Robinson et al, 1996, page 382 Formation, geology and oceanography The Ward Islands were formed about 9450 years ago following the rise of sea levels at the start of the Holocene.Robinson et al, 1996, Page 11 Geologically, Ward Island is the remnant of a small hill with a volcanic plug core which had solidified to granite more than 1500 Ma ago and whose summit was buried under sand that consolidated to calcarenite, and that has been extensively eroded by wave action since the commencement of sea level rise. The Ward Islands are part of a submerged reef system which includes a number of ‚Äòsunken rocks, and three detached reefs, on which the sea generally breaks‚Äô and which extends from Ward Island to the west of for about and to the south for about . A depth of is reached within of the west of Ward Island. Flora and fauna Flora Terrestrial flora on the island group was found in 1980 to be represented by 12 species present as a ‚Äòlow, salt and wind-pruned heath‚Äô and dominated by the following three species. Marsh saltbush is common on Ward Island in ‚Äòdeepest patches of the sandy loam soil‚Äô followed by Nitre bush which favours ‚Äòlimey calcareous soils‚Äô and pointed twinleaf which favours ‚Äòthe orange, decomposed sandstone soils‚Äô. South Ward Island is vegetated with marsh saltbush as are a number of large rocks which are permanently exposed above low water.Robinson, 1996, pages 479- 480 Fauna Vertebrate animals observed on the island group include Australian sea lions and New Zealand fur seals and the following bird species: short tailed shearwater, white faced storm petrel, osprey, white-bellied sea-eagle, Richard‚Äôs pipit, sooty oystercatcher, silver gull, Pacific gull and rock parrot.Robinson et al, 1996, page 195DEH, 2006, page 64DEH, 2006, pages 65, 68 & 69 History European discovery and use Flinders discovered the island group on Saturday, 13 February 1802, and reportedly named it after his mother‚Äôs maiden name.

She was a society figure, belonging to the British upper class; she was the daughter of Rev. Edwin Hatch, as well as the sister of Beatrice Sheward Hatch and Evelyn Maud Hatch. Early life Ethel Charlotte Chase Hatch was born as the youngest daughter of Evelyn and Edwin Hatch. Ethel had two sisters, being Beatrice and Evelyn Maud, the latter presumably being named after her mother. She also had a brother named Arthur Herbert Hatch (b. 1864), who was House Prefect at his school, Malvern College. p. 162. The family lived in a Gothic-style house built in 1867 on Banbury Road in Norham Gardens, North Oxford, England. The house was described as having \\"arched windows, a tower, and a turret complete with a statue niche towards the top.\\" Neighborhood friends included Julia and Ethel Huxley, daughters of Thomas Henry Huxley and the aunts of Aldous Huxley. Other acquaintances in the neighbourhood who visited the Hatch family included Bonamy Price, Mark Pattison, and Benjamin Jowett. Ethel's father Edwin was a theologian; author; a vice-principal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford; and later a university reader in Ecclesiastical history. The Hatch family moved in \\"stimulating circles\\", including friendships with Edward Burne-Jones, Algernon Charles Swinburne and William Morris. Ethel attended Oxford High School, Oxford in Oxfordshire, a private girls school. She graduated at age 17 before going on holiday to St Leonards-on-Sea with her mother for three months. While on holiday, her mother continued to give her lessons to expand her education. Relationship with Dodgson Beatrice and Ethel, taken by Dodgson in his Christ Church Studio on 24 March 1874 Ethel, along with her sisters, was introduced to Dodgson through mutual acquaintances. Dodgson cultivated \\"the friendship of many little girls\\", often photographing them. Dodgson's friendships with these children focused on upper-middle-class families, making sure \\"he did not seek very low-class children as friends.\\" Ethel's family were of an upper middle class station and they subsequently became friends with Dodgson. Ethel's mother gave permission to Dodgson to photograph her three girls and Dodgson was considered a family friend. Beatrice, rather than Ethel or Evelyn, was considered the \\"long term favorite of Dodgson.\\" Dodgson's friendship with Ethel continued for a number of years, however. Along with clothed photo shoots, Dodgson also photographed Ethel nude. She was considered one of Dodgson's muses. The photos that Dodgson took of nude prepubescent girls has been the cause of much discussion and speculation in contemporary times. Art Dodgson tried to make arrangements for Ethel to study under Sir Hubert von Herkomer, a British painter of German descent. This arrangement did not come to fruition, however, and Ethel went to study at the Slade School of Art in London, England. While there, she focused on painting foreign scenes and flower arrangements. At Slade, Ethel studied under Henry Tonks, Philip Wilson Steer, and Frederick Brown. Ethel had Brown's figure painting class 1896‚Äì1897, where she earned an extra certificate for her work. Ethel worked mostly with watercolors, and her paintings made the rounds at galleries for display. Christie's, the art business and a fine arts auction house, has auctioned off some of Ethel's work. One of those pieces was a signed watercolor called On the Sand, Midsummer. The 10 x 14¬ºin piece had a realised price of ¬£352. Works of Ethel's were presented at the New English Art Club, of which she was a member. Her technique won praise: \\"Amongst the oils, however, No. 51 At the Fair by Miss Ethel C. Hatch, though only a sketch, shows clever handling of the lights and of the varied colours. It suggests a crowd of children, but has to be observed from a considerable distance to be seen to advantage.\\" The Government Art Collection in Britain has a piece of Ethel's named A View of Lago di Orta in their collection. It was presented by the artist to the Collection in 1972 and was given GAC number 17065. Later life On 10 November 1889, Ethel's father died. Ethel was 20 years old at the time. Ethel maintained a friendship with artist Joan Hassall, another artist, who had focused on wood engraving and book illustrating. For the 1959 release of The Yale Edition of the Swinburne Letters, 1854‚Äì1869, Volume 1; Volumes 1854‚Äì1869, Ethel donated letters to her father Edwin from Algernon Charles Swinburne. Four letters appear in the compilation, and Ethel copied all mention of Swinburne from her father's journals for the publication as well. On 20 September 1920, at age 51, Ethel was among the chief mourners at the funeral of William Sanday, Dean Ireland's Professor of Exegesis of Holy Scripture at Oxford between 1883 and 1895. She was joined in formal mourning by her sister Evelyn, as well as Professor Cuthbert Turner. She died in Kensington in 1975, a month shy of her 106th birthday.

Founded as the Century Freeway Housing Program in 1979, Century Housing and its predecessor have financed more than 25,000 affordable homes throughout California. History Century Freeway Century Housing, and its predecessor, the Century Freeway Housing Program (CFHP), was initially created in response to the environmental and social impacts expected from development of the Century Freeway, one of the last urban segments of the Interstate Highway System to be developed in an existing urban area before fiscal realities ended the growth of freeway development. The Century Freeway was originally included in the 1958 Master Plan of Freeways and Express ways prepared by the Metropolitan Transportation Engineering Board (MTEB), and previous plans dating from 1956, and was proposed to go from the Los Angeles International Airport east to the City of Riverside. Despite being referenced with different route numbers, it remained a part of the California highway master plan, and by 1979 was included in District 7 Highway System as I-105, was planned to extend from El Segundo immediately south of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) about 20 miles east to intersect with Interstate 5 in Norwalk, passing through the communities of Los Angeles, Hawthorne, Inglewood, Willowbrook, Lynwood, Paramount, Bellflower, Downey, and Norwalk. Ultimately, due to the opposition of Norwalk and the lack of capacity on Interstate 5, the right of way was terminated at the western edge of Norwalk, just east of the intersection with Interstate 605. Keith v. Volpe In 1972, before the construction of Century Freeway began, members of the community brought a lawsuit against the state and federal agencies responsible for the funding and construction of the freeway.Note: Keith v. Volpe is the name of several separately reported cases, some of which are only tangentially related to the actual construction of the Century Freeway. Some of the cited cases are: 960 F.Supp. 1448 (C.D.Cal.1997); 965 F.Supp. 1337 (C.D.Cal.1996); 644 F.Supp. 1312 (C.D.Cal.1986); 643 F.Supp. 37 (C.D.Cal.1985); 618 F.Supp. 1132 (C.D.Cal.1985); 501 F.Supp. 403 (C.D.Cal.1980); 352 F.Supp. 1324 (C.D.Cal.1972); and appeals, Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467 (9th Cir.1988); 833 F.2d 850 (9th Cir.1987); 784 F.2d 1457 (9th Cir.1986); Keith v. California Highway Comm'n, 506 F.2d 696 (9th Cir.1974) (en banc), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 908, 95 S.Ct. 826, 42 L.Ed.2d 837 (1975) The suit sought to require changes to the design of the freeway to reduce the environmental effects of the freeway on surrounding communities and regional air quality, mitigate the economic effects of the disruption to the community, extend employment and subcontracting opportunities to local residents and businesses, eliminate perceived racial and economic discrimination against displacees seeking replacement housing, and assure the availability of replacement housing for residents whose homes would be destroyed by the construction activities. The U.S. District Court issued a preliminary injunction in July 1972, prohibiting further work until federal and state officials complied with environmental and relocation assistance statutes. Aff'd en banc sub nom., Keith v. California Highway Commission, 506 F.2d 696 (9th Cir.1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 908, 95 S.Ct. 826, 42 L.Ed.2d 837 (1975) asked the issued an injunction to stop the state and federal governments from constructing the freeway until its environmental impact‚Äîincluding the depletion of the housing stock in the area surrounding the proposed freeway‚Äîcould be evaluated and minimized. The case, presided over by then-District Court Judge Harry Pregerson, prevented construction for several years. In 1979, the parties to the lawsuit entered into a Consent Decree (amended in 1981), and the Court lifted the preliminary injunction, permitting construction to go forward. The Consent Decree imposed a replacement requirement on the transportation agencies, under the provisions of the Uniform Relocation Act requiring public agencies to provide replacement housing as a \\"last resort\\" where it is found that there is an inadequate supply of housing to accommodate the persons being displaced by the construction. The Consent Decree established three separate programs: (1) 1,025 units were to be built through rehabilitation of new construction and made available to eligible purchasers or renters (the 1025 Program Segment); (2) 1,175 units were to be built to meet the needs of corridor residents eligible for benefits under the relocation act (the 1175 Program Segment); and, (3) as many units as possible were to be built from a federal commitment of $110 million plus the state's pro rata share (the $110 Million Program Segment). Any proceeds from sale of the housing developed by the $110 Million Program Segment were to be recycled into the program for reuse in developing additional housing. Century Freeway Housing Program The terms of the Consent Decree required development of replacement housing. In order to carry out this mandate, the Century Freeway Housing Program (CFHP) was created as a division of the California Department of Housing and Community Development (CalHCD). CalHCD created the Century Freeway Replenishment Housing Program, Housing Plan and Environmental Assessment in 1982.Housing Plan and Environmental Assessment for Century Freeway Housing Program pursuant to Keith v. Volpe lawsuit This plan implemented the Consent Decree's three programs within a \\"primary zone\\" of development approximating a band within six miles of the I-105 right-of-way. The CFHP was charged with creating a minimum of 3,700 homes at prices that fit the budgets of low- and medium-income families to replenish the housing stock that would be lost due to the construction of the freeway. The work of the CFHP was overseen by the Federal Highway Administration, as well as California state agencies. Initially, the CFHP acted as a developer, acquiring land, and building single-family homes, condominiums, and rental apartments, or purchased completed units from private developers on a turnkey basis. In 1987, media reports claimed that the CFHP housing program was a failure, pointing to high costs, high vacancy rates, and opposition to the public housing development model being used for some housing. The charges led to calls for investigations by Congress and the grand jury. The Center for Law in the Public Interest (CLIPI), representing the plaintiffs in the Keith v. Volpe lawsuit, proposed in 1988 that the housing replacement program be completed by a to-be-formed nonprofit corporation, not CFHP. The proposed Century Community Housing Corp. would have been charged with building 2,500 new dwellings in three years, compared to the 1,300 units completed by CFHP over the prior seven years. The new entity was to be governed by a board including elected and appointed officials from affected cities, and was expected to compete for tax credits, tax exempt bond allocations, and other federal, state and local housing finance resources against other affordable housing developers to leverage the funds from the FHWA and Caltrans. While CLIPI's proposal was not accepted, CFHP did alter its approach. In 1989, after several years of direct development activity, the CFHP was restructured to become a lender to provide a more efficient development process and to maximize leveraging opportunities with public and private lending sources. Privatization In July 1995, after the completion of the freeway and meeting of the initial housing development goal, all parties agreed to the privatization of the CFHP as the Century Housing Corporation, the only known conversion of a California state program to a private, nonprofit corporation. The court retained oversight of the new entity, including appointment of members to its board of directors. The initial Board included Carl Covitz, Norm Emerson, Carrie Hawkins, G. Allan Kingston (who had served as the executive director of CFHP and was acting as administrator/trustee during the transition, and later would be president/CEO of the new nonprofit), Stephen McDonald, Robert J. Norris, Jr. (who had served as associate director of CFHP, and would later become executive vice president of the new nonprofit), William Park, William Robertson, and Ronne Lynn Thielen. Century, now governed by its board of directors, was admitted as a defendant in Keith v. Volpe and became a party to the consent decree, with the responsibility to manage the assets of and honor the obligations of the housing program. Among other changes, Century Housing proposed altering some of the limitations of the consent decree, including expanding the geographic area in which its operations could be undertaken. Originally constrained to a zone of communities lying within six miles of the freeway right-of-way, the consent decree was amended to expand it to include communities within twelve miles of the freeway. Century Housing sought to expand this zone even farther away from the freeway, as well as shift its housing financing from outright grants or \\"soft debt\\" deep subsidy long-term financing which the borrowers were not required to repay for decades, to shorter term financing which developers would be expected to repay. This was opposed by plaintiffs representatives. Century Housing Century's role‚Äîstocking the housing market with more options for working families and individuals‚Äîcontinues through loan and credit enhancement products, including construction financing, bridge loans, property acquisition and predevelopment loans, subordinate bond guarantees, subordinate bonds, and credit lines. Lending Century provides development capital to both for-profit and not- for-profit developers seeking to build housing that will be rented at affordable prices to persons and families who have moderate-, low-, very low- and extremely low-incomes throughout California. Most of these developers utilize government subsidy program funds as long-term (>20 years) capital, as well as funding from private financial institutions. While these government housing subsidy programs are highly competitive, once the developer receives commitments from these agencies, borrowing on short-term basis, e.g., to buy the materials and hire the labor to construct the housing, is relatively easy to acquire. However, financial institutions consider any loan made before the proposed projects have been approved for these government subsidy programs to be high risk, because of the uncertainty of whether, and when, such commitments might be secured. Century provides loans in this space successfully, and has had a very low default rate (<2% since its founding). Century funds its loans to affordable housing developers from a combination of its own capital assets, lines of credit provided by commercial banks and charitable foundations, and participation in publicly sponsored loan funds, including the City of Los Angeles New Generation Fund, the Los Angeles County Housing Innovation Fund and the State of California Golden State Acquisition Fund.http://www.goldenstate-fund.com/ Century's financing of housing developments is typically early-stage, relatively high risk capital provided to borrowers to acquire property, perform necessary predevelopment studies and analyses, line up construction and permanent capital from public agencies and other private lenders, and acquire needed permits from public agencies. For some developers, Century also provides construction capital. The entitlement and financing process may require two or more years, and Century's loans are usually repaid from the construction or permanent financing the developer acquires from others. Housing Upon formation, Century assumed all of the assets and liabilities of the Century Freeway Housing Program, which included a considerable portfolio of rental apartments, as well as notes from loans made by the Freeway Program secured by single-family homes, condominiums and apartment buildings developed during construction of the Century Freeway. Over time, almost all of the owned properties were sold or transferred to other community development organizations, and most of the notes have been repaid as older developments are refinanced, often in order to renovate them to maintain the quality of the housing. However, Century has remained as owner, developer and property manager of one significant property, and has acquired interests in several other smaller properties in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Century Villages at Cabrillo The Century Villages at Cabrillo, a 27-acre site in western Long Beach originally housed families assigned to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, which was closed by the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC). In partial satisfaction of the requirements of the McKinney‚ÄìVento Homeless Assistance Act, when the Long Beach Naval Shipyard was closed, the BRAC deeded the Cabrillo and Savannah Navy Housing sites to the City of Long Beach, with the understanding that the property would then be transferred to Century Housing for development of housing to assist the homeless, and to the California State University, Long Beach Foundation (CSULB Foundation) On the portion conveyed to the CSULB Foundation, the existing structures were demolished and replaced by a technology park, vocational center and job incubator. A portion of the remaining undeveloped property is proposed for development of a \\"big box\\" retail store. The portion of the property which passed to Century Housing has been developed in stages to provide housing for homeless persons, including emergency shelters, transitional housing, a substance abuse recovery program operated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and permanent supportive housing for households with family members who are disabled. Services are provided by some 20 health and employment readiness organizations, both public and private. The property now houses over 1,000 previously homeless men, women and children, over half of whom are armed forces veterans. Active Century Affiliates Century Housing has created special purpose affiliates to undertake specific activities. Some of these are single-asset entities which own properties and are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies to facilitate compliance with federal tax laws, particularly the requirements of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Others are designed to manage relationships with financial institutions who provide capital which Century Housing lends to developers of low- and moderate-income affordable housing. In addition, there are four affiliated corporations: * Century Affordable Development, Inc. (CADI) holds title to properties acquired through foreclosure or purchase for development purposes. * Century Community Children's Centers, Inc. owns Century's children's centers. * Century Pointe, Inc. holds title to Century's corporate offices and supports Century's nonprofit operations. * Century Villages at Cabrillo, Inc. holds title to former United States Navy property in Long Beach for development of housing and services benefiting homeless persons, especially military veterans. Past Century Affiliates Century Housing assumed responsibility for several Century Freeway programs not directly related to its primary mission of housing finance and development, and created other affiliates to provide services to the community. These programs were operated under Century Housing's More Than Shelter umbrella of services. Most of these programs have either been incubated to full independence, integrated with other community development organizations, or closed because other organizations provided the same services. * Century Learning Initiatives For Today, Inc. (Century/LIFT) provided after school tutoring services to assist low-income students improve learning skills and maximize academic achievement. This program was determined to be duplicative of services being provided by public school districts with funding from federal sources, and California Proposition 49 (2002), including especially the Los Angeles Unified School District Beyond the Bell After School programs, and was closed in 2010. * Century Community Training, Inc. provided job training placement services and post employment counseling to unemployed, underemployed persons living in low-income communities, primarily through pre-apprenticeship programs in cooperation with construction labor unions. This program was merged into the Center for Economic Opportunity, Inc. another entity created as a result of the Century Freeway project, in 2011. * Century Community Charter Schools, Inc. operated two public charter schools, the Century Community Charter School and Century Academy for Excellence, located in the City of Inglewood and chartered by the Lennox School District. After establishment and period of incubation, these two charter schools were able to self-finance their on-going operations, and became completely independent of Century Housing in 2011. * More Than Shelter for Seniors, Inc. was established to provide enriched living services to residents of Century- funded senior housing complexes. In 2006, this entity became completely independent as EngAGE, which continues to provide life-enhancing services to low-income seniors living in affordable apartment communities. * Century Community Development, Inc. was created to qualify as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) in the early years of that program. In 2010, Century Housing (the parent organization) was certified as a CDFI, and this entity was no longer needed.

Rebellion Trunajaya was born in Madura. In 1674 he led a revolt against Amangkurat I and Amangkurat II of Mataram. He was supported by itinerant fighters from Makassar led by Kraeng Galesong. The Trunajaya rebellion moved swiftly and strong, and captured the Mataram court at Plered in mid-1677. The Mataramish king, Amangkurat I, escaped to the north coast with his eldest son, the future king Amangkurat II, leaving his younger son Pangeran Puger in Mataram. Apparently more interested in profit and revenge than in running a struggling empire, the rebel Trunajaya looted the court and withdrew to his stronghold in Kediri, East Java, leaving Prince Puger in control of a weak court. While on his way to Batavia in order to ask the Dutch for help, Amangkurat I died in the village of Tegalarum near Tegal just after his expulsion, making Amangkurat II king in 1677. He too was nearly helpless, having fled without an army or a treasury to build one. In an attempt to regain his kingdom, he made substantial concessions to the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in Batavia, who then went to war to reinstate him. He promised to give VOC the port town of Semarang if they lent him troops. The Dutch agreed, since for them, a stable Mataram empire that was deeply indebted to them would help ensure continued trade on favourable terms. The multinational Dutch forces, consisting of light-armed troops from Makassar and Ambon, in addition to heavily equipped European soldiers, first defeated Trunajaya in Kediri in November 1678. Trunajaya himself was captured in 1679 near Ngantang west of Malang. He was executed by order of Amangkurat II in Payak, Bantul, on 2 January 1680. Legacy The Trunajaya rebellion is remembered with pride as a heroic struggle by the Madurese people, against foreign forces of the Mataramish state and the Dutch VOC. Today his career is commemorated as the name of Trunojoyo Airport in Sumenep and Trunojoyo University in Bangkalan, Madura.

It was commissioned by the aristocratic Revese family with local properties. An inscription dates to 1466, but construction occurred from 1486 to 1499, with a design attributed to Alvise Lamberti of Montagnana, a collaborator of Pietro Lombardo in Venice and Lorenzo da Bologna in Vicenza. A controversy exists whether Alvise is the same as Aloisio the New, who designed the Cathedral of the Archangel in the Moscow Kremlin. The facade of this oratory recalls the Lamberti work of Santa Maria dei Miracoli in Lonigo. Both these recalls some of the work of Mauro Codussi and Pietro Lombardo, including the latter's Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice. The tall nave has two orders of pilasters, and has shell-like ribbing in the tympanum. The front is topped with four small spires with iron crosses. The interior frescoes are attributed to Giovanni Buonconsiglio. They depict, a Crucifixion with St Catherine of Siena; a Saint in local vista; a Resurrected Christ; and depictions of St Roch and St Sebastian. The statues in the apse represent the Annunciation and date from the 15th century. The oratory remained in the Revese family and they added the last restoration in the end of the 19th century.

It is an obligate parasite growing on the roots of rainforest trees. The flowering structure is shaped like a puffball but in fact consists of a globe covered with thousands of tiny female flowers. The globe is surrounded at its base by a much smaller number of male flowers. In flower, the plant emits an odour resembling that of mice. Description Like other members of its genus, B. fungosa is holoparasitic and contains no chlorophyll. The aerial parts of the plant consist of a hard, irregularly shaped tuber from which the flower-bearing structures extend. The leaves are scale-like, pale cream in colour, long, wide and more or less stem clasping. The plant is monoecious, bearing both pistillate (female) and staminate (male) flowers. Thousands of minute female flowers cover a globe-shaped structure in diameter. The styles are less than long. About 20 male flowers are arranged around the base of the globe, each about in diameter with a pedicel about long and are covered with powdery white pollen. Taxonomy and naming Balanophora fungosa was described by Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster in 1774 and the description was published in Characteres Generum Plantarum. The specific epithet (fungosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"full of holes\\" or \\"spongy\\".

In Australia it occurs in Queensland from near the border with New South Wales to Cape York. Ecology Twelve species of plant in eight families are known to be hosts to Balanophora fungosa var. indica including some of those in the genera Syzygium, Olea and Rapanea. The plant is sometimes a weed in coffee and tea plantations. Numerous small animals visit the flowers, including ants, springtails, flies, a moth of the family noctuidae, and even rats, which appear to be attracted by the smell. Workers of the Asiatic honeybee, Apis cerana have been observed collecting pollen. Two beetle species of the genus Lasiodactylus, a moth of the family Pyralidae and a moth of the family Tipulidae use the bracts at the base of the flowers as a breeding site.

The member companies operate in a range of sectors that include telecommunications, fabricated metal products, electronics, machinery and equipment, office machinery and apparatus, power industry, instrument technology, optics, motor cars and transport equipments. The association‚Äôs main objective is to assist the employers of its member companies with various industry policies and labor law guidelines, collective agreement negotiations with labor unions as well as regular publication of economic policy and trend analysis reports. The association also maintains an established task force to promote initiatives in technological innovation, research collaboration between universities and companies as well as design thinking that ultimately can enhance the global competitiveness of Sweden‚Äôs industrial sector. The association has 4,000 member companies with over 300,000 employees.  History  In July 1896, as a result of the rapid industrial clustering and labor unionization, an industrial workers association (Swedish: Sveriges Verkstadsf√∂rening) was founded in Gothenburg, the home of world headquarters for several Swedish multinational engineering companies including, Electrolux, Saab Group, Volvo Group as well as SKF. The purpose of Verkstadsf√∂rening was to promote healthy employer-employee relations through collaboration with labor unions and to design bilateral employment agreements providing equal and yet competitive employment conditions to manufacturing employees. Verkstadsf√∂rening subsequently expanded through several regional organizations across the country which by 1917 together became members of the Swedish Employers Association (Swedish: Svenska Arbetsgivaref√∂reningen (SAF)). The pivotal change however took place in 1992 when the Workshop Association merged with the Mechanic Federation (Swedish: Mekanf√∂rbundet), yet another employers interest organization for select sectors of the ever industrializing manufacturing sector in Sweden. The combined organizations were then named The Association of Swedish Workshop Industries (Swedish: F√∂reningen Sveriges Verkstadsindustrier (VI)), which in 2002 was renamed to the current Association of Swedish Engineering Industries.  The Grand Award of Design  Since 2003, the association has hosted an annual challenge named The Grand Award of Design (Swedish: Stora Designpriset) to cultivate and promote domestic industrial design and design thinking for product and service development. The key objective is to nurture and inspire design work of viable commercial and competitive value for the Swedish manufacturing companies. Each year a shortlist of finalist companies are nominated for The Grand Design Prize and awarded with grants.  Affiliations  At a national level, the association is a member of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (Swedish: Svenskt N√§ringsliv). At a regional level, the association is a member of the European Engineering Association named Orgalime where collaborative partnerships have been formed at an EU-level R&D; workgroups to increase cross-border collaboration in technology innovation in the manufacturing sector.

It is one building south of the junction of Rio del Santissimi Apostoli with Grand Canal, next to the Palazzo Michiel del Brus√† and across the Canal from the Rialto Mercato and the Campo della Pescaria. The palace is also referred to as Palazzo Michiel Dalle Colonne a Santa Sofia. Grand Canal Facade History The present facade is mainly due to reconstructions of the original Gothic-Byzantine palace during the 17th and 18th-centuries, the most important rebuilding was by the architect Antonio Gaspari (1656-1723). The palace had many owners during the centuries including the Grimani and Zeno families. In the 17th-century it was acquired by Ferdinand Charles Gonzaga Nevers, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat. He is described as a prince enamoured by profligate delights, including women, specially those heavy and large, and of infamous character. Tassini, citing the History of Italy by Botta, describes him as keeping the palace as a debauched serraglio, governed by the Countess Calori. Muratori in his Annals describes the Duke as always venturing to carnival of Venice to procure the glory of besting all in the search for pleasure.egli non lacisse per questo di portarasi a Venezi ne'tempi di carnevale a procacciarsi la gloria di superar tutti nella ricerca de' piaceri. Annali d'Italia ed altre opere varie: 4: Dall'anno 1358 all'anno 1687, by Lodovico Antonio Muratori, page 630. Others said all night long his palace was the scene of theatrical representations by dissolute women, with music and banqueting, so that he had a worse name than Sardanapalus of old.The Atlantic Monthly Library of Travel: Italian journeys, by W. D. Howells, page 368. However the reign of this Duke was ill-fated. During the War of the Spanish Succession, he favored the French, even selling in 1681 the fortress of Casale Monferrato for profit. He denied this manipulations to his Austrian overlords, but tired of his deceit, in 1707, they exiled him to this palace, where he brought as much statuary, painting and precious items as he could carry. Abandoned by all, on June 30, 1708 he was declared a felon by the emperor, and died a few days later in Padua. He was buried in the church of Santa Sofia of that city. His heirs soon sold the palace to Count Conigli of Verona, who owned it by 1712, but by 1716 it was owned by Marcantonio Michiel, husband of Giustina Renier. In 1716, Michiel dalle Colonne hosted Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, later Duke of Warsaw, and Karl Albrecht, Elector of Bavaria (and future Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor) and his mother. The Michiel added a third floor and added interior decorations under the sculptor Michelangelo Morlaiter and painter Francesco Zanchi. The palace was next inherited by the Martinengo family. Alcuni palazzi: ed antichi edificii di Venezia, by Giuseppe Tassini, Filippi Editori, Tipografia M. Fontana, Venice (1879): page 160-162. The palace, under the Martinengo underwent major reconstruction after the mid-19th-century. In the 20th century, the palace served many functions including the offices of the Fascist Party (Casa del Fascio) and other ministries. The 18th-century frescoes in the palace by Franchi depict the Allegory of Victory, Triumph of Merit, and Allegory of Abundance in the piano nobile and in the floor above, Allegory of Peace.Ministerio dei beni e delle attivita' culturali e del turismo, Direzione regionale per i beni culturali e paesaggistici del Veneto.

Trask, an American historian and archivist based in Danvers, Massachusetts. The book compiles more than 350 photographs made by amateur and professional photographers in Dallas, Texas, during the November 1963 assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, and includes interviews with many of the people who made the images, some of which had never been published prior to the book's release. Pictures of the Pain was released to favorable reviews, both by critics and by its participants. An abridged version, That Day In Dallas, was published in 1998. The year before, Trask appeared before the Assassination Records Review Board, where he offered prepared comments on the many images compiled for his books. History Genesis and evolution John F. Kennedy (JFK) was shot dead in 1963, when Richard B. Trask was 16 years old. Trask wrote that he was like most people, unable to understand how \\"seemingly unremarkable nobody\\" Lee Harvey Oswald could succeed in assassinating a President of the United States, so Trask set out to learn as much as he could. He found that a photographic study of the assassination was lacking within the many works published on the subject. Trask began his research in 1983, originally expecting to self-publish a handful of copies for \\"institutional collections\\"; his success in finding and interviewing people whose stories had yet to be told led Trask to continue work on a completed book. Rather than add to the volume of works that offered everything from facts to half-truths to outright lies about the assassination, Trask chose to keep his focus on its photographic history. As a result, Pictures of the Pain included many images that had never been published before. Sources Amateurs Trask contacted several people who had brought cameras to Dealey Plaza to make their own records of Kennedy's visit to Dallas, including Hugh Betzner, Phil Willis and Robert Croft. He cited the published recollections and testimony of many others, including Abraham Zapruder and Orville Nix. Willis, his parents, his wife and their two daughters were present when JFK was shot. Willis snapped several photographs of the motorcade from the area of Houston and Main Streets; he and his daughters then ran toward Elm Street, where Willis took a picture from behind the presidential limousine, and then a second picture as a \\"shot rang out [and] I just flinched\\". Willis told Trask that, due to his experience with firearms, he knew the sound of a high-powered rifle and that a bullet had struck something. Croft had taken three pictures of the motorcade and was certain he had taken another at the instant Kennedy was shot in the head. When he got his film back from the FBI, the first three exposures were developed but the fourth was blank. Croft said he was told by the FBI that his camera must have malfunctioned. Navy officer Thomas Atkins was the first-ever motion picture cameraman assigned to the White House; he rode in the first camera car in the motorcade. The first explosion suggested to Atkins that someone had \\"lit a cherry bomb ... and then immediately following there were two more quick explosions, and my stomach just went into a knot.\\" Looking for something to film, he captured Bill and Gayle Newman lying on the grass, covering their young children. When his car started to leave, he dived head-first into the back seat \\"or I'd have been left right there.\\" Professionals Several professional photographers and photojournalists were interviewed for Pictures, including Ike Altgens, Henry Burroughs, Clint Grant, Cecil W. Stoughton and Dave Wiegman. Altgens made seven total photographs of the motorcade; the first of two along Elm Street was widely scrutinized after people noticed a man in the doorway of the Texas School Book Depository who appeared to resemble Lee Harvey Oswald. Altgens told Trask that he had been contacted many times by reporters and researchers, many of whom tried--and failed--to convince him of a conspiracy. Stoughton, the official White House photographer, also had been approached by researchers and said he was well-read on the subject. Stoughton told Trask that he did not have any strong feelings about a possible conspiracy, except to say that it was hard to believe that one man could have pulled off the assassination. Grant was the one photographer who was with President John F. Kennedy during the trip from Washington, D.C., to Texas in November, 1963. Seated in Camera Car 2 in the motorcade, Grant was too far back to capture the shooting, but would make a picture of the Newman family before suggesting to his colleagues that they catch up with the presidential limousine, arriving eventually at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Freelance journalist and photographer Jim Murray had just moved back to Dallas with his family, and was retrieving a personal camera from his vehicle when he heard the gunshots. Murray would make more than a dozen pictures of the aftermath in Dealey Plaza, including a sequence in which a Sheriff's deputy, a uniformed officer and a man wearing a suit are seen inspecting a spot where, according to the officer's testimony, \\"they found one shot that had hit the turf\\" near the south curb along Elm Street. In 1993, Murray complained to Trask that the timing and location of these photographs were misinterpreted by \\"so-called 'researchers' [who] will bend the truth when there's a buck to be made.\\" That Day In Dallas In 1998, Trask published That Day In Dallas: Three Photographers Capture On Film the Day President Kennedy Died. This smaller volume focused on and updated the stories of Altgens, Murray and Stoughton. Response In 1997, Trask gave testimony before the Assassination Records Review Board where, in prepared comments, he noted how the many images made during the assassination and compiled within Pictures had been both \\"used and abused by the government, media and critics.\\" He also hoped to see the Zapruder film donated to the American people due to its value as evidence and as historic record. Trask's books would be cited in numerous works to follow, including Crossfire and Reclaiming History. Critical response Goodreads called Pictures a major work that created \\"a broad tapestry of truths and perspectives never before revealed concerning\\" the assassination of President Kennedy. Choice called the book interesting if \\"tiresome\\" in its repetitive presentation of witnesses' recollections, and said the chapter on the history of the Zapruder film \\"is brilliant and riveting.\\" Dan Rather called it \\"the definitive book\\" on the assassination. For the book's jacket, Stoughton called himself a proud contributor to a \\"collectible collage [that is] not just another theory.\\" Altgens called Pictures a \\"powerful display of words and pictures ... a 'must read' chronicle\\". Warren Commission member Gerald Ford called the book an \\"invaluable addition\\" to his library. Sixth Floor Museum curator Gary Mack wrote that Trask had done for the photographic record \\"what Sylvia Meagher did for the Warren volumes.\\" See also Notes References Footnotes Bibliography * Cited as ARRB 1997. * Cited as Hersh 1998. * Cited as WCH 1964. * Cited as Trask 1994.

The new schoolhouse is a two-classroom structure built of red brick at a cost of $4,500. In addition to the two large classrooms, there is an entrance hall, two small rooms for storage, and a full-sized basement that was used as a church and a community center in the early years. The schoolhouse was later used as the Scottsdale City Hall and Justice Court, the Scottsdale Public Library and then the Scottsdale Chamber of Commerce. The Scottsdale Historical Society was established in 1969 to save the Little Red Schoolhouse from being demolished for the development of the Scottsdale Mall. Over the next several years, the school was restored to its original condition and now includes a classroom exhibit meant to appear as it did in 1910. In November 1991, the Scottsdale Historical Society opened the building to the public as a local history museum and in 1994 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Taqueria, commonly referred to as Por Que No and sometimes stylized as ¬øPor Que No?, is a small taqueria chain owned by Bryan Steelman with two locations in Portland, Oregon, United States. The restaurant is known for its Mexican-style tacos, but also serves a variety of entr√©es including enchiladas, quesadillas, rice bowls, salads, and tamales. Description and history Interior of the Hawthorne restaurant, 2015 ¬øPor Qu√© No? () is a small taqueria chain with two locations owned by Bryan Steelman, who was inspired by the \\"hole-in-the-wall joints\\" he visited in Mexico. The original restaurant is in the Boise neighborhood in north Portland (3524 North Mississippi Avenue) and a second opened in the Hawthorne District of southeast Portland's Sunnyside neighborhood (4635 Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard). Both restaurants often have queue lines, especially during good weather or happy hour, and on \\"Taco Tuesdays\\".Queue lines:  In 2005, Willamette Week described the original restaurant as a \\"newish taqueria owned by a white couple, frequented by a largely‚Äîbut by no means entirely‚Äîwhite clientele, and it charges higher-than-average taqueria prices.\\" Nearly ten years later, the paper described it as \\"Nouveau-Portland comfort Mexican food\\". In 2009, Steelman received a grant from the Portland Development Commission (PDC) for construction of a \\"green\\" covered outdoor patio at the north Portland location. The project's design and development was led by Orange Design and Construction Company, with assistance from Allusa Architecture. Steelman used the opportunity to also install a green roof with assistance from the Bureau of Environmental Service's Ecoroof Program. Construction of the patio and ecoroof, which features vegetation and two solar water heating panels, occurred during April‚ÄìMay 2010. The same location closed for two months in 2013 for expansion and remodeling, during which the house above the restaurant was converted into a catering kitchen, an additional bathroom was added, and the downstairs seating capacity was increased. As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's \\"PQN Hawthorne\\" division received between $350,000 and $1 million in federally backed small business loan from Umpqua Bank as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The company stated it would allow them to retain 54 jobs. Menu Three taco varieties, 2010 The chain is known for its Mexican-style tacos with recipes originating from across the country, from the Oaxaca region to the Pacific Coast, and for its sustainable practices and seasonal ingredients. Por Que No is considered local food, with line-caught fish, pork by Oregon-based Carlton Farms, and tortillas handmade and chips fried on-site. Taco filling options include barbacoa, calamari, carne asada, and cod. Larger entr√©es include enchiladas, quesadillas, rice bowls, salads, and tamale plates. Its \\"pollo verde\\" features chicken slow-cooked in tomatillo salsa and its tinga recipe includes shredded beef in a both instead of the traditional chicken or pork stew. Side dishes include fish ceviche, guacamole, a house salad with tomatillo-avocado dressing, and pinto beans. Beverages include margaritas, michelada, \\"cerveza roja\\" (michelada with Bloody Maria and Tecate beer), and various flavors of aguas frescas. The restaurant also serves SolPops paletas, or popsicles made with whole fruit. Community Por Que No has contributed to a variety of charitable organizations and fundraising campaigns, including the annual dine-out for Raphael House (which supports victims of domestic abuse), \\"Dining with Dignity\\" for Sisters of the Road, \\"Make It Pop\\" for the non-profit local summer music festival PDX Pop Now!, and Willamette Week giving program \\"Give!Guide\\". In 2011, the restaurant donated food to Occupy Portland demonstrators. The restaurant has also taken political stances. In 2013, it joined a handful of other restaurants in supporting City Commissioner Amanda Fritz's plan to require all local businesses to provide paid sick leave to employees. Steelman shared with The Portland Mercury that his employees accrue three paid days off per year and said, \\"I think that employee benefits give employees more confidence and self-worth, which creates a stronger community at work.\\" In 2014, Por Que No supported the unsuccessful campaign behind Oregon Ballot Measure 88, which sought to make available four- year driver's cards to people who were unable to supply documentation of legal status. Reception Hawthorne restaurant exterior, 2015 In 2005, Willamette Week Seth Lorinczi disagreed with locals who criticized the original restaurant's high prices, saying, \\"you get what you pay for, and ¬øPor Qu√© No? delivers the goods and then some. And in a neighborhood not known for its Mexican food, it fills a niche.\\" Furthermore, he said the \\"folksy knickknacks and distressed tables fulfill the decorative requirements without veering into pastiche, and the effect is charming\\". Lorinczi complimented chef Mark Salda√±a, whose \\"treatments border on the reverential... The effect is akin to watching high-definition television: One recognizes familiar flavors and textures, but they're startlingly detailed and fully realized.\\" He ended his review by saying the restaurant's \\"upscale street food isn't for everyone... But I do know great cooking when I taste it, and ¬øPor Que No?'s got it in spades.\\" Since then, the restaurant has been included in several Willamette Week lists. It was runner-up for \\"Best Mexican Restaurant\\" in the annual \\"Readers Poll\\" in 2007, and has also been included in the newspaper's \\"Eat Cheap\\" (2008), \\"Restaurant Guide\\" (2013), and \\"Cheap Eats\\" (2014) lists. Fox News Channel included Por Que No at number seven in its 2014 list of the ten best taco stands of the United States. One Frommer's reviewer recommend the lime margaritas and said of the Hawthorne location: \\"It's not huge, and you'll find lines for lunch more often than not, but in good weather it's the perfect spot for sunny sidewalk dining.\\" The same reviewer described the taqueria in USA Today as \\"colorful\\" and said it \\"excels in atmosphere and food\\". In 2014, The Oregonian readers voted Por Que No as the Portland metropolitan area's best taqueria \\"in a landslide\\". The restaurant has also been called \\"hip\\", \\"merrily chaotic\\", \\"perpetually hectic\\", and a \\"Technicolor shrine\\" to the restaurants Steelman visited in Mexico.

The tunnel was to have three underground stations at Woolloongabba, George Street and Roma Street with Dutton Park upgraded. The BaT project was planned to be a critical new link in South East Queensland‚Äôs public transport network by creating new major transport hubs across the city and inner city suburbs, and facilitating existing locations such as the Gabba, and the new Queen's Wharf development on George Street. Following a change in State Government, the project was cancelled in March 2015 and replaced by a new Cross River Rail proposal. 2013 plan In November 2013, the Queensland Government announced a revised plan for the BaT (Bus and Train) project as an alternative to the previous Cross River Rail proposal. The revised plan involved a 14.8m external diameter (13.5m internal diameter) tunnel to accommodate both a dual track rail line on the lower level and a two lane busway above. The cost was expected to be $5billion with construction proposed to start in 2015 and completion in 2021.Double-deck rail and bus tunnel proposed for Brisbane Railway Gazette Citytrain patronage is quoted as having increased at an annual average of 3.4% between 2006‚Äì12, compared to an average annual population increase of 2.4% over the same period, confirming forecasts that the Merivale Bridge will reach capacity some time between 2016‚Äì2021. The proposal commenced in the vicinity of Dutton Park station, with two new underground stations at Woolloongabba (adjacent to the Gabba) and George Street (in the CBD) adjacent to a proposed casino redevelopment site. The balance of the proposal involved the previously proposed underground station at Roma Street and the line connecting to the Exhibition line near Bowen Hills. The Underground stations were to also be busway stations. The southern end of the busway was proposed to connect directly to the existing Eastern Busway, with the northern end then proposed to connect to the Northern Busway via a bridge over the railway and adjacent Inner City Bypass motorway. The stations were proposed to have 175 metre platforms to cater for future seven carriage trains, with the peak hour headway of 2.5 minutes between trains giving a notional capacity of 24 trains per hour in each direction. This was proposed to facilitate an increase in Gold Coast line services by 80% when it opened, and was also stated as catering for the 'Hillcrest (New Beaudesert) line by 2031'. That proposed line involves converting the existing standard gauge line from the Acacia Ridge freight terminal (just south of Salisbury station) to dual gauge. Hillcrest is a suburb west of Browns Plains and north of Greenbank. The standard gauge line passes west of Beaudesert on its way to the New South Wales border, and re-establishment of the station at Bromelton may be what is intended by the term 'New Beaudesert line'. No surface property resumptions were required under this revised plan. Dutton Park station was proposed to be closed, as it would need to be demolished as part of the project and the government stated that its patronage level of ~150 passengers per peak hour didn't justify the $150m cost to rebuild the station. Following public objections, particularly to the proposed walkways from Park Road station, 800 metres away (proposed to provide replacement access to the Princess Alexandra Hospital, the major facility adjacent to Dutton Park station), the government reversed its decision.\\"Brisbane's BaT project planning takes flight ‚Äì but awaits funding\\" Railway Digest June 2014 pages 28‚Äì31BaT changes include Dutton Park railway station and Victoria Park Queensland Government 25 June 2014Queensland Government not closing Dutton Park train station for BAT Tunnel ABC News 25 June 2014\\"Dutton Park station to remain\\" Railway Digest August 2014 page 14 The George street station was proposed to be built 48 metres below 63 George Street building on the corner of George and Mary Streets. The George Street building, which houses many state government departments, was to be demolished. The Woolloongabba station was to be 38 metres below surface level, with the Roma Street station to be 31 metres below surface level. The ruling grade in the tunnel was proposed at 3.25% (~1 in 31). 2014 revision On 30 November 2014, the State government announced a further revision to the plan affecting the northern section. The tunnel was now proposed to be situated at the western end of Roma St station, and involve the demolition of the Brisbane Transit Centre's west tower, with a new building to incorporate the BaT Roma Street station and the Transit Centre's bus terminal. The bus tunnel component was planned to connect to the Northern Busway between the Roma Street and Normanby busway stations, with a train-only tunnel to continue under the Normanby Busway station, with a northern portal in the Normanby rail yard, shortening the tunnel length by 1.4 km, to 4 km in total. The reference design for the tunnel between Dutton Park railway station and Boggo Road busway station showed a 'knock out panel for possible future rail extension'.BaT Tunnel Maps Queensland Government Cancellation Following a change of State Government, in March 2015 the BaT Project was cancelled.BaT Tunnel scrapped as government looks for different cross river rail line Brisbane Times 6 March 2015 See also *Rail transport in South East Queensland *Transport in Brisbane References External links * for BaT Tunnel project Category:Brisbane railway lines Category:Public transport in Brisbane Category:Cancelled railway lines Category:Cancelled tunnels ","title":"BaT Tunnel"},{"id":"44937780","text":"Agapanthia korostelevi is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Biography  Born in Auburn, New York, on May 20, 1913, John W.F. Dulles was the son of the former Secretary of State of the United States of America, John Foster Dulles. In 1935 he graduated in philosophy from Princeton University. He received a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University in 1937 and then joined the Bank of New York, where his father was a director. He worked in a New York mining company where he was sent to Arizona where he received a bachelor's degree in metallurgy from the University of Arizona's School of Mines and Metallurgy in 1943. In 1959 he moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to fix an unprofitable Hanna Mining Co. gold mine in the country. The task proved too difficult due to the political turbulence in Brazil at the time, so in 1962 he moved to Texas to become a professor of Latin American studies at the University of Texas. His first book, published in 1962, Yesterday in Mexico: A Chronicle of the Revolution, 1919‚Äì1936, was the result of conversations with the Mexican president Adolfo Ruiz Cortines. Later on he dedicated himself to the study of Brazilian history, starting with the study about former president Get√∫lio Vargas, entitled Vargas of Brazil: a political biography in 1967. His works were criticized for having too much description and too little analysis, as well as for not mentioning his part and of his company in the political articulations during the Jo√£o Goulart government.CARRIJO, Maicon Vin√≠cius da Silva.

It is notable for its masonry construction, and is a work example by an engineer who was prominent at the time. The lighthouse employed the first revolving beam in New Zealand, and the unique original light apparatus was in use for 60 years. Dog Island Lighthouse is one of the most distinct lighthouses in New Zealand, with only two others having stripes painted on them for better visibility at daytime. The lighthouse is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I structure, and the adjacent lighthouse keepers cottage has a Category II registration. Originally operated by three lighthouse keepers, the structure has since 1989 been remote controlled from Maritime New Zealand's Wellington office, with Dog Island since having been uninhabited. Dog Island Lighthouse has twice featured on New Zealand stamps. Background It was clear that a lighthouse was needed in Foveaux Strait, but there were long discussions in the 1860s where to place it. Captains with local experience were asked for their opinion, and they suggested possible sites on Centre Island, Ruapuke Island, Stewart Island, Solander Islands, and Dog Island. The latter was chosen as Southland's first site for a lighthouse; the recommendation was made by the Invercargill Harbour Master to James Alexander Robertson Menzies, the first Superintendent of the Southland Province. The Harbour Master's rationale was that the island was dangerous, as \\"it is very low and not seen till close upon it\\". At the time, the Southland Province had just split from Otago Province, and both provincial governments were involved. There was confusion over who would take ownership of the situation, and in the end, the central government assumed responsibility for the construction of all lighthouses throughout the colony. Construction James Balfour, at the time marine engineer to the Otago Provincial Council and later to the Colonial Government of New Zealand, was commissioned during 1863 to design the lighthouse. Balfour ordered the lighthouse equipment and the light apparatus from the renowned Edinburgh lighthouse designer Alan Stevenson. Balfour had trained under Stevenson's brothers David and Thomas Stevenson. In 1848, Balfour's older sister Maggie had married Thomas Stevenson, hence the Stevensons were his brothers-in-law. The equipment arrived on the ship City Of Dunedin from Glasgow in Port Chalmers on 3 September 1863, and the light apparatus arrived via the ship Resolute on 17 March 1864. The light apparatus for the Taiaroa Head lighthouse also arrived on the Resolute. Dog Island is low-lying and rocky, and its highest (natural) point is about above sea level. Calculations showed that the lighthouse would have to be some tall if built on the highest point to be effective. An investigation showed that there was enough rock that could be quarried on the island for the structure, and that it would be too expensive to build such a tall tower from steel. The tower designed by Balfour was tall. It had a diameter of at its base, and below the balcony. The lantern was placed at a height of . Two dwellings, also designed by Balfour, were constructed for the lighthouse keepers and their families. The total cost came to ¬£10,480-12s-8d, which was significantly more than the average cost of between ¬£4,000 and ¬£6,000 at the time. The light apparatus was specifically designed for the remoteness of the location. Instead of the usual central burner system with one lamp, sixteen lamps were used arranged in four, each with their own mirror behind it. The lamps were mounted on a frame with a square base that completed a revolution powered by a massive clockwork every two minutes, thus achieving a beam every 30 seconds. The reason behind the arrangement was redundancy; even if one of the lamps failed, the other three pointing in the same direction would still produce a, albeit somewhat weaker, beam. The light mechanism was also reasonably simple to repair should the need arise. It was the first revolving light apparatus in New Zealand. History Dog Island Lighthouse in the early 1900s Dog Island Lighthouse keeper's wife and baby in 1924 The lighthouse was first operated on 5 August 1865. Within a year of its construction, it was noted that the tower oscillated in high winds much more than other towers. Due to weak peaty subsoils, the tower took on a slight lean. During storms, the tower leaked severely and it was feared that this would strengthen the mortar between the stones. Weak mortar was scraped out in 1867 and replaced with Portland cement. At the same time, the tower was painted with a large white stripe in the middle, with the remainder painted in black, both to make the tower more visible during daylight, but also to further waterproof the structure. This colour scheme has remained ever since. In 1871, a crack appeared at the base of the tower and the Marine Engineer of the day ordered immediate strengthening. This was carried out with strong hardwood and wrought iron bands. This work, significantly hindered by bad weather, cost ¬£978-4s-3d. By 1916, it was decided that major strengthening was necessary again, as the cement grout was failing. Plans drawn up then and amended two years later saw a reinforced concrete skin of in thickness being applied to the outside up to just below the balcony, and an internal reinforced concrete lining up to the fourth floor. The tower was repainted in its previous colour scheme. The burners for the lights were changed from colza oil to paraffin oil in 1876. The original system was in use for 60 years, and in 1925, the optical apparatus was upgraded to a second order dioptric lens with an incandescent oil burner. This changed the light output to three flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. A diesel electric plant was installed in 1954, and electrical operation of the beam started in October of that year. The diesel generator was replaced in 1970. In September 1999, the light was replaced again, this time with a rotating beacon, with a 35-watt halogen bulb as the light source. The energy comes from solar panels and a battery bank. A third dwelling for lighthouse keepers was built in 1884. The three original dwellings were in a poor state by the 1920s and two houses with six rooms each were built for the families; at the same time, the two original cottages became storage sheds. A new house was built in 1979 for the by then single lighthouse keeper. There were originally three lighthouse keepers with their families on the island. The initial rotating light mechanism had to be wound up hourly, and in 1883, the principal lighthouse keeper died when he fell down the central shaft trying to attach weights to the mechanism. In 1977, the number of lighthouse keepers were reduced from two to one due to operational improvements. There was a Committee of Inquiry into lighthouse automation in 1981 and the Dog Island site was one of nine sites throughout New Zealand that was to remain staffed; in this case, it was due to its remoteness, and its ability to help with search and rescue in the area. In August 1989, Dog Island was fully automated and the last permanent lighthouse keeper in New Zealand was withdrawn from service. The lighthouse is remote controlled from Maritime New Zealand's Wellington office. Despite the lighthouse, the steamer SS Waikouaiti ran aground on Dog Island on 28 November 1939 during dense fog and was wrecked. Stamps Dog Island Lighthouse has twice featured on New Zealand stamps. In 1969, the New Zealand Government Life Insurance Department (better known as Government Life) issued five stamps showing lighthouses, with the highest denomination (15c) depicting the Dog Island Lighthouse. In 2009, New Zealand Post issued five stamps commemorating the 150th anniversary of New Zealand's oldest lighthouse at Pencarrow Head; the Dog Island Lighthouse was included with a $1 value. Today thumb The lighthouse was automated in 1989, and the island has since been uninhabited. The lighthouse is the tallest lighthouse in New Zealand, and one of its oldest. Due to its black and white stripes, it might be one of New Zealand's most distinctive lighthouses. There are only two other lighthouses in New Zealand of similar appearance; Cape Campbell Lighthouse also has black and white stripes, whilst Cape Palliser Lighthouse has red and white stripes. The lens from 1925 is on display at the Museum of Wellington City & Sea on Jervois Quay in Wellington, on loan from Maritime New Zealand. The 1865 rotating mechanism can be seen at the Bluff Maritime Museum. There is no public access to Dog Island or to the lighthouse. The lighthouse is being maintained by Maritime New Zealand. Heritage registrations The lighthouse keepers cottage was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) on 24 November 1983 as a Category II structure, with registration number 2562. On 22 November 1984, the Dog Island Lighthouse was registered as a Category I structure, with registration number 395. The lighthouse is significant for its height, its age, and the relatively rare use of masonry for such a structure. It is also an example of the work of an engineer who was prominent at his time.

In 1478 he traveled to Brescia, to request that Lorenzo Zane, Patriarch of Antioch and Bishop of Brescia, who had revealed political secrets to the pope, to appear before the council and explain himself. Nicol√≤ Grandiben, in his will of August 8, 1490, left to his son Girolamo (also ducal secretary), the house and contents, except for part of the well with columns and marble table, were endowed for the church of San Martino for construction of a baptistery in memory of the family.

In 1630, Diana Grandiben, daughter of Girolamo Gradinben, left the palace to her sister, Agnesina married to Marcantonio Negri.

It was sold by 1736 to the Vezzi family, and that year a fire that arose during prolonged wedding festivities spread to this palace from a neighboring building belonging to a jurist named Angelo Tirabosco. Contemporary journals document that on October 4, 1742, the exiled Francesco III d'Este, Duke of Modena found temporary lodging in this palace, after being exiled for siding with France and Spain in the War of the Austrian Succession.

A church has stood on the site since 726 with the present building dedicated to Saint Cassian of Imola being consecrated in 1376 and re-modelled during the 17th century. It has a plain exterior with several adjacent buildings overlapping it. Its interior however is richly decorated in a Baroque style. The church is located on the Campo San Cassiano, site of the world's first public opera house, west of the Rialto Bridge and is open to visitors Tuesday-Saturday mornings.Simonis, Italy, p. 339 The church houses three paintings by the Italian artist Tintoretto, including The Crucifixion of Christ painted in 1568 which the art critic John Ruskin described as, \\"the finest [example of a Crucifixion painting] in Europe\\". However, the most famous painting associated with the church is paradoxically one which is no longer there. The San Cassiano altarpiece, painted for this church by Antonello da Messina, was the first major example of oil painting in the city. It disappeared from the church in the 17th century and was cut into sections; the remaining known pieces are re-united in Vienna. History The removed, divided and reconstructed altarpiece by Antonello da Messina, as it now is in Vienna. The earliest church on this site was built in 726 and dedicated to Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of musicians and music. Over the centuries there have been several reconstruction projects, including one following a fire in 1106, and a major rebuild which commenced in 1350. This building was consecrated in 1376 and re-modelled in the early 17th century to give it its current appearance which dates from 1663. A large campanile, high, was added to the church in the 13th century, though its rugged style suggests that it may have been a guard tower which was acquired by the church. In 1509, the funeral procession of Catherine Cornaro, the former queen of Cyprus and wealthy Venetian noblewoman, began at San Cassiano. From here it crossed a floating bridge to the church of Santi Apostoli where she was buried in the Cornaro family chapel. Exterior Bell tower The church has a 13th-century campanile which was modified shortly after with the addition of a Gothic belfry. On the side facing the water is a door which formerly had a porch (portico), a feature which was demolished in the 19th century. The church is typically described as having the appearance of a \\"big box\\" with buildings close by and overlapping on several sides. Unlike many churches in Venice it has no facade and overall the exterior is plain and unadorned. A feature which may possibly have been retained from the original church is the door jambs or doorposts, which date back to the Byzantine era. Entry to the church is usually through a side door in the wall facing the Campo San Cassiano. Interior In contrast to the plain exterior, the church's interior is highly decorated in the Baroque style. It has an altar by Heinrich Meyring and Nardo. Meyring is notable for the large altar he produced for the church of San Mois√®, also in Venice. The ceiling of the church was painted by Costantino Cedini, a student of Giambattista Tiepolo, and has recently been restored. In 1746 Abbot Carlo del Medico commissioned a chapel which is located on the left-hand side of the church. It contains an altarpiece dating to 1763 and a ceiling fresco, both by the artist Giambattista Pittoni. The renowned playwright Count Carlo Gozzi was buried in this church, although his tombstone has not survived.

The painting depicts a hovering Christ, two years after the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563) demanded grounded depictions.Renaissance Art, p. 248 The chancel of San Cassiano houses three paintings by Tintoretto who was a former parishioner of the church. These are The Resurrection, The Descent into Limbo and The Crucifixion, all of which were completed between 1565 and 1568. The art critic John Ruskin described the latter as, \\"the finest [example of a Crucifixion painting] in Europe\\" and noted its particularly interesting perspective which Ruskin said gave the viewer the impression that they were \\"lying full length on the grass, or rather among the brambles and luxuriant weeds\\".Ruskin's Venice, p. 34 Tintoretto's Resurrection was painted in defiance of the Council of Trent's demand that all depictions of the resurrection feature a standing, rather than hovering, Christ figure. The Sicilian artist Antonello da Messina was commissioned by Pietro Bon to paint an altarpiece for the church. Completed between 1475 and 1476, his Sacra Conversazione was one of the earliest appearances of oil in the city's artworks. It brought a style of altarpiece that would be imitated by other Venetian artists such as Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and the Vivarini brothers, Antonio and Bartolomeo, establishing a template that would be used all the way through to Titian.Masterpieces of Western Art, p.117 San Cassiano's altarpiece disappeared from the church sometime during the 17th century and reappeared in the private collection of the Austrian Archduke Leopold William where it was attributed to Giovanni Bellini. After being removed from Venice the altarpiece was split into a number of fragments. Only three of these were found and these are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria.Mcgregor, Venice from the Ground Up, p. 238 The church also contains an early 18th-century painting of the Martyrdom of San Cassiano by Antonio Balestra. It depicts the saint being attacked by school children, an act which explains why Saint Cassian of Imola is the patron saint of school teachers.

She is compelled to dance nightly in Sontag's saloon where she is known as Mexicali Mae. There she meets Joe Blanchard (Ford), a derelict from the east who plays the piano in order to secure enough dope to satisfy his craving. Sontag, fearing that one of his confederates has double crossed him and told about his opium smuggling operations, kills the man and places the blame on Joe. Merlin helps Joe escape, and they take up a ranch where Joe finally overcomes his desire for drugs. Joe's mother (Chapman) and fiancee (Pickford) pay a visit and Mrs. Chapman tries to buy off Merlin and have Joe return east. Merlin returns to Sontag's dance hall, and Joe follows, convinced that she no longer loves him. Merlin returns to the ranch and is about to end her own life when Joe and Sontag arrive.

It is along Indian Creek. Seventy Six Falls may have been named for the nearby community of Seventy Six, Kentucky. There is a popular belief that it was named for its height before the impoundment of Lake Cumberland, but the height was about 84 feet. At normal pool of the lake the height is 38 feet. Another assertion is that the waterfall was named for the number of breaks, or small falls, on Indian Creek just before the cataract, but that is unlikely; clearly defining a specific number of such breaks is impossible because of varying water flow and small differences between them. The community may not have been named for the falls; some say the name came from a survey marker; others say it was named for 1776; it was settled around 1806, 30 years after U.S. independence. A post office named Goodson, for the postmaster, was established in 1830; Charles D. Semple renamed it Seventy Six in 1834.

Released in 2014 by creators Ori Takemura and Dmitry Kurilchenko, the game can best be described as colorful. Boasted as a \\"classical game that embraces physics,\\" one characteristic is that it is minimalistic. The web page describes it as, \\"no words. No punishment. No tutorials. No time limits and no scores...\\" The game can be found on the Apple or Android app store. Gameplay The objective of each level is to clear away the door, a 3 by 2 tile box with 6 triangles in the middle. The door is blocked by several blocks of various shapes, which must be maneuvered around. The first levels only have regular blocks, but as the game progresses, different types of blocks are added. These blocks are explained below and have different properties and increase the level of difficulty. Regular Blocks These are normal blocks that only move into empty spaces. They are the first blocks to appear in the game and range widely in shape, size, and color. They do not interact with each other unless pushed into another by the player. Their shape is fixed unlike other blocks; only their location can be altered. Magnetic Blocks Magnetic blocks are the next blocks that are introduced to the player. They are different colored blocks that when magnetically connected to another block, have an orange line attach them. Magnet blocks repel blocks of the same color, but can be dragged next to each other by the player. Magnet blocks are only affected by what is immediately next to them so they will only repel along columns or rows of tiles in the game. This also means that they can be formed into non-linear shapes with ease. They automatically connect to an adjacent magnet block of a different color and must be manually separated by double tapping one of the blocks.  Spring Blocks  Spring blocks are the next block introduced. They can be contracted by the player, and after a few seconds will expand automatically to fill up spaces. These blocks have the ability to squeeze into small places and be pinned down so they cannot expand again. The blocks are always rectangular and appear blue with an orange 'Z' as the spring.  Shape changing Blocks  At its most difficult levels, the game introduces blocks with a square shape that can be transformed into triangle by pulling the corners inward. The player can restore the original square shape by tapping twice on the block if the space around it allows for transformation.

It was introduced as a dry cleaning fluid for laundry in 1933. Formula , the safety data sheet for Lestoil lists: Tall oil fatty acids, sodium salts 5 - 10%, Stoddard solvent 3 - 7%, Pine oil 1 - 5%, Sodium hydroxide < 1% History Jacob L. Barowsky, creator of Lestoil In 1927, a Harvard alumnus, Jacob L. Barowsky, worked at the General Cleaners and Dyers in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where he saw the need for a single product that removed both water-soluble and non-water-soluble soils from laundry. Jacob started the Adell Chemical Company to solve the problem, and with the assistance of chemist John Tulenko, they introduced LAVOL to the world in 1933 (renamed to LesToil in 1936). Initially, LesToil was used by commercial laundries, but it was also used to remove ink, wax, oil, grease and adhesives by paper mills during production. After 11 years of pressure to enter the retail market, Barowsky started using industrial profits to fund marketing efforts. Much of his early success was also attributed to an agreement with Steiger's Department Store, which sold the product and allowed him to perform demonstrations. Among other marketing promotions that Barowsky would use, included promotional bottles featuring the likenesses of historical figures like George Washington, the inclusion of dolls with the product, such as a series representing different countries, and the publishing of a book \\"Lestoil Animal Stories\\" which prominently featured its product, as well as a washable cover. The amount of time and money he put into local marketing however proved time-consuming and it would not be until the 1950s, when Barowsky saturated the market with TV commercials, that he succeeded in making Lestoil a household name. The product was now used in 80% of the homes in which it was made available. For some duration in the late 1950s, the Adell Chemical Company would also promote a powdered bleach product, dubbed \\"Lestare\\". Barowsky sold the company in 1960 for $12 million to Standard International Corp. They sold it to the Noxell Company in 1969, which became a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble Company in 1989. On June 21, 1996, Noxell sold the Lestoil cleaner brand to Clorox Company, so that Noxell could focus on its Max Factor and CoverGirl lines. Noxell claimed that 99% of their business had become cosmetics and fragrances and that cleaners had no strategic fit in their company. As of 2014, regional marketing has left brand recognition of Lestoil to primarily a midwest/eastcoast American and Puerto Rican audience. As such, large distributors like Walmart only stock it in regions where it was advertised. Lestoil syndrome In product marketing, the name Lestoil became synonymous by the early 1960s with a phenomenon of corporate copycat practices, known as the \\"Lestoil syndrome\\", coined by journalist and management consultant Robert Heller. Essentially \\"Lestoil syndrome\\" describes the phenomena of innovators being copied by competitors with greater capital resources, who can employ the initial creator's strategy, but use their capital to obtain a greater market recognition. The Lestoil detergent product was among the earliest heavy-industry cleaning detergents marketed directly to consumers; however, its initial success in obtaining a large market share was quickly overshadowed when larger competitors in the household product space took notice. These competitors began introducing similarly marketed products like Colgate-Palmolive's liquid Ajax, and Procter & Gamble's Mr. Clean, and before eventually being bought by a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, their marketing campaigns diluted Lestoil's market share. Heller characterized this by saying they had \\"reacted with multi-million dollar force, swamping Lestoil in a sea of green bubbles\\".

AutoZone Stores, Inc., Case No. 08-CV-00417-WVG (S.D. Cal. Nov. 17, 2014), was a court case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California which is believed to be the largest single-plaintiff employment verdict in United States history at $185,872,719.52.https://lrus.wolterskluwer.com/news/employment-law- daily/185m-punitive-damages-verdict-for-autozone-employee-after-legal- department-cast-as- perpetrator/27260/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/nov/18/verdict-autozone- pregnancy-women-juarez-lawsuit/http://www.law360.com/articles/597232/jury- hits-autozone-with-185m-verdict-in-pregnancy-bias-row This case is also believed to be the largest punitive damages verdict awarded to a single plaintiff in an employment discrimination lawsuit. Background and trial Rosario Juarez worked for AutoZone beginning in December 1999 as a cashier. She was promoted to the position of Part Sales Manager in 2001 where she hit a glass ceiling and remained in that position for 3 years. During the five years since she joined AutoZone, Ms. Juarez noticed that male employees were treated more favorably than female employees. In particular, less experienced male employees were promoted to vacant store manager positions and other promotions far more often than women, regardless of experience and knowledge. Although qualified for open store manager positions in her district, Ms. Juarez was frequently passed over for promotion in favor of less experienced and qualified male employees. The practice of promoting male employees to better positions faster than female employees permeated AutoZone in the past. Most often women were relegated to service as delivery drivers. When possible, younger attractive women were sought for these positions to encourage predominantly male operated repair shops to place orders. Women at AutoZone have rarely been promoted beyond assistant store manager or part sales manager positions. Unknown to Plaintiff, AutoZone's California operations were subject to a legal requirement that women were to be provided greater opportunity for employment and advancement. Senior managers were required to keep statistical records concerning the hiring and promotion of women. The requirement resulted from a gender discrimination claim brought against Chief Auto Parts. AutoZone acquired Chief after the legal requirement was imposed and was therefore obligated to comply until it expired sometime in 2004. After the legal requirement expired, a meeting was held to announce that statistics pertaining to women in the workplace no longer needed to be collected. A district manager who was present at the meeting testified about how AutoZone leaders celebrated in reaction to the announcement. According to the witness, who was then an AutoZone District Manager the Vice President of the Western Division said ‚Äúwe can finally start getting rid of these women.‚Äù Another corporate leader (who was later placed in charge of Plaintiff in San Diego) remarked that ‚Äúwomen weren‚Äôt worth sh#t‚Äù to AutoZone. The same leader was also credited with telling a district manager that he needed to fire the women in his district stores if he hoped to be promoted to a regional manager himself. In 2004, shortly after the end of the legal requirement expired, Plaintiff Ms. Juarez complained to upper management that she had been unfairly passed over for promotion to store manager. Ms. Juarez specifically asked if she would be required to file a lawsuit in order to get promoted. Shortly after complaining, Plaintiff was informed she would be put in a Store Manager Training program for several months. Male employees who worked for AutoZone did not have to go through this training program which was only required for store manager candidates who came from other companies. Plaintiff received no actual training in the program and continued to serve as an assistant manager for other stores in the San Diego Market. Eventually in October 2004, Plaintiff was given her first opportunity to serve as a store manager. Plaintiff excelled in the Store Manager position and had a positive impact on her store's sales and appearance. At this time, her supervisor was a woman District Manager. After several months, Ms. Juarez was assigned a different district manager, a male, who was demeaning and condescending to Plaintiff and the other women in her store. Male employees in the store would receive pats on the back and jolly greetings, while Plaintiff and her female assistant manager were treated coldly by the district manager with little positive encouragement or interaction. Although Plaintiff's store was steadily improving in response to her efforts, the district manager would continuously comment that she could not handle the job. In August 2005, Ms. Juarez became pregnant. At first she kept her condition secret for fear that the district manager would become more critical and upset. In late October 2005, Plaintiff received a favorable performance evaluation wherein she ‚Äúmet expectations‚Äù overall. However, the evaluation included multiple unfair comments. Although she was fearful of the consequences, Ms. Juarez felt that company rules required her to disclose her condition to the district manager. In early November 2005, Ms. Juarez told the district manager she was pregnant. The meeting was witnessed by two assistant managers who testified at trial. Upon hearing the news, the district manager became visibly upset. He sarcastically responded, \\"Congratulations....I guess.\\" Later the district manager stated, \\"I feel sorry for you.\\" Immediately after being informed Ms. Juarez was pregnant, the district manager became more aggressive, mean and critical of Ms. Juarez. Suddenly, nothing was being done correctly. Time-consuming work assignments had to be redone, even though no need for a redo existed. Before knowing of the pregnancy the district manager gave the store short ‚Äúfix-it-lists‚Äù of approximately 15 items to be addressed. Afterward, the lists became several pages and sometimes containing as many as 70 nitpicking items. Yelling criticisms and public humiliation followed. The district manager repeatedly remarked in front of workers and customers that he did not believe Plaintiff could perform the work in her ‚Äúcondition‚Äù and told her to ‚Äústep down.‚Äù Even though Plaintiff and her managers worked tirelessly, and often off the clock, to address the unwarranted ‚Äúfix-it-lists,‚Äù Ms. Juarez was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). At all times while on the PIP, Ms. Juarez and her sales team met or beat sales targets set by the company. Nevertheless, the company falsely claimed she failed to improve and meet expectations. In February 2006, Ms. Juarez was demoted back to assistant manager and placed in a different store. Ms. Juarez lost her bonuses and overtime pay. She was replaced by a male store manager who was not given ‚Äúfix-it-lists.‚Äù Ms. Juarez worked until she was nine months pregnant and then went out on maternity leave one week before the birth of her second child. While on leave in April 2006, Ms. Juarez filed a charge of gender and pregnancy discrimination with California Department of Fair Employment and Housing concerning her demotion from store manager. A key document in this case was a letter from AutoZone's legal department, called ‚ÄúAutoZoner Relations‚Äù to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing in response to the discrimination complaint filed by Ms. Juarez. In a July 2006 letter, AutoZoner Relations claimed to have \\"thoroughly investigated\\" the claims of Ms. Juarez and found no problem. However, at trial evidence clearly demonstrated that AutoZoner Relations never spoke to any of the obvious witnesses to the conduct including Plaintiff and the people who worked with Plaintiff in her store. Following her maternity leave, Ms. Juarez returned to her demoted position in 2007. While employed, Ms. Juarez filed a lawsuit in San Diego state court in January 2008, challenging her demotion as discrimination based on gender and pregnancy. She was deposed by AutoZone in October 2008, as part of her lawsuit. On November 20, 2008, Ms. Juarez was fired by AutoZone because she was allegedly not trustworthy. However, during discovery, AutoZone's person most knowledgeable witnesses indicated that the reasons for Plaintiff's termination were unknown. At trial, the witnesses ‚Äúremembered‚Äù that the termination was probably related to an incident when loss prevention managers investigated a situation where another employee lost $400 cash while Plaintiff was in charge of the store. Alternatively, the company claimed that the termination may have been related to Plaintiff's refusal to fully cooperate in the $400 investigation by loss prevention. During the course of litigation, AutoZone continued the date for trial because the company's loss prevention manager who investigated the missing $400 became pregnant. Months after the continuance, but before this trial, the company fired this loss prevention manager (while she was pregnant) for allegedly falsifying a store audit. The loss prevention manager testified to additional information not provided at the deposition she gave when still employed. According to the witness, the investigation into the missing $400 was requested by high level upper management. The investigation was prioritized over other incidents involving larger amounts of missing cash. She was specifically instructed to target Ms. Juarez rather than the subordinate employee who the loss prevention manager actually suspected to have lost the cash. Contrary to the allegations of the company, the loss prevention manager confirmed that Ms. Juarez acted appropriately during the investigation and answered all questions concerning the incident. The loss prevention manager stated she provided a detailed report to AutoZoner Relations immediately following the investigation which was never produced by the company and was not brought to trial. When Ms. Juarez was suspended for the incident on the day of the investigation, the loss prevent manager suspected retaliation had occurred; unfortunately, she did not say so at her deposition under pressure from AutoZone's lawyers to say only what she knew for absolute certain and for fear of retaliation. Several former AutoZone employees testified about a pervasive fear of retaliation at the company. One of Ms. Juarez's assistant managers testified he was fired a few months after she was demoted in retaliation for supporting Ms. Juarez as a store manager. Declarations submitted by the company in support of AutoZone's summary judgment motions indicated that ‚ÄúAutoZoner Relations‚Äù had recommended both the demotion and termination of Ms. Juarez. In closing argument, counsel for Ms. Juarez argued that the illegal demotion and termination were orchestrated and/or ratified by the company's legal department. AutoZone did not call a single woman employee to say she was fairly treated by the company. AutoZone's attorneys strenuously argued that there was no evidence to support Plaintiff's claims. Further, AutoZone claimed that Plaintiff was a manipulative liar who used threats to receive promotions. In closing, AutoZone's lead trial counsel asked the jury to ignore the evidence about their own upper management's statements. Its counsel argued that the company had additional witnesses and documents to support its position, but the company did not want to waste the time presenting the information.http://www.10news.com/news/jury-awards-mother-more- than-185m-in-damages-in-pregnancy-discrimination-case-against- autozone-11172014https://www.wsj.com/articles/autozone-hit-with-186-million- verdict-1416359038https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-auto-zone- discrimination- verdict-20141118-story.htmlhttp://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/AutoZone- Ordered-to-Pay-185M-in-Discrimination- Suit-283004671.htmlhttp://www.bna.com/autozone-pay-185-n17179912162/ Verdict The verdict in favor of Plaintiff included $393,749.52 in past wages, $228,960 in future wages, and $250,000 for past emotional distress for garden variety emotional harm such as anger, anxiety, emotional distress, worry and the like. Plaintiff testified to the shame and embarrassment she felt after her demotion. At the time of her termination, she was a single mother caring for her two young children. During a lengthy period of unemployment, she and her children would make burritos and sell them just to make money to survive. Although Ms. Juarez eventually found new employment with a different auto parts company, the difference between the earnings and benefits resulted in significant financial losses. The ability to earn bonuses and overtime pay as a store manager at AutoZone as compared to jobs without such benefits supported future wage loss, even though gainfully employed at the time of trial.http://www.newyorkemploymentattorneysblog.com/sexual- harassment/http://go.bna.com/autozone-pay-185-n17179912162/ The jury deliberated for a day and a half before finding for Plaintiff on all claims asserted.http://www.law360.com/articles/596966/ex-autozone-manager-wins- nearly-1m-in-gender-bias-row Punitive damages phase Following the liability phase, Plaintiff presented the testimony of an economist to assess the company's ability to pay punitive damages. Using AutoZone's public financial disclosures, it was established that the cash flow of the company, after all operational expenses, is $20,798,192 a week. Although on paper the company had a negative net worth of $1 billion, Plaintiff's economist explained the company's net worth is not a reliable indicator of the company's ability to pay because the excess cash was used to repurchase its stock, which had the effect of making outstanding shares more valuable. Plaintiff's economist further testified that AutoZone had the ability to pay a $100,000,000 punitive damage award after only four weeks of operations. Defendant's economist, who was unaware of the company's cash flow, testified about the company's negative net worth but offered no comment regarding what amount of punitive damages the company could pay. In opposition to any award of punitive damages, the company offered the testimony of attorney Allison Smith, the director AutoZoner Relations from its headquarters in Memphis, TN. Ms. Smith testified that she had come from Memphis to tell the jury that the company had heard their verdict and would be examining its ‚Äúprocesses.‚Äù Ms. Smith told the jury that she wanted to speak with the jury to hear why they had found liability. On cross-examination, Ms. Smith acknowledged that this case was not the first time a California jury had sent the company a message about ‚Äúretaliation.‚Äù She acknowledged a prior 2010 verdict in Sacramento, where AutoZone fired a district manager for ‚Äúfalsifying an audit‚Äù after he reported that a human resources manager used the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word in reference to customers and employees of AutoZone. Ms. Smith was asked what AutoZone had done as a result of the 2010 jury finding and she responded that AutoZone had paid the judgment. As to financial condition, Ms. Smith confirmed that the company's current public filing with the SEC reported that all pending litigation against the company ‚Äúindividually or in the aggregate‚Äù was ‚Äúnot material to the company‚Äôs financial condition.‚Äù This became a stipulated fact during the punitive damages phase of trial. In the closing argument for punitive damages, Plaintiff's counsel argued that the reprehensibility of the conduct was extremely high because the unlawful acts were committed by the legal department which was responsible for guiding operations around the world. Counsel suggested that more than a hundred million dollars would be required to ensure that the Board of Directors took a hard look at their legal department and \\"clean house.\\" Specifically, counsel suggested that the award should equate to one week of the company's extra cash for each year of injustice suffered by Plaintiff. Counsel expressed a hope that the verdict would come to be known as the ‚ÄúJuarez Award‚Äù which would stand for the proposition that women are an equal part of the workplace, that they have a right to work pregnant, and that retaliation will not be tolerated. In opposition, AutoZone argued that it had heard the message and no further punitive damages were required.https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2014/12/185-million- punitive-damages/ The jury deliberated one day before reaching its punitive damage verdict.http://www.law360.com/articles/596966/ex-autozone-manager-wins- nearly-1m-in-gender-bias-row Trial counsel Counsel for plaintiff: *Lead Counsel Lawrance Bohm, Bohm Law Group *Charles Moore, Law Offices of Charles Moore *Kelsey Ciarimboli, Law Clerk, Bohm Law Group Counsel for defense: *Lead Counsel Nancy E.

In the weeks and months that followed, Ford's shooting triggered multiple demonstrations and a lawsuit by Ford's family claiming $75 million in damages. The officers and eyewitnesses offered competing accounts of the events surrounding the shooting, and an investigation by the LAPD's watchdog unit, Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, concluded in June 2015 that one officer had been justified in the shooting, while the other officer was unjustified, had acted outside of LAPD policy, and had violated Ford's civil rights by detaining him. Backgrounds Ezell Ford Ezell Earl Ford (October 14, 1988August 11, 2014) was the oldest of seven children. At the time of his birth his parents, Tritobia and Edsell, were 16 and 17 years old respectively. His parents said in August 2014 they had been living in the same neighborhood for 15 years. Ford attended 66th Street Elementary, Marcus Garvey Elementary, Bethune Middle School, and Verbum Dei High School, which he left before completing a full term. As a child he played basketball, and wanted to play professionally and to study medicine. In his youth Ford suffered from asthma and difficulty breathing. In September 2007 Ford was arrested on felony charges of carrying a loaded firearm and possession of marijuana with intent to sell. He argued the marijuana was for personal use, and in January 2008 the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor, for which he paid a small fine. He pleaded guilty to the firearm charge and was sentenced to 90 days in jail. In 2008 Ford was shot in the leg in a gang-related incident. A neighbor said that Ford was an innocent bystander in the shooting, and that his mental illness became more evident from then on. Ford also had a prior conviction for trespassing. After his death his parents said their son had been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and that everybody in the neighborhood, as well as police, were aware of this. They recalled that Ford had become more introverted and melancholy around the age of 18, and took medication that made him less active. Ashanti Harrison, a neighbor, said he had grown up with Ford, who \\"did not bother nobody. He was kind of slow. The whole neighborhood took care of him.\\" Harrison also described Ford as having \\"the mental capacity of an 8-year-old\\", while another neighbor said \\"He had a mind of a 10-year-old\\". Another neighbor said while Ford \\"wasn't all there, he was there enough to follow orders and know to stop when the police tell him to stop.\\" Leroy Hill, who described himself as an eyewitness to the shooting, and Harrison both said Ford was not involved in gangs. A neighbor said the officers who shot Ford had harassed him in the past, including the day before the shooting. Sharlton Wampler and Antonio Villegas The officers involved in the shooting were named on August 28 as Sharlton Wampler and Antonio Villegas, both gang enforcement officers in the LAPD's Newton Division. Wampler had been on the force for twelve years, Villegas for eight. Wampler is Asian American and Villegas is Latino. The two men had been working together in the Newton Division for five months. Wampler had previously arrested Ford on marijuana possession charges in 2008. He was also one of two officers accused in a 2011 lawsuit of assaulting and pepper spraying members of a South Los Angeles family in 2009. A settlement was reached in the case in 2012 but details were not disclosed in court records. Shooting LAPD accounts According to LAPD commander Andy Smith in August 2014, Wampler and Villegas saw Ford walking on the sidewalk at 65th Street and left their vehicle. Wampler said he knew Ford, but did not recognize him at the time. The two officers confronted Ford as part of an \\"investigative stop\\" at around 8:20p.m. They told investigators that though they carried a Taser in the patrol car, neither took it out, and Villegas instead drew his gun. Villegas said he believed Ford may have been armed because he was in \\"a gang area\\". Villegas soon put the gun away and repositioned himself as the \\"cover\\" officer while Wampler approached Ford. After the release of Ford's autopsy, LAPD chief Charlie Beck said Ford walked away after Wampler and Villegas left their vehicle to speak to him. An earlier press release said Ford looked towards the officers but kept walking and \\"made suspicious movements, including attempting to conceal his hands\\". According to Beck, Wampler and Villegas told detectives Ford concealed his hands as they attempted to stop him. According to Beck's account the officers then followed Ford to a driveway where he crouched between a car and some bushes. Wampler and Villegas said they believed Ford was trying to dispose of drugs that were in his possession, which Wampler felt was sufficient evidence to arrest him. No drugs were found in the vicinity, however. Smith said as they were walking towards him Ford \\"whirled around and basically attacked the lead officer.\\" Wampler told investigators he had approached Ford from behind and pulled back his shoulder with the intention of handcuffing him. The officers and an LAPD spokesman said in August 2014 that Ford had \\"tackled\\" one of the officers and that a struggle ensued after Ford tried to remove the officer's handgun from its holster. Smith said Ford \\"grabbed the officer around the waist, threw him to the ground and was laying on top of the officer\\" when he was shot. In Beck's account, Wampler and Villegas told detectives that Ford had been on top of one of the officers and reaching for the officer's gun when they both opened fire. Wampler told investigators he had been tackled by Ford and had landed on top of Ford, but Ford rolled over immediately and took the top position. Villegas responded by pushing his knee into Ford's back and attempting to handcuff him. Wampler said he then felt Ford grasping at his holstered pistol. Villegas said he feared for his life and that of his partner and shot Ford in the arm, then at Wampler's urging fired a second round into Ford's side. Wampler said Ford continued to resist, causing him to retrieve his backup gun and used it to reach around Ford and shoot him in the back. Smith said Ford had been on the ground when he was shot, and said \\"This was an extremely rapidly unfolding event. Basically the fight was on.\\" After the shooting, Wampler handcuffed Ford. Wampler told investigators a crowd appeared, including one man who appeared angry but left after Wampler pointed his gun at him. Thirteen seconds elapsed from the time that Wampler and Villegas left their vehicle to the first shot. LAPD lieutenant Ellis Imaizumi said the officers sustained minor abrasions that did not require hospitalization. An LAPD news release said neither had been injured. Smith said Ford had been unarmed. Other accounts Two witnesses disputed the officers' claim that Ford had concealed his hands, and said that he had raised his hands as the officers left their vehicle. They also said that Ford did not tackle an officer, and was instead tackled to the ground by one of the officers. Tritobia Ford said her son was lying on the ground and complying with officers' orders when he was shot. Other family members supported her account, including a man who identified himself as Ford's cousin and said: > They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, > knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the > Newton Division, knows that ‚Äî that this child has mental problems. The > excessive force ... there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in > the back while he's laying down? No. Then when the mom comes, they don't try > to console her ... they pull the billy clubs out. Harrison, who said he saw the shooting from a second-story window, said Ford had put his hands in the air when he was tackled to the ground and shot three times. Harrison said that while on the ground Ford \\"was struggling like he didn't want anyone on top of him, didn't want anyone holding him down\\". Two women who were in the home adjacent to the driveway said Ford had not been on top of one of the officers, and had instead been face-down with the officer on top of him. Dorene Henderson, a friend of the Ford family, said she heard someone yell \\"Get down, get down.\\" She said she heard a pop and neighbors telling officers \\"He's got mental problems.\\" Hill said \\"I was sitting across the street when it happened ... The cops jumped out of the car and rushed him over here into this corner. They had him in the corner and were beating him, busted him up, for what reason I don't know he didn't do nothing.\\" Hill said he heard an officer say \\"Shoot him\\", followed by three gunshots, while Ford was on the ground. Ina Smalls, who lives across the street from Ford, said she ran outside after hearing gunshots and saw Ford \\"on the ground, shot dead, handcuffed on his stomach\\". Smalls said she did not believe that Ford had tried to take the officer's gun. Fred Sayre, Ford's parents' attorney, said none of the witnesses he had spoken to could decisively say whether Ford grabbed for the officer's gun. Events immediately following the shooting Ford was taken to California Hospital Medical Center, where he underwent surgery, and was pronounced dead at 10:10p.m. Tritobia Ford said police had refused to inform her where her son was hospitalized. Police initially offered little information about the shooting, and did not initially release Ford's name or specify why they stopped him. Imaizumi said police had declined to release information due to a \\"gathering\\" at the scene. Response Comparisons to Michael Brown Local civil rights leaders and some on social media drew comparisons between Ford and the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri two days previously. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, the president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, released a statement soon after the shooting commenting \\"The killing of Ezell Ford ‚Äî coming on the heels of the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson, Missouri ‚Äî again raises the issue and problem of tense police-community relations\\". Hutchinson also said \\"If in fact Ferguson hadn't happened, if in fact we hadn't seen what we've seen the last two days there ... I don't know there would be the same sense of urgency. I think coming on the heels of that, it does give it a sense of urgency.\\" Investigations, autopsy and LAPD response Initial response Both officers were placed on paid leave. In the aftermath of the shooting, and in response to threats on social media, the LAPD directed all officers to travel in pairs. Hutchinson and other civil rights leaders met with LAPD officials on August 14. Hutchinson said he was reassured by the meeting and believed the LAPD was taking the concerns seriously, and that it would fast-track the investigation while ensuring transparency. The activists who attended the meeting stressed that they did not want to see in Los Angeles rioting similar to that seen in Ferguson or in L.A. in 1992. LAPD officials named Wampler and Villegas on August 28. Wampler's name had been leaked the previous day by blogger Jasmyne Cannick. In a statement the department commented \\"it was necessary to investigate evidence ... regarding potential threats to the safety of the officers and ensure that measures were taken to mitigate those threats.\\" Both officers remained on paid administrative leave. In December 2014 a department spokesman said both officers had been reassigned to administrative duties. In August 2014, Paysinger said the LAPD would investigate the shooting with oversight by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, its Office of Inspector General, and the office of the Los Angeles District Attorney. On August 18 Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti said he would ensure a \\"full and fair investigation\\" took place. Autopsy On August 18 the LAPD placed a \\"security hold\\" on the release of the report of Ford's autopsy. Smith said the hold was due to the risk that the autopsy's findings would affect witnesses' testimonies, but Hutchinson said it would fuel \\"suspicions about the LAPD's version of the Ford killing.\\" In October 2014 the South Central Neighborhood Council passed a resolution calling on Los Angeles City Council member Curren Price to direct the LAPD to release Ford's autopsy report. A spokesman said the LAPD was reluctant to release information that could adversely affect ongoing investigations, and that the department had seen little success in finding witnesses. On November 13 Garcetti said the report would be made public by the end of 2014. The autopsy was released on December 29. It showed Ford was shot three times, in the back, side and right arm. The gunshot wound in his back bore a \\"muzzle imprint\\" suggesting the shot was fired at very close range. It also noted multiple abrasions to Ford's hand and arm. Experts consulted by the Los Angeles Times said none of the autopsy's findings were unexpected or contradicted the officers' accounts. Beck investigation LAPD chief Charlie Beck in January 2014 Beck concluded in a report that Wampler and Villegas had been justified in their actions. His investigation found that Wampler had grounds to reasonably suspect that Ford had been in possession of drugs. Bustamante investigation Steve Soboroff, the president of the Board of Police Commissioners, said in August 2014 that he had asked the office of the Inspector General to prioritize its investigation of Ford's case. On September 2 Inspector General Alex Bustamante issued a statement urging witnesses to come forward. Bustamante said despite the conflicting accounts of the shooting, he had only succeeded in contacting one witness. In November 2014 Beck, District Attorney Jackie Lacey and Price called on witnesses to come forward. On December 4 Beck said no new witnesses had been identified. Beck and Bustamante reiterated in December 2014 and January 2015 that the department had encountered difficulties in finding witnesses, and that witnesses whose names were provided by the Ford family's attorney had been uncooperative. Bustamante's report found that Wampler and Villegas's actions had been justified, but found that Wampler did not have grounds to reasonably suspect that Ford had been in possession of drugs. The report criticized Wampler's decision to initiate physical contact with Ford as a \\"substantial deviation from tactical training\\" that put him at risk of assault. Bustamante explained that, though Ford was looking back at Wampler and Villegas while taking his hands in and out of his pockets, this alone was not enough \\"to cross the threshold of reasonable suspicion\\". Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners investigation On June 5, 2015 the Los Angeles Times reported that, \\"according to sources with knowledge of the investigation\\", the Board of Police Commissioners had determined that both Wampler and Villegas were justified in the shooting. Soboroff responded the same day that the Board had received several recommendations but had yet to make a decision. On June 9, 2015 the Board's ruling stated that Villegas was justified in the shooting, but Wampler violated Ford's civil rights by detaining him. The commission rejected Beck's conclusion that Wampler had adhered to LAPD policy. The investigation found that Villegas did not have a good reason to initially draw his gun, and that Wampler did not have grounds to reasonably suspect that Ford had been in possession of drugs. Nine different determinations were issued: Wampler was found in violation of policy in four areas (tactics, drawing of weapon, use of non-lethal force, use of deadly force), while Villegas was within policy in three areas (tactics, use of non-lethal force, and use of deadly force) and one part of another area (drawing of weapon on the second occasion) but in violation of policy in another part of the same area (drawing of weapon on the first occasion). The Board's decision to consider the \\"totality of the circumstances, and not just the moment in which force was used\\" marked a departure from its previous approach to police shootings, which involved assessing only whether officers faced a deadly threat at the moment they opened fire. More than 100 people attended the Board's public meeting on June 9. The Board's decision is not legally binding. Its findings will be sent to the LAPD's internal affairs group, and after a few months, will be forwarded to Beck, who will determine if he will discipline the officers involved. Any possible criminal charges will be determined by Lacey. Speaking after the Board's ruling, Beck downplayed the disagreement between its report and his own, and said the result was the outcome of a system of checks and balances. Beck also released a video message in which he told LAPD officers, \\"You have my support. You have the support of the mayor. You have the support of the vast majority of the people of Los Angeles.\\" Soboroff questioned Beck's failure to also mention the Board of Police Commissioners, which he described as \\"hurtful but ... untrue.\\" Beck said it was not his intention to suggest that the Board did not support officers. Craig Lally, the president of the LAPPL, criticized the ruling, and claimed the Board had dealt with the officers severely to prevent civil unrest. Lally and other LAPPL officials addressed Commissioners at the Board's first public meeting following the decision, where he criticized Commissioner Paula Madison for comments she made on KNBC, in which she compared changing use of force laws to changing laws that once condoned slavery or barred women from voting. Lally described Madison's remarks as \\"disturbing and insulting.\\" Lally also described Ford as a \\"known gang member\\". Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti in April 2014 Garcetti commented on the Board of Police Commissioner's report on June 13, 2015. He said \\"I think it's so important for law enforcement officers to know that they are supported,\\" and emphasized the need \\"to strengthen the bonds between community and between police.\\" Garcetti also met with Tribotia Ford, and told reporters \\"It was a really beautiful meeting between the two of us, I think\\". Ford said she was grateful to the mayor but the meeting had come \\"10 months late.\\" Disciplinary process and long-term response In June 2015 Beck criticized confidentiality laws, which he argued prevented him from making public the disciplinary measures to be placed on Wampler and Villegas, and called for \\"greater leeway for the police department to make not only the decisions known, but the rationale behind the decision.\\" He said that these confidentiality requirements prevented him from discussing what measures would be taken against Wampler, or what form they could take. In July 2015 officials told KPCC that the LAPD would re-train all its officers in de-escalating confrontations with suspects and in approaching people with mental illnesses, in part in response to the shootings of Ford and Michael Brown. Protests and community response August 2014 On the morning of August 13 a group of men gathered at a makeshift memorial featuring candles and sign reading \\"police brutality must stop\\". On August 14, a rally and march was attended by around 100 protesters who marched from Leimert Plaza Park along Crenshaw Boulevard to the LAPD's 77th division statement. Protesters marched with their hands raised shouted \\"hands up, don't shoot\\", and chanted Ford's name. The protest took place simultaneously with demonstrations in 90 other U.S. cities as part of a National Moment of Silence for Michael Brown. Lavell Ford, Ezell Ford's brother, spoke, saying \\"They killing us all, they killing us all. Blacks, Latinos, everybody, they just killing us. And we gotta take a stand. It happens everyday around in this neighborhood, everyday. That could've been me laying out there.\\" After the protest many demonstrators went to the scene of the shooting. Another protest took place the following day, and was attended by around 36 people. On August 15, Paysinger favorably compared the Los Angeles' community's reaction to Ford's death to the reaction to Brown's death in Missouri, and attributed the absence of violence to \\"the confidence the public has in the police department to conduct an immediate, a thorough, a thoughtful investigation\\". Paysinger added that the LAPD does \\"a much better job reaching out to the community\\" than it had done previously. Soboroff described the comparison as \\"apples to oranges,\\" due to the LAPD's emphasis on community policing. Price said \\"Los Angeles is not Ferguson. Much work has gone into changing the culture of our police department. Our progress is evidenced this evening by the presence of our chief of police and his command staff.\\" On August 15 a video entitled \\"Fuck the Police\\" was posted online accompanying a song by Ceebo the Rapper. The song's lyrics state \\"When they killed Ez' [Ford], they should have killed me,\\" and described police as \\"the enemy\\" and \\"KKK in the flesh.\\" On August 21 the Los Angeles Police Protective League (LAPPL) called for officers to be on heightened alert in response to the video. Ceebo the Rapper, a cousin of Ford, said \\"There was never any intent [in the song] to threaten any police or nothing. But I guess that's how they want to take it\\". A protester speaks at the August 17 demonstration Protesters outside LAPD headquarters on August 17 Another protest occurred on August 17, in response to Ford's death as well as that of Brown. Several hundred protesters marched to LAPD headquarters, where several speeches were made, and then to Union Station, La Placita, through Little Tokyo and Chinatown to City Hall. Protesters carried signs carrying the names of Ford and Brown; others wore Guy Fawkes masks. The protesters again chanted \\"Hands up, don't shoot\\", and called for charges to be brought against the officers involved in Ford's death, and for the names of the officers to be released. Speakers also demanded increased civilian oversight of the police and mandatory body cameras. Interactions between police and protesters were minimal and no violence was reported. On August 19, Beck answered questions before an audience of around 300 community members at Paradise Baptist Church in South Los Angeles, including members of Ford's family. Beck told the audience there remained \\"more questions than answers\\" in the Ford investigation, and said \\"We wonder the same things: Was it necessary? Was it justified? Could there have been another way? I want exactly what you want ... and that is the truth.\\" Beck declined to name the officers or share information on why they had stopped Ford, explaining \\"I will not give you half a story ... We have to find out all the facts\\"; and promised the names would be released when the department believed they were no longer in danger of retaliation. Soboroff, Bustamante, Deputy District Attorney James Garrison, and Price also attended. Another protest also took place on the same day. After attending the meeting Paysinger said \\"You think you're in a good place, but then you find yourself at that meeting ... It was patently clear to me that we need to get busy.\\" Paysinger also commented that two decades previously such a meeting would not have taken place and said he \\"found great satisfaction, at least in some way, that people came. They had an ability to voice their dissatisfaction with the LAPD because I think somewhere deep down, they do believe that something is going to happen.\\" Around 100 people took part in another protest on August 21. Ford's funeral was held on August 30 at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles. County supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, Price, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters and former U.S. Representative Diane Watson spoke at the service. Speakers linked Ford's death to other encounters between officers and unarmed African-American men, including the shooting of Michael Brown. Later events On December 29, 2014, following the release of Ford's autopsy, demonstrators gathered outside LAPD headquarters and at Leimert Park. That evening protesters briefly blocked traffic on the 110 Freeway. In December 2014 a group of activists including Hutchinson announced the Ezell Ford Police Conflict Reduction Plan, calling for mandatory body cameras, a review of deadly force policies, retraining on mental health issues, a conflict mediation task force, and for referring all officer-involved shootings to criminal prosecutors. Another demonstration took place on January 3, 2015, organised by the Coalition for Community Control Over the Police, with around 50 participants. In late December 2014 and early January 2015 protesters camped outside LAPD headquarters. On January 5 they were forced to leave, with two arrests made after participants tried to pass barricades to deliver their demands to Beck. The following day demonstrators attended the weekly meeting of the Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, demanding greater transparency and civilian control over the LAPD. Later in January protesters continued to gather daily outside LAPD headquarters, demanding that Wampler and Villegas be terminated and that Lacey file charges against the officers. An activist interviewed by ColorLines said LAPD officers had used \\"intimidation tactics\\" against the encampment. On January 9 leaders met with Beck, who did not accept the demand that the officers be fired but agreed to treat the protesters with greater respect. Following the meeting police removed the metal barricade used to keep the protesters away from the building. Prior to the Board of Commissioners' announcement of its findings in June 2015 a protest camp was established outside Garcetti's home. Later in June a small group of protesters gathered in response to reports that Beck and Bustamante would find that Wampler and Villegas were justified in shooting Ford. After the ruling community activists called on Lacey to file criminal charges against Wampler. Tritobia Ford applauded the outcome and joined in calling for Lacey to file charges. She also said she was \\"kind of surprised\\" by the decision. In July 2015 Garcetti announced he would meet with Black Lives Matter activists who called for the dismissal of Beck, Wampler and Villegas. Ford's family held a memorial service for Ford at Inglewood Park Cemetery on August 8, 2015. Protesters disrupted a meeting of the Board of Police Commissioners on August 11, the first anniversary of Ford's death. Protesters shouted at a woman who spoke in support of police officers, and held photographs of Ford. An LAPD lieutenant declared an unlawful assembly, and demonstrators delivered written demands that Beck, Wampler and Villegas attend a \\"people's tribunal\\". No arrests were made and the demonstration continued outside LAPD headquarters. Legal proceedings In September 2014, Ford's family members filed a federal wrongful-death lawsuit against the LAPD. They voluntarily dismissed this suit in June 2016.Stipulation to Dismiss the Complaint of Plaintiffs, C.D. Cal. case no. 2:14-cv-07268-JFW-JPR, Dkt. 131 (June 28, 2016). In March 2015, Ford's parents filed a second wrongful- death lawsuit in state court, alleging that Wampler and Villegas intentionally or negligently shot Ford and that Wampler and Villegas violated Ford's constitutional rights. The suit also alleged that the LAPD had a longstanding practice of violating civil rights, and that Wampler and Villegas were motivated by Ford's race and their \\"prejudice, disdain and contempt for African Americans or persons of black skin tone.\\" The City of Los Angeles settled this lawsuit in October 2016 for $1.5 million.http://abc7.com/news/ezell-ford-family-lawsuit-$15m-settlement- reached/1744227/; see also LASC case search (Case No. BC574800). In January 2017 Los Angeles County prosecutors said Wampler and Villegas would not face criminal charges in connection with the shooting.

He was a main contributor in the Albanian Bashkimi Alphabet. Life Preng Do√ßi was born in Paraspor neighborhood of Bulg√´r, a village near Lezha, back then Ottoman Empire, and today's Rubik, Mirdit√´ municipality on 25 February 1846. He finished the high school in Shkod√´r and in 1859 entered the recently opened Albanian Pontifical Seminary (). Later he studied in Rome, in the Propaganda Fide College, where he met and became a close friend of Prenk Bib√´ Doda. In 1871, he returned to Mirdita region in Albania, where he served as a priest in Korthpul√´, Orosh, and, Kalivarja near Spa√ß. He was among the leaders of the Mirdita uprising against Ottoman rule in 1876‚Äì1877 under Prenk Bib√´ Doda. Do√ßi had previously traveled to Cetinje, capital of Principality of Montenegro, in order to seek financial and military assistance by the Montenegrins. He returned from Cetinje with a pledge of Montenegrin assistance and, equally important, a promise of noninterference. The rebellion was quelled by the Ottomans in March 1877. The bishop of Lezh√´, Francesco Malƒçinski, an Austrian of Ukrainian origin suspended him from all religious activities. Do√ßi hid in Vuthaj, near Gusinje. Later Do√ßi was captured and exiled to Istanbul. With the intervention of Armenian Patriarch Stefan Azarian, he received a fake name P√©re Achile and was sent to Rome with the condition of not returning to Albania. Dom Preng Do√ßi portrait. After staying few months in Antivari, with the intervention of Cardinal Giovanni Simeoni of the Propaganda Fide, Do√ßi was sent to the west coast of the Americas, Newsfoundland, Wayne, Pennsylvania, and New Brunswick, where he worked as a missionary until 1881. To Do√ßi goes the honor, as far as it can be ascertained, of being the first known Albanian resident of North America. After his return to Rome, he was sent to India as secretary of the apostolic delegate to India, Cardinal Antonio Agliardi. In 1888, after years of petitioning and with the intercession of the patriarch of Constantinople, Do√ßi finally received permission from the Ottoman authorities to return to Albania. He arrived on 6 November 1888 and became abbot of Mirdita. In January of the following year, he was consecrated head of the Abbey nullius of St. Alexander of Orosh, Mirdita. In 1890 and later in 1894, several other regions of Lezh√´ and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sap√´ would be joined under his Abbey's jurisdiction. Do√ßi died on 22 February 1917.  Political activity  Sculpture of Preng Do√ßi in the portico of the Orosh Church, Mirdita Do√ßi did not cease his political efforts. He advocated for close relations between Albanians and Austria-Hungary to advance Albanian geopolitical self determination however his political thinking was mainly toward Albanian Catholic interests and regional concerns. In 1897 he traveled to Vienna to propose the creation of an autonomous Catholic principality in northern Albania under Mirdita leadership and would politically dominate within a wider confederation of Albanian statelets. Austria-Hungary supported his proposal however found its implementation would be unfeasible and opposed by Muslim Albanians and the Ottoman Empire. In 1889, he founded an Albanian school in Orosh (Gryk√´ Orosh - Orosh Gorge), one of the earliest. Literary activity In 1899, Do√ßi founded the Shoqnia e bashkimit t√´ gjuh√´s shqipe (Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language) literary society, usually known as the Shoqnia Bashkimi (The Union Society), or simply Bashkimi (The Union) of Shkodra for publishing Albanian language books. Together with him there were Dom Ndoc Nikaj, Luigj Gurakuqi, Dom Gjergj Fishta, Dom Dod√´ Koleci, Father Pashk Bardhi, Dom Laz√´r Mjeda, etc. The society came out with the so-called Bashkimi alphabet, which would become one of the three alphabets considered for the standard Albanian alphabet during the Congress of Monastir in 1908. Do√ßi supported the use of the Bashkimi alphabet and promoted its spread in Catholic Albanian schools. He contributed to the Fiamuri Arb√´rit (Flag of Albanians) newspaper of the Arb√´resh√´ scholar Girolamo De Rada. He signed his articles as \\"Primo Docci\\", or \\"Nj√´ djal√´ prej Shqypnije\\" (A guy from Albania). After the foundation of Bashkimi Society, he published many works, many of them anonymously. Gjergj Fishta mentioned during his speech at the Do√ßi's funeral that Do√ßi had created 32 literary works.

The film stars Jayasurya, Aparna Nair, Vinay Forrt, Ajay Nataraj, Ambika Mohan, Riyaz Khan, Anusree Nair, Salim Kumar, Shankar Ramakrishnan and Vinayakan in prominent roles. It was released on 5 December 2014. The film was later dubbed into Tamil and released as Andha Sila Nimidangal (In Those Few Seconds). The film is a multi-narrative, told in a non-linear format. The film cuts between present day, where the police officer on investigation asks for the whereabouts of the people who were in the lift and flashbacks, where their lives on the day leading up to the incident is shown.http://www.indiaglitz.com/Seconds-malayalam-movie- review-18255http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Aparna- Nair-joins-Jayasurya-in-Seconds/movie- review/22485842.cmshttp://www.nowrunning.com/movie/14168/malayalam/seconds/index.htm Plot The film revolves around a murder that happens in the lift of a city apartment in Kochi. Four unrelated individuals are stuck in the lift. One ends up dead, two are stabbed and the forth is arrested under suspicion of murder. The police officer on investigation, Bimal Vaas (Ajay Nataraj), leads the case. He interrogates Shivan Kutty (Indrans), the lift technician who claims to be new and is unaware of any problems with the lift. The backstory of each one of the four young people in the lift is then told in flashbacks. The first person is Teena (Aparna Nair), who is the only one safe and is arrested by the police. She is a playful young lady who left her family and came to the city in search of wealth and fame. However, she can only afford to live at a ladies' hostel and work at a new jewelry store in the city. During the store's grand opening, she meets Abi Thomas (Riyaz Khan) who offers her a better position as the manager at his own jewelry store. Teena's boss and co-worker advice her to ignore Abi's advances. However, she still phones Abi and he invites her to his apartment. After lying about her mother being sick, Teena leaves work early and rushes over to the apartment building to meet Abi. The second person is Feroz (Vinay Forrt), who in present-day is in critical condition at the hospital. He is a hot-tempered young photographer who was raised by his grandparents after his parents' death. They are desperate to get him married but he is preoccupied with saving up money to buy a new studio in the middle of the city. One evening, he takes a budding young actress, Sneha (Meera Muralidharan) to meet his filmmaker buddy, Mahadevan (Shankar Ramakrishnan). Sneha is a big fan of Mahadevan and asks Feroz to take a photograph of them together. On their way back to Feroz's studio, Mahadevan's jeep breaks down and Feroz tries to fix it. Meanwhile, Sneha is hit by an electric pole which kills her. Mahadevan fears that he will be implicated in Sneha's death and forces Feroz to leave the scene with him before anyone comes. Following the events of that fateful evening, Feroz realizes that he can blackmail Mahadevan for money by using the photograph he took of Mahadevan and Sneha on the day she died. Mahadevan cannot deal with any bad publicity at the moment since he is venturing into politics. Desperate, Mahadevan asks one of his gangster friends in Mumbai, Jeevan (Salim Kumar), for help. Jeevan hires an assassin in Kochi to kill Feroz. Mahadevan invites Feroz to his apartment building which is the same one as Abi's on the pretext of giving him the money he demands. The third person is Veeramani (Jayasurya), who is at present stable at the hospital. He is an unsuccessful insurance agent with low self-esteem who lives with his wife, Parvathy (Anusree) and their daughter. He is no longer in talking terms with his Iyer parents because he married a girl without their consent. Unknown to his family, he is going through depression and meets a psychologist to overcome his mental issues. Before returning home from work everyday, he goes to the local cinema to clear his mind. Since he has never achieved his annual target, he goes around asking everyone he meets if they would like to buy his insurance policy, which makes him unpopular in his neighbourhood. After much difficulty, Veeramani manages to convince Mahadevan to become his latest client. He then goes to the same apartment building to meet Mahadevan on the same day to finalize the insurance agreement. The final person is Thampi (Vinayakan), who is the one who ends up dead in the lift. He is both a drug dealer and a drug user. He lives in the slums with his two wives and a young daughter. A few hours before his murder, he gets into a fight with the new police officer in the area and is jailed. Once he is released, he returns to the slums and gets high on drugs. He then gets a phone call from someone mysterious asking him to come the same apartment building for a job. Once in the lift, the lift gets stuck and the lights go off. When it is back on, Veeramani has been stabbed. Before anyone can react, the lights go off again and this time, Feroz is stabbed. Teena quickly notices that Thampi has a dagger in his hand and fatally hits him in the head with the emergency telephone. When the lift doors are finally opened, she is arrested by the police and is taken to the nearby station. After checking the visitors book, Bimal learns that both Veeramani and Feroz were at the apartment building to meet Mahadevan. While being questioned, Mahadevan admits that he knows both Feroz and Veeramani and that they were both scheduled to meet him that day. However, he hides the fact that he and Feroz tried to cover up the truth behind Sneha's death. Bimal also learns that Thampi wrote down the number of an empty apartment in the visitors book, which means he was probably up to something suspicious. Also, the coroner's report indicate that he was on drugs before he was killed. Even more strange, he was from the slums where the crime rate is high. Bimal concludes that Thampi was probably high and became paranoid when the lift stopped working. He saw the two young men with him as dangerous and tried to kill them. Teena then attacked him in self-defense, unwittingly killing him. All the charges on her are dropped and she is released from police custody. Meanwhile, Feroz dies in the intensive care unit and Veeramani is discharged from the hospital. A few days later, Veeramani is fully recovered. On the advice of his mother-in-law (Ambika Mohan), who was told by the police that he is suffering from depression, Veeramani goes on a pilgrimage to Palani by bus. However, halfway through his journey, he gets down from the bus at Palakkad and gets into a limousine with Shivan Kutty and Jeevan. It is then revealed that Veeramani is actually the contract killer Mahadevan hired to kill Feroz. He has been leading a double life as a timid insurance agent to avoid suspicion. Shivan Kutty, who tampered with the lift on that day, is his partner in crime while Jeevan is their handler. Veeramani had pretended to be depressed and had Jeevan arrange for Mahadevan to buy his insurance policy on that day to cover his tracks. He was also the one who anonymously phoned Thampi on the pretext of needing drugs and gave him an empty apartment number to make him look suspicious. Mahadevan then summoned Feroz to the apartment at the same time so that Veeramani can carry out his plan. However, Teena had unexpectedly gotten into the lift. In reality, Veeramani had stabbed himself before stabbing Feroz. Teena and Thampi thought the other person was the killer and she ended up killing him. Veeramani, Jeevan and Shivan Kutty then head for the Coimbatore International Airport, where Veeramani is given his latest task. The screen then cuts to black.

The US and Canadian border inspection agencies inspect trains, motor vehicles and airplanes. History Laurier, WA border station as seen in 1936 Canada has operated a border station at this crossing since 1897, when the prospecting boom was at its peak. In 1899, the Columbia and Western Railway laid tracks across the border. The mining boom ended soon after, and a series of fires (one of which destroyed 6 hotels in 1899 in the boomtown of Cascade City) hastened the departure of many. A large sawmill operated in Cascade just north of the border until the 1930s. Although the Laurier post office remains in operation, the town is gone. The Cascade post office closed in 1973, and the location where the center of town once stood is now a golf course. The US built a border inspection station at Laurier in 1933, which remains in use today. It was listed on the US National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

He was the title of Raja and old documents use the titular name or the prefix \\"babu\\", a term used for native Indian officers employed by the British Indian government. Born in Banaras he is known for the three-volume work on the history of India titled \\"ItihƒÅsa timiranƒÅ≈õaka\\". He also translated several books from English to Hindi. Sivaprasad was born in a Parmar Kshatriya family that converted to Jainism and the Oswal caste that originated in Ranthambore. When Ranthambor was besieged by Allauddin Khilji in the 13th century, the family moved several times, first to Ahmedabad, then to Champaner and finally to Khambat. One member of the family line, Amar Datt, gifted Shah Jahan a diamond and received the title of Ray. Sivaprasad's grandfather moved to Banaras and his father Gopichand died when he was eleven. His early education was from his grandmother, Bibi Ratan Kuar. An anti-European upbringing led to him choosing, at the age of seventeen, to work for the Bharatpur Maharajah as a Vakil in the court of Colonel James Sutherland (commissioner), Governor-General's agent at Ajmer. He quickly resigned after finding the durbar \\"rotten\\". He then worked for Lord Hardinge's camp at Firozpur and was so impressed by the conditions that he swore never to serve under a native ruler again. He then worked for the British as a Mir Munshi in the Simla agency. He rose to become a Joint- Inspector for Schools in 1856. In May, 1870, he was conferred the Companionship of the most exalted Star of India or \\"Sitar-e-Hind\\" and the hereditary title of \\"Raja\\" in March 1874. Sivaprasad submitted a memorandum in 1868, Court Characters in the Upper Provinces of India, in which he pointed out that Urdu characters required interpretation and that the phonemes could easily be altered by minor changes to the strokes causing major changes in meaning. He suggested that this could permit legal documents to be altered or forged and proposed therefore the use of Nagari scripts in courts. The period from 1845 to 1870 of Hindi printed literature was greatly influenced by Sivaprasad. Sivaprasad was proficient in Hindi, Urdu, Persian, Sanskrit, Bengali and English, and edited the news periodicals Banaras akhbaar and Simla akhbaar. He also contributed poems to the Awadh akhbaar and published thirty- five books. He was a promoter of the Hindi language, particularly the version known as khari boli and popularized the use of the Nagari script. He made full use of Arabic and Persian words in his writings.

The Age, 14 May 2006 The original lineup, drawn largely from the bayside Beaumaris, Sandringham and Brighton suburbs of Melbourne, consisted of Allan Browne, drums; Brett Iggulden, trumpet; Kim Lynch, tea-chest bass; Bill Howard trombone; Felix Blatt, banjo and John Pike, piano, while Brett's sister Sally (aka \\"Sweet Sal\\", who later married Browne and became a clothes designer) was an occasional addition on washboard. John Funsten, another pupil of Ade Monsbourgh, was added on clarinet. They played New Orleans inspired traditional jazz and infused it with their own vitality, their flair for presentation and promotion and zany sense of humour.Stevens, Timothy (2000). The origins, development and significance of the Red Onion Jazz Band, 1960‚Äì1996. Jazz standards were the material for their first job at St Michael & All Angels Anglican Church hall dance in Beaumaris, and by about April 1961, they were given a brief spot at the Melbourne Jazz Club; their first introduction into the Melbourne jazz scene and in June Corrine Kirby included them on her ABC T.V. programme Let's Make a Date for which, at the insistence of Channel 2 executives a name change from their original Gin Bottle Jazz Band to the more respectable Red Onion Jazz Band was made, the title chosen in honour of an early Louis Armstrong recording group. They opened then at the 'Oxford' Jazz Club, where they continued for six months, with Fred Charles on clarinet. Success In November 1961, Geoff Thomas took over from Felix Blatt as banjoist and the band started the Red Onion Jazz Club in Brighton. They also played at the Downbeat Jazz Concert in 1962 before Fred Charles and Geoff Thomas left the band in October and were replaced by Gerry Humphrys (born Brian Anton Humphrys, 1941, in Battersea, England) and Rainer Breit (who had been playing together in a skiffle trio for about a year). After securing gigs at the Ormond R.S.L. Hall and Beaumaris Yacht Club, they joined the 17th Jazz Convention in Sydney in December 1962, where their long hair, formal wear, violins and mad vocals caused a stir. Returning to Melbourne they played Friday nights at the 'Newport' Jazz Club at the Edithvale Life Saving Club and on Saturday nights at their own venue 'The Onion Patch' in Oakleigh. In early 1963, the group released their first 7\\" EP, An Impromptu Recital by the Amazing and Entertaining Red Onion Jazz Band on the tiny EAST (Elwood Audio Services Transcriptions) recording label, and it received conspicuous airplay on radio station 3XYs Jazz As You Like It program. John Pike left in March and for 11 months the band played without a pianist, but had a busy year of concerts that included Moomba, Myer Music Bowl, a 3-day tour of Tasmania including radio, T.V. and dance engagements in Hobart, as well as the 18th Australian Jazz Convention. The Red Onion Jazz Band at the 1963 Jazz Convention EP (their second recording) contains two vocal tracks; the bawdy sea-shanty \\"Barnacle Bill\\", and a version of Tommy Dorsey's \\"It's Tight Like That\\". Gerry Humphrys left the band for four months in June 1963, and Jerry Salt, Derek Miller or Eddie Robbins replaced his clarinet, while Brett Iggulden took up alto sax for special numbers. Venues then included the 'Driftwood' Club and the 'Downbeat' Jazz Club where in 17 February-year-old pianist Ian Clyne first sat in and thereafter became a regular member. In July 1964, The Red Onions signed with W&G; Records who put out a well-received EP entitled The Red Onions at Home and they transferred from the 'Onion Patch' to the popular 'Campus' Club. They appeared again on TV for GTV9 and ATV0, most importantly on Graham Kennedy's influential In Melbourne Tonight. In November the band opened at 'Opus' discotheque in South Yarra where it was estimated that more than 2,000 attended the first night. The entire band also featured at the 19th Jazz Convention in Newcastle. After the split In early 1965, The Red Onion Jazz Band released their self-titled debut LP. Its black-and- white cover art (see above) was designed by tuba player Kim Lynch, however in October, he and two other members, clarinetist, vocalist and occasional violinist Gerry Humphreys and Ian Clyne left, after three years of success, to play together the electric Rhythm and Blues that was beginning to eclipse jazz amongst younger audiences, especially after the visit of the Beatles to Melbourne in 1964. Humphrys, Clyne and Lynch went on to form the rock group The Loved Ones. After this split The Onions' Brett Iggulden (trumpet and vocals), Bill Howard (trombone and vocals) and drummer Allan Browne persevered, joined by John Scurry (banjo and guitar) and Richard Miller (clarinet) in 1965. In 1967 the group left Australia for a 10-month, 50,000-mile tour of Europe. During the tour the band performed at the Jazz Jamboree in Warsaw, Poland, during October 1967, and at jazz clubs, ball rooms, jazz festivals and on radio. On return to Australia they continued to appear on television, at balls and discoth√®ques, jazz clubs, university concerts and fashion parades. Between 1974 and 1983 the Onions did not perform together. In 1983 they reunited in a benefit for Bill Howard who had lost his house and possessions in the Ash Wednesday bushfires. Thereafter they performed quite regularly, with festival appearancesTHE RED ONIONS drew a crowd of long-term fans to the penultimate concert of the spring series of Jazz at The Cross at the Canberra Southern Cross Club last week. and occasional gigs in Melbourne. They travelled to Europe a third time in 1992, and released the CD Crisis shortly thereafter.Beilby, Roger & Brown, Eric (2010). The Red Onion Jazz Band. Victorian Jazz Museum, Wantirna, Vic With Bill Howard's death from cancer in 1996 the Red Onions finally disbanded, with their last formal appearance at the Wangaratta Festival of Jazz and Blues. At this performance they featured their mentor and long time friend, Ade Monsbourgh. A Red Onion Jazz Band exhibition was opened by Allan Browne on 7 August 2010 at the Victorian Jazz Archive.

In addition to publishing albums by the founding members, the label was responsible for releases by other Spanish artists and the distribution of releases by some foreign artists. Along with other labels founded around the same time, such as DRO Records, Grabaciones Accidentales is considered to be one of Spain's first independent record labels. History Grabaciones Accidentales was established in Madrid in late 1981 by members of the bands Esclarecidos and D√©cima V√≠ctima. Aviador Dro's label DRO Records, with which GASA would later collaborate, was also founded around this time. Music critic Diego Manrique announced the label's establishment in the December 1981 issue of Spain's Rock Espezial magazine, explaining that the label would sign artists for one release at a time (often a single) rather than making long-term contracts. GASA is one of Spain's earliest independent record labels. As alternative rock became more popular in Spain, Grabaciones Accidentales and other small Spanish labels presented the opportunity for independent artists, especially those based in Madrid, to release music to a wider audience. GASA's first releases, 7\\" EPs by founding artists Esclarecidos and D√©cima V√≠ctima, were issued in March 1982. In that year, the label also released EPs by Los Coyotes and Derribos Arias. The following year, GASA continued to take on new artists. However, the collapse of its original distributor, Pancoca, which had also handled distribution for other independent labels such as DRO and Tres Cipreses, caused a crisis for the label. Grabaciones Accidentales began acting as a distributor for DRO to help alleviate pressures. It was absorbed into DRO in 1984. In 1993, struggling to meet increasing demand in an unstable market, DRO was acquired by Warner.

History The ranch school movement began in the Western United States in the early 1900s as a way to educate children who lived on ranches in remote and rural areas, far away from regular schools in the towns and cities. The idea was popular and within a short time many ranch schools took on a boarding school type of application, similar to a dude ranch concept, where Easterners or city-dwellers could send their children as well. At the time, Americans widely believed that the arid climate of the Western states could help children suffering from conditions like asthma recuperate. The hard work that went with living and working on a ranch and spending a lot of time outdoors was also appealing to those who wanted their children to grow up strong, healthy and independent. Most ranch school students rode a horse every day and were taught the basics of ranching and living outdoors, in addition to regular school teachings. Arizona led the nation in the number of ranch schools, most of which were in the Tucson area. Many were for boys only, but there were some all-girls schools as well, such as the Hacienda del Sol school outside of Tucson or the Jokake School in Scottsdale. Most of the ranch schools were built for locals, but some ranchers - such as those at the Little Outfit Ranch in Arizona's San Rafael Valley - established ranches with the specific intention of operating them as boarding schools for \\"city boys\\". Ranch schools were advertised in magazines and newspapers, drawing in students and their families from across the country, and as a result are accredited with contributing to the growth of the tourism industry in the Southwest in the early 1900s. By the 1960s, most of the ranch schools in the United States were closed or soon-to-be closed, marking the end of the ranch school movement. However, some ranch schools have survived (such as Deep Springs College, a liberal arts college, not a school).

Eaton, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 454 (1818), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a patent disclosing an improved method of manufacture by means of several different improved machines should be construed to claim both the method and the improvements to the machines, but not to include the machines apart from the inventor's improvements. It was the third published Supreme Court decision on patents,Malla Pollack, The Owned Public Domain: The Constitutional Right Not to Be Excluded - or the Supreme Court Chose the Right Breakfast Cereal in Kellogg v. National Biscuit Co., 22 Hastings Comm. & Ent L.J. 265, 291 n119 (2000). and the first to deal with substantive patent law.Harold C. Wegner, Post-Merck Experimental Use and the \\"Safe Harbor\\", 15 Fed. Circuit B.J. 1, 37 (2005). It was the first Supreme Court case to deal with the question of when an invention is patentably distinct from the prior art.N. Scott Pierce, A Great Invisible Crashing: The Rise and Fall of Patent Eligibility Through Mayo v. Prometheus, 23 Fordham Intell. Prop. Media & Ent. L.J. 186, 211-15 (2012) It was also the second of four successive Supreme Court cases related specifically to the Oliver Evans flour mill patent. In addition to its legal significance, the opinion is notable for containing in its appendix a transcript of the Evans patent and patent application, otherwise unavailable to the modern reader. Background Evans' hopperboy and automated bolting process. In the 1780s, inventor Oliver Evans developed a system for an automated flour mill that would revolutionize milling technology. After keeping his invention a secret while he reduced it to practice, he initially obtained protection for it through individual state statutes, for example in Maryland and New Hampshire, because the patent system did not yet exist. When the Patent Act of 1790 took effect, Evans obtained the third United States patent ever issued. No copies of this original patent are extant. As all patents at the time had 14-year terms, his patent lapsed in 1804, and the invention entered the public domain. Immediately upon the expiration of his patent, he sought a private bill that would allow him to renew it, the first such request ever made. He was unsuccessful until 1808, when the Tenth Congress passed a law authorizing the Secretary of State to grant him a new patent on the same terms as the original one.\\"An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans\\", 6 Stat. 70. Evans obtained his new patent the day after the law took effect.Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872, 872 (C.C.D. Va. 1813). Under the Patent Act of 1793, which was in effect at the time of the 1808 grant, patents were not required to have claims. In the case of complex patent such as Evans', which included both a general improved method of manufacturing flour and specific improved machines for achieving that method, this created confusion as to the actual scope of grant. By the same token, it also created confusion as to the kind of prior art that would suffice to invalidate the patent on the basis of anticipation. In the district court for Pennsylvania, the defendant Eaton did not dispute having used Evans' improved hopperboy, but sought to show either that the patent only covered the improved method as a whole (and not the hopperboy specifically), or alternatively that the patent had been anticipated by earlier machines. In particular, the defendant introduced evidence of a crude kind of hopperboy that was in use at some mills in Pennsylvania in the 1760s. Persuaded that the patent could only cover the improved method as a whole, rather than any of the improved machines, the court instructed the jury in such a way that the jurors had no choice but to return a verdict for the defendant, as they did. The court also declined to admit the plaintiff's proffered evidence that the defendant had initially offered to pay a license fee to Evans. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court on a writ of error, with Evans alleging the following errors: # That the district court should have admitted the plaintiff's evidence that the defendant's witnesses had paid the license fee, thus implicitly conceding the validity of the patent; # That the district court should not have admitted evidence of the use of the hopperboy in other locations not specified in the defendant's pleading; # That the district court should not have instructed the jury that Evans was not entitled to damages for infringement unless he was the original inventor of the hopperboy. Opinion of the Court The Court unanimously rejected the district court's judgment, and remanded the case for a new trial under a venire facias de novo. The opinion was authored by Chief Justice Marshall. The Court accepted the first ground of error and rejected the second, in both cases preferring to put the evidence before the jury. The Court noted however that the evidence of witnesses having paid the license fee was entitled to \\"very little weight.\\"16 U.S. at 505. On the main issue, regarding the district court's instructions to the jury, the Court agreed that the district court had erred in two respects: first, in opining that the patent covered only the improvement in manufacture \\"produced by the general combination of all his machinery\\", and not the individual machines used; and second, in instructing the jury that Evans could not recover unless he was the original inventor of the hopperboy rather than an improver.16 U.S. at 519. Fatefully, however, the Court observed that > In all cases where his claim is for an improvement on a machine, it will be > encumbent on him to show the extent of his improvement, so that a person > understanding the subject may comprehend distinctly in what it consists.16 > U.S. at 518. Subsequent developments The case was retried in the district court of Pennsylvania, with the jury once again returning a verdict for the defendant. The verdict turned on the judge's instruction that the jury should not find for the plaintiff unless there was clear evidence within the patent (including the annexed schedule and application) as to the exact nature of Evans' improvements on the prior art. Since the patent had not been drafted with such a requirement in mind, and merely described his invention without distinguishing it from the prior art, there was essentially no question left for the jury to decide. The next year, Evans published a pamphlet arguing his side of the case, with particular attention to the court rejecting his evidence on novel grounds. He also once again appealed to the Supreme Court on a writ of error, but his appeal was rejected by a closely divided Court in Evans v. Eaton (1822) -- although by that time, he was dead and the patent had expired. The confusing arising about the scope of the claimed invention in this case led in part to the Patent Act of 1836, which introduced the requirement of a separate claims section for all patents.Westlaw, Patent Claims ¬ß 4:1 (3rd ed.) That requirement in turn made the specific legal analysis in this case largely obsolete. However, the case continued to be cited for the general principle that a patentee need not be aware of a previous use in order for that previous use to render the patent invalid.Gayler v. Wilder, 51 U.S. 477, 488, 13 L. Ed. 504 (1850).John Burke, Examining the Constitutionality of the Shift to \\"First Inventor to File\\" in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, 39 J. Legis. 69, 87 (2013). The case was most recently cited by the Supreme Court in 1934, to support the general principle that \\"the prize of an exclusive patent falls to the one who had the fortune to be first.\\"Radio Corp. of Am. v. Radio Eng'g Labs., 293 U.S. 1, 55 S. Ct. 928, 79 L. Ed. 163 (1934).

Description The diademed amazon grows to a length of about . It is a largely green bird with glimpses of red and black; many of the feathers are margined with contrasting colours giving a finely scalloped effect. The crown, nape and neck, breast and belly are green while the forehead, lores and cere are red. This red colour does not extend above the eye in a superciliary streak. The primary wing feathers are dusky black and the secondaries bluish- green; the base of the first five secondaries are red, giving a flash of red colour during flight. The tail is green with the side feathers being tipped yellowish-green, with red at the base. The beak is dark grey and the bare skin surrounding the eye is white. The iris is orange and the legs and feet are pale grey. Distribution The diademed amazon is endemic to the Amazon basin in northern Brazil; its range is restricted to the lower part of the Rio Negro and the upper part of the Amazon River in the state of Amazonas. It is found in a variety of lowland forest habitats as well as areas containing scattered trees and plantations. In the Adolfo Ducke Forest Reserve, near Manaus, it is common in the canopy of the humid forest and around the woodland margins. It also occurs in the Ja√∫ National Park where it is uncommon. Ecology The species feeds mostly on fruits and nuts. Its behaviour is probably similar to the red-lored amazon, with birds roosting communally outside the breeding season, with daily flights to feeding areas, where the birds forage in the canopy and are well-camouflaged. Status This species has a limited range and is threatened by habitat loss caused by the forests where it lives being cleared for cattle farming and soybean production. Some birds are caught by trapping for the domestic pet trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the bird's conservation status as \\"endangered\\".

This butterfly can live in grasslands. The upperside of the butterfly is brown with orange spots and on its underside the chequered skipper is orange with brown spots. Chequered skippers are found in Great Britain and other European regions, but seen locally in Japan and in North America. In North America the chequered skipper is known as the arctic skipper. The size of the chequered skipper ranges from 19 to 32 mm with females being larger. In the 1970s, the chequered skipper went extinct in England due to the new management of the woodlands. Description This butterfly has a wingspan of 29 to 31 mm. The uppersides of chequered skippers are dark brown with orange scales at the base of the wings and golden spots, giving it its English name of chequered skipper. The basic pattern on the underside is similar but the forewings are orange with dark spots, and the hindwings are russet with cream spots rimmed in black. The sexes are similar although females are generally slightly larger. Distribution In Britain, the chequered skipper was formerly resident in England and Scotland. Now, the chequered skipper is only found in western Scotland. A programme is under way to reintroduce the species to England. The butterfly has also reached parts of Japan but faces threats there. In North America the chequered skipper is also known as the arctic skipper and is found in the northern coasts and expands to central Alaska. The chequered skipper can be seen in central California. The chequered skipper has been seen along the coasts of Canada. It is generally considered a woodland butterfly and breeds in and around damp woodland, favoring clearings and woodland paths and seems to have a particular attraction to blue woodland flowers. British population The chequered skipper has been extinct in England since 1976 but has stable populations in western Scotland. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly to England were started in the 1990s. It was previously widespread in the Midlands, with isolated populations as far south as Devon and Hampshire. It is thought that the cessation of coppicing in English woodlands is the main cause of its extinction. It was only discovered in Scotland in 1939 where it was found in grassland on the edges of open broad-leaved woodland. In May 2018, 50 individual chequered skippers are to be reintroduced to Rockingham Forest in Northamptonshire by a Butterfly Conservation led Back from the Brink project.http://www.smallholder.co.uk/news/16235051.Butterfly_extinct_for_42_years_to_be_reintroduced_to_England/ Habitat Though the chequered skipper is a woodland butterfly it can also be found in bogs, at the edges of streams, and at grassy forest openings in both Great Britain and northern parts of the United States. Chequered skippers can breed in open grasslands in Scotland. In woodland areas the breeding sites happen at the edges of rivers and the bottom of slopes. Though there is a small range in the areas the butterfly can live in, these areas tend to have a smaller range in seasonal and temperature range. The presence of the M. caerulea is really important in determining habitat in Scotland and in England the Bromus is essential. In North America, chequered skippers can be found around forest trails, forest edges, and open grassy areas. Even though the chequered skipper goes by arctic skipper it does not live in Arctic areas. Home range and territoriality Males defend territories and intercept passing females from favored perches. This behavior tends to occur when there are concentrations of females, larvae, or food plants. The area where the butterflies place the larvae are in between woodland soils and peats. Chequered skippers set up home close to nectar sources. However, they are careful to not let their territory attract other males. When it is flight season males are known to spread their home farther away from each other. Food resources Caterpillars By laying her eggs in a nitrogen-rich environment, the female increases her offspring's chances of finding food. The amount of nitrogen in the plant can change, however, so the outcome of her initial deposition is determined by various environmental factors. Caterpillars in response change their behavior by eating from different parts of the plant depending on the nitrogen availability. Their preferred diet includes leaves of the plants M. caerulea and Bromus, and the caterpillar's fitness is affected by the nutrients that the plants are growing in. North American caterpillars feed on the purple reedgrass, Calamagrostis purpurascens and other native grasses. Adults Seeing that the chequered skipper is an active butterfly and can travel long distances it needs to keep its energy stores filled. Since the chequered skipper lives an active lifestyle it needs to stay in nectar-rich sources. In North America the adults are eating from flower's nectar and they include wild iris and Jacob's ladder. Parental care Males defend territories and intercept passing females from favored perches. This behavior tends to occur when there are concentrations of females, larvae, or food plants. The area where the butterflies place the larvae are in between woodland soils and peats. Chequered skippers set up home close to nectar sources. However, they are careful to not let their territory attract other males. When it is flight season males are known to spread their home farther away from each other. Life history The life cycle of the chequered skipper starts in early June and ends slightly before the July of the following year.Article in the Online Journal of Lepidoptera This species of butterfly is single brooded. Egg Eggs are singly laid, 20‚Äì30 cm above the ground, on the upperside leaf blade of Molinia caerulea or purple moor grass. The eggs are tiny, white, and dome- shaped. The eggs are laid in early June and it takes two to three weeks before it hatches. Caterpillar Immediately after the egg hatches, the larva begins to make its own shelter by rolling a leaf blade with silk into the shape of a tube. It leaves the shelter to eat surrounding leaves. The caterpillar molts five times before it is ready to pupate. In between the molting the caterpillar makes a new shelter to accommodate for its growing size. This process is from July to September. By the end of September the caterpillar makes one more shelter using two or three blades of M. caerulea and then hibernates; it comes back out in early spring. The caterpillar is no longer eating by April and begins to pupate, but before it pupates it can wait up to a week. Pupa Pupation occurs on the ground by the bases of tussocks. Six weeks later a butterfly comes out of the pupa. Adult Around the middle of May the adult has emerged from its pupa. The females and the males mate, then the females lay the eggs on the M. caerulea. Butterflies can be seen before dawn and even after dusk. Migration These butterflies fly around spring time when there are lower temperatures and stay in the cooler and unpredictable climate that is Scotland. How far they fly is based on the amount of resources and the adequate habitat that there is. Enemies There are no known enemies of the chequered skipper. However, changes in their woodland habit decrease their population size. This decrease in population size is due to the decline of coppicing, which is the cutting of trees close to the base and allowing regrowth to happen. New management of the chequered skippers' habitat also plays a role in its survivability. Chequered skippers' populations decreased in England due to coppicing coming to a halt in the 1950s. By 1976, they were only found in Scotland.  Mating  According to Ravenscroft's study, male chequered skippers are territorial and will determine where mating occurs as they decide optimal places to live. Most males find multiple perches, that they guard to catch any potential mates that are pass through their territory. Males make short and brief round trips near their territory in order to defend it. Researchers deduced that male decision in mating location was not due to richness in resources, but rather due to varying temperature relations. Females generally gravitate to territories based on this as well. Physiology Chequered skippers are small and because of their size flight is fast and inefficient. When they fly it is almost like they are skipping above the plants. This skipping makes it hard for them to be followed. Conservation Conservation of this butterfly is being called for because there once was an abundance of chequered skippers throughout the United Kingdom, but over time the population decreased, so that they are now predominantly seen only in western Scotland. One important factor that played into this outcome is the overgrazing of the larval habitat by the sheep which decreased the nutrients in the M. caerulea thus causing the larvae to have a hard time gathering the resources it needs in order to survive. The hunting of deer decreased the amount of grazing that is accomplished usually, which causes shrub to form and that in turn results in adult habitats suffering. A new company was managing the woodlands in the mid-twentieth century and it resulted in the deforestation of many areas in the United Kingdom and that also allowed the adults to suffer and find different places to live. In North America, conservation is not required for the chequered skipper. Nature Conservation Act in Scotland protects the chequered skipper. In various butterfly association high priority is given to the chequered skipper such as the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, Butterfly Conservation priority. However, the European status states that the butterfly is not threatened. A Species Action Plan, written in 1996, has a specific way in which it want to protect the butterfly from reintroducing the species into parts of the United Kingdom to denying grants to plant conifers. This action plan was going to be maintained annually.

Throughout his 44-year career, he designed hundreds of buildings, mostly row houses. His work included designs in every quadrant of the city and a large number of his buildings are still extant. One of his works is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Biography Germuiller Row, designed by Germuiller in 1890 Julius Germuiller was born in Washington, D.C., to Francis and Anna Germuiller, immigrants from Bavaria who had moved to the United States in 1850. Francis operated a saddlery and harness business on 7th Street NW in present-day Chinatown, then a neighborhood with a large German population. It is believed Germuiller attended St. Mary's Catholic School. It's unknown whether or not he attended architecture school or who he apprenticed with, but by 1879, he was listed in the Washington City Directory as an architect. Germuiller designed more than 300 buildings, most of which were residential, and frequently worked for real estate developers A. Behrends, Diller B. Groff and James Healy. Germuiller's notable clients included Senator John Sherman and General Abraham D. Hazen. He designed six apartment buildings, though the locations of these buildings are unknown. Germuiller's surviving designs include buildings in Bloomingdale, Brightwood Park, Downtown, Dupont Circle, Georgetown, Logan Circle and Mount Pleasant. The largest surviving examples of his designs are in Capitol Hill and Near Northeast. Several of his buildings are contributing properties to historic districts throughout the city and Germuiller Row, a collection of buildings at 3rd and H Streets NW, is listed on the NRHP. Germuiller retired in the mid-1920s and resided at the Little Sisters of the Poor Home on H Street NE at the time of his death in 1929.

It was built from 1850s to 1960s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999. The site was vacated by the police in the mid-1980s and sold in 1987. The police barracks remained unused for two decades, while the two other surviving buildings saw alternate uses for some years. In 2007‚Äì08, the entire site was redeveloped as a commercial and retail precinct known as \\"The Barracks\\".  History  The site of the former Petrie Terrace Police Depot occupies the southwest edge of a ridge formerly known as Green Hills, which overlooks the former Roma Street railway yards and the Brisbane central business district. The place has been associated with penal and police activity in Queensland since the 1850s. The site was occupied by the second purpose-built Brisbane Gaol from November 1860 until July 1883, and functioned as a police barracks from 1885 until the mid-1980s. Within the former Petrie Terrace Police Depot, the former Police Barracks, opened in September 1939, is a highly visible and prominent landmark in Brisbane. The site was early associated with a penal facility. When Moreton Bay was opened to free settlement in February 1842, the only prison accommodation available was at one end of the former military barracks in Queen Street ‚Äì the remainder of the building was occupied by storekeepers. In the second half of 1847 the former female factory in Queen Street, which had served as an immigration barracks for some years, was refurbished as a gaol. This was a temporary measure until Brisbane's first purpose-built gaol was erected in 1848‚Äì49. However, within a few years the construction of a larger gaol complex was considered necessary. Aerial view of Petrie Terrace Gaol, 1862 By 1856, a gaol reserve had been proposed in the vicinity of what is now Petrie Terrace ‚Äì the area known in the 1850s as Green Hills. The site was considered remote, well-drained, healthy and extendable. In 1857 the New South Wales Colonial Architect provided plans for a gaol to accommodate nearly 100 prisoners at Green Hills. The contract was let in mid-1858 to Andrew and John Petrie of Brisbane ‚Äì their name being commemorated in Petrie Terrace ‚Äì who submitted a tender of . Construction commenced in October 1858, and was completed by September 1860, when the complex was proclaimed as the Brisbane Gaol. The buildings were masonry, and included 2 two-storeyed cell blocks; 2 two-storeyed guard houses containing offices, warders' room and store rooms, flanking the main entrance to the gaol (which faced southeast, overlooking the Town of Brisbane); kitchen block; washhouses; and lavatory blocks. The gaol reserve was enclosed by a wooden fence, which was replaced in 1862 by a high stone wall, constructed by contractor Joshua Jeays of Brisbane. Stone for the gaol wall was obtained from the Woogaroo Quarry. Almost from its inception, the Brisbane Gaol on Petrie Terrace was overcrowded. By 1865, overflow prisoners were being accommodated on the hulk Proserpine, anchored at the mouth of the Brisbane River, and in 1867 the decision was taken to convert the quarantine buildings then under construction on St Helena Island, in Moreton Bay, into gaol buildings. St Helena was gazetted as a prison in the same year, and operated in tandem with the Brisbane Gaol on Petrie Terrace. In 1870 the female prisoners at Petrie Terrace were relocated to the Toowoomba Gaol. These measures afforded only temporary solutions to the overcrowding at the Brisbane Gaol, and in the late 1870s plans for the new Boggo Road Gaol in South Brisbane were prepared. This complex was constructed in the early 1880s and completed in 1883, with the gaol on Petrie Terrace closing on 2 July 1883. The colonial government initially intended that the Queensland Defence Force, which was reorganised and expanded in the mid-1880s following the \\"Russian scare\\" of 1883, should occupy the former Petrie Terrace gaol reserve, along with the adjacent former military barracks, which had been established in 1864 to accommodate a small contingent of Imperial troops, but which had been occupied since 1874 by the Queensland Police Force. However, in 1885 the gaol reserve on Petrie Terrace was divided between the newly established permanent Queensland Defence Force and the Queensland Police Force. The QDF occupied the 1864 military reserve and the northern end of the gaol reserve, the whole of which was renamed Victoria Barracks by mid-1885. The Queensland Police Force occupied the remainder of the gaol reserve on Petrie Terrace, as a police depot and training centre. At this time the former guard houses and a block which contained the chapel, kitchen and workshop, were renovated as quarters and offices for the police, but the former cell blocks were demolished. The police occupied the former gaol reserve for a century, from 1885 until the mid-1980s, although the site was not officially gazetted as a reserve for police purposes until 1901. The re-use of the gaol reserve for police and military purposes necessitated the demolition of the surrounding stone wall, most of which was removed in 1885, although the arched stone entrance gate on the southeastern perimeter remained until the mid-20th century. The stone was recycled and used on various government projects in Brisbane, including the foundations supporting the iron palisade separating Queen's Park (now part of the City Botanic Gardens) in Alice Street. It is understood that the stone base to the surviving fence along Petrie Terrace at the former Petrie Terrace Police Depot, and the stone retaining wall between the Defence and Police Reserves, are constructed from fabric from the 1862 wall. In the 1880s, as the Queensland economy boomed and new districts were opened to settlement, the number of men recruited into the Queensland police force increased significantly. Recruits received a brief period of training at the Petrie Terrace Police Depot, where facilities were strained. Along with recruits, the depot accommodated probationary officers and unmarried officers serving in the Brisbane area. In 1889, the police barracks at Petrie Terrace was described as a very bad barracks, damp in wet weather, without a washhouse or proper earth closets, and overcrowded. Despite the poor conditions, prior to 1901 only minor alterations and additions were made to the depot buildings. Presentation of medals to ex-members of the Queensland Police Force, Petrie Terrace, 1909 (present day Lord Alfred Hotel is visible at the back right) In the period 1895 to 1925 the Queensland population almost doubled. The Queensland Police Force, while not quite matching this growth rate, increased by one third, especially after 1910, when pay and conditions for police officers improved. In the first two decades of the 20th century a number of new structures were erected at the Petrie Terrace Police Depot to accommodate the increase. These included: * a washhouse near the southern boundary of the reserve (timber, 1901, since demolished) * a residence for the Police Drill Instructor at the southwest corner of the reserve near the junction of Roma Street and Petrie Terrace (timber, 1907, demolished) * a dormitory block at the northeastern end of the reserve, near the Victoria Barracks boundary (2-storeyed, timber, 1907, demolished) * a stables building in the northern corner of the reserve, abutting Petrie Terrace and the boundary with Victoria Barracks (brick, 1912, extant) * extensive additions to No.2 dormitory block (the former gaol kitchen and chapel building) at the southern end of the reserve (1914‚Äì15, since demolished) The 1912 brick stables building contained stables for 40 horses, harness room and feed room. The building was E-shaped with external dimensions of . As motor vehicles gradually replaced horses in police work, alterations to the stables building were undertaken in 1927 to provide some garage accommodation, and in 1936 a substantial brick garage and workshop was erected between the 1912 brick stables building and the 1907 timber dormitory block. At this period the 1912 stables still contained 15 loose boxes and 16 stalls. In the late 1930s, following decades of police complaint that the buildings at Petrie Terrace were totally unsuitable for police purposes, the Queensland Government finally resolved to address police accommodation at both the Petrie Terrace Police Depot and the Roma Street Police Station and Barracks ‚Äì the latter erected in 1879, and by 1899 considered inadequate. Early in 1938, work commenced on construction of a new three-storeyed, brick and concrete police barracks at the Petrie Terrace Police Depot, on land formerly utilised as a parade and drill ground. It was intended to accommodate recruits, probationers and single officers stationed at Petrie Terrace, Roma Street, and the Traffic and Criminal Investigation branches in Brisbane. At this period, single officers still were obliged to reside in barracks. When the new barracks were completed in 1939, however, it was occupied only by probationers and single officers ‚Äì recruits were accommodated in the 1907 timber barracks. The design for the new barracks was developed after extensive consultation with officers of the Queensland Police Force, with consideration given to providing commodious quarters for unmarried men, and taking advantage of the prominent ridge site to establish a distinctive and forceful presence as a sentinel building overlooking the centre of Brisbane and to the major arterial road of Petrie Terrace. The ground floor comprised offices, store, armoury, guard room, lecture theatre with folding partitions, kitchen and mess. The second and third floors contained bedrooms, bathrooms, drying rooms, and recreation rooms, and accommodated 100 unmarried officers. The first floor contained 18 two-men bedrooms and 4 three-men bedrooms and the second floor accommodated 18 two-men bedrooms and 8 three-men rooms. Every effort was made to provide maximum privacy for the occupants, and to admit as much light and air as possible. The warm Brisbane climate was accommodated with verandahs and balconies on each floor. The building was constructed largely of fireproof materials (brick and cement and fibrous-cement roofing tiles), and enclosed escape stairs were provided at each end of the building. When the barracks was officially opened on Friday 29 September 1939 by the Minister for Health and Home Affairs Ned Hanlon, it was considered one of the best investments that the Government had made; it would enhance the reputation of the force and give dividends daily in efficient service. The Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland considered that the new barracks represented the new idea in the construction of public buildings, that they were not \\"institutional\\" in their appearance, and that they were impressive in their architectural line and mass of brickwork, and the tiled roof makes the building a prominent landmark. The Police Commissioner, in his report for the year ended 30 June 1939, stated of the new depot barracks: \\"It is at this centre that a member of the Police force receives his early training prior to his admission as a constable, as well as his accommodation in the early years of his official life. Environment has a great influence on the future career of any person, and it is felt that the change in accommodation as well as the increased facilities for training will benefit both the public and the administration.\\" Design responsibility for the new Petrie Terrace Police Barracks was assigned to Raymond Clare Nowland, an architect in the Department of Public Works. Nowland had joined the architectural office of the Department of Public Works in November 1932, and was appointed a senior architect in this office in 1938. He produced the most significant buildings of his career between 1932 and 1942, including the Petrie Terrace Police Barracks (1939); University of Queensland Mayne Medical School (1939); Brisbane Dental Hospital and College (1941); Cairns Government Offices (1935); Rockhampton Police Court (1935); Fortitude Valley Police Station (1935); and Toowoomba Police Station (1935). Construction of the barracks was the first stage of a planned remodelling of the whole of the Petrie Terrace Police Depot and grounds. The scheme provided for a square to the east and southeast of the barracks to incorporate formal gardens, tennis court, residences for senior officers and garaging for cars. In the early 1940s the former Brisbane Gaol buildings on the site, which the police had occupied since 1885, were demolished, the ground filled in and levelled, and a parade ground formed. New garaging was erected at the northeastern end of the site in the early 1950s, but not on the site of the former gaol buildings demolished . It appears that no further structures were erected on this part of the site. The new Petrie Terrace Police Barracks was constructed during an intensive public works building programme undertaken by the Forgan-Smith Labor Government in Queensland during the 1930s, to counter the effects of the economic depression. It was also the first stage of an ambitious building scheme proposed for the Queensland Police Force, which included the demolition of the Roma Street Police Station and Barracks and the transformation of the site into a public square as an extension of King George Square; and new police watchhouse, courthouse and centralised police headquarters buildings in William Street adjoining and incorporating the Public Library (the Library was to be relocated to a proposed new Public Library in Turbot Street). While the Petrie Terrace Police Barracks was erected in 1938‚Äì39, the advent of the Second World War diverted resources, and the remainder of the scheme did not come to fruition. In 1941, just prior to the outbreak of war in the Pacific, a brick building to house the Police Wireless Transmission Station VKR was erected in the southwest corner of the police reserve, on the site of the 1907 Drill Instructor's Residence, which was removed. In conjunction with the wireless station, an aerial was erected at the top of the southern end of the 1938‚Äì39 police barracks. Two-way radio communication with wireless patrol vehicles had been established, and the station was linked to the interstate wireless police telegraphy service. Mechanised transportation and radio communication revolutionised Queensland police practices. During the Second World War, military police attached to the Australian Army, Royal Australian Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, United States Army, United States Shore Patrol, and the Royal Navy, also utilised the police wireless transmission station at Petrie Terrace. The Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy continued to operate wireless patrol vehicles from this station for some years after the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific. The war created other impacts on the Petrie Terrace Police Depot. In March 1942 an observation post was established at the depot, manned by members of the Volunteer Air Observers' Corps, who occupied the billiards room on the ground floor of the police barracks. A Royal Australian Air Force hut was erected in the depot grounds to house the office staff attached to this corps. This structure was taken over by the Police in 1946‚Äì47, principally to house records and stores, but has been removed since. Also in 1941‚Äì42, the surviving stalls in the 1912 stables were removed and the place was converted into a garage. In the immediate post-war years, Queensland Police acquired wireless equipment from the Civil Defence Organisation, which was installed in a number of suburban police stations to receive broadcasts from station VKR. Improvements to the two-way transmission system in 1946‚Äì47 increased the coverage to a radius of Police Wireless Station VKR. In the late 1940s a aerial pole was erected in the Petrie Terrace Police Depot grounds to support transmitting aerials for the interstate police wireless service, which became increasingly important as a police tool. By 1945, the Police were experiencing difficulty in accommodating cadets (recruits), probationers and single officers at the Petrie Terrace Depot. Both cadets and probationers were quartered in the 1907 barracks, and in 1949‚Äì50 this building was refurbished and a separate laundry building was erected for the use of cadets and probationers. Old wooden barracks, 1951 A number of alterations were made to the Petrie Terrace Depot in the 1950s, reflecting the advent of new technologies and changes in policing practices. Brick barracks, 1951 In 1951 Brisbane's Central Communications Room at the Criminal Investigations Branch came into operation, taking over the handling of police radio communications from the control room at station VKR, Petrie Terrace. The new facility, which was intended as the \\"nerve-centre\\" of police communications in Queensland, was linked to the technical services of station VKR by land lines, and staffed by junior wireless operators. Senior staff supervised all transmissions and reception at the VKR control rooms, and operated the interstate radio telegraphy services. In 1953 two tennis courts near the 1907 timber barracks were demolished to make way for a large garage which housed 30 vehicles. In 1956 the bedrooms on the second and third floors of the 1938‚Äì39 police barracks were converted into new office accommodation for the Commissioner of Police and Licensing and Special branches. Cadets and single probationers were still housed in the 1907 timber barracks, but single officers were no longer accommodated at the Depot. Also in 1956 the engine room at the rear of the wireless transmission station was enlarged to house a larger emergency power plant for the station. From 1956 a number of structures at the southern end of the site were demolished to create a large open space which was developed as a parade ground. In the early 1960s the Police Commissioner's and several other offices accommodated at Petrie Terrace moved into the newly opened Police Headquarters Building at North Quay. At Petrie Terrace, the 1938‚Äì39 building was re-converted into barracks, necessitating only minor alterations, and the 1907 barracks was removed. By 1964 the 1938‚Äì39 building contained accommodation for probationers and cadets on the first and second floors, and offices (including Inspector and Sub-Inspector of Police), class rooms and mess on the ground floor. Also by 1964, the transmission and reception of police messages had been transferred from Petrie Terrace to the North Quay building, and the Petrie Terrace wireless transmission station was being used principally for the housing of equipment and for workshop repair rooms. Use of the Petrie Terrace Police Depot as a training facility ceased in 1973 when this function was removed to the Oxley Police Academy, but the Depot continued to serve other police purposes until the mid-1980s. In 1987 the Queensland Government sold the former police reserve and buildings to private enterprise, and approval for re-zoning was gazetted in September 1990. A number of structures have been removed from the site, including the 1953 garage building and several structures at the northeastern end of the site; the former Police Stables functioned as the Underground Nightclub through the 1990s; and the former Police Wireless Transmission Station was converted into a restaurant. The former Police Barracks remained vacant until the late 2000s and suffered a high level of vandalism. The open area to the east and southeast of the former Police Barracks, which contains significant sub-surface material associated with the former Brisbane Gaol (1860‚Äì1883), became a carpark. In 2007‚Äì08, the entire Police Depot precinct, including the three surviving structures in the barracks, stables and wireless transmission station, was renovated and redeveloped as a retail and commercial precinct named \\"The Barracks\\". The redevelopment won UDIA Awards for Urban Renewal and best large Retail/Commercial development The site now contains a Coles supermarket, a range of eateries, bars, restaurants and shops, and the Palace Cinemas at The Barracks.  Description  View of the redeveloped Petrie Terrace Police Depot as seen from the Petrie Terrace (street) outside, 2009 The former Petrie Terrace Police Depot occupies the southwest edge of a ridge which overlooks the former Roma Street railway yards and the Brisbane central business district. It is bounded on the southeast by the Brisbane-Ipswich railway, on the southwest by Upper Roma Street, on the northwest by Petrie Terrace, and on the northeast by Victoria Barracks military reserve. It contains a number of significant elements, including:  The former Petrie Terrace Police Barracks  The former police barracks is highly visible from a number of vantage points around the Brisbane CBD, the former Petrie Terrace Police Barracks is a prominent landmark on a ridge overlooking the Roma Street Railway Yards and provides an impressive presence to Petrie Terrace. The place is important for views to and from the site including to/from Upper Roma Street, William Jolly Bridge and the Brisbane River, the riverside expressway, the Brisbane CBD, inner western suburbs such as from Cairns Terrace, Red Hill and from Petrie Terrace, Milton Road, Caxton Street and Victoria Barracks. Opened in 1939, the former Petrie Terrace Police Barracks is a three-storey brick and concrete building in red face brick with contrasting horizontal banding in rendered concrete. The roof is sheeted with corrugated fibro cement tiles. The main elevation to the southeast is a single range, symmetrical about a narrow, faceted projecting parapeted central entrance. The modest entrance to the ground floor is approached by a set of concrete stairs to a covered entry porch opening into the main entrance lobby ahead. The central block is flanked to each side by verandahs to each floor. The elevation to Petrie Terrace is symmetrical about a hip-roofed projecting and faceted central bay flanked by verandahed wings which terminate in prominent hip-roofed blank end pavilions. The blank ends contain recessed rectangular panels to each floor level giving shadow and texture to the exterior walls. The faceting of the central bay forms a full length oriel-like window-bay suggestive of defensiveness. A prominent roof ventilator is located to the centre of the main roof. The second floor verandahs to both elevations are punctuated by pairs of Doric columns with battened timber balustrading with decorative criss-cross central panels. The verandahs to the ground and first floors have similar balustrading punctuated by solid brick piers. The projecting eaves around the building are timber-lined. Other detailing includes decorative terracotta tile panels to the projecting parapet fronts to each elevation and vertical bands of incised arrows to the concrete door surrounds to the north, south and east entrances. The southwest and northeast elevations are symmetrical about faceted parapeted blocks flanked by two bays of timber sash windows with the verandah ends and the fire escape stair block to the corners. The central projecting parapets to each elevation contain panels of terracotta tiles with a stylised diamond pattern to each tile. The moulded concrete door surrounds to the north, south and east entrances have vertical bands of an arrow pattern to the upper corners. The building is planned about a central staircase opening off the main entrance hall. The entrance and stair treads are finished in different shades of terrazzo. The stair has a moulded timber handrail, decorative timber newels and decorative wrought iron balustrading. The openings to the main stairwell on each level have large decorative consoles. The walls and partitions are of brick; the verandah floors, corridors and staircases are of concrete; and the roof is sheeted with corrugated fibro cement tiles. Internal walls are rendered and painted. Ceilings to corridors and ground and first floor verandahs are concrete. Ceilings to internal spaces on each floor, stairwells and the second floor verandahs are lined with fibro cement sheeting with timber cover strips. On the ground floor, offices and storage open off a central corridor to the northeast, former mess and kitchen area open off a small corridor to the south west and toilet blocks are positioned at each end of the building. The lecture theatre is accommodated in the projecting wing to the northwest opening off the verandah. This room retains the original timber folding doors. The first and second floors are organised about a central corridor off the central staircase. Bedrooms open off the central corridor and have doors with tilting glass fanlights opening to the verandahs. Toilets, bathrooms and drying rooms are located at each end of the building on both floors. On the first floor the projecting northwest wing accommodates the recreation room and on the second floor additional bedrooms. The building was not secured and was subject to continual vandalism and many of the windows and doors were damaged or removed as have a large percentage of the ceiling linings. The internal spatial relations remain substantially intact including the configuration of the bedrooms, lecture theatre, recreation room, bathrooms and drying rooms, kitchen and office spaces. The plain concrete escape stairs and main terrazzo stair remain intact. The verandah posts and balustrading are substantially intact.  The former stables  The former stables at the former Petrie Terrace Police Depot are located on the north-western site boundary line opposite Caxton Street. The building is constructed of single storey brick masonry with a hipped corrugated red Colorbond roof with ventilated ridges. The building, which was partly converted into garage accommodation in the late 1920s and fully in 1941‚Äì42, has been more recently refurbished as a night club. The floor now has several different level changes and the original floor finish is not evident. The render to the interior walls has been largely removed and there have been several partition walls, bar areas, stage areas and toilet facilities constructed within the building. The south western wing of the former E-shaped building was demolished prior to the night club refurbishment with the exception of a section of the projecting eastern wall which survives and contains an early timber framed and clad pair of doors. The voids which housed horse then car washing areas between the wings of the E shaped building have been enclosed together with the area to the south east between the stables building and the former police garage and workshop constructed in 1936. At the north western corner of the building a basement level has been more recently added through the underpinning of the original walls and the addition of a new end wall and contains several different floor levels. Early fabric that survives include the majority of the perimeter walls which are constructed of English bonded brickwork. These walls have arrised corners to openings and engaged piers in the form of bull nosed brickwork to prevent injury. Several of the original openings in external walls are apparent including the bricked in windows to the Petrie Terrace elevation which correspond and provide evidence of the location of the stalls and loose boxes that were positioned along that elevation. Other elements include the roof structure of substantial timber trusses and large timber framed louvred ventilators to each of the ridges. The timber posts supporting the trusses to the central wing demonstrate where the former stalls and timber partition walls were located.  The former garage and workshop  The former garage and workshop constructed adjacent to the Stables building in 1936 is a single storey brick masonry structure with a corrugated red Colorbond gambrel roof with timber lined eaves. It has also been refurbished as part of the nightclub. The floor and ceiling has been relined, the internal render largely removed and window openings in the north western wall have been converted to door openings. The openings in the other perimeter walls survive intact. Remnant masonry internal partition walls to the former office area survive. The building has an infill of bar and food preparation areas, cold rooms and stores.  The former police wireless transmission station (VKR)  The former police wireless transmission station is a brick masonry building with metal roof constructed adjacent to the Petrie Terrace boundary near the intersection of Milton Road. It currently houses the Hog's Breath Cafe and has a large addition of recent construction along its north-eastern side. The interior and much of the exterior have been highly modified. This building is not included within the heritage listing boundary for the entry in the Queensland Heritage Register for the former Petrie Terrace Police Depot.  Other site elements  A wrought iron fence on a stone base runs along the boundary to Petrie Terrace. A gate post remains to the former vehicle entrance to the Barracks from Petrie Terrace with evidence of gate hinges. There is a retaining wall of roughly dressed sandstone, laid in courses, along the boundary between the former police and military reserves, at the northeast end of the site. The former square to the southeast now contains a bitumened open carpark.  Heritage listing  The former Petrie Terrace Police Depot was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Petrie Terrace Police Depot is important historically for its long association with penal and police activity in Brisbane, and is an important component of a precinct of penal, military, and police buildings established from 1860. Within the former Petrie Terrace Police Depot there are elements with specific cultural heritage significance. These include: * sub-surface remnants of the former Brisbane Gaol (1860‚Äì1883), which have strong historical, social and archaeological significance * the stone retaining wall between the police and military reserves, which has aesthetic value engendered by the rustic material, and is important historically as remnant stone from the wall of the former Brisbane Gaol on this site. * the wrought iron and stone fence to the Petrie Terrace street frontage, which is important as remains of the stone walling of the second Brisbane Gaol perimeter, and for its aesthetic contribution to the Petrie Terrace streetscape * the 1912 police stables which, despite late 20th century modification, is still illustrative of its type, has a strong aesthetic appeal engendered by the materials, forms and the interior spaces, and remains important surviving evidence of the nature of police work in Queensland prior to the introduction of mechanised transportation * the 1936 police garage and workshop, which, despite late 20th century modification, is still illustrative of its type, and remains important in illustrating early adaptations to mechanised transportation in the interwar years of the 20th century, along with the impact of mechanised transportation on the nature of policing in Queensland at this period. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The 1938‚Äì39 police barracks is a rare example of urban residential accommodation provided for unmarried police officers in the first half of the 20th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. As the site of the second Brisbane Gaol, the place has the potential to yield information from archaeological deposits that would contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history, particularly aspects of the history of punishment and prisons in colonial Queensland. The now open area to the east and southeast is important as the site of many of the Gaol structures and yards. This area is also important as the grounds associated with the former Police Barracks, accommodating residences for senior officers, garaging, parade areas and tennis courts. The sub-surface remnants of the former Brisbane Gaol (1860‚Äì1883), which have strong historical, social and archaeological significance. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Police Stables, former Police Garage and Workshop, former Police Barracks, former Police Wireless Transmission Station VKR, the perimeter stone and wrought iron wall along the Petrie Terrace frontage to the former Petrie Terrace Police Depot, and the stone retaining wall between the military and police reserves at the northern end of the site, form a cohesive group of buildings and structures, which together contribute to our understanding of the nature of police training and administration in Queensland in the first half of the 20th century.

The patterning of the facades in bands of red facebrick and imitation stone render give the building a lively, defensive quality in a style reminiscent of the Arts and Crafts movement. The detailing includes decorative terracotta tile panels to the projecting parapet fronts to each elevation and vertical bands of incised arrows to the concrete door surrounds to the north, south and east entrances. Highly visible from a number of vantage points around Brisbane City, the 1938‚Äì39 police barracks is a prominent landmark on a ridge overlooking the Brisbane central business district and former Roma Street Railway Yards, and is an impressive presence in Petrie Terrace. The place is important for views to and from the site including to/from Upper Roma Street, William Jolly Bridge and the Brisbane River, the Riverside Expressway, the Brisbane CBD, the inner western suburbs (such as from Cairns Terrace, Red Hill), and from Petrie Terrace, Milton Road, Caxton Street and Victoria Barracks. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The sub-surface remnants of the former Brisbane Gaol (1860‚Äì1883) have strong historical, social and archaeological significance The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Petrie Terrace Police Depot is important for its association with the Queensland Police Force, demonstrating the evolution of work practices and the changing nature of the lifestyle associated with police force employment in a major urban centre. The 1938‚Äì39 police barracks is important as the only building to be realised from an ambitious building program of prestigious police buildings proposed for Brisbane City under the extensive public works building programme of the Forgan-Smith government of the 1930s. The 1938‚Äì39 police barracks is important also for its association with the work of the Department of Public Works, and in particular for its association with the work of architect Raymond Clare Nowland. It is one of the most notable buildings designed by Nowland, an architect of considerable talent working in the Department of Public Works during the period of extensive public works building in the 1930s.

Like Melbourne Punch, it was modelled on Punch of London. History Adelaide Punch had its origin in The Rattlesnake or Adelaide Punch, a fortnightly magazine first published by Haddrick and East on Thursday 24 January 1878. It failed after a few issues, leaving the printers Scrymgour and Sons holding a debt of around ¬£100. Rather than writing it off, they decided to persevere with its production, and momentarily interested D. W. Melville, at one time with the Register, to act as managing editor, but he found it interfered with his lucrative auctioneering business, so they settled on J. C. F. Johnson, of the Register (later M.P. for Onkaparinga). His team included D. M. \\"Dan\\" Magill (ca.1845 ‚Äì 3 April 1916), also ex-Register; William John Kennedy (1848‚Äì1894), headmaster of Mount Gambier and Hindmarsh schools, as cartoonist (also associated with Quiz magazine); and C. R. Wilton, then a promising cadet. The magazine was a considerable success, and went weekly in September 1878. Johnson purchased a half-share from Scrymgour in December that year and assumed the role of managing editor, and in 1879 became sole proprietor, bringing his brother A. Campbell Johnson in as partner. In mid-1880 they advertised for another cartoonist (by this time the proprietors were Johnson and Scarfe); in July Adelaide Punch grew in size, and the type and layout were changed to more closely resemble the London Punch; South Australian newspapers greeted the new format with approval. Around October 1881 Johnson hired Godfrey Egremont (died 1923), once the Register theatre critic, prolific author and embezzler, as editor then in April 1882 sold out to E. H. Derrington,Edwin Henry Derrington (1830‚Äì1899), later MP for Victoria, was owner of the Yorke's Peninsula Advertiser and the Port Adelaide News who appointed Henry O'Donnell as editor and engaged Herbert James Woodhouse (1858‚Äì1937) as cartoonist. This reference names H. J. Woodhouse's brother W. J. Woodhouse as Adelaide Punch cartoonist 1878‚Äì1884. O'Donnell and Woodhouse became owners in early 1884; quality suffered, the wit was gone and by October 1884 the magazine was in trouble; it was purchased by Charles A. Murphy, owner with Charles F. Stansbury, of an erstwhile competitor, the Lantern, and publication ceased.

It was the largest steamboat yet used on river being 140 feet long and 29 feet wide, with a powerful engine that could carry up to 100 tons of cargo upriver against strong currents in the river. Additionally it had a draft of a mere 19 inches, with a full cargo, making it ideal for dealing with the snags and sandbars of the river especially in the low water time of the year.

It was launched there in August 1859. It was subsequently captained by David C. Robinson, a long time employee of Johnson's, who had recently captained the Explorer in an exploration of the Colorado River over 500 miles up river above Fort Yuma to the mouth of Las Vegas Wash (now under Las Vegas Bay, Nevada).

Life  Schmidt began studying Mathematics in 1957 at G√∂ttingen University, studying with Carl Ludwig Siegel who had returned to G√∂ttingen after spending time in the United States during WWII. In 1960 he transferred to Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen where he studied functions of several complex variables with Karl Stein. Schmidt wrote a thesis on analytic continuation of such functions. In 1962 Schmidt began work at TU M√ºnchen with students of Robert Sauer, in the beginning in labs and tutorials, later in mentoring and administration. Schmidt's interests turned toward programming when he collaborated with Hans Langmaack on rewriting and the braid group in 1969. Friedrich L. Bauer and Klaus Samelson were establishing software engineering at the university and Schmidt joined their group in 1974. In 1977 he submitted his Habilitation \\"Programs as partial graphs\\".R. Berghammer and M. Winter (2004) \\"Gunther Schmidt‚Äôs Life as a mathematician and computer scientist\\", Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming 83: 300 to 308 He became a professor in 1980. Shortly after that, he was appointed to hold the chair of the late Klaus Samelson for one and a half years. From 1988 until his retirement in 2004, he held a professorship at the Faculty for Computer Science of the Universit√§t der Bundeswehr M√ºnchen. He was a classroom instructor for beginners courses as well as special courses in mathematical logic, semantics of programming languages, construction of compilers, and algorithmic languages. Working with Thomas Strohlein, he authored a textbook on relations and graphs, published in German in 1989 and English in 1993 and again in 2012. In 2001 he became involved in a large project (17 nations) with the European Cooperation in Science and Technology:about the European Cooperation in Science and Technology Schmidt was chairman of project COST 274 TARSKI (Theory and Application of Relational Structures as Knowledge Instruments). In 2014 a festschrift was organized to celebrate his 75th year.Berghammer, R., M√∂ller, B., Winter, M. (2014) Festschrift in Honour of Gunther Schmidt on the Occasion of his 75th Birthday, Special Issue of the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming The calculus of relations had a relatively low profile among mathematical topics in the twentieth century, but Schmidt and others have raised that profile. The partial order of binary relations can be organized by grouping through closure. In 2018 Schmidt and Michael Winter published Relational Topology which reviews classical mathematical structures, such as binary operations and topological space, through the lens of calculus of relations.  Work  In 1981 he participated in the International Summer School Marktoberdorf, and edited the lecture notes Theoretical Foundations of Programming Methodology with Manfred Broy. Gunther Schmidt is mainly known for his work on Relational Mathematics; he was co-founder of the RAMiCS conference series in 1994. His textbooks on calculus of relations exhibit applications and potential of algebraic logic.  Books  * 1989: (with T.

The event took place on April 5, 2015, in Tokyo at Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan and featured nine matches, four of which were contested for championships. In addition to airing worldwide through NJPW's internet streaming site, NJPW World, the event also aired in Japan as a regular PPV through SKY PerfecTV!'s Sukachan service. It was the third event under the Invasion Attack name. Production Background The event sold out in advance, making it the fastest non-G1 Climax or non-special show to sell out Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan in more than a decade. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter noted that this spoke volumes as the card was in his mind \\"not all that loaded\\" and that none of the \\"big three\\" (Hiroshi Tanahashi, Kazuchika Okada, Shinsuke Nakamura) were in the main event. During the event, NJPW experienced technical difficulties with its NJPW World streaming site, leading to many paying viewers worldwide unable to view the event live. NJPW issued an apology for the problems. It was later reported that the problem was caused by an \\"outside hacker\\". Storylines Invasion Attack 2015 featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Kota Ibushi, who entered Invasion Attack 2015 as the number one contender to the IWGP Heavyweight Championship after winning the 2015 New Japan Cup Invasion Attack 2015 was main evented by A.J. Styles defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Kota Ibushi. This marked Ibushi's first ever shot at the title and the first singles match between him and Styles. Ibushi, at that point a former IWGP Junior Heavyweight and IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion, first ventured out of the junior heavyweight division in the summer of 2013, when he took part in the G1 Climax tournament. After signing a contract extension with NJPW in October 2014, it was announced that Ibushi had permanently switched to the heavyweight division. His first big match as a heavyweight wrestler took place on January 4, 2015, at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, where he unsuccessfully challenged Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Between March 5 and 15, Ibushi took part in the 2015 New Japan Cup and, after victories over heavyweight wrestlers Doc Gallows, Toru Yano, Tetsuya Naito and Hirooki Goto, won the tournament for the first time to earn the right to challenge either for the IWGP Heavyweight, IWGP Intercontinental or NEVER Openweight Championship. Following his win, Ibushi announced his decision to challenge Bullet Club's A.J. Styles for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The match was made official the following day. Another match at Invasion Attack 2015 continued the storyline rivalry between Bad Luck Fale and Kazuchika Okada, which had started at the beginning of the year. After suffering yet another loss against Fale in the opening round of the 2015 New Japan Cup, Okada finally managed to pin his rival in a tag team match on March 15, resulting in a singles rematch at Invasion Attack 2015. New Japan Cup also re-ignited the rivalry between Hiroshi Tanahashi and Toru Yano, with Yano upsetting Tanahashi in the opening round. At Invasion Attack 2015, the two faced off in a tag team match with Yano teaming with his regular tag team partner Kazushi Sakuraba, while Tanahashi formed a new team with Sakuraba's former partner Katsuyori Shibata. The event would also feature a six-man tag team match, where Chaos' Shinsuke Nakamura, Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi take on Hirooki Goto, Tetsuya Naito and Togi Makabe, which built up two more future title matches between Nakamura and Goto for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship and between Ishii and Makabe for the NEVER Openweight Championship. In addition to the IWGP Heavyweight Championship match, the other three title matches at Invasion Attack 2015 also involved the villainous Bullet Club stable. First, Bullet Club's The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) were set to defend the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero). Following Romero's Forever Hooligans partner Alex Koslov stepping away from professional wrestling, Romero announced on March 1 that he was forming a new tag team with Beretta. The team wrestled their first match together for Ring of Honor (ROH) on March 13, which was followed by their NJPW debut on March 22 during the \\"Road to Invasion Attack 2015\\" tour. This marked Beretta's return to NJPW, having debuted for the promotion during the 2013 Best of the Super Juniors tournament. The second title match would see Bullet Club's Kenny Omega defend the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against M√°scara Dorada. After signing a NJPW contract at the beginning of the year, Dorada quickly entered the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship picture by challenging Omega on February 11 and then pinning him in a six-man tag team match three days later. This marked Dorada's first ever shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. The third title match would see Bullet Club's Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson defend the IWGP Tag Team Championship against the ROH tag team The Kingdom (Matt Taven and Michael Bennett). On March 1 at ROH's 13th Anniversary Show, Anderson and Gallows were scheduled to wrestle in a three-way non-title tag team match with The Kingdom and The Addiction (Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian), however, when Gallows was unable to make the event due to travel issues, Anderson was left to wrestle alone and was in the end pinned for the win by The Kingdom. Upon his return to NJPW, Anderson publicly offered The Kingdom a shot at his and Gallows' IWGP Tag Team Championship anytime, anywhere, while also stating that Bullet Club was going to steal Bennett's valet and real-life wife Maria Kanellis away from him. This marked Bennett, Taven and Kanellis' return to NJPW, having worked their first tour with the promotion in late 2014, during the 2014 World Tag League. Event In the first title match of Invasion Attack 2015, Roppongi Vice defeated The Young Bucks to become the new IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions, after less than a month of teaming together. Overall, this marked the start of Romero's fifth reign with the title. In the following match, Kenny Omega defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against M√°scara Dorada. As a sign of the junior heavyweight division's solidarity against Bullet Club, Dorada was accompanied to the ring by six junior heavyweight wrestlers, including the injured Bushi. Despite this, Omega won the match, making his second successful defense of the title and afterwards confronted the other junior heavyweight wrestlers. Omega then stated that after cleaning up Japanese and Mexican \\"garbage\\", he now wanted an American, Alex Shelley, who then entered the ring for a staredown with Omega. In the third straight title match featuring members of Bullet Club, the stable lost also their other tag team championship as Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson were defeated by ROH's Matt Taven and Michael Bennett with help from Maria Kanellis distracting Anderson. In the following match, Hirooki Goto pinned Shinsuke Nakamura to win a six-man tag team match, setting himself up as the next challenger for his IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Following the match, Tomohiro Ishii brawled with Togi Makabe, setting up a future NEVER Openweight Championship match between the two. A.J. Styles successfully defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in the main event of Invasion Attack 2015 The semi-main event of the evening featured the culmination of a rivalry between Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale and Chaos' Kazuchika Okada, which saw Okada emerge victorious with NJPW declaring his recent \\"slump\\" over. Finally, the main event saw A.J. Styles make the first successful defense of his second IWGP Heavyweight Championship reign by defeating 2015 New Japan Cup winner Kota Ibushi. Part of the story of the match involved Kenny Omega, who accompanied Styles to the ring. Prior to joining Bullet Club, Omega was part of a tag team named Golden‚òÜLovers with Ibushi. The two held the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship together, before amicably breaking up, when Ibushi turned heavyweight. In the finish of the match, Omega climbed onto the ring apron and looked like he was going to interfere in the match, but hesitated. Despite not physically interfering in the match, the distraction was enough to jar Ibushi, leading to him jumping directly into Styles' Styles Clash finishing move to end the match. Following the match, Omega looked indifferent to his Bullet Club stablemate retaining his title. The show ended with Okada attacking Styles and posing with his IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt. Aftermath The day after Invasion Attack 2015, NJPW announced that the IWGP Heavyweight Championship match between A.J. Styles and Kazuchika Okada would not be taking place at the following big event, Wrestling Dontaku 2015, as speculated, but instead at July's Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall, giving the title match a rare three-month build. Instead Wrestling Dontaku 2015 would be main evented by the IWGP Intercontinental Championship match between Shinsuke Nakamura and Hirooki Goto, while Tomohiro Ishii and Togi Makabe's NEVER Openweight Championship match would main event a show on April 29. Reception In his review of the event, Dave Meltzer gave the highest rating of four and three quarter stars out of five to the main event match between A.J. Styles and Kota Ibushi, calling it \\"one of the year's best matches\\". He also praised both junior heavyweight matches, giving The Young Bucks and Roppongi Vice four stars and Omega and Dorada four and a quarter stars, and the match between Bad Luck Fale and Kazuchika Okada, giving it four stars and writing \\"Okada has to be one of the best in the world getting this kind of a match out of Fale\\".

He is considered one of the founders of physiological optics, a scientific discipline that studies physiological processes, physical and psychic regularities which characterize the functioning of the organs of human vision.  Biography  Kravkov was born 31 May 1893 in Ryazan in the family of Vasily Pavlovich Kravkov (1859‚Äì1920), an army medical officer. At the time of his birth his father held a rank of a Court Councilor (VII grade of the Table of Ranks) and served as a senior physician in the 137th \\"Nezhinsky\\" Infantry Regiment based in Ryazan. The future scientist's mother, Elena Alexeyevna, n√©e Lukina (1870 ‚Äì c. 1922) came of a family of hereditary gentry in the Ryazan Governorate. From 1903 to 1911 Kravkov attended the First Ryazan Gimnasium. After leaving it, the future scientist was admitted to the Imperial Moscow University, where he studied at the Faculty of History and Philology. From 1912 Kravkov was also a student at the Lydia Schukina Psychology Institute attached to Moscow University and from 1915 worked there as an assistant. The beginning of Kravkov's scientific activity is considered to be his report Objective psychology, its subject and significance, presented to the annual session of the Psychology Institute. The young scientist's abilities were highly appreciated by the Institute's Director, Professor Chelpanov. In 1916 Kravkov graduated from the University magna cum laude with a qualification in experimental psychology. He was left at the University's Psychology Chair to be prepared for the professor's rank. Working at the Psychology Institute (up to 1923) from 1920 to 1932, Kravkov was also a senior assistant of the Institute of Biological Physics of the People's Commissariat for Health of the RSFSR, where he worked under the guidance of academician Pyotr Lazarev. Those years he studied physics and mathematics and also started his own experimental research of physiology of the eyesight. Kravkov carried out an active pedagogical work in Moscow higher institutions: from 1924 to 1929 he was a senior lecturer at the Higher Art and Technical Studios (Vkhutemas), teaching colorimetry, since 1927 he had been associated professor on physiological optics at the Light Technical Department of the Moscow Energy Institute. In 1932 the scientist became professor of physiological optics of the Moscow Energy Institute. In addition to that since 1920 Kravkov had carried on pedagogical and research work in a number of Moscow higher institutions ‚Äî the Military Pedagogical Academy, the Moscow Plekhanov Institute of People's Economy, the State Academy of Arts, the All- Union Electrical Engineering Institute, etc. In 1935, on the basis of a career of published works, Kravkov was awarded a scientific rank of Doctor of Science in Biology with the qualification in psychophysiology of the eyesight. From 1935 to 1938 he was professor of physiology chair of the biological faculty of the Moscow State University. Since 1936 Kravkov had headed the Laboratory of Physiological Optics at the State Central Helmholtz Institute of Ophthalmology (now the Moscow Helmholtz Scientific Research Institute of Eye Diseases), created by him and laternamed after him. At the same time Kravkov headed the Laboratory of Perception Psychophysiology at the Psychology Institute of the Academy of Pedagogical Science. During World War II Kravkov worked in a neurosurgical hospital at the problems of rehabilitation of the eyesight. Since 1945 he had created and had been in charge of the Laboratory of Physiological Optics at the Philosophy Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. From 1946 to 1951 he was professor of philosophy faculty of the Moscow State University. Kravkov was an Academic Secretary (since 1943) and Vice Chairman of the Commission on Physiological Optics at the Biological Department at the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was also a member of the Commission on lightning engineering at the Department of Technical Sciences at the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (1947‚Äì1951). In 1946 Kravkov was elected corresponding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR and Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1947 he was given a title of Honoured Scientist of the RSFSR. On the initiative of the academician Mikhail Averbakh in 1941 an issue of a specialized periodical publication Problemy fisiologicheskoi optiki (Problems of physiological optics) was launched. From 1941 to 1951 Kravkov was its permanent editor. During the decades of academic activity, Kravkov became the author of more than one hundred scientific works. The main of them are Samonablyudeniye (Self-observation, 1922), Vnusheniye (psikhologiya i pedagogika vnusheniya) (Suggestion, its psychology and pedagogics, 1924), Ocherk psikhologii (Essay on psychology, 1925), Glaz i ego rabota (Eye and its functions, 1932), Ocherk obschey psikhofiziologii organov chuvstv (Essay on general psychophysiology of sense organs, 1946) Vzaimodeystviye organov chuvstv (Interaction of sense organs, 1948), Tsvetovoe zreniye (Colour eyesight, 1951). In cooperation with N. Vishnevsky, Kravkov designed and constructed a special device for definition of the normality of twilight vision, that was being mass-produced for the Red Army needs during the Great Patriotic War. Kravkov brought up a number of prominent Soviet scientists. Kravkov died 16 March 1951 in Moscow and was buried at the Danilovskoye Cemetery.  Scientific activity  Kravkov's scientific activity went on from 1916 up to 1951. It can be divided into four periods: the first one, of early creative activity (1916‚Äì1930), that took place in difficult conditions of postrevolutionary coming into being of Soviet psychology; the second one (1930‚Äì1941), mainly connected to investigations in the field of interaction of sense organs; the third one (1941‚Äì1945), chiefly directed to the solution of tasks connected with the country‚Äôs defense during World War II; the fourth one (1945‚Äì1951), that coincides with the scientist‚Äôs work at the Psychology Institute of the Academy of Pedagogical Science, at the State Central Helmholtz Institute of Ophthalmology, at the Psychology Sector of the Philosophy Institute of the Academy of Science of the USSR, where Kravkov kept on an extending research of the interaction of the senses organs and problems of colour eyesight. For this period Kravkov published more than one hundred original research works. Many of them were translated and published in Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, UK, US. Kravkov‚Äôs monograph Glaz i ego rabota (Eye and its functions) was considered the best combined work on psychophysiology of the eyesight. It had four editions in the USSR and was translated in a number of foreign countries. Kravkov‚Äôs wide range of scientific interests included: adaptation and interaction of the senses organs, contrast, successive images, synesthesia, bioelectricity of different levels of visual system (retina, cerebral subcortex and cortex), interaction of macular and peripheral spheres of the retina, induction of retina, electrophysiology of the eyesight (electric sensibility of the eye, lability, electroretinogram), colour eyesight and its anomalies, sensorial classical conditioning, glaucoma diagnosis methods (by colour sensation and by the reaction of a blind spot) and many other items. Kravkov is one of the founders of physiological optics, a scientific discipline representing a synthesis of knowledge about physiological, psychical and psychological regularities that characterize the function of the eyesight organ. He studied the regularities of the functioning of the vision system, central regulation of vision functions, interaction of senses organs, electrophysiology of vision, investigated colour vision and the hygienics of lightning. Numerous experiments carried out by Kravkov, his disciples and colleagues, helped to find out functional ties between colour vision systems, between the sensitivity to red and green colours, and to understand antagonistic relation between them. The same functional dependence was found out in the sensitivity to yellow and blue colours. A relation of assistance between green and blue sensitive systems was discovered. In the years of World War II the themes of Kravkov's researches were linked to the practical needs of the Red Army: he dealt with the problems of observation efficiency, improvement of camuflage, reconnaissance, worked out methods to oppose the eye dazzling by searchlights, methods to fight against snow blinding and the senses organs hypersensitivity.  Family  Since 1920 Kravkov was married to Nina Kolosova (1894‚Äì1985), daughter of archpriest Pavel Kolosov (c. 1853‚Äì1923), bishop of Yelisavetgrad from 1921 to 1923. She was a pianist, later lecturer of the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory. Their son Yuriy Kravkov (1921‚Äì2003), Major General of Medical Service, directed the Nikolai Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital from 1973 to 1983.  Memory  By the order of the Minister of Health Care of the RSFSR Mariya Kovrigina # 616 of November 28, 1951, the Department of Physiological Optics of the State Central Helmholtz Institute of Ophthalmology was named after Kravkov. Nowadays the Kravkov Laboratory of Clinic Vision Physiology is one of the structural branches of the Moscow Helmholtz Scientific Research Institute of Eye Diseases.

The title Nee-Na is an abbreviation of the central characters Neena and Nalini, played by Deepti Sati and Ann Augustine respectively and it also stars Vijay Babu as male lead. The music label was Muzik247. Nee-Na released on 15 May and received mostly mixed reviews from critics.  Plot  Vinay Panicker (Vijay Babu) is the head of an advertising agency based in Mumbai. He is married to Nalini (Ann Augustine) and they have a son. Vijay asks for a transfer to Kochi and moves to Kochi to take over the Kochi branch. He is impressed by the works of a creative director, Neena (Deepti Sati), an alcoholic and tomboy girl in his company. He also learns that she works in her own terms, comes and leaves office at her own will. She does not go along well with her colleagues. Vinay is open to her oddities and which makes Nalini to binge eat. Slowly Neena falls in love with Vinay. During a dance party, Neena asks Vinay to kiss her. Vinay startles and shrugs her off and goes home. Disturbed Vinay comes home and Neena calls. Vinay puts the phone on speaker and tells Neena that he is committed to his wife and is not up for an extramarital relation in the presence of Nalini. Devastated, Neena goes missing for 5 days. Neena attempts suicide and Vinay is called by the hospital staff from Neena's contacts. The hospital staff mistake Vinay to be her husband. The doctor advises Vinay to take Neena to a well known rehab centre at the earliest since she is a complete alcoholic and a young person who can recover. The rehab centre will allow only family members or couples. Vinay tries to contact Neena's estranged family but her father is sick and unable to travel. After telling Nalini and feeling guilty, Vinay decides to take Neena to the rehab centre by posing as Neena's husband. During the course of treatment Vinay starts to develop feelings for Neena. Vinay even approaches Neena. This ashames Neena and begins to distance away from Vinay. She begins to avoid Vinay and tells him, she is in touch with her office colleague Karthik. Vinay who kept a certain integrity in his relationship with Neena begins to be possessive and upset by Neena's approach. Counselor Pearl (Lena) explains to Vinay about Neena's behavior and says she knows that both Vinay and Neena aren't husband and wife. Whatever Neena said or done before coming to Rehab Center was by the intoxicated effect of alcoholism and inebriated father-fixation. After unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with her husband Nalini comes over and accidentally hears this conversation between Pearl and Vinay and understands his feelings for her have changed. When the treatment is over and Neena and Vinay go back to Cochin, Neena asks Vinay to drop her on the way and claims Karthik will come by to pick her to take her home. She also resigns from her job saying she needs to take a break and leave the place for a change in atmosphere. Neena's parents come by and picks up Neena and commends her for leaving Vinay with his family and that is best kind of love she can give to him. Neena deletes Vinay's photos and contact number from her phone. Vinay is hurt and wasn't able to bear the toll and gets drunk and goes home to Nalini and confides in her in an apologizing manner. Nalini remembers what Pearl has told and strengthened her with the insight that \\"In Vinay's life there would be only one woman and that is Nalini\\". In the end it is shown that Neena is in Russia and remembers Vinay lovingly and holds on to his jacket.

Interferon activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to induce transcription of ISGs. ISGs can be divided based on what class of interferon they are activated by: type I, type II, or type III interferon. The protein products of ISGs control pathogen infections. Specifically, type I and type III interferons are antiviral cytokines, triggering ISGs that combat viral infections. Type I interferons are also involved in bacterial infections; however, they can have both beneficial and harmful effects. The type II interferon class only has one cytokine (IFN-Œ≥), which has some antiviral activity, but is more important in establishing cellular immunity through activating macrophages and promoting major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II.

Course and features  The Rock Flat Creek (technically a river) rises below One Tree Hill, on the lower slopes of the Snowy Mountains, part of the Great Dividing Range. The creek flows generally north by west before reaching its confluence with the Cooma Creek just upstream from that creek's confluence to form the Numeralla River (itself a tributary of the Murrumbidgee River), north of the town of . The creek descends over its course. The Monaro Highway crosses the creek near the locality of Milton Park. There is a mineral spring that comes to the surface on the bank of Rock Flat Creek about 16km south-east of Cooma.

The first church dedicated to the Nativity of Mary was built out of cane. In 1611, a stone church and convent was built under the direction of Father Gonzalo del Roble. Restoration of the church's woodwork and improvement of the convent was done by Father Lucas Fernandez in 1711. The church was remodeled in 1749 to 1751 by Father Luis de Nambroca.

She is widely known for her up cycling reconstructive clothing, and her contribution to hip hop and reggaeton style of dress of the early 1990s. Most notably, Berman was pivotal in creating the definitive looks of pop rave, hip hop, reggaeton and gangster style seen in her work with Jodeci, P. Diddy, Heavy D, Proyecto Uno and Michael Jackson. As recorded in Valerie Steele's Fifty Years of Fashion: New Look to Now, Berman is known by many as the \\" Queen of Reconstruction\\", constructing her highly adored blue denim \\"prison\\" suits throughout her career. With Berman's recent 2015 Smithsonian Institution induction in the American History Museum, Berman's impactful contributions in the representation of such style, particularly with Proyecto Uno will be in the permanent collection. Early life and education Born in Manhattan, New York, Berman grew up in the Bronx and at the age of 7, started recycling old clothing. By the age of 15, she was working for notable, steel sculptor, Richard Shore, fabricating welded pieces for Storm King Art Center and Newark Airport. By 17, Berman decided to follow the punk rock movement to San Francisco, CA where she enrolled in The San Francisco Art Institute. While at The San Francisco Art Institute, Berman, furthering her interest in welded Cor-ten steel sculpting, majored in sculpture creation. Shortly after beginning her time at The San Francisco Art Institute, she started her career creating clothes for bands such as The San Francisco Mutants and vocalist, Silke Berlinn. During this period, Berman also attended Berkeley California for liberal arts, participating in Angela Davis's Women's Studies class as a student. Following her time at Berkeley, she returned to New York in 1979. Then in 1979, she met Bruce Douglas, an English bass player with the band Snatch, which included Douglas, Patty Palladin, and Judy Nylon. Berman and Douglas fell in love and shortly, thereafter, Berman joined Snatch as the keyboard player. Playing Max's Kansas City, CBGB's, and The Squat Theatre opening for Nico, Snatch then went to England in late 1979 for a tour, which never took place. Despite the tour not taking place, Berman and Douglas, still in love, decided to marry in London, where Berman worked at The Screen on The Hill Movie Theater. Berman, then, proceeded to be accepted to attend Central St. Martin's. While attending Central St.Martin's, she worked for designer, Zhandra Rhodes and followed the wave of punk via Vivienne Westwood, Malcolm McLaren. Career Continuing on into a turbulent time of the advent of punk rock, Berman pursued her costume design career at Club 57 St. Mark's Place in the East Village. With Club 57, catering to the likes of Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf, Berman created costumes for the musical, \\"Boeing Boeing\\". Additionally, while working at Club 57, Berman worked at FOOD Restaurant in Soho with her co-worker being Cookie Mueller. Following her work at Club 57 and FOOD Restaurant, Berman started creating one-of-a-kind, high-end bustiers that were sold at Patricia Field's store on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. In September 1988, she met Al Diaz at Dogbrothers recording studio on Ludlow St. in the Lower East Side. Al Diaz, being Jean-Michel's writing partner of SAMO, became her common-law husband for 12 years. They traveled immediately to Costa Rica in 1988, and became inseparable despite Al's intense battle with drugs. On return to the Lower East Side, Berman began to dream about creating a thug-gangsta look for the up-and-coming hip hop bands of that moment. She, then, created in her loft on Rivington St., an iconic suit known as simply, \\"The Jail Suit.\\" The Jail Suit was then sold at Patricia Field's store under \\"JoAnn Berman is BOIY KRAZI\\". Immediately after seeing these suits at Patricia's, then P. Diddy, known as Puff Daddy at the time, called Berman to request suits for his new group, Jodeci. She created those suits and sent them to him at Uptown Records three days later. Two weeks later, Puff Daddy requested more. Two weeks after that, Puff Daddy called Berman again and requested they meet at her studio at 109 W. 27th St. for what was known as \\"the surprise.\\" He arrived to her studio with Heavy D. Al Diaz was present as well. Berman was given an order for four jail suits for Heavy D to wear in Michael Jackson's 1992 \\"Jam\\" video, that would soon become some of her most notable pieces. A month later, Michael Jackson's 1992 \\"Jam\\" video premiered on MTV and Berman's career skyrocketed. After the release of the \\"Jam\\" video, her iconic designs, appeared in Paper Magazine, Italian Vogue with Cindy Crawford, American Vogue, and The New York Times Style page. She continued to create looks for the tours of Jodeci, as well as Salt n' Pepa and Proyecto Uno. She even went on to create designs for Joe Public's \\"This One is For You\\" video. At this point in her career, Berman took the time off to travel to Mexico with Diaz, where they camped through the jungles of Chiapas and notably, Palenque, which changed her life. The mysteriousness and magic of Mexico, then, grew to become a huge influence in the development of her aesthetic upon her return to New York. When Berman returned to New York, she focused on taking care of Diaz, exhausting her emotional and mental energy. She had to stop and close her business, BOIY KRAZI. After closing BOIY KRAZI, in 1998, Berman and Diaz parted ways amicably. Berman, then, went on to teach in East Harlem and acquired a studio on 3rd Avenue and 119th St in East Harlem. In addition to teaching, for some time now, Berman had been silk screen printing with the screens she had kept from BOIY KRAZI. Inspired by her travels in Mexico and her day-to-day visuals of the then,rough East Harlem, Latin gangsters, she then met Fabio Anzolin Borges, a student at AMDA who became her best friend. Borges was a Brazilian actor from Florianopolis. Borges and Berman would often spend entire days dreaming of 17th century Brazil and as a result, Berman created and became more passionate with her imagery of re-vamped Afro-Brazilian art, history and culture. Berman then opened her first store, BOIY KRAZI, in 2007 on 112th Street and 2nd Ave. Rihanna was her first customer, whose then single, \\"Umbrella\\", was number 1 on the charts. Within a month, Berman's store was burned to the ground and was under an arson investigation. After this trauma, Berman regrouped and moved to Brooklyn,N.Y. After moving to Brooklyn, Berman with Leonel Logrono, a Dominican sewing machine repairman, whom she married in 2005. She then proceeded to open another store in Williamsburg, BOIY KRAZI'S GROOVI GARDENS. BOIY KRAZI GROOVI GARDENS stayed open from February 2008 to late 2008. Shortly thereafter, Berman opened her third store, Thug Mama, on N4th St. in Williamsburg in 2011. FURNITURE Before her store burned to the ground in 2007, Berman took her textiles and began creating what was to become one of the earliest and most iconic up cycled furniture as art. Using her printed fabrics and old-antique frames of any nature, she began reupholstering furniture and that became her not yet known passion. In 2008, Berman resumed her fashion career in Bushwick in Brooklyn, N.Y. She became the premiere designer at The Green Shows. Berman showed in Fashion Week and received the 2011 Ecco-Domini Semi-Finalist award in Sustainable Clothing. She also received Time Out Magazine's and WWD's Breakout Designer award. Berman sewed, printed and patterned everything herself. Berman also appeared on the premiere episode of Lifetime Television's \\" A 24 Hr. Catwalk\\", which she won. After frustration with the clothing industry and her approach to her clothing being a one-of-a-kind, reconstructed art piece, Berman turned completely to furniture. Her up cycled Chrome chair appeared in the Thanksgiving issue of the 2013 NY Magazine's The Cut's Best Bet. She then appeared on the April 2014 cover of New York Cottages and Gardens for her mini-rock star arm chairs.

It was built in 1839 by Don Antonio Maxino. The house was claimed to be the first bahay-na-bato of the municipality. In 2007, the half- ruined house was sold to Jose L. Acuzar by a remaining family member. Unfortunately, the rest of the Maxinos were massacred by bandits, or tulisan. Architectural features The ground floor of the Don Antonio Maxino house were lined with stone flooring while the flooring of the second floor was made of wooden planks. Each plank measures long and wide. The second floor of the house was surrounded with rectangular capiz windows. Unlike majority of the bahay-na-bato houses, there were no minor window openings, or ventanillas, below the capiz windows. This feature would improve the security of the house. The two paneled door into the living room, or sala, and the bedroom wing was decorated with a sunburst design. The house was surmounted with four-sided, quatro aguas, tile roofing. An intricate system of rafters, or quilo, and king posts support the ridge, or palupo. The ridge bears the dead load of the tile roofing - laid out in Chinese style. In addition to that, there were two types of roof slopes present. These two pairs of roof slopes were built at different angles - providing two air vents at the apex of each sides. The second floor of the house consists of two wings; the principal and the secondary wings. The principal wing consists of a living room, or sala, and bedrooms while the secondary wing consists of dining room, kitchen, and terrace, or azotea. A stone staircase (originally made of wood) was located in between these two wings - leading into the foyer, or caida. This layout of the stairs was in reference to Southern Luzon houses wherein the bamboo stairs were located at the rear portion of the houses. The main facade of the house faces the street while the living room, or sala, was located behind. Its secondary facade is located on the perpendicular side of the street. It consists of the shorter side of the principal wing, the outside stairs, and the terrace, or azotea. Its ground floor is now converted into a Filipino restaurant called the Marivent Caf√©.

History Vietnam War MiG-17s at Phuc Yen c.1966 MiG-21s at Phuc Yen April 1998 Ph√∫c Y√™n, constructed in 1963, was North Vietnam's first modern, jet-capable air base. It was built about north of an airstrip that had been abandoned in the 1950s. On 6 August 1964 the first VPAF jet fighter unit, the 921st Fighter Regiment (known as the Red Star Squadron), arrived at Ph√∫c Y√™n after training in the People's Republic of China (PRC), bringing 36 MiG-17 and MiG-19 fighters. In response to the attack on Bien Hoa Air Base on 1 November 1964 the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) proposed a B-52 strike on Ph√∫c Y√™n, but this was opposed by senior Johnson Administration officials. At the start of Operation Rolling Thunder in March 1965, U.S. aircraft were forbidden to go within a radius of 40 nautical miles of Hanoi, which included Ph√∫c Y√™n, although these restrictions were gradually reduced as the campaign continued. In May 1965 Il-28 bombers were identified at Ph√∫c Y√™n, as these aircraft were capable of conducting airstrikes on South Vietnam the JCS again proposed a B-52 strike on Ph√∫c Y√™n and nearby SA-2 sites, but once again approval was denied for fear that such an attack might provoke increased Soviet and PRC support for North Vietnam or even PRC intervention in the war. By late March 1966 U.S. intelligence indicated that more than 60 MiG-15s and MiG-17s and 15 MiG-21s were based at Ph√∫c Y√™n while crates containing an estimated 5 MiG-15s and 25 MiG-21s were also at the base. In April 1966 the CIA concluded that a small number of MiG-21s had possibly deployed to K√©p Air Base from Ph√∫c Y√™n. On 24/5 October 1967 in response to increased VPAF fighter interceptions USAF, Navy and Marine aircraft attacked Ph√∫c Y√™n for the first time. Post-strike assessment indicated that nine MiGs had been destroyed on the ground and one in the air and that the runway was severely cratered. On 18 November 1967 a Combat Skyspot attack by 16 F-105s of the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing preceded by 4 F-105 Wild Weasels on Ph√∫c Y√™n resulted in the loss of 2 Wild Weasels to MiGs and then some of the bombers to SAM sites that tracked the USAF jamming. In early 1968 U.S. intelligence noted that Il-28 bombers had returned to Ph√∫c Y√™n and three separate airstrikes were conducted against the base in mid- February. One Il-28 was believed to have been damaged in the raid while two MiG-17s were shot down. On the morning of 9 May 1972 as US Navy aircraft were conducting Operation Pocket Money, the mining of Haiphong harbor, radar on the detected three MiGs departing Phuc Yen and heading directly towards the mining aircraft. Chicago launched two Talos surface to air missiles at the MiGs, now away. One of the MiGs was destroyed while the other two returned to base. Ph√∫c Y√™n, K√©p and Hoa Lac were targeted on the first night of Operation Linebacker II on 18 December 1972 to suppress fighters that might otherwise intercept US attack aircraft.

Munn had also been a talented cricketer in his youth, and is one of the few Newfoundlanders to play at first-class level, having played in England for Oxford University. Family and early life John Shannon Munn was born in 1880 in Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, into a prominent local family. The company established by his Scottish-born grandfather, John Munn, owned several boats in Newfoundland's sealing and fishing fleets, and also owned Harbour Grace's newspaper and main store. Following the elder Munn's retirement in 1878, his son (John Shannon Munn's father), William Panton Munn, assumed management of the company together with his cousin, Robert Stewart Munn. William Munn died in 1882 and his widow, born Flora LeMessurier Clift, remarried in 1888 to Edgar Rennie Bowring, scion of another merchant family. Bowring (later Sir Edgar) later became a director at Bowring Brothers (established by his grandfather, Benjamin Bowring), and John Shannon Munn became his protege at the firm after completing his education. Munn initially attended the Church of England College in St. John's (now Bishop Feild College), but was sent to England for further schooling, as had his step-father. From 1894, he attended the Forest School, a public school in Walthamstow, Essex.David Liverman. \\"John Shannon Munn\\" ‚Äì Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador. Retrieved 1 January 2015. Cricket Cricket had become reasonably popular in Newfoundland by the late 19th century, but died out following the First World War. Munn was likely introduced to the sport on the island, and continued playing at the Forest School, where he was a regular in the school first XI. In his last season at the school, in 1899, he took 55 wickets at an average of 13.96. Wisden, in its coverage of public schools cricket, noted especially his performance against Epsom College, where he took a five-wicket haul and scored a half-century to help Forest School to a 220-run victory. Going on to Hertford College, Oxford, Munn played in two trial matches for Oxford University Cricket Club prior to the start of the 1900 season, taking a five-wicket haul in both games. Despite this form, he did not make his debut for the first XI until Oxford's fourth first-class match of the season, likely due to his status as a first-year student.First-class matches played by John Munn (10) ‚Äì CricketArchive.

Instead of playing for a County Championship side later in the season, like many of his teammates, he returned to Newfoundland for the rest of the summer. There, Munn played in the local St. John's league. In late August 1900, he turned out for a St. John's representative side in two games against an I Zingari team from Boston. He took figures of 8/17 in the second of those matches, which was attended by around 1,200 people. Back at Oxford for the 1901 season, Munn performed poorly in pre-season trial matches, but was in the first XI for Oxford's third first-class fixture of the season, against Surrey in late May.

Background In 642 the Sassanid Empire was nearly destroyed and almost all parts of Persia were conquered, except parts of Khorasan, which were still held by Sassanids. Khorasan was the second largest province of the Sassanid Empire. It stretched from what is now north-eastern Iran, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. Its capital was Balkh, in present-day northern Afghanistan. In 651 after Yazdegerd III was murdered by Mahuy Suri, the marzban or administrator of Marw Tabaristan was afterwards invaded by the Muslim Arabs. During Rashidun and Umayyad era Beginning of conquest Oxus River the mission of conquering Khurasan was assigned to Ahnaf ibn Qais and Abdullah ibn Aamir. Abdullah marched from Fars and took a short and less frequent route via Rayy. Ahnaf then marched north direct to Merv, in present Turkmenistan.The Muslim Conquest of Persia By A.I. Akram. Ch:17 , Merv was the capital of Khurasan and here Yazdegerd III held his court. On hearing of the Muslim advance, Yazdegerd III left for Balkh. No resistance was offered at Merv, and the Muslims occupied the capital of Khurasan without a fight. Second phase of conquest Farrukhzad, the previously minister of Yazdegerd, and ruler of Tabaristan, managed to repel the Arabs with the aid of Gil Gavbara and make a treaty with them. The Arabs then invaded Khorasan, and made a treaty with the kanarang of Tus, Kanadbak. In the treaty Kanadbak agreed to surrender and assist Muslim forces while still remaining in control of his territories in Tus. Abdullah and Kanadbak then conquered Nishapur after defeated KanƒÅrangƒ´yƒÅn family Last phase of conquest A veteran military commander, Ahnaf ibn Qais, was appointed by Umar for the conquest of Khurasan, which in those time comprises most of present-day north eastern Iran, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. On hearing of the Muslim advance, Yazdegerd III left for Balkh. No resistance was offered at Merv, and the Muslims occupied the capital of Khurasan without a fight. after that, for sometimes after Umar's death Ahnaf was re-appointed again by Abdullah Ibn Aamir for pacifying many revolting areas including Quzestan and Herat. Reconquest in 654 the Battle of Badghis occurred between the Karen family and their Hephthalite allies against the Rashidun Caliphate led by Abdullah ibn Aamir.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 469 this battle was completed the first phase of Rashidun Conquest in the soil of Iran. Despite initial Arab setbacks and the Turgesh invasion of Khurasan, Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri succeeded in inflicting a defeat upon the khagan in person in the Battle of Kharistan and turning back the Turgesh army. later after Asad's death a few months later, this success was instrumental in preserving Muslim rule in Central Asia, as the blow to the khagan 's prestige led to his murder soon thereafter and the collapse of Turgesh power. At the same time, Asad's conciliatory policy towards the native population laid the foundations for its eventual acceptance of Muslim rule and the Islamization of Central Asia. In 724, immediately after the rise of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724‚Äì743) to the throne, Asad's brother Khalid al-Qasri was appointed to the important post of governor of Iraq, with responsibility over the entire Islamic East, which he held until 738. Khalid in turn named Asad as governor of Khurasan. The two brothers thus became, according to Patricia Crone, \\"among the most prominent men of the Marwanid period\\". Asad's arrival in Khurasan found the province in peril: his predecessor, Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi, had just attempted a campaign against Ferghana and suffered a major defeat, the so-called \\"Day of Thirst\\", at the hands of the Turgesh Turks and the Soghdian principalities of Transoxiana that had risen up against Muslim rule. From the early days of the Muslim conquests, Arab armies were divided into regiments drawn from individual tribes or tribal confederations (butun or ‚Äòasha‚Äòir). Despite the fact that many of these groupings were recent creations, created for reasons of military efficiency rather than any common ancestry, they soon developed a strong and distinct identity. by the beginning of the Umayyad period, this system progressed to the formation of ever-larger super-groupings, culminating in the two super-groups: the northern Arab Mudaris or Qaysis, and the south Arabs or \\"Yemenis\\" (Yaman), dominated by the Azd and Rabi'ah tribes. By the 8th century, this division had become firmly established across the Caliphate and was a source of constant internal instability, as the two groups formed in essence two rival political parties, jockeying for power and separated by a fierce hatred for each other.Blankinship (1994), pp. 42‚Äì46Hawting (2000), pp. 54‚Äì55 During Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik's reign, the Umayyad government appointed Mudaris as governors in Khurasan, except for Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri's tenure in 735‚Äì738. Nasr's appointment came four months after Asad's death. In the interim, the sources report variously that the province was run either by the Syrian general Ja'far ibn Hanzala al-Bahrani or by Asad's lieutenant Juday' al-Kirmani. At any rate, the sources agree that al-Kirmani stood at the time as the most prominent man in Khurasan and should have been the clear choice for governor. His Yemeni roots (he was the leader of the Azd in Khurasan), however, made him unpalatable to the Caliph.Shaban (1979), pp. 127‚Äì128Sharon (1990), pp. 25‚Äì27, 34 Conquest under Umayyads After the invasion of Persia under Rashidun was completed in five years and almost all of the Persian territories came under Arab control, it is also inevitable open a new problems for Caliphate. pockets of tribal resistance continued for centuries in the Afghan territories. During the 7th century, Arab armies made their way into the region of Afghanistan from Khorasan. the second problem was As a corollary to the Muslim conquest of Persia, the Muslims became neighbors of the city states of Transoxiana. Although Transoxiana was included in the loosely defined \\"Turkestan\\" region, only the ruling elite of Transoxiana was partially of Turkic origins whereas the local population was mostly a diverse mix of local Iranian populations. As the Arabs reached Transoxiana following the conquest of the Sassanid Persian Empire, local Iranian-Turkic and Arab armies clashed over the control of Transoxiana's Silk Road cities. In particular, the Turgesh under the leadership of Suluk, and Khazars under Barjik clashed with their Arab neighbours in order to control this economically important region. it was after a heavy works of two notable Umayyad generals, Qutayba ibn Muslim and Nasr ibn Sayyar. In July 738, at the age of 74, Nasr was appointed as governor of Khurasan. Despite his age, he was widely respected both for his military record, his knowledge of the affairs of Khurasan and his abilities as a statesman. Julius Wellhausen wrote of him that \\"His age did not affect the freshness of his mind, as is testified not only by his deeds, but also by the verses in which he gave expression to his feelings till the very end of his life\\". However, in the climate of the times, his nomination owed more to his appropriate tribal affiliation than his personal qualities.Sharon (1990), p. 35 the problems of Transoxiana could be resolved although the Umayyad was on decline and being replaced by the Abbasid During Abbasid era The widespread discontent with late Umayyad was exploited by Abu Muslim, who operated in the eastern province of Khurasan. This province was part of Iranian world that had been heavily colonised by Arab tribes following the Muslim conquest with the intent of replacing Umayyad dynasty which is proved to be successful under the sign of the Black Standard.The Cambridge History of Islam, vol. 1A, p. 102.

The race was the 106th edition of the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. It was the fourth of the 28 races on the Union Cycliste Internationale's (UCI) 2015 World Tour and the first of them to be a one-day race. It was also the first of the 2015 cycling monuments, the five most important one-day races of the year. The defending champion was Alexander Kristoff (), who won the previous year's race in a sprint. The 2015 race returned to the traditional route of the Milan ‚àí San Remo, which had not been used since an extra climb had been added in the 2008 race. The removal of the La Manie climb was seen as making the race more suitable for sprinters. The race started in the city of Milan, travelling to the Mediterranean and then south along the coast. The final part of the race was the most difficult, with five climbs in the last , before the race ended in the city of San Remo, for a distance of . After numerous attacks in the final stages of the race, particularly from riders on the and , it was decided in a sprint in San Remo on the Via Roma, won by John Degenkolb (), with Kristoff second and Michael Matthews () in third place.  Route   Route history and course changes  The route of the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo has varied over the years, with climbs added at various points to make the course harder. The first climb to be introduced was the Poggio, followed by the Cipressa in 1982. The course was made more difficult again in 2008, with the addition of the climb of La Manie approximately from the end of the race. The finish of the course was also moved in 2008 from the traditional location on the Via Roma to Lungomare Italo Calvino. Further changes were planned for the 2014 edition. The climb of La Manie was removed. A new climb, the Pompeiana, was planned between the Cipressa and the Poggio, but was discarded after landslides made it unsafe to ride. The 2015 edition of the race was similar to the route ultimately taken by the 2014 edition: neither La Manie nor the Pompeiana were included. The course closely resembled the route that had been used between 1982 and 2007, with the traditional finish on the Via Roma. The race director, Mauro Vegni, announced that the race would use this route again in future editions, without any extra climbs. He expressed hope that the race would remain \\"finely balanced\\" between sprinters and attackers.  2015 route  Altitude profile of the 2015 Milan‚ÄìSan Remo Milan‚ÄìSan Remo is the longest one- day race on the professional cycling calendar; the 2015 edition was in length. It began in the city of Milan, on the Via della Chiesa Rossa. From Milan, the first part of the route was almost entirely flat, as the course passed through the provinces of Milan, Pavia and Alessandria. There were no significant climbs in the first . As they entered the province of Genoa, the riders climbed the Passo del Turchino, a long and gentle climb with no significant difficulty. The descent, however, was twisting, giving an advantage to the riders who were towards the front of the peloton. The next were again generally flat. This part of the course, in the province of Savona, took the riders along the Mediterranean coast. After around , the route entered the province of Imperia, and the riders faced a series of climbs known as the Capi: the Capo Mele after ; the Capo Cerva after ; and the Capo Berta after . With less than left in the race, a short flat section followed before the riders entered the climb of the Cipressa, where there is always a battle between the teams to position their riders. The Cipressa is , with an average gradient of 4.1%. The summit came with to the finish line. After the descent from the Cipressa, a flat, section of road followed, where there is often a headwind. The final climb of the race was the Poggio, which is long, with an average gradient of 7% and a maximum of 8%; the summit came with left in the race. The descent from the climb used narrow roads and hairpin bends; it required strong bike-handling skills. At the foot of the descent, there were left, on major urban roads. The final turn came with remaining.  Teams  The Milan‚ÄìSan Remo is part of the UCI World Tour; all of the 17 UCI WorldTeams were obliged to take part. The race organisers, RCS Sport, also made eight wildcard invitations to UCI Professional Continental teams, for a total of 25 teams.  Pre-race favourites  As the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo is generally flat and the climbs at the end are not particularly hard, it is often seen as a race for sprinters and is sometimes known as the \\"sprinters' classic\\". The defending champion, Alexander Kristoff (), was foremost among these, as he had a particular aptitude for long races in cold conditions. Mark Cavendish (), who won the race in 2009, was seen as the most likely challenger to Kristoff in a bunch sprint. Cavendish, however, had suffered from a stomach virus in the weeks before the race and was not in perfect condition. Other sprinters expected to have a chance at victory included John Degenkolb (), Michael Matthews (), Andr√© Greipel (), Arnaud D√©mare (), Ben Swift () and Peter Sagan (). The other likely scenario was that a small group of riders would break away over the final climbs, most probably on the Poggio, and be able to hold off the chase from the group behind. Fabian Cancellara (), who won the race in 2008 and had finished on the podium for the last four years, was considered the most likely rider to win the race in this scenario. Peter Sagan was also believed to have a good chance of victory, since he was thought to have the ability and form to win the race from a breakaway as well as a bunch sprint. Other riders who could win the race from a breakaway included Greg Van Avermaet () and Sep Vanmarcke (). Although Cavendish was not in perfect form, his had other riders capable of victory: Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar and Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski, the 2014 world champion, had the potential to attempt an attack in the final part of the race.  Report   Early stages  The race began in wet and cold conditions in Milan. Four riders formed a breakaway shortly after the beginning of the race: Jan Barta (), Sebastian Molano (), Andrea Peron () and Maarten Tjallingii (). They were joined shortly afterwards by Marco Frapporti, Tiziano Dall'Antonia (both ), Matteo Bono (), Serge Pauwels (), Adrian Kurek (), Stefano Pirazzi () and Julien B√©rard (). After , they had a lead of over 10 minutes. and were among the teams leading the peloton; their efforts reduced the gap to seven minutes after . As the breakaway passed over the Passo del Turchino, about halfway through the race, they had a lead of five minutes. The gap was briefly as low as four minutes, but was generally held at about five minutes until there were about left to race. As the riders arrived on the Mediterranean coast, the weather conditions improved, with the rain stopping and the roads drying out.  Tre Capi and the Cipressa  With remaining, as the riders climbed the Capi climbs, the breakaway's lead was reduced to three minutes; this was reduced again to 90 seconds over the next . The leading group was breaking up during these climbs, leaving Pirazzi and Bono at the front of the race. were the main team controlling the peloton at this point, especially as the climb crossed the Capo Berta. Luke Rowe was leading the group, with Geraint Thomas, Ben Swift and Salvatore Puccio immediately behind. On the descent from the Capo Berta, Puccio crashed and brought down several riders behind him, including Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar () and Christopher Juul Jensen (), whose crash resulted in a bloodied face. Following Puccio's crash, Rowe, Thomas and Swift had a gap ahead of the peloton. Rowe continued to drive the three-man group of riders and they caught the remainder of the original breakaway, with Bono the last to be caught. Several riders bridged across to the Sky group, including ≈†tybar and Greg Van Avermaet (), while kept up a fast pace in the peloton. As the riders reached the foot of the Cipressa climb, the groups came back together. At this point, Arnaud D√©mare () crashed. On the climb, 's Lars Petter Nordhaug and 's Julian Arredondo set the pace and caused difficulty for several of the sprinters, including Alexander Kristoff (), Mark Cavendish () and Nacer Bouhanni (). Cavendish had a mechanical problem during the climb ‚Äì the same slipped-chain problem that he had suffered in stage 2 of the Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico. He had to put in significant effort to stay with the group on the Cipressa, which meant that he was unable to contest the later stages of the race. On the descent from the Cipressa, Filippo Pozzato () put in a brief, unsuccessful attack. Soon afterwards Daniel Oss () attacked and was followed by Geraint Thomas. Oss and Thomas built a lead ahead of the main group. With to the finish line, they were 30 seconds ahead. After some hesitation, the lead was cut down by the pack behind, initially led by Jos√© Serpa (), then by riders from and . The pack was 17 seconds behind at the foot of the Poggio climb.  Poggio and San Remo  John Degenkolb () won the 2015 Milan‚ÄìSan Remo in the sprint (photographed here at the 2015 Paris‚ÄìNice). On the Poggio, Thomas attacked alone. Luca Paolini () was leading the peloton, although he was unable to reduce Thomas's lead. Eventually, attacks came from Philippe Gilbert () and, more tellingly, his teammate Van Avermaet. Van Avermaet's attack was followed by Julian Arredondo, Peter Sagan () and Michael Matthews (). Van Avermaet and Thomas were together at the top of the climb, a few seconds ahead of the second group; the peloton were a further few seconds back. On the descent from the Poggio Philippe Gilbert crashed, causing the crash of several other riders. These included Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski (), Gerald Ciolek () and ≈†tybar. Kwiatkowski said after the race that his helmet had saved his life in the crash. Van Avermaet and Thomas were caught soon after the summit of the Poggio, with one reduced group coming into the finish. Thomas continued at the front of the group, bringing back another attack from Van Avermaet and attempting to lead out Ben Swift, but he was exhausted from his earlier efforts in several breakaways. As no rider were able to escape from the front group in the final part of the race, a group came together into the finishing straight. Paolini attempted to lead out Kristoff, as he had done a year earlier. Kristoff launched his sprint with remaining, but was tired after a long day's racing and was unable to maintain his speed to the finishing line. John Degenkolb () came around him in the final to take the race win, the first monument win of his career. Kristoff finished second, while Matthews beat Sagan to third place.  Results   Post-race analysis   Reactions  After the race, Degenkolb contrasted his tears of frustration at his eighteenth place in the 2014 race to the tears of joy that followed his victory in 2015. He attributed his win in part to the fact that he was not seen as a favourite, and he gave credit to his teammates Bert De Backer and Tom Dumoulin for their assistance during the race. Degenkolb described it as \\"the best day in [his] cycling career\\", as it was his first victory in one of the cycling monuments (he won a second in April in the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix). Kristoff, meanwhile, expressed disappointment with his second-place finish and his failure to defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell at the front of the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.  UCI World Tour rankings  Thanks to the 100 points won in the race, Degenkolb moved into fourth place in the UCI World Tour rankings. His total of 102 points left him 96 points behind the leader, Richie Porte (). Matthews and Kristoff also moved into the top ten. and Australia retained their leads in the teams and nations rankings.

It took place on 27 March and was the sixth race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The defending champion was Peter Sagan (), who won the 2014 edition in a four- man sprint. The race, while important in its own right as part of the spring classics season, is seen as an important part of riders' preparation for 2015 Tour of Flanders, one of the cycling monuments that takes place on many of the same roads the following week. The E3 Harelbeke takes place on roads in Flanders, starting and ending in the town of Harelbeke. The primary difficulty in the race is the series of short climbs known as hellingen, some of which are cobbled; most of these came in the middle part of the race, with a fairly flat final part. The key move of the race was made on the Oude Kwaremont by Geraint Thomas (), Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar () and Peter Sagan. The three riders rode together for over , maintaining a gap to the chasing peloton. With approximately remaining, Thomas attacked and was able to take a solo victory. He became the first British rider to win the race. ≈†tybar chased and was able to take second place, but Sagan was caught by the main peloton. ≈†tybar's teammate Matteo Trentin won the bunch sprint for third place. The other major feature of the race was a succession of crashes. Sep Vanmarcke () slipped on the Paterberg, though this resulted in nothing worse than a broken shoe; however, a major crash early in the race caused significant problems for a number of riders. The worst affected was Fabian Cancellara (), one of the major favourites for victory; he broke two vertebrae, ruling him out of the remainder of the classics season.  Poster controversy  The controversial poster issued before the race About a month before the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers published a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? (\\"Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?\\"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race. The poster caused significant controversy, especially as the 2011 race had also featured a poster viewed as sexist. The 2015 poster was described as \\"demeaning\\" and \\"misogynistic\\". The poster was criticised by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and by the Belgian Jury of Advertising Ethics. In March, a few weeks before the race was held, the poster was withdrawn and replaced.  Route  The 2015 edition of the E3 Harelbeke was in length. It started in the Belgian municipality of Harelbeke, where there was a neutral zone before the official start. Initially, the route headed north, but after a short distance it turned south- east to reach the town of Avelgem after . The route then turned north-east through Oudenaarde and reached the first climb, the Katteberg, after . The route briefly went south-east again to reach the second climb, the Leberg, later. Between the Katteberg and the Leberg, there were two flat sections of cobbles, the Holleweg and the Haaghoek. The race then entered a long loop without any significant climbs, though it did include the Paddestraat, another flat section of cobbles. This loop first went north-east, reaching Burst after , then south to Appelterre-Eichem. The loop turned west at this point, travelling through Geraardsbergen after . Route of the 2015 E3 Harelbeke The third climb came after at La Houppe. This was the longest climb of the day at . The course then turned north to reach the Berg Stene climb after . The next four climbs came in quick succession over the next : the Boigneberg, the Eikenberg (the first of the cobbled climbs), the Stationberg and the Taaienberg. A flat section followed, as the course travelled south-west through Ronse, before a turn to the north to tackle the next climb. This was the Knokteberg, which came after , and it was followed by another turn to the east and the climb of the Hotondberg after . The Rotelenberg (after ) and the Kortekeer (after ) were the next two climbs as the route again approached Oudenaarde. After turning south at Leupegem, there were remaining. With remaining, the riders climbed the Kapelberg. The next section was expected to be the key part of the race: the climbs of the Paterberg and the Oude Kwaremont. The Oude Kwaremont was the final cobbled climb of the day; at the top of the climb there were left to the end of the race. In past editions of the race this was the section where a decisive breakaway was formed; the combination of the two climbs is also a major feature of the Tour of Flanders. The route continued south to the penultimate climb of the day, the Karnemelkbeekstraat, with remaining, then turned north-west for the final part of the race. This section was mostly flat; the only climb was the Tiegemberg with to the finish line. It was expected that riders dropped in the hilly section of the course would try to regain contact on this section. The route continued west and finished where it had started in Harelbeke.  Teams  As the E3 Harelbeke is a UCI World Tour event, all 17 UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and were obliged to send a squad. Seven Professional Continental teams received wildcard invitations.  Pre-race favourites  's Peter Sagan (pictured at the 2015 Tour de France) was a leading contender to win the race. The E3 Harelbeke is part of the spring classics season. It is therefore suited to the riders who ride in the several other similar races through the early part of the season, such as the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, the Tour of Flanders and the Dwars door Vlaanderen, which are often raced over the same roads. The winner of the 2014 E3 Harelbeke, Peter Sagan () was one of the major pre-race favourites, although his early-season form had been mixed and he had won just one race so far in the year. The team's preparation for the race was also affected by the suspension of the team manager, Bjarne Riis, by the owner Oleg Tinkov, following the team's poor results. The other principal favourite was Fabian Cancellara (), who won the race in 2013, 2011 and 2010. Although he too had had a relatively unsuccessful Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, finishing seventh, he had shown good form in other races in the season. However, one of his most important teammates, Stijn Devolder, crashed in the Dwars door Vlaanderen earlier in the week, potentially affecting Cancellara's chances. The team was also expected to feature in the race. Although Tom Boonen, the leader of the team and a five-time winner of the race, had crashed at Paris‚ÄìNice and was absent with injury, the team had several other riders who could compete for the win. These included Niki Terpstra, who was second in 2014, Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar and Stijn Vandenbergh. Other favourites included Greg Van Avermaet (), Sep Vanmarcke (), Alexander Kristoff () and Ian Stannard and Geraint Thomas (both ). Nairo Quintana () also entered the race as he had the Dwars door Vlaanderen; he was preparing for cobbled stages at the Tour de France rather than competing for the win.  Race report   Early stages  The race started without Filippo Pozzato (), the 2009 champion, who missed the race due to illness. Shortly after the start, a breakaway was formed by six riders. These were Sjoerd van Ginneken (), Sean De Bie (), Dries Devenyns (), S√©bastien Turgot (), Kristian Sbaragli () and Andrea Dal Col (). The first significant event took place on the Haaghoek cobbles after about . A water bottle came loose and caused a large crash in the main peloton. A large number of riders crashed, including Fabian Cancellara (), Sebastian Langeveld (), Robert Wagner (), Lars Boom () and John Degenkolb (). Most of the riders were able to continue, but Cancellara, one of the favourites to win the race, was forced to abandon it in significant pain. It was immediately clear that he would miss Gent‚ÄìWevelgem; soon afterwards it was announced that he had two broken vertebrae and would miss the rest of the spring classics season. Over the next , the breakaway continued to build their lead over the peloton; with to race, they had a lead of around six minutes, although Dal Col was dropped. Shortly afterwards, the peloton climbed the Taaienberg, where Daniel Oss (), Matteo Trentin () and Matti Breschel () attacked and were soon joined by Tiesj Benoot (). This breakaway was soon brought back by . Nairo Quintana was dropped during this period of racing and abandoned the race. , along with , took up the chase in earnest and reduced the breakaway's lead to under two and a half minutes with left. joined in the chase and halved the lead over the next . Van Ginneken was dropped, leaving three riders in the leading group.  Paterberg‚àíOude Kwaremont  Peter Sagan, Geraint Thomas and Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar lead the race from the Oude Kwaremont climb until Thomas's attack from the finish. The riders then entered the crucial section of the Paterberg and Oude Kwaremont. Devenyns attacked alone from the breakaway group, while Sep Vanmarcke () attacked the peloton. Vanmarcke was riding the climb in the gutter to one side of the road. He slipped in the mud and had to put a foot down on the cobblestones; this damaged his shoe and left him unable to clip into his pedal, reducing his ability to apply power on the climbs. He continued with the broken shoe over the Paterberg and Oude Kwaremont until he was able to change it on a flat section of road. Vanmarcke was in a small group of riders that earned a gap on the Paterberg, but they were caught soon afterwards. At this point there a chase group of around 30 riders, half a minute behind Devenyns as they entered the Oude Kwaremont. Marcus Burghardt () led the peloton on the first part of the climb, until he was attacked by Geraint Thomas (), who was followed by Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar (). After a brief period, Peter Sagan () bridged across to Thomas and ≈†tybar; the three riders then caught and dropped Devenyns. The gap between the leading three and the peloton quickly reached 25 seconds, then was reduced to 15 seconds by BMC.  Final stages  The gap expanded again to 45 seconds at the foot of the final climb, the Tiegemberg; on the climb, BMC's pressure reduced the lead by 20 seconds and dropped several riders from the chasing group. At the top, with left, Oss was leading the group, while Greg Van Avermaet, BMC's team leader, was a couple of places further back. Van Avermaet was riding on the wheel of Alexandr Kolobnev (), who missed a corner and was forced to brake. Van Avermaet also braked; this action caused him to somersault over his handlebars and crash, injuring him and taking him out of contention for the rest of the race. With Van Avermaet injured, BMC were no longer riding at the front of the group and the breakaway's lead quickly grew to 50 seconds, with only 's Luca Paolini leading the chase. The gap was reduced slightly to 40 seconds as the riders entered the last . With left, Thomas attacked the lead group and ≈†tybar waited for Sagan to respond. Sagan, however, was unable to chase Thomas, who built a gap ahead of the other two. ≈†tybar eventually gave chase, but he was unable to catch Thomas. After the race, he attributed his loss to two seconds' hesitation. Thomas continued alone to win the race ahead of ≈†tybar by 25 seconds. Sagan, meanwhile, was both caught and left behind by the main chase group and finished 30th, over a minute behind Thomas. In the main peloton, Matteo Trentin was led out by his teammates Stijn Vandenbergh and Yves Lampaert. Another teammate, Niki Terpstra, was able to block Alexander Kristoff as he attempted the sprint and Trentin took the third podium place, 38 seconds behind Thomas and 13 behind ≈†tybar.

It was the 77th edition of the Gent‚ÄìWevelgem race; it took place on 29 March and was the seventh race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The defending champion was John Degenkolb (), who had won the 2014 edition in a bunch sprint. Gent‚ÄìWevelgem is part of the spring classics season and is known as the \\"sprinter's classic\\", because its terrain is less challenging than most of the other classics. The 2015 edition followed a route that started in Deinze and ended in Wevelgem. The race took place in difficult weather conditions with heavy wind and rain; as a result, only 39 riders finished the race of the 200 who had started. The race was won by Luca Paolini (), who attacked a small group in the final and took a solo victory. Niki Terpstra () sprinted to second place, ahead of Geraint Thomas ().  Route  The 2015 Gent‚ÄìWevelgem was in length, starting in the Belgian city of Deinze, west of the city of Gent, and finishing in Wevelgem. Most of the spring classics centre around Oudenaarde and the many small hills in the nearby region. Gent‚ÄìWevelgem, however, travels west into West Flanders and France and has fewer hills, making it more suitable for sprinters. Route of the 2015 Gent‚ÄìWevelgem After the race began in the Grote Markt in Deinze, the route took the riders west towards the coast; after of flat roads, they reached Adinkerke, southwest of Nieuwpoort, where the route turned south. They travelled another before reaching Roesbrugge and, after , entered the Nord department of France. The first of French roads took them west, before they turned south at Wormhout. The first climb of the day came another later, as the riders climbed the Casselberg. A loop brought them round to climb the Casselberg a second time, though from a different direction. The route then turned east. The final French climb was the Catsberg, which came after . The riders continued east after this and, after , re-entered Belgium at Westouter, on the outskirts of Heuvelland, to enter the key section of the race. This began with the climb of the Baneberg, from the start. later, they climbed the Kemmelberg in the town of Kemmel. after that, they climbed the Monteberg. This succession of climbs was interspersed with steep descents, including the difficult descent of the Kemmelberg. A flat, section of road followed, as the route went east towards Mesen, then gradually looped back west through Nieuwkerke. After this flat section, the riders returned to the same roads that they had ridden previously and repeated the Baneberg‚ÄìKemmelberg‚ÄìMonteberg sequence of climbs. At the top of the second climb of the Monteberg, there were remaining, mostly on flat roads. The route turned north-east out of Kemmel to Ypres, where several cobbled roads were used. After Ypres, the route turned east through Menen and into Wevelgem.  Teams  As Gent‚ÄìWevelgem is a UCI World Tour event, all 17 UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and were obliged to send a squad. Eight Professional Continental teams received wildcard invitations. With eight riders on each team, the peloton at the beginning of the race was made up of 200 riders.  Pre-race favourites  John Degenkolb () won the 2014 Gent‚ÄìWevelgem (podium ceremony photographed) and was among the favourites for the 2015 race. The 2015 Gent‚ÄìWevelgem was without two of the main classics riders, Tom Boonen () and Fabian Cancellara (), both of whom had been injured in races earlier in the spring. However, their absence was not expected to affect the race as much as it would other races in the classics season, such as the Tour of Flanders the following weekend, as Gent-Wevelgem is particularly suited to sprinters. This is because it has fewer climbs than the other spring classics; difficulty often comes from crosswinds on the exposed parts of West Flanders. The defending champion, John Degenkolb (), was the principal favourite for victory before the race. He had won Milan‚ÄìSan Remo the week before and was in good form. Degenkolb is seen as a sprinter, but has good ability at getting over short climbs, having had no difficulty on the Kemmelberg in the 2014 Gent‚ÄìWevelgem. Alexander Kristoff (), who was second in Milan‚ÄìSan Remo and fourth a few days earlier at E3 Harelbeke, was also among the favourites, especially in the bad weather expected for Gent‚ÄìWevelgem. Peter Sagan (), the 2013 champion, was also in form following E3 Harelbeke, and was expected to be able to win either from a bunch sprint or from an attack. The team was also expected to feature strongly in the race, even in Boonen's absence. They were led by Mark Cavendish, one of the strongest sprinters, who had already won Kuurne‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìKuurne, which is similar to Gent‚ÄìWevelgem. Other options for the team included Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar, second in E3 Harelbeke. also brought a strong squad. Their team included Geraint Thomas, the winner of E3 Harelbeke, Ian Stannard, the winner of the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, and Bradley Wiggins, but they were expected to support sprinter Elia Viviani. There were many other riders considered to have a chance of victory in the race. These included classics riders such as Sep Vanmarcke (), Daniel Oss and Greg Van Avermaet (both ) and sprinters such as Andr√© Greipel (), Arnaud D√©mare (), Nacer Bouhanni (), Sam Bennett (), Heinrich Haussler (), Sacha Modolo (), Adam Blythe (), Tyler Farrar and Edvald Boasson Hagen (both ). Moreno Hofland () was also expected to be among the favourites, but he withdrew the day before the race with an illness. Race report The race took place in very wet and windy conditions. This included a headwind in the early stages of the race, which delayed the formation of a breakaway. When the breakaway did form, it included seven riders, who built up a nine-minute lead within the first hour of racing. These riders were Tim Kerkhof (), Alexis Gougeard (), Albert Timmer (), Alex Dowsett (), Pavel Brutt (Tinkoff-Saxo), Jesse Sergent (Trek Factory Racing) and Mirko Tedeschi (). Soon afterwards the peloton was split into groups as riders began to withdraw from the race. The principal difficulty throughout the race was the wind: Cyclingnews.com described the riders as \\"constantly balancing on their bike, leaning into the wind, trying not to be blown off the road\\". J√ºrgen Roelandts () spent more than in a solo breakaway and eventually finished seventh. As the riders entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around three-quarters of the peloton had been dropped or had withdrawn from the race by the time the riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards. Around Cassel, the peloton was again split into small groups by the strong winds. The front group was reduced to 25 riders. Bradley Wiggins was left behind and withdrew from the race, along with Edvald Boasson Hagen (MTN-Qhubeka), who had hit a pole by the side of the road and had broken his clavicle. The front group included Vanmarcke, Thomas, Kristoff and Sagan, with D√©mare, Greipel, Matti Breschel and Van Avermaet joining soon afterwards. On the Catsberg, Maarten Tjallingii () attacked alone and gained a one-minute lead over the main group. Several riders attacked the group but no one was able to get away and they came to the Kemmelberg together. J√ºrgen Roelandts (Lotto-Soudal) attacked after the summit of the Kemmelberg. He initially built a small lead over the chasing group, which was led by riders from Etixx-Quick Step. They stopped chasing, however, after Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar suffered a puncture. This allowed riders to attack the group. Stijn Vandenbergh (Etixx-Quick Step) was the first to attack; he was then joined first by Daniel Oss (BMC) and Thomas, and then also by Jens Debusschere (Lotto-Soudal) and Vanmarcke. Despite their superior numbers, Roelandts was able to maintain his lead; the peloton, meanwhile, quickly fell a long way behind. Riders continued to crash during this period, including Sylvain Chavanel () and Mat Hayman (). Jack Bauer (Cannondale-Garmin) suffered a crash when another rider's rain jacket got caught in the spokes of his wheels; he picked up his bike and threw it into a ditch. With many of the team cars full, some riders asked for directions so that they could ride directly to their team hotels rather than completing the race. Luca Paolini () attacked in the final kilometres to win a solo victory. Luca Paolini (Katusha) attacked from the main group and caught the five chasers, with Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step) doing the same shortly afterwards. While Paolini and Terpstra were chasing, Geraint Thomas was blown violently from his bike, landing on his left shoulder. He landed on the grass and was able to rejoin the group, although he appeared to be shaken by the crash. As the riders approached the Kemmelberg for the final time, Roelandts had a lead of around two minutes. Vandenbergh led up the climb, with Thomas following closely and the other riders struggling. Vanmarcke and Terpstra soon caught up, with Debusschere quickly following. Paolini eventually returned to the group, but Oss was unable to do so. As they crossed the final climb of the day with remaining, Roelandts had a one-minute lead ahead of the six-man group. By this point, Roelandts had led solo for around and was beginning to struggle. He was caught with around remaining. As he was caught, Terpstra suffered a puncture. He quickly returned to the group and immediately attacked, with Paolini joining him. Thomas led the chase, with Vanmarcke and Debusschere looking tired. The six riders therefore came into the final together. With around remaining, Paolini attacked and was chased down by the other riders; he then attacked again and built a gap, which he was able to maintain to the finish. Terpstra beat Thomas to second place, followed by Vandenbergh, Debusschere, and Vanmarcke within a minute and Roelandts and Oss further behind. The main peloton came in more than five minutes behind Paolini, with Kristoff winning the sprint for ninth place ahead of Sagan. Only 39 riders finished the race. Results Post- race analysis Niki Terpstra () finished second after several crashes for his teammates (pictured at the 2015 Le Samyn). There was widespread comment in the media after the race about the weather conditions. Cyclingnews.com described it as \\"mayhem\\" and \\"one of the wildest [races] in recent years\\". Paolini said that he had crashed twice on the way to victory and had used a total of three bikes, but also that he had been lucky later in the race. He said \\"we're up in the north and this is real cycling\\". Paolini pointed at his head and heart as he crossed the finish line ‚Äì the same gesture that he had performed when winning a stage in the 2013 Giro d'Italia ‚Äì and explained the gesture as indicating that such wins required \\"head and heart as much as legs\\". Patrick Lefevere, the Etixx-Quick Step team manager, afterwards described the team's \\"bad luck\\" throughout the race, which included crashes for Cavendish and Martin Velits and punctures for Terpstra and ≈†tybar. Lefevere pointed to the absence of Tom Boonen as a reason for his riders' nervousness. Geraint Thomas felt that the other riders had been looking at him in particular to chase Paolini because of his win in the E3 Harelbeke; he said that he \\"didn't have much left\\" in the sprint at the end of the race. VeloNews wrote that the riders had come close to calling for the neutralisation of the race because of the extreme weather conditions. The winds reached approximately and were so strong that the riders were even unable to form into echelons. However the website also quoted Brian Cookson, the president of the UCI, who described the conditions as \\"very difficult, but not impossible\\" and the race as \\"a real classic\\".

He was born at Shepherd's Bush, London. His death is less certain; in one source, he was living in 1940, the year of his apparent death, at Town of Mount Royal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, though the exact date and circumstances of death are not known. In the record of his parish at Mount Royal, however, his death is given as 1937, again with no detail (and the church has his birth-year wrong, claiming he was born in 1859). The fourth son of the Rev. Frederick Poland, a Church of England clergyman who was vicar of Paignton, Devon from 1861 to 1891, Poland was educated at a private school called Newton College in Devon and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket for club and amateur teams in Devon, and also played in a trial match at Cambridge University in 1881, when he batted low down in a line-up of 16 batsmen against the preferred university first team, and scored 31 and 13. A right-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper, he was picked for only one first- class game, the match against the \\"Gentlemen of England\\" amateur team, and made an unbeaten four in his only innings; he also made two catches and three stumpings as wicketkeeper. He was not picked again in first-class cricket, but he continued to play in less important games, including matches for Devon and Hertfordshire, and some of his Hertfordshire games from the mid 1890s were in the Minor Counties competition. Poland graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1882. Like his father, he became a Church of England clergyman, and he was curate at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, from 1884 to 1892. From 1904, he was based in North America and from 1912 until his retirement in 1933 he was a priest at churches in Montreal.

Taking them seriously, he suggests, advances scholarship on social movements, human rights, and anti-trafficking. Policy implications include the possibility that international development efforts recognize that some of their beneficiaries are also rights violators.Shorter articles along these lines can be found in Huffington Post, Aeon, and The Guardian. Early work along these lines can be found in a volume co-edited with Alison Brysk: From Human Trafficking to Human Rights: Reframing Contemporary Slavery (University of Pennsylvania Press Series on Human Rights). A new book, The Good Drone: How Social Movements Democratize Surveillance (MIT Press) explores the ways social movements use new technologies. This project is notable for its path to publication--the book went through an open peer review process and the final publication is to be an open access PDF. It is one of the first books to be both open preview process _and_ open access publication.

Although his academic and early career was in the legal field, he is best known for being one of the country's foremost experts on the history of European occupation of Sri Lanka. Early life and education Born to John Martinus Pieris Sriwardhana and Don Johannes Dias Bandaranaike, Pieris was educated at S. Thomas' College, Mutwal and in 1889 was judged the most successful candidate at the Cambridge Local Junior Examination in the under- sixteen group, passing out in the first division with distinctions in English, Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Botany, and Drawing. In 1890, he repeated his former success with distinctions in several subjects, including Religious Knowledge, and in the following year, again, with five distinctions. He then became the first Asian to be admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, and after a distinguished performance as an undergraduate he was admitted as a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1895. Having passed the Civil Service exam in London, on his return to Ceylon, Pieiris was enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon and joined the Ceylon Civil Service. Civil service career In 1896 he joined the Ceylon Civil Service and served until his retirement in 1935. During this time he had served as District Judge Matara, District Judge Kegalle, District Judge Kandy, District Judge Kalutara, and Trade Commissioner for Ceylon in England. At the time of his retirement he was serving as the Public Trustee. After several judicial appointments he became the Public Trustee of Ceylon and representative of Ceylon in London. As a district judge he presided over a number of prominent cases, including the Gampola Perahera Case as District Judge of Kandy in 1914. Scholarly work It has been remarked that Pieris was never given a position in the Civil Service that was commensurate with his intellect and ability, and as such he turned his attention toward in depth historical research on the European occupation in Ceylon from the 16th Century onwards. Pieris carried out extensive historical research in Ceylon and he was several times elected the President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Ceylon having last held the role from 1932 to 1934.Past Presidents, Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka to whose journal he contributed frequently from 1904 to 1948.

January 2015. Accessed January 3, 2014 The Astra 28.2¬∞E position was established in 1998 to provide digital TV, digital radio and multimedia services to the UK and Republic of Ireland, and a major part of Astra 2G's mission is to continue, extend and backup this provision. Along with Astra 2E and Astra 2F it will deliver programming to almost 13 million satellite homes, over 3 million cable homes, and 700,000 IPTV homes in the UK and Ireland, in particular for channels from the major UK digital satellite TV platforms, BSkyB and Freesat. Astra 2G also supports SATMED, a satellite-based e-health platform developed by SES and supported by the Luxembourg Government and the Ministry for Cooperation and Humanitarian Action which enables communication between doctors, enabling the transfer and exchange of medical knowledge and supporting tools for medical e-learning and e-teaching to improve public health in emerging and developing countries, particularly in isolated areas. Broadcasting footprints Astra 2G has three Ku-band downlink beams and one Ka-band beam: * The Europe beam is centred on the Benelux countries with reception from a 60 cm dish available across most of Europe - west to the Portuguese eastern border, east to Belarus, north to Estonia and south to coast of North Africa. * The UK Spot beam provides maximum signal (for reception with 45 cm dishes) over the whole UK, Ireland, Benelux and northern France with a sharp roll-off of signal level outside this region, in close approximation of the UK Beam of Astra 2D. This enables channels to be broadcast free-to-air but with reception effectively constrained to the British Isles, and has been the basis for the Freesat free- to-air UK platform.Bains, Geoff. \\"Flight of the Big Birds\\" What Satellite & Digital TV February 2012 pp29 * The strongest signals of the West Africa beam (receivable on 50 cm dishes) covers C√¥te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria and northern Cameroon, with additional \\"lobes\\" for parts of Gabon and Congo. Reception on larger dishes is available across the entire sub-Saharan west Africa region. * The Ka-band footprint is centred on France with coverage over all of western Europe. History The launch of Astra 2G was intended to be from the Baikonur Cosmodrome by ILS Proton-M rocket a month earlier, on November 28, 2014 but technical problems with the launch vehicle caused it to be rolled back from the launch pad to undergo a component replacement. The satellite had arrived at Baikonur on October 29 after a delayed flight from Europe - an emergency landing of the transport aircraft in the city of Ulyanovsk due to engine trouble required replacement of the aircraft's engine and a two-day delay.

Life  Ilustre graduated with a degree in architecture at the Mapua Institute of Technology, eventually becoming a licensed architect in 1937. His architectural experience however went way back, when he started out in 1935 as a draftsman in the architectural office of Juan Nakpil, as well as a stint as a furniture designer in 1936 for Puyat and Sons. He first joined the Bureau of Public Works in 1936 as a draftsman, staying in that position until the outbreak of World War II in the country in 1941. He was then promoted to the position of consulting architect iduring the Japanese Occupation. After the war, he briefly left the bureau to join the AFWESPAC of the US Army as supervising architect and assist them in the postwar infrastructure rehabilitation. In 1947, he became the supervising architect of the National Housing Commission, a position he held for two years until he returned to the Bureau of Public Works in 1949 also as supervising architect. He would remain with the public works office until the 1970s. His most notable work would be his design of the Quezon Memorial Shrine monument, a design he made for a national design competition held in 1951 for the then-planned monument for late President Manuel L. Quezon, where he won the grand prize. In addition, he also designed some notable postwar structures, varying in architectural styles from high- modernism to the neo-vernacular.

He authored a number of academic textbooks and published numerous research papers. He was one of the first to establish the development of global human resources as a goal for university and graduate school students and produced a large number of young and competent researchers and human resources who are active both nationally and internationally. He received the Japan Association of College English Teachers (JACET) Award in 1984 for publishing Nihonjin Eigo no Kagaku [A Scientific Observation of Japanese English] and Hiaringu no Koudou Kagaku [A Scientific Observation of Listening in Action] which summarized research that became the basis for scientific English education and other related fields. In 1991, based upon his pioneering research, he created a unique teaching theory called the Three-step Auditory Comprehension Approach (3 Step System) which increases the effectiveness of English listening skills and vocabulary skills training. This 3 Step System combines a broad expanse of academic knowledge with an interdisciplinary or integrated approach. In 1996, an award from the Japan Association of College English Teachers (JACET) was presented to the practical training that was put in practice in the Center for Language Education, Chiba University through using the CALL teaching materials (Computer-assisted Language Learning courseware) developed by the graduates of Takefuta's research laboratory based on the 3 Step System. He also received a poster prize, Chiba University's Open Research ‚Äò99, from the university's president for the practical report of the students he taught in the educational department of Chiba University. Starting from 2000, he served as the research representative for the Research of Foreign Language CALL Teaching Material Advances which received the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and the CALL materials have been used widely in many educational institutes since 2001. The research on the development, application and evaluation of the system of the Three-step Auditory Comprehension Approach received the academic award in 2007 from the Japan Association for Language Education and Technology.  Educational administration  During the establishment of the Graduate School of Education (MA) in April 1982 and the Graduate School of Science and Technology (Ph.D.) in April 1986, Takefuta participated in the enhancement and development of a graduate school of Chiba University by serving as vice chairman of Chiba University Graduate School of Education's establishment committee. He was also assigned to the Chiba University Graduate School general problem investigating committee by the president of Chiba University. During the reorganization of the Chiba University's College of Liberal Arts, Chiba University's then president, Ryo Yoshida, requested the committee the installment of the Center for Foreign Languages (Currently referred as the Center for Language Education) centering on CALL system based teaching.

History  The station opened on 1 November 1886, and closed on 25 November 1988. Parts of the station and the locomotive depot are currently used for the Lachlan Valley Railway.  Description  The complex includes: * the standard roadside station building (1886) * a non-standard platform level timber box with gable roof (1937) * a type 4 station domicile at 32 Brougham St (1886) * the railways institute building and examiners hut (1886) * the roundhouse and environs It also includes the water column, the brick-based water tanks, the timber footbridge, turntable, the drop pit jack in the locomotive depot, and the platform signs. The station forecourt and grounds, locomotive depot, roundhouse, gardens, buildings, turntable, footpaths, and approaches (with 1930s yard layout), are protected as an almost complete country locomotive depot. The heritage listing includes all infrastructure, vegetation, and archaeological relics in the Cowra yard, between up and down distant signals, and all infrastructure and vegetation included in the former Cowra locomotive depot.  Heritage listing  Cowra was reached by rail in 1886 from Young, and linked to Blayney in 1888, forming the first cross country line. The station complex forms an interesting and complete group of buildings illustrating the importance of the location through the development of the site, particularly the station building. Many periods of construction, utilising various architectural styles, are evident within the group and in the station buildings, making the present structures unique. The complex forms an important civic group on one of the major approaches to Cowra, having a strong and ongoing relationship to the town. The station building is classed as a civic structure within the town itself. The Institute building is one of the few remaining in the state, and is of high significance for its social value in illustrating the importance of the railways to not only the vocational, but the social, educational, and entertainment life of employees. The examiners hut is a rare example of such a building, and is of high significance. The forecourt parking area and grounds are of significance, as it connects the streetscape to the station complex; although the surface treatment has altered the appearance from the original. The site is in close proximity to the Cowra Railway Hotel, which is one of the few active remaining Railway Hotels in the state of New South Wales. This association enhances the significance of both groups of structures.

Life Carmen-Maja Antoni was born into the chaos that followed the war. Her father, Pedro Antoni, was an artist who left the family scene soon after she was born, leaving the baby with her mother, Ursula Antoni-Orendt, an \\"all- round artist\\" who later became a production director with the DFF, East Germany's national broadcasting corporation. Carmen-Maja made her camera debut when aged eleven, as one of the three \\"Blue Streaks\\" in a Young Pioneer Cabaret programme on national television. By the time of the successful completion of her final school exams she had already negotiated her way through the admissions process for the Konrad Wolf Film Academy in the Babelsberg quarter of Potsdam. On joining, she became the academy's youngest student. As soon as she had completed her studies she was hired by Potsdam's Hans Otto Theatre. Still aged only 18, it was here that in 1964 she appeared as an exceptionally young \\"Grusche\\", the heroine in \\"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\\" by Bertolt Brecht. Her performance drew praise from Brecht's widow and from Brecht's old friend, the composer Paul Dessau. She later took the part of \\"Minna\\" in Lessings's \\"Minna von Barnhelm\\". By 1970 Carmen-Maja Antoni had moved on to the People's Theatre in the centre of Berlin. She has been a member of the Berliner Ensemble Theatre Company since 1976, and has recently (2005) appeared there as the lead protagonist in \\"Mother Courage and Her Children\\". Over the years she has played in a very large number of stage plays and films, and her unmistakable voice has also been heard in various radio plays. In addition, she teaches at the Konrad Wolf Film and Television Academy in Babelsberg. Antoni built her career in the German Democratic Republic during the decades of German division, but following reunification hers has become a well-known television presence across German-speaking central Europe thanks in part to her appearances in the long-running (1994‚Äì2013) ZDF crime drama series Rosa Roth in which she played Karin von Lomanski, a close colleague of Police Commissioner Rosa Roth.

The film is produced by Sajjad Chunawala and Shariq Patel under the banners Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Trigno Media. The film features Paresh Rawal, Annu Kapoor and Naseeruddin Shah in lead roles. It tells the story of an ordinary Hindu man who discovers that he is originally a born Muslim, and in order to meet his biological father, he must learn how to be or at least come across as a true Muslim. The film is an official remake of the 2010 British film The Infidel starring comedian Omid Djalili in the lead role. Dharam Sankat Mein released on 10 April 2015, and received mixed reviews from critics.  Plot Dharampal Trivedi (Paresh Rawal), a caterer by profession, lives in a Gujarati Hindu household in Ahmedabad with his wife and two grown children. He is very stereotypical towards Muslims. He starts his days with the old songs of a Punjabi Sikh pop singer Manjeet Manchala (Gippy Grewal), who has now stopped producing albums and disappeared mysteriously. Besides, he has regular arguments with a Muslim neighbour, Nawab Mehmood Nazim Ali Shah Khan Bahadur (Annu Kapoor). One day Dharampal visits his late mother's bank vault to collect her belongings. He then finds adoption papers certifying he was adopted in 1960 and that his biological parents were Muslims. This shocks him, considering how much he dislikes Muslims, and he decides to keep this a secret. Eventually, he admits to Nawab that he is also a Muslim, and that he must find his real father in order to speak to him. They discover that his father is in critical condition due to old age, living in a senior home. The Imaam taking care of his father tells Dharampal that if his father saw that his only son has been brought up as a non-Muslim, it could cause severe damage to his health. Therefore, he tells Dharampal to learn how to become a true Muslim and come back to meet his father once he is ready. With the help of Shah, he begins to learn the ways of Muslim people. However, the Imaam declines Dharampal's request to meet his father once again, claiming he is still not coming across as a true Muslim. Meanwhile, Dharampal's son falls in love with a young girl named Shraddha and in order to marry her, he must have her father accept him and his family. Shraddha's father is a devout follower of a spiritual baba named Neelanand (Naseeruddin Shah). To help him impress Shraddha's father, he asks Dharampal to also follow Neelanand and become spiritual. However, at one occasion, Dharampal ends up admitting publicly that he is a born Muslim. Dharampal's family and Shraddha's father witness this, and Neelanand advises Shraddha's father not to have his daughter marry Dharampal's son. Due to this, Dharampal's family leave him. A case is lodged against Dharampal for offending Muslims, and in the court, the Immam comes and gives character witness of how Dharampal detests Islam. His witness backfires when Nawaab, now Dharampal's attorney, accuses the Immam of trying to wrongfully convert Dharampal to Islam. The court gives permission to Dharampal to see his ailing father. However, before they arrive at the senior home, his father has already died. Furious over the whole situation, Dharampal tries to bring down Neelanand, the main cause of most of his troubles. He then accidentally discovers that Neelanand Baba's eye twitches due to Blepharospasm, a very rare abnormality causing contraction of the eyelid, which the Punjabi pop singer Manjeet Manchala also suffered from. This reminds Dharampal that Manchala had disappeared years ago, and then matches the voices of Manchala and Neelanand, confirming they are the same person. He then crashes an event of Neelanand and reveals to a large audience how Neelanand Baba is actually a born Sikh and has been a fraud and characterless pop-singer with various cases lodged against him for adulterous relationships with many women. He gives a speech on how the religion a person follows should not matter as long as they are acting rightfully. Dharampal's family finally returns and his son is allowed to marry Sharaddha.

These techniques are reserved for the most difficult cases where other therapeutic modalities have failed. The American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons recommends a conservative/non- surgical approach first. Only 20% of patients need to proceed to surgery. Examples of surgical procedures that are used in TMD, some more commonly than others, include arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, menisectomy, disc repositioning, condylotomy or joint replacement. Invasive surgical procedures in TMD may cause symptoms to worsen. Menisectomy, also termed discectomy refers to surgical removal of the articular disc. This is rarely carried out in TMD, it may have some benefits for pain, but dysfunction may persist and overall there it leads to degeneration or remodeling of the TMJ. Arthrocentesis TMJ arthrocentesis refers to lavage (flushing out) of the upper joint space (where most of the translation movement takes place) with saline via the introduction of cannulae. It is theorized that the hydraulic pressure generated within the joint combined with external manipulation is capable of releasing adhesions or the anchored disc phenomenon and leads to an improvement in the movement (\\"lysis and lavage\\"). It is also suggested that undesirable contents within the synovial fluid of the joint can be washed out, such as microscopic debris (from breakdown of the articular surfaces) and pain mediators (enzymes and prostaglandins), and there is also stimulation of the synovial membrane to restore its normal lubricating function. It was initially used to treat acute closed lock, however it has since come to be used chronic closed lock, chronic anterior displaced disc with reduction, and degenerative joint disease (e.g. arthritis). In acute closed lock, it is theorized that the upper joint space is inflated from its normally collapsed state during this procedure, and this extra space frees up the articular disc which returns to its correct position. This is the least invasive, and easiest to carry out of the surgical options. It can be carried out under local anesthetic (and for this reason is cheaper than arthroscopy, although it may also carried out under general anesthetic) and has minimal complications. Although it has been suggested that arthrocentesis decreases pain, increases maximal incisal opening and has prolonged effects, when the procedure was investigated by a systematic review, the impact on pain was comparable to arthroscopy and the results are unstable. The review concluded by suggesting that arthrocentesis only be used for TMD within well designed randomized controlled trial (i.e. for the purposes of further research and not for routine management). Arthrocentesis may be combined with injection of sodium hyaluronate into the joint at the end of the lavage with the aim to improve lubrication within the joint. Arthroscopy Arthroscopy involves the introduction of an arthroscope (a very thin, flexible camera) into the joint via single cannula (as opposed to arthrocentesis which usually involves 2 cannulae and no arthroscope), allowing the joint space to be visualized on a monitor and explored by the surgeon. Arthroscopy is also used in other joints and the technique is similar to laparoscopy. The cannula is inserted via a small incision just in front of the ear. The arthroscope has a built in capacity to pump in or suck out saline. Arthroscopy may be intended as a purely diagnostic procedure, or it may be employed in combination with surgical interventions within the joint, in which case a second \\"working\\" cannula is also inserted into the joint. Examples include release of adhesions (e.g. by blunt dissection or with a laser) or release of the disc. Biopsies or disc reduction can also be carried out during arthroscopy. Arthroscopy is usually carried out under general anesthesia. Arthroscopy has advantages over arthrocentesis in that it allows for detection of problems inside the joint such as perforation or synovitis. As with arthrocentesis, the procedure may be combined with sodium hyaluronate injection into the joint at the end of the procedure. Intra-articular injections Both sodium hyaluronate and glucocorticoids have been injected into the joints in order to treat TMD. Sodium hyaluronate is a component of the normal synovial fluid that fills the joint spaces in health. Its function is to lubricate and maintain the internal environment of the joint. It has been used for arthritis in the knee and hip joints, and it was first used for TMD in 1985. A systematic review found that hyaluronate might be beneficial for clinical TMD signs in the long term, but that this may be unstable. The effects of hyaluronate may be similar to glucocorticoids. There may be added benefit in arthrocentesis or arthroscopy if intra-articular injections are combined with these procedures. Reported adverse events are minor and temporary. Joint replacement Prosthetic TMJ placement surgery is used as a last resort to manage severe pain and restricted function due to TMJ disorders. At the onset of symptoms, primary prevention such as a soft diet, cessation of gum chewing, physiotherapy and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are put into place. If primary prevention fails, TMJ joint replacement is one of the several surgical options. Recent studies have shown TMJ replacement surgery to be highly successful, improving mean pain scores, mean diet scores, mean maximum inter- incisal opening, and mean function and speech scores.NICE (2014) 'Total prosthetic replacement of the temporomandibular joint', NICE interventional procedure guidance , ([IPG500]), pp. Section 2 [Online].

Synthetic jaw implants already on the market prior to the 1976 Federal law requiring medical devices be proven safe and effective were exempt and continued to be sold after 1976 without proof of safety. Teflon implants made by Vitek, and silicone ones made by Dow Corning, raised the most concern. Vitek-Kent Proplast-Teflon partial & total prosthesis were manufactured from 1982 to 1990 in Houston TX. TMJ prostheses became popular with the introduction of Vitek, but evidence that the implants could cause debilitating reactions including pain, malocclusion, and foreign-body giant cell reaction (FBGCR) resulting in degeneration of the surrounding tissue led to a recall by the FDA on 1/7/91. Since Vitek declared bankruptcy in June 1990 and the owner fled the country, the FDA was left to handle the recall, which they did by sending out a safety alert and public health advisory. Otherwise, there was next to no follow-up on the recall. Silastic silicone TMJ Implants produced by Dow Corning became popular during the 1970s, but reports of widespread mechanical failure with wear, tearing, and fracture began to surface. Debris and fragments led to an inflammatory response, joint degeneration, bony ankylosis, and lymph node swelling. Marketing of Silastic for use in the TMJ was discontinued on 6/15/93 after warnings from the FDA and the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS). To date, the FDA has approved only 4 TMJ Implants by 3 manufacturers: the Anspach patient fitted Total TMJ Joint Replacement System by TMJ Concepts; the Walter Lorenz Total TMJ Replacement System by Biomet Microfixation; the TMJ Metal-on- Metal Total Joint Replacement System, and the Christensen TMJ Fossa-Eminence System (patient specific partial), both by TMJ Medical.https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/PatientAlerts/ucm064784.htm The Hoffman-Pappas Total TMJ Replacement System produced by Endotech has been in use since 1995 while awaiting final FDA approval. Working with Dr. Mike Pappas, Dr. David Hoffman of Staten Island University Hospital received approval by the FDA to undertake a national study to investigate a clinical trial on the prosthetic joint system.

Members of this genus are in the subfamily Dolichoderinae of the family Formicidae, known from Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene fossils found in Europe. The genus currently contains five described species, Y. constrictus, Y. geinitzi, Y. intermedius, Y. mayrianum and Y. samlandicus. The first specimens were collected in 1868 and studied by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr, who originally placed the fossils in other ant genera until the fossils were reviewed and subsequently placed into their own genus. These ants are small, measuring from in length and can be characterized by their trapezoidal shaped head-capsules and oval compound eyes that are located slightly to the rear of the capsules midpoint, with no known ocelli present. Distribution Individuals of Yantaromyrmex species have been found as inclusions in four different Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene amber deposits in Europe. Baltic amber is approximately 46 million years old, having been deposited during the Lutetian stage of the Middle Eocene. There is debate on what plant family the amber was produced by, with evidence supporting them being relatives of either Agathis or Pseudolarix. Rovno amber, recovered from deposits in the Rivne region of Ukraine, is slightly younger in age, being dated to the Bartonian to Priabonian of the Late Eocene. Bitterfeld amber is recovered from coal deposits in the Saxony area of Germany and the dating of the deposits is uncertain. Bitterfeld represents a section of the Eocene Paratethys Sea, and the amber that is recovered from the region is thought to be redeposited from older sediments. The fossil record of Bitterfeld and Baltic amber insects is very similar with a number of shared species, and that similarity is noted in the suggestions of a single source for the paleoforest that produced the amber. The amber deposits on the Danish coast, often referred to as Scandinavian amber, is of similar age to the other three European ambers, however a study of the ant fauna publushed in 2009 indicates Scandinavian amber has a fairly distinct ant assemblage. Y. constricta and Y. geinitzi are both identified from all four European ambers, while Y. samlandicus has been described from Baltic, Bitterfeld and Rovno fossils. Y. intermedius and Y. mayrianum, are each known from only a few fossils, Y. intermedius from only a single Bitterfeld amber fossil while Y. mayrianum is known from a Baltic amber and a Rovno amber fossil. History and classification Larva and pupae of Y. geinitzi, illustrated by William Morton Wheeler The type specimens of Y. geinitzi and Y. constrictus were collected in 1868, and when first described were part of the University of K√∂nigsberg's amber collection. The fossils were initially studied by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr who placed the two species in the genus Hypoclinea, now considered a junior synonym of the living genus Dolichoderus. Mayr's 1868 type descriptions of the new species were published in the journal Beitr√§ge zur Naturkunde Preussens. All the Y. samlandicus syntypes were collected by 1915, and the first 73 described were part of the University of K√∂nigsberg amber collection. These fossils were first studied by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler, whose type description of \\"Iridomyrmex\\" samlandica was published in the journal Schriften der Physikalisch-√ñkonomischen Gesellschaft zu K√∂nigsberg. Both Y. geinitzi and Y. constrictus were both moved from Hypoclinea to the small related genus Bothriomyrmex in 1873 by Dalla Torre. In his 1915 paper The ants of Baltic Amber Wheeler suggested both species and the newly named \\"I.\\" samlandica would be better placed in the genus Iridomyrmex and noted Y. geinitzi to be one of the most abundant ant species in the Baltic amber he had studied. Wheeler based the placement on the structuring of the labial and maxillary palpi. This placement was unchallenged until the genus was reviewed, redefined and split up in 1992 by Steven Shattuck. In his review, Iridomyrmex was split into a more restricted genus group while the other species which did not match the definition of that genus were moved to other genera. At that time Shattuck provisionally kept Y. geinitzi in Iridomyrmex citing a lack of specimens for him to study, while both Y. constrictus and Y. samlandicus were transferred to the genus Anonychomyrma. The placements of Y. geinitzi was retained until 2011 when Shattuck and Brian Heterick again reviewed Iridomyrmex. With more fossils to study and based on a number of characters, Y. geinitzi was also moved to Anonychomyrma. The three species were reviewed again, this time in 2013. The species were examined by Russian entomologists G.M. Dlussky and D.A. Dubovikoff, who they came to the conclusion that the three species, along with two unnamed species, were distinct from Anonychomyrma and Iridomyrmex. Based on the differences they noted, Dlussky and Dubovikoff erected the new genus Yantaromyrmex in 2013 for these ants and described two new species, Y. intermedius and Y. mayrinaum. The name is a combination of the Russian word —è–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä—å, translated as yantar, meaning \\"amber\\" and the Greek ŒºœÖœÅŒºŒÆŒ≥Œ∫Œ± which means \\"ant\\". They noted the new species name intermedius was derived from the Latin word of that same spelling, meaning \\"intermediate\\". They chose the name mayrianum to honor Gustav Mayr for his work as a myrmecologist. Description The genus is characterized by workers which have head-capsules that are trapezoidal in shape, narrowing at the front and widening towards the rear of the capsule. The oval compound eyes are generally placed slightly to the rear of the capsules midpoint, and lacking ocelli completely. The mandibles have a number of teeth along the masticatory margin (the middle area of the mandibles) and an overall triangular shape. The gaster has a flat first tergite that does not cover the petiole, a flat fourth abdominal sternite. Y. constrictus Y. constrictus worker Overall Y. constrictus can be distinguished from the congeneric Y. geinitzi in several ways. Y. geinitzi individuals are overall more gracile in form with a less constricted mesonotum and the mesosoma has a less convex appearance. Y. constrictus specimens have maxillary palps (sensory organs) which are six-jointed, labial palps which are four jointed, and an abundantly hairy body. The antennae have a scape (the first segment of the antenna) which just passes the back-edge of the head capsule on both female and ergatomorphic (male) workers. The ergatomorphs have larger and more rounded compound eyes than the workers, and the antennae are overall longer than in the workers. Both males and workers have a five segmented gaster and the males are distinguished by the slightly protruding stipites (the second segment of the maxilla) at the tip of segment five. Y. geinitzi Overall Y. geinitzi can be distinguished from the related Baltic amber species Y. constricta in several ways. Y. geinitzi individuals are overall more gracile in form with a less constricted mesonotum and the mesosoma has a less convex appearance. Y. geinitzi specimens have maxillary palps which are six-jointed, labial palps which are four jointed, and the clypeal border is sinuately indented in the middle. The pupae which Wheeler referred to the species are noted to not have any cocoon unlike the modern larvae of some ant subfamilies which will spin a cocoon to pupate in. The eyes of Y. geinitzi are placed more to the front and sides of the head capsule than seen in Iridomyrmex species. Due to the shape of Y. geinitzi, the species may have been a herpetobiont (an inhabitant of the soils surface), but scientists suggest that these ants inhabited trees, dwelling inside epiphytes and dead plant material (such as branches). Y. intermedius The only specimen of Y. intermedius is that has several cracks surrounding it, and areas of white \\"mold\\" coatings. The indent behind the propodeum (the first abdominal segment) is deep, the connection between the segment and the thorax is wide and covered in wrinkles of the exoskeleton. The propodeum has an angular appearance with a rounded corner when viewed from the side. This separates the species from both Y. geinitzi and Y. mayrianum. The legs of Y. intermedius are generally free of hairs while the mesosoma and head have only a few sparse hairs on the upper surface. This is different than the much hairier Y. constrictus which always has numerous erect hairs on the body and legs. The high conical propodeum and scape which does not extend to the edge ofhte head capsule isolate Y. intermedius from Y. samlandicus. The right antennae of the type specimen is preserved with the head of a Ctenobethylus goepperti worker ant clamped near the tip, and it seems the two had just fought prior to entombment. Y. mayrianum Y. samlandicus worker Workers of Y. mayrianum range in length from approximately and look very similar to workers of Y. geinitzi. In both species the indent behind the first abdominal segment is broader and shallower than seen in Y. constrictus, Y. samlandicus and Y. intermedius. Also unlike the other three species the first abdominal segments surface is smooth and unsculptured. Y. mayrianum can be distinguished from Y. geinitzi by the amount of hairs found on the workers body. In Y. mayrianum there is abundant erect hair covering the entire body, on the underside head capsule and along the eye margins and leg undersides. In contrast Y. geinitzi workers have smooth eye margins and legs, and a sparse scattering of hairs on the mseosoma, last segments of the abdomen and along the upper side of the head. Y. samlandicus Y. samlandicus specimens have maxillary palps which are six jointed, labial palps which are four jointed, and a total body length between . The antennae each possess twelve segments and a scape that curves at the base. The thorax is narrower in profile than the head capsule, reaching its widest in the broad flattened pronotum. The petiole is notably broad and short, having a high node that has a rounded point on the upper side. Y. samlandicus specimens have fine to coarse punctuation (small spots) across the head and thorax and an overall coloration that is black, though some specimens have a reddish tone to the legs or antennae.

The battle was fought between a Norman expeditionary force and a Muslim alliance of Sicilian and Zirid troops. The Normans fought under the command of Roger de Hauteville, the youngest son of Tancred of Hauteville and brother of Robert Guiscard. The Muslim alliance consisted of the native Sicilian Muslims under the Kalbid ruling class of Palermo, led by Ibn al-Hawas, and Zirid reinforcements from North Africa led by the two princes, Ayyub and 'Ali. The battle was a resounding Norman victory that utterly routed the opposing force, causing divisions amongst the Muslim aristocracy which ultimately paved the way for the eventual capture of the Sicilian capital, Palermo, by the Normans and subsequently the rest of the island. The initial battle took place at the hilltop town of Cerami, around five miles to the west of the Norman stronghold at Troina. However the main battle was joined in the valley just to the south. By all accounts the Normans, numbering 136 knights with probably only slightly more infantry, were heavily outnumbered by their Muslim opponents who some sources claim were as many as 50,000 strong. The best surviving source of information for the battle is found in Geoffrey of Malaterra's De rebus gestis Rogerii Calabriae et Siciliae comitis et Roberti Guiscardi Ducis fratris eius. Prelude Norman invasion Roger de Hauteville had arrived in Italy sometime after the Battle of Civitate in 1053, which had seen his brother Robert Guiscard catapulted into the spotlight. In the ensuing years Robert had inherited his brother Humphrey de Hauteville's lands and titles in southern Italy. As a result of increasing pressure exerted on the papacy by the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, during the Investiture Contest, Pope Nicholas II was looking for allies. Despite the Norman victory against, and subsequent incarceration of, his predecessor Pope Leo IX in 1053 at Civitate, Nicholas concluded the Synod of Melfi in 1059 by formally acknowledging the Norman possessions in southern Italy and granting Robert the title of Duke of Apulia and Calabria, and in the future, of Sicily. Robert did not have to wait long for an opportunity to invade Sicily. By this time, Roger had harangued control of Calabria from Robert in recognition for Roger's help against the rebellious Norman lords there and held it as his own fief, but owing homage to Robert as his duke. In 1060, the Sicilian Emir of Syracuse, Ibn al-Timnah, landed at Reggio in Calabria to secure the aid of the Normans against his rival emir, Ibn al-Hawas. He promised that, in return for the Normans' military assistance, al-Timnah would acknowledge their claim over the entire island. Roger immediately began preparing to make a foray across the straits of Messina. After one reconnaissance raid in 1060 and one abortive attempt in early 1061, Roger captured Messina ahead of a Norman army under the command of Robert Guiscard. The population the Val Demone region of Sicily, of which Messina forms the northeast corner, was largely made up of Greek-speaking Christians despite two centuries of Islamic rule and they welcomed the Normans as liberators. With Messina fortified and garrisoned, Robert and Roger were free to march inland. Conquering as they went, the Norman army quickly secured Rometta, Frazzano, Centuripe and Patern√≤. They defeated a sizeable force belonging to Ibn al-Hawas as his fortress at Enna (or Castrogiovanni) but were ill-prepared to maintain a siege of its citadel for long. With the campaigning season drawing to a close, Robert abandoned the siege and returned to Italy with Roger. Roger however, did not remain there long and, returning with a small force, captured Troina, where he spent Christmas 1061. The following year, while his brother was tied down with Apulian rebellions and Byzantine resurgences, Roger plundered all the way to Agrigento and solidified Norman holdings in the Val Demone. However, as 1062 drew to a close, Ibn al-Hawas launched a counterattack which besieged Roger's wife and a handful of retainers in Troina's citadel. Roger returned from plundering and his relief force broke through the siege lines and managed to occupy the citadel, but the Normans found themselves besieged by the Muslims as well as the Greek townsfolk, who were tired with the harsh Norman rule. Roger's second Christmas in Troina was markedly less comfortable. Early in 1063, Roger broke the siege of Troina and resumed his harrying of the Sicilian interior. Unbeknown to him, however, Ibn al-Hawas had signed an alliance with the Zirid emir of Ifriqiya, Tamim ibn al-Mu'izz, and had received substantial reinforcements of Zirid soldiers led by his sons, princes Ayyub and 'Ali. Ibn al-Hawas struck eastwards at the head of this large army towards Roger's position at Troina with a single-minded ambition, to destroy the Norman presence on the island. Army composition Normans Roger's force consisted of 136 mounted Norman knights who were highly disciplined and well versed in the Frankish tactic of the heavy cavalry charge. The Norman force would also have contained an infantry element but, owing to the Roger's chronic shortage of manpower, this almost certainly did not exceed approximately 150 troops and would have consisted of Norman as well as Calabrian Lombard sergeants and dismounted knights and squires. Norman notables at the battle included Roger I of Sicily, Serlo II of Hauteville, Roussel de Bailleul and Arisgot du Pucheuil. Roger, although the supreme commander of the army, would also have led a personal retinue of several dozen knights and their entourages. His nephew Serlo also commanded a cadre of around 30 knights, as would have other lords, and to a lesser extent other knights, such as Roussel de Bailleul and Arisgot du Pucheuil. Muslim alliance We know relatively little about the composition of the Kalbid/Zirid army at Cerami. The majority of troops were of Berber origin and were under the command of the Zirid princes. Ibn al-Hawas commanded a sizeable force himself consisting of troops levied mainly from Palermo and Agrigento. The Zirid forces, being mostly Berber tribesmen, were many in number but lacked professionalism and discipline, unlike the Palermitans. This would later cause significant rifts between the two allies as increased Zirid control in Palermo and their successive defeats at the hands of Normans led to many Sicilians resenting their interference. Initial moves Siege of Cerami Upon discovering the proximity of the Muslim army, Roger immediately sent Serlo and his knights as an advance force to secure the strategically vital position offered by Cerami. When the large Muslim vanguard drew up before the town, they found the gates shut and barred against them; Serlo's knights spread thinly across the walls. Ibn al-Hawas ordered the vanguard to scale the walls and take the town but all efforts were repulsed and met with failure. Some time afterwards, probably around an hour (but sometimes stated to be as long as 3 days) later, and once the Muslim force had arrived in full, Roger's main force entered the valley from the East and drew up into battle order. Main action Unfortunately nothing is known of the disposition of the Muslim force at the battle, however it is likely that the vanguard was made up of the Muslim cavalry contingent which dismounted in order to besiege the town. Roger's force, however, was drawn up into a tight body of men forming a vanguard and a rearguard, in a similar fashion to the Norman tactic used at Castrogiovanni in 1061. The Muslim force, tired of its fruitless efforts to capture Cerami, abandoned the siege of the town and drew up facing them. It is unclear who attacked first, but a hesitant Roger is recorded as having led an early cavalry charge which failed to break the Muslim lines. The Muslim forces then counterattacked in force however the Norman infantry held fast. It was at this point that St. George is said to have appeared amongst the Norman ranks, clad in shining white armour atop a white stallion and bearing the flag of St. George upon his lance (it has sometimes been portrayed as Roger who bore the flag of St. George). His speech inspired the Norman knights to charge the Muslim ranks again and, as they did, Serlo led a charge down from Cerami into the left flank of the Muslim force, cutting a bloody path towards his Norman compatriots. In the space of a few hours, the courage and determination of the Norman warriors in the face of such an overwhelming force had checked the Muslim onslaught. The surprise of the double charge proved too much for the undisciplined Zirid troops, who turned tail and fled, precipitating the rout of the remaining Kalbid troops. Before long the entire Muslim army had descended into a chaotic flight which the Norman cavalry, now regrouped, was able to exploit without mercy. Aftermath Malaterra records how the Norman cavalry chased the mass of routing troops all the way back to their camp, which they sacked and pillaged, killing all they found. He also claims that the Norman cavalry wanted to stop and rest their horses at the Muslim camp and enjoy the spoils of war, but Roger ordered the chase to be continued into the surrounding mountains so that he could capitalize on the route. After much time had passed, and the dust had settled, it is claimed that 35,000 Sicilians and Zirids had been killed. Yet the Zirid Princes Ayyud and 'Ali, as well as the Palermitan Emir Ibn al-Hawas, escaped the battle, returning to Palermo with what remained of the Muslim army. Roger, in the immediate aftermath, sent four camels as a gift to the Norman suzerain, the reigning Pope Alexander II, who in return blessed the expedition and offered certain spiritual indulgences, such as remission of sins, for those who had fought at the battle. With his possessions secured, Roger took advantage of the lull in Muslim aggression to return to Calabria in order to quell rising rebellious sentiments among his vassals and to plan the capture of Palermo with his brother, the Duke of Apulia and Calabria, Robert Guiscard. Consequences The Normans were now the dominant force in Sicily. But that is not to say they were unchallenged. Their victory at Cerami had tipped the balance of power in their favour but they were still only in undisputed possession of the Val Demone region around Messina. The Val di Noto and Val di Mazara regions were still firmly in the hands of the Kalbids. However, the Norman victory had scattered Muslim hopes for a swift counter offensive which might expel the Normans from the island. The Kalbid Palermitans began to resent the interference of the Zirid rulers in Sicilian affairs and blamed them for the defeat at Cerami. This hostility increased gradually until the second humiliating defeat of the alliance by the Normans at Misilmeri in 1068, only 5 miles from Palermo. Riots broke out in Palermo and Ibn al-Hawas rose in revolt against the Zirid princes at Agrigento. Ibn al-Hawas was killed in the fighting but the Zirid prince Ayyub gathered what was left of his troops and returned to his North African domains. Having lost the last vestiges of a field army, the remaining Sicilian troops could only watch from the walls of Palermo, waiting for the inevitable killing-blow. It came 3 years later, in 1071, after Robert Guiscard had added Bari, the final Byzantine foothold in Apulia, to his domains. A much larger force of Normans, as many as 3000, attacked the city by both land and sea, led by Robert Guiscard and Roger. After a siege lasting five months, the Palermitans capitulated on January 10, 1072. Although local resistance across the island lasted for a further 2 decades, this moment marked the turning point in the fortunes of the Normans. In gaining Palermo, the Normans were on their way to establishing what was arguably the most successful kingdom in Europe. It also marked a turning point in the ongoing Islamo-Christian conflict around the Mediterranean. The following decades would see increasing papal involvement prompting and sponsoring wars to recover once-Christian lands which had been lost to the Muslims as long ago as the 7th and 8th centuries. In 1095, 4 years after Sicily's conquest by the Normans definitively came to an end, Pope Urban II launched the First Crusade to recover the holy city of Jerusalem for the Christians, ushering in the next epoch of Mediterranean history.

After experiencing many successes and difficulties relating to DU‚Äôs finances, enrollment, and staff relations, Pritchard was fired by the school‚Äôs board of trustees. Despite this pall cast over his tenure as chancellor, Pritchard did succeed in making many strides for the University. Background Pritchard was born September 3, 1924. He married Emily Gregg in 1948, and the couple had seven children, two of which were adopted Iranian nationals. Pritchard studied at the University of Arkansas and earned both his BA and his MA in political science and history in 1951. He also played college football at Arkansas, and was drafted in the 17th round of the 1949 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins, but chose not to play professional football. The next year, he earned an MA from the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and in 1954 achieved his PhD in international economics. He was appointed to the faculty of Southwestern College at Memphis, Tennessee in 1955, where he combined teaching with football coaching. Career Pritchard served as co- chairman of the Regional Export Expansion Committee from 1958 to 1960 under President Eisenhower, and again from 1960 to 1962 under President Kennedy. From 1961 to 1962 he was a member of Kennedy‚Äôs National Executive Committee on Foreign Aid. Also in 1962, Pritchard left Southwestern to take a position as Special Assistant to the Director of the Peace Corps, where he worked on program review and evaluation. He was later appointed Peace Corps Director in Turkey, and served there until 1965. From 1965 to 1968, Pritchard worked as Regional Director of the Peace Corps for East Asia and the Pacific, and in 1968 joined the Development and Resource Corporation where he would eventually become Resident Manager for the firm in Iran. In 1972, he served as president of Hood College, a private women‚Äôs liberal arts school in Maryland, which he is credited with saving from bankruptcy. In 1975 he assumed the presidency of Arkansas State University, making this university more competitive with the more popular University of Arkansas. He accepted the chancellorship at DU in 1978. Pritchard‚Äôs leadership skills benefited him as chancellor. He purchased the Colorado Women‚Äôs College campus, resurrected DU‚Äôs engineering school, and oversaw the building of the Driscoll University Center. He raised the University‚Äôs enrollment from 7700 in 1978 to 8600 in 1984, and increased the endowment fund from $18.5 million to $22.5 million over the same time period. Despite these achievements, financial troubles continued to plague the University. DU reported a $2.4 million deficit in 1983, and more than a $1 million deficit in 1984. As a result, Pritchard announced that in 1984 there would be no salary raises for faculty or staff. A majority of DU faculty members voted no confidence in Pritchard, and demanded he resign as chancellor. Reports published by committees of the University Faculty Senate and faculty of the arts and sciences claimed that Pritchard was responsible for ‚Äúthe deteriorating state of the University in general, and of enrollment and development (fund-raising) in particular.‚Äù[1] The board of trustees voted unanimously to terminate Pritchard‚Äôs employment on 1984, when the chairman of the board Lucien Wulsin declared it was ‚Äútime for new blood‚Äù and named himself interim chancellor.[2] Sargent Shriver, who directed the Peace Corps when Pritchard worked as regional director, explains ‚ÄúAmerican Indians always had two chiefs‚Äîone to rule in peace, the other to lead the tribe in war.

At the time of description the species Zherichinius horribilis and Zherichinius rapax were two of eight ant species known from Sakhalin fossils. History and classification Zherichinius is known from two complete adult female fossils, the holotype specimens numbers PIN3387-35 and PIN3387-37, along with the partial legs of a third specimen in the same amber piece as PIN3387-35 and a poorly preserved worker, PIN3387-36, which was not described. At the time of the genus description all three specimens were residing in the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow. Both described specimens are worker caste adults preserved as inclusions in transparent chunks of Sakhalin amber. The amber specimen was recovered from deposits on Sakhalin island, in far eastern Russia during a 1972 collecting expedition. The expedition recovered amber from the beaches of the Okhotsk Sea at the mouth of the Naiba River and upstream on the banks of the river eroding out of exposures of Naibuchi Formation strata. One additional fossil has been reported from Bitterfeld amber, and has been listed by Dlussky and Rasnitsyn 2009 as undescribed. Sakhalin amber is noted for having undergone high temperatures and pressures after the resin was buried. As a result, insects and other inclusions in the amber are not as well preserved as those of other amber locations, even those of older ambers. The inclusions are most of the time carbonized reducing fine detail preservation, and the amber has been subjected to plastic deformation changing the shapes and features of the inclusions. The distortion is visible in the outlines of trapped air bubbles, which are elongated along the plane of distortion, rather than spherical as seen with bubbles in Eocene Baltic amber and Cretaceous Taymyr amber. In some cases the inclusions are at least partially filled with amber rather than being hollow. Sakhalin amber has been attributed a range of geological ages, with Vladimir Zherikhin in 1978 suggesting dates between 59 and 47 million years old. In 1988, Gennady Dlussky suggested a tentative Paleocene age, which was followed by subsequent authors through 2013. However research published in 1999 on the Naibuchi Formation, in which Sakhalin amber is directly preserved, gives a Middle Eocene age based on geological and paleobotanical context. The Sakhalin amber forest had a variety of plants living in a mixed coastal swamp, river, and lake environment. The river and lake system had numerous swampy areas that resulted in active peat bog formation. The bogs were surrounded by Osmunda, Nymphaeaceae and Ericaceae plants, while Taxodium, Alnus, Salix, and other trees populated the forest. Bitterfeld amber is recovered from coal deposits in the Saxony area of Germany and the dating of the deposits is uncertain. Bitterfeld represents a section of the Eocene Paratethys Sea, and the amber that is recovered from the region is thought to be redeposited from older sediments. The fossil record of Bitterfeld and Baltic amber insects is very similar with a number of shared species, and that similarity is noted in the suggestions of a single source for the paleoforest that produced the amber. The Sakhalin amber fossils were first studied by paleoentomologist Gennady Dlussky of the Russian Academy of Sciences, with his 1988 type description for the genus, and species published in the Paleontologicheskii Zhurnal. The genus name was coined as a patronym honoring the Russian paleoentomologist and coleopterist Vladimir Zherikhin, who had died in 2001, and was often called a \\"living encyclopedia\\" by friends due to his knowledge and memory.Anon, 2001. Obituary V. V. Zherikhin The genus name was used for the base of Dlussky's proposed tribe Zherichiniini, erected for the genus. The species name horribilis was derived from the Latin word meaning \\"terrible\\", and the species name rapax is from the Latin meaning \\"predatory\\". The tribe Zherichiniini was recognized by Dlussky, but subsequent authors did not recognize it, rather they placed the genus as incertae sedis within Dolichoderinae without a tribal placement. Zherichinius is one of six genera and eight species described from Sakhalin amber. The dolichoderine species are most diverse with Z. horribilis, Z. rapax, Eotapinoma compacta and E. gracilis. Other ant subfamilies are represented by a single species each, the aneuretine Aneuretellus deformis, the formicine Chimaeromyrma brachycephala, the myrmicine Aphaenogaster dlusskyana, and the ponerine Protopone primigena. Description Zherichinius species workers similar in proportion to Leptomyrmex species, but are distinguished from other members of Dolichoderinae based on the distinct deep notch along the rear margin of the head capsule and the scales on the petiole. The heads have fairly straight sides and are rectangular in outline, being between 1.3 and 2.2 times wider than long. There are no visible ocelli on the workers, but the compound eyes are well developed, large, and positioned near the center point on the head. The antennae are long with 12 segments, the scape being much longer than the head capsule, and the terminal segments not enlarged into a club. Z. horribilis The worker is approximately long, with an antenna scape that is long. The wide mandibles have a large apical tooth along with several backward facing teeth along the chewing margin. Behind the mandibles the clypeus have a wavy to nearly straight front margin. The petiole is distinctly elongated to about three times its width. There are two pairs of defensive spines on the face and three pair on the rear margin of the head. Additionally there are single pairs on the pronotum and propodium. Z. rapax The Z. rapax worker is smaller in proportions than Z. horribilis, with a total length of approximately and a scape that is long. At 2.2 greater in length then width, the head has a larger length to width proportion then Z. horribilis and the rear corners of the head capsule are drawn backwards distinctly. The mandibles are more elongated then Z. horribilis, with a large apical tooth and between seven and eight smaller teeth on each chewing margin, while the front margin of the clypeus angles forward. The legs are proportionally longer than those of Z. horribilis, while the petiole is shorter in proportion and there are no defensive spines present.

Early baseball career Hojo playing for Kosei Gakuin in 2011 Hojo started playing baseball in 4th grade at elementary school, and joined the All-Sayama Boys baseball club when he started at Mikita Junior High School. He then entered Kosei Gakuin High School, a known baseball powerhouse in Aomori Prefecture. On his sophomore year, he appeared in the 2011 Summer Koshien, where he contributed 8 RBIs (highest in team history), helping his team make it all the way to the championship round. They finished as the runner-up however, when they were blanked by Nichidai-san High (11-0). During the Autumn Invitational Tournament of the same year, he batted at an average of 0.455, and racked up 7 RBIs including a lone homerun, helping his team win the championship. In the following year's Summer Koshien, he recorded 4 homeruns as the team's 4th batter during the entire tournament, 2 of which were hit in 2 consecutive at- bats. This feat of hitting 4 homeruns in one tournament was last accomplished by former Yomiuri member Kazuhiro Kiyohara in 1985. In the tournament's final round, his team battled with pitching sensation and soon-to-be Tigers teammate Shintaro Fujinami of Osaka Toin High, but Kosei was once again denied the championship when they failed to score a single run (3-0). Nevertheless, due to his consistent performance at the plate which helped brought his team to 3 consecutive tournament championship rounds, 29 RBIs in all of his Koshien appearances (the most in Koshien history, tied with Kiyohara), and a total of 25 homeruns in his entire high school career, Hojo caught the attention of baseball scouts. He also participated in the 2012 18U(AAA) Baseball World Championship. Hanshin Tigers He was the Hanshin Tiger's 2nd round pick during the 2012 annual professional baseball draft, second to the highly sought-after Shintaro Fujinami. It was rumored that the Hiroshima Carps also planned to pick Hojo during the 2nd round, but when they heard that the Giants were planning to pick Seiya Suzuki in the same round, they changed their plan and picked Suzuki earlier instead. Hojo signed a 70 million yen contract with Hanshin for an annual salary of 7.2 million, and was assigned the jersey number 2. 2013 He spent his first year playing in Western League (farm) games. He played as shortstop in 84 games, batted at an average of 0.199 with 20 RBIs and a single home run. Fielding wise, he committed 18 errors. During offseason, he participated in Miyazaki Phoenix League games where he played different infield roles apart from shortstop in order to increase his chances of making it to the main roster in the next season. 2014 On July 17, he made his first Fresh All-Star Game appearance in Nagasaki as the clean-up batter (5th). He finished the season with 102 ni-gun game appearances, 23 RBIs, 2 homeruns and batting average of 0.259. His feel for the strike zone improved from the previous year as he led the league with 52 walks. He finally made it to the main roster on September 29, but never got any playing time in the end. During offseason, he played for the national team in the WBSC U21 Baseball World Cup in Taiwan. He played in every round, batting 0.304, and contributed 8 RBIs including a 3-run homerun during the match against Venezuela, helping Japan finish as the runner-up winner. He was given the tournament's Best Nine Award as second baseman. 2015 With rumors of Takashi Toritani considering to be posted to the majors during the off-season, Hojoh was one the candidates considered for his replacement as the team's main shortstop. Despite Toritani's declaration to stay with the team however, Hojoh was included in the main squad during spring training for the first time since he was drafted. But when he only managed to notch one hit during the pre-season exhibition games (0.067 average), he got sent back to the farm before the season began. Because of the team's abundance in infielders who specialized at either 2nd base or shortstop, Hojoh was assigned to 3rd base in most of his outings in the Western League (farm) games. His hitting improved as the season progressed, and he even batted clean-up in a couple of games. He finally debuted as a pinch-hitter in the May 28 inter-league match against the Rakuten Golden Eagles, but his at-bat ended with a foul fly. This got him sent back to the farm once more, making this his first and final main squad at-bat for the season. Unfazed, he still continued to hit well in the farm. In the May 31 game against the Dragons, he together with Ryutaro Umeno and Taiga Egoshi notched a historic 3 consecutive home-run feat that was last accomplished in the Western League 35 years ago. He finished the season with a 0.243 average out of 112 Western League games (the most appearances for a player in the league), and led the team with 43 RBIs including 10 home runs. 2016 He again joined the main squad during spring training, and batted well during the exhibition games (0.333) which earned him a spot in the opening day roster. His first appearance was as a pinch-hitter on April 4, where he hit a solo home run against the Baystars' Kenta Ishida. A few games later, he began being included in the starting line up, and his starts gradually increased either as a 2nd or 3rd baseman. As Toritani went into a slump later in July, he then took over as the team's main shortstop. By August, he was batting lead-off at 0.311, and experienced his first Hero interview after he hit the winning run on August 10. He continued to hit well and reached his 100th hit by September 24, and became the 4th Hanshin player drafted out of high-school to reach 100 hits within his first four seasons. He spent the entire season in the main squad and appeared in 122 games, the most appearances among the team's infielders. At the plate, he finished with an average of 0.273, batted in 33 RBIs including 5 home runs, but defense-wise, he committed the most errors (12). Nevertheless, his improved overall performance earned him a pay raise that tripled his previous salary to 22 million yen.

Architectural features The ground floor of the Don Hilarion Esquivel house were lined with stone flooring while the flooring of the second floor was made of wooden planks. The terrace, or azotea, was located at the rear portion of the house. Its windows were made of large glass panels, instead from the traditional capiz windows. Also, it has a protruding front room - similar to houses built during the American Colonial Period such as the Baldomero Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite.

He was a contemporary of the French naturalist Alfred Grandidier and wrote detailed books about the flora and fauna of Madagascar, the country's general history, and the mission history on the island. He also helped revise the Malagasy Bible and wrote several works in the Malagasy language. He was a vocal advocate of Malagasy independence prior to the French invasion of Madagascar in 1895. Sibree also designed and helped build almost 100 new mission buildings and 50 churches in Madagascar. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and earned an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews. Swiss zoologist Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major named Sibree's dwarf lemur after him in 1896. Son of a Congregational minister, he apprenticed as a civil engineer before travelling to Antananarivo, Madagascar in 1863 on assignment from the London Missionary Society (LMS) to oversee the construction of four churches. After returning to England in 1867, he was ordained in 1870. He returned to Madagascar from 1870 to 1877, leaving again following difficulties with the Malagasy government. After spending a few years in England and South India, he returned to Madagascar again in 1883 and stayed until 1915. He died in 1929 due to a car accident. He and his wife had five children, four of which also become missionaries.  Early life and career  Born in 1836 in Hull, England to the Congregational minister, Rev. James Sibree, and Martha Goode Aston, he attended Hull Collegiate School and apprenticed as a civil engineer at the Local Board of Health in Hull from 1859 to 1863. In 1863, he travelled to Antananarivo, Madagascar after being assigned by the London Missionary Society (LMS) to oversee the architecture of four large stone churches, each of which was dedicated as a memorial to a recent martyr. The churches were located at Ambatonakanga, Ambohipotsy, Andohalo, and Manjakaray. Along with the churches, he was also involved with the construction of other mission buildings before returning to England in 1867. Upon his return, he studied for the Congregational ministry at Spring Hill College in the Moseley area of Birmingham, England from 1868 until 1870. During that time, he acted as a deputator for the LMS. In 1870, he was ordained in Hull and got married. He returned as a LMS missionary to Madagascar in 1870, taking up residence in Ambohimanga and establishing the first country station there. From that station, he managed the mission work operating outside the capital. He was selected as an LMS delegate to help revise the Malagasy Bible in 1873. In 1874, he joined the LMS delegation on a trip to Antsihanaka province, and embarked on another mission-related journey to south-eastern Madagascar in 1876. Later that year he moved to Antananarivo to teach at theological college. In 1877, he left Madagascar due to \\"difficulties with the government.\\" For the next two years, he did deputation work for the LMS in England. In 1879, he was appointed to South India to superintend the high school run by LMS at Vizagapatam. While there, his wife's health deteriorated, forcing them to return in 1880 to England, in which he continued deputation work until 1883. Returning to Madagascar, he continued missionary work along with his wife and became the principal at the theological college. Preceding the French invasion of Madagascar in 1895, he was a vocal advocate of Malagasy independence, insisting the LMS in England adopt the same stance. When his wife's health once again deteriorated in 1915, he retired from his position at the theological college and returned to England. The following year he resigned from mission work, though he continued deputation work for both the LMS and Bible Society throughout the 1920s. During his career, he was a contemporary of the French naturalist Alfred Grandidier.  Publications  In addition to publishing many popular, detailed books about the flora and fauna of Madagascar, the country's general history, and the mission history on the island, he also edited Register of Missionaries and Deputations of the LMS (1923) and wrote several works in the Malagasy language, as well as articles about Madagascar which were published in several editions of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and Chambers's Encyclopaedia. In all, he published sixteen books in English, including his autobiography, Fifty Years in Madagascar (1923) and the following works: * Madagascar and its People (1870) * South-east Madagascar (1876) * The Great African Island (1880) * A Madagascar Bibliography (1885) * Madagascar before the Conquest (1896) * The Madagascar Mission (1907) * Our English Cathedrals (2 volumes, 1911) * A Naturalist in Madagascar (1915) * Things Seen in Madagascar (1921)  Achievements and recognition  James Sibree and his family, c. 1901 In addition to his writing, Sibree regularly designed and built new mission buildings, almost 100 in all, in addition to 50 churches. He was the chief English authority on Madagascar, and was elected as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, as well as the International Society of Philology. His work on the geography and bibliography of the island earned him Sir George Back's Grant in 1892. In 1902, he became a member of the Malagasy Academy (l'Acad√©mie Malgache), and he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of St Andrews in 1913. Sibree's dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus sibreei) was named after him in 1896 by the Swiss zoologist Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major.  Personal life  In 1870, he married Deborah Hannah, the daughter of the Congregational minister in London, Rev. J. Wilberforce Richardson. Together they had two sons and three daughters. Four of his children, also became missionaries: James Wilberforce Sibree (1871‚Äì1927), Marie-Am√©lie Sibree (1874‚Äì1926), Deborah Marie Sibree (1876‚Äì1928), and Elsie Sibree Isabel (1881‚Äì1954). His wife died in 1920, and he died in 1929 at age 93 as a result of a car accident.

Other members of the gang ‚Äì the Schwartz brothers, treat him with contempt but work with him because without a good getaway driver their plans are doomed to failure. During preparation for the next robbery the leader of the gang is killed, and Ho intends to take his place to carry out the robbery. As usual, the first part of the plan is carjacking which is entrusted to Ho. But the police manage to seize him and he is sent to prison. There he sits in a cell with a bum who has received a mere 1,5 months sentence and begins to impersonate him. After 1,5 months pass the guards can no longer distinguish one from the other and Ho manages to get out of jail instead of the tramp. Immediately he creates false documents for himself and returns to the old apartment of his gang. The next day all the newspapers publish front-page articles about the daring escape, calling Holin public enemy number one, a man with nerves of steel, and state that while such a brilliant criminal is on the loose, the criminal world is invincible. Thus the police with the help of journalists hope to provoke Holin to rash acts unaware of his excessive vanity. But he unravels their plan and forces the author of these articles to write the truth. Moreover Holin intends to implement a plan that they developed before his arrest, but the Schwartz brothers refuse to work with him as they have already found a replacement for him. Then Holin goes in search of new associates and finds three small time robbers, who offer participation in a bank robbery. They succeed in the robbery, but soon the police are out on the Holin‚Äôs trail, knowing his weakness for expensive ties and set up ambushes in stores.

His association with Vikram later led to him being offered the role as the main photographer for the actor's films including Dhool (2003) and Majaa (2005). While launching Kokki (2006), director Prabhu Solomon asked Sukumar to make his first foray into cinematography but his reluctance meant that his brother Jeevan, was handed the opportunity. Towards the end of the shoot, Jeevan became busy with other projects and Sukumar was brought in to work on a few portions in the film, including a song shoot in Chalakudi. After Kokki, he worked on other Prabhu Solomon films including Laadam (2009), Mynaa (2010) and Kumki (2012), the latter two, winning him acclaim and fetching him opportunities to work in big budget ventures.

The book was first published in the United States by Farrar, Straus and Giroux on November 12, 2013 and in the United Kingdom on October 4, 2014 through Blackfriars Books. Griffith has stated that the book will be the first in a trilogy and that the second book will be titled Menewood. Hild is a fictionalized telling of the life of Hilda of Whitby, also known as Hild of Streoneshalh, a significant figure in Anglo-Saxon Britain. The book includes a map, a glossary of terms, and a pronunciation guide. Novel summary In seventh-century Britain, small kingdoms are merging. Edwin of Northumbria plots to become the king of all the Angles through force, bribery, and religious coercion. The king's niece Hild grows up bright, curious, and willful in this world of violence and mysticism. She learns to fight with staff and sword and to speak several languages. Although her father has been assassinated, Hild survives to become an advisor to the king and ultimately to other major figures determining England's course in the early medieval age. Development Prior to writing Hild, Griffith began researching Hild and seventh-century Britain, upon which she realized that not much was known about Hild as a historical person. Griffith documented her research on her blog Gem√¶cce and during this process she began wondering about aspects of Hild's life not recorded historically, such as her likes, dislikes, and reasons for choosing specific actions. While writing the character Griffith posited that she had two types of close personal relationship with women outside of her immediate family: her sexual partner and her gem√¶cce. Griffith created the grammatically feminine term gem√¶cce from the Old English masculine word gem√¶cca meaning \\"mate, equal, one of a pair, comrade, companion\\" and \\"husband or wife\\", which she repurposed to refer to a female friend and work partner. As Hild was female and held a position in her uncle's court, Griffith realized that it would be possible for Hild to have sexual partners of either sex. Women of Hild's station would have to worry primarily about being discreet and careful about whom they selected. However Griffith also stated that: Griffith also stated that she wanted to write the book in an immersive style in order to let the reader \\"experience the seventh century, to see, smell, hear, taste and feel what Hild does; to gradually adopt her mindset and worldview; to think as she does, to learn her lessons, feel her joys‚Äîto be her, just for a little while.\\" Reception Critical reception for Hild has been positive and many compared the work to Dame Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall. American historical novelist Cecelia Holland wrote in Locus Magazine that \\"Griffith‚Äôs description of how the little girl Hild foretells some events is deftly done [...] In dealing with the history the book is less effective, and for an interesting reason. Contrast this novel with Hillary Mantel‚Äôs Wolf Hall, which also treats a huge political landscape from the perspective of one character.\\" Mantel could take advantage of the popularity of Tudor history and \\"never had to describe the ins and outs of Tudor politics; she could incorporate whole masses of data by a simple reference. ... Griffith has nothing like this. Very few people know anything at all\\" about fifth-century politics, historical figures, and linguistics. \\"So all this data falls on Hild to divulge, the whole tangle of little kingdoms, the people with names like Coelfrith... and Eadfrith..., the family feuds and the religious undercurrents...\\" In contrast a reviewer for the Chicago Tribune wrote that the book had more in common with T. H. White's The Once and Future King and George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones than with Wolf Hall. Amal El-Mohtar gave the work high praise in an NPR article, writing \\"Hild is a book as loving as it is fierce, brilliant and accomplished. To read it felt like a privilege and a gift.\\" The work also received praise from Publishers Weekly, who named it one of their \\"Books of the Week\\" for November 11, 2013, and the Seattle Times, who named it one of the \\"best titles of 2013\\".

Built as the general cargo ship Margareta in 1984, she was converted to carry cement in 1998 and was en route from Aalborg, Denmark to Runcorn, Cheshire, United Kingdom when she capsized in bad weather and sank in of water. All eight crew were presumed lost. No bodies were recovered, and the ship has been left as a sea grave. Description The ship was long overall, with a beam of . She had a draught of and a height of . The ship was assessed at , , 661 NT. She was powered by a Kl√∂ckner-Humboldt-Deutz 6M 628 diesel engine which produced at 790 rpm. The engine was a four-stroke engine with six cylinders of 240mm diameter by 280mm stroke. It drove a screw propeller, which could propel her at . The ship was also equipped with a 136-kilowatt (182-horsepower) bow thruster. History The ship was built as yard number 126 by Detlef Hegemann Rolandwerft GmbH, Bremen, West Germany. Her keel was laid on 15 February 1984 and she was launched as the general cargo ship Margareta on 31 August. Completion was in November 1984. She was allocated the IMO Number 8403569. Her call sign was DCOG. She had a cargo capacity of 72 twenty-foot equivalent unit. Margareta was built for Thekla Schepers KG and operated under the management of MS Margareta & Co, Haren, West Germany. In May 1995 she was sold to the Margareta ‚Äì Shark Shipping Co NV, Willemstad, Netherlands Antilles and placed under the management of Briese Schiffahrts GMBH & Co KG, Bremen, Germany. In June 1998, she was converted to a cement carrier by Morska Stocznia Remontowa S.A., ≈öwinouj≈õcie, Poland. Pneumatic equipment was installed which enabled her to self load and self discharge. She was allocated the call sign P3ZG9. She was owned and operated by Brise Bereederung, Hamburg, Germany. Following an inspection at Runcorn, Cheshire, on 15 December 2013, Cemfjord was detained due to deficiencies found. The launch apparatus for her lifeboats was inoperative and her safety management did not meet the required standard. There were nine other deficiencies of a lesser nature. She was released from detention on 18 December 2013. At 22:14 on 29 July 2014, Cemfjord ran aground in the Kattegat off L√¶s√∏, Denmark. The authorities were contacted at 01:47 on 30 July and the ship was refloated later that day. Her Russian captain was subsequently convicted of being drunk in charge of the vessel. He was fined DKK 10,000 by a Danish court. A new Polish captain was appointed to take charge of the ship. In August 2014, a second Russian captain in command of Cemfjord was convicted by a court in Stavanger, Norway. The court sentenced him to 35 days imprisonment for steering his ship while being intoxicated, and banned him from being in charge of a ship in Norwegian waters for two years. Sinking On her last voyage, Cemfjord was carrying 2,000 tonnes of cement from Aalborg in Denmark to Runcorn in Cheshire and was due to arrive on 5 January 2015. She was last sighted at 13:00 on 2 January 2015 in the Pentland Firth. At 14:30 on 3 January, her upturned hull was sighted east of the Pentland Skerries by the NorthLink ferry , which was sailing from Shetland to Aberdeen. Only the bow was visible above the waves. The ferry searched for survivors for two and a half hours pending the arrival of lifeboats. No distress call had been received and the weather at the time was bad, with storm force winds. There was no trace of her eight crew, comprising seven Poles and a Filipino. Lifeboats were launched from Longhope, Scrabster, Stromness and Wick. Two helicopters and an aircraft also joined the search for the missing crew members, as did . By mid-afternoon on 4 January, the ship had sunk entirely. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) conducted an investigation into the sinking. An MAIB underwater survey located the vessel on the seabed at a depth of around , east of Muckle Skerry. The wreck was found to be intact but inverted and resting on its superstructure; no evidence was observed of structural failure. It is thought that the Cemfjord may have been overwhelmed so quickly by bad weather that the crew did not have time to evacuate. The MAIB investigation concluded that the ship \\"capsized in extraordinarily violent sea conditions caused by gale force winds and a strong, opposing tidal stream. Such conditions are commonly experienced within the Pentland Firth, were predictable and could have been avoided by effective passage planning. The master‚Äôs decision to take Cemfjord into the Pentland Firth at that time was probably influenced by actual or perceived commercial pressures and his personal determination to succeed.\\" According to the MAIB, the Cemfjord also suffered from \\"significant safety deficiencies relating to its rescue boat launching arrangements and bilge pumping system in the void spaces beneath the cement cargo holds. Both shortcomings were subject to Flag State [Cyprus] approved exemptions from safety regulations; however, the exemption regarding the rescue boat was not applicable to the equipment on board. This resulted from misunderstandings caused by the imprecise nature of the communication between the vessel‚Äôs managers, the Flag State and the Flag State‚Äôs recognised organisation.\\" No bodies were seen or recovered during the survey or subsequently. The ship's owner, Brise of Hamburg, has said that no attempt to raise the wreck would be made and it will be left as a sea grave. Less than two months prior to her sinking, on 7 October 2014 Cemfjord was left with a list in the Pentland Firth, after her cargo shifted. The list was corrected by ballasting the ship.

She served as the First Lady of the U.S. state of Montana from January 1, 1973, until her divorce from Governor Thomas Lee Judge in the winter of 1980. Judge, who was 31 years old when she assumed the role of First Lady in 1973, remains the youngest First Lady in Montana's history. Judge was a longtime advocate for numerous issues, including universal kindergarten, health care reform, and the ratification of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. She worked in nursing and related fields within the healthcare industry for more than 32 years. During her tenure as First Lady, she successfully lobbied for a new law to require mandatory immunizations for Montana school children, which was signed into law in 1979. She campaigned for improved conditions for patients at Montana's state psychiatric hospitals, including Warm Springs State Hospital and Boulder River School and Hospital (now called the Montana Developmental Center). Biography Early life Judge was born Carol Ann Anderson in Los Angeles, California, on June 7, 1941. Her mother Hazel Anderson, was a homemaker and dietician, and her father, Kermit Anderson, owned the Anderson Advertising Agency in Los Angeles. Her family, who were originally from Montana, returned to Helena, Montana, when she was 10 years old. She attended Bryant Elementary School and graduated from Helena High School in 1958. She received a degree in nursing with honors in 1962 from Montana State University. Anderson was assigned to Warm Springs State Hospital, a state- owned psychiatric hospital, as a student nurse in the early 1960s. She was appalled by the poor conditions and lack of staff at Warm Springs. She later took her boyfriend and future husband, then member of the Montana House of Representatives Tom Judge, on what has been described as \\"a behind-the-scenes, eye-opening tour\\" of Warm Springs State Hospital to show the lawmaker the substandard conditions within Montana's mental hospitals. Carol Anderson married Thomas L. Judge in 1966. The couple had two sons, Thomas Warren Judge and Patrick Lane Judge. In 1966, Carol Judge established the Home Health Agency at St. Peter's Hospital, the first home healthcare and visitation program in Helena, Montana. First Lady of Montana Thomas L. Judge, a Democrat, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Montana, in 1968, defeating in 1968. He was elected Governor of Montana in 1972, defeating Ed Smith, a Republican legislator and farmer. Judge took office on January 1, 1973. Carol Judge, who was 31 years old at the time, became the youngest First Lady in the history of Montana, a record she still holds today. Lawrence K. Pettit, Judge's 1972 campaign manager and former brother-in-law of Carol Judge, later wrote of the Judges, \\"Tom and Carol were like Montana's Jack and Jackie, handsome, beautiful and always well presented, with the hint of sophistication and urbanity,\\" in his book, If You Live by the Sword: Politics and in the Making and Unmaking of a University President. First Lady Carol Judge made improvements to the state system of hospitals and psychiatric hospitals a priority during the mid-1970s. She had first encountered poor, substandard conditions at Warm Springs State Hospital as a nursing student during the early 1960s. She visited twelve state hospitals in an effort to call attention to poor living conditions for patients. She wrote and printed a four-page, yellow brochure called \\"Have a Heart: The Human Side of Boulder River School and Hospital and Warm Springs State Hospital,\\" which she distributed to state lawmakers and other influential individuals throughout Montana. In the brochure, Carol Judge wrote specifically about Warm Springs State Hospital, \\"Here, as in Boulder, we find a terrible shortage of staff, poor wages and inadequate housing. Patients are overcrowded in decaying buildings, which are impossible to keep clean, and this encourages the spread of disease. The drab and depressing surroundings lack stimulating things to do for learning, therapy and recreation.\\" She included pictures of the hospitals in the publication. Governor Thomas Judge, in response to the First Lady's campaign, proposed sweeping reforms to the state's mental hospitals, which received solid support from state legislators and other groups. Montana lawmakers increased funding to improve living and working conditions at both Warm Springs State Hospital and the Boulder River School and Hospital. The government of Montana also began a deinstitutionalization of some patients, by moving them out of psychiatric hospitals and into local living centers. Opposition to the group homes was often high in local communities. In response, the operators of the group homes would invite Carol Judge, who was popular as First Lady, to their openings and events to speak with neighbors and community leaders. In the early 1970s, Carol Judge teamed with other U.S. state first ladies to draw attention to low immunization rates among schoolchildren. The campaign became known as \\"Every Child in '76.\\" In 1979, Governor Judge signed legislation to require that all Montana schoolchildren receive mandatory immunizations for certain diseases. Carol Judge underwent treatment for alcoholism during her tenure as First Lady. She then led the campaign to legally classify alcoholism as a disease after the American Medical Association revised its own position. Montana changed its state law to reclassify alcoholism as a disease in 1975. In 1977, Carol Judge was appointed to the Liaison Panel on Alcohol Related Problems for the President's Mental Health Commission. She met with U.S. First Lady Rosalynn Carter in Washington D.C. to discuss alcoholism and mental health issues. In the 1980s, after leaving the position of First Lady, Carol Judge established a state treatment program to treat nurses with substance abuse programs. Governor Thomas L. Judge and Carol Judge separated during the fall of 1979 and divorced during the winter of 1980, ending Judge's tenure as Montana's first lady. Their divorce has been described as public and \\"bitter\\". Her former husband lost his bid for re-election for a third term as governor in 1980, losing the Democratic primary election to his Lieutenant Governor, Ted Schwinden. Schwinden was elected Governor in the 1980 gubernatorial election. Return to nursing Carol Judge returned to the nursing and healthcare fields after her divorce from the Governor. She received a master's degree in psychiatric nursing from Montana State University in 1983. She spearheaded the creation of a new state program to treat nurses from substance abuse during the 1980s. Judge joined the staff of Fort Harrison Veterans Hospital in 1985, where she worked for the next 22-years. During the 2000s, Judge collaborated with other former First Ladies of Montana and a legislator to advocate for the immunization of children by the time they turn 2-years old. In 2006, Carol Judge traveled to Arizona to care for her former husband, Thomas Lee Judge, as his health deteriorated. Thomas Judge died from pulmonary fibrosis in Chandler, Arizona, on September 8, 2006.

ULTRASAT will observe a large patch of sky, alternating every six months between the southern and northern hemisphere. The satellite will be launched into geosynchronous orbit in 2023. All ULTRASAT data will be transmitted to the ground in real time. Upon detection of a transient event, ULTRASAT will provide alerts within 20 minutes to other ground-based and space telescopes to be directed to the source for further observation of the event in other wavelength bands. ULTRASAT will study the hot transient universe. The extra- Galactic volume accessible to ULTRASAT for the discovery of transient sources will be 300 times larger than that of the most sensitive UV satellite to date, GALEX. It is comparable to that of the largest ground-based optical transient survey planned to begin operation in 2022, LSST. The ULTRASAT spacecraft will be constructed by the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), and the telescope will be constructed by the El-Op division of Elbit Systems. ULTRASAT is jointly funded and managed by the Israel Space AgencyIsrael Space Agency, ‚ÄúULTRASAT project‚Äù and the Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS), under the scientific leadership of the WIS, and with a significant contribution of the DESY center of the Helmholtz association. ULTRASAT is planned for a 3-year operation at a GEO orbit. Its small mass and volume, 160 kg and <1m3, allows a launch to GEO as a secondary payload. Background The ULTRASAT initiative was born in 2010 in discussions between Weizmann Institute (WIS) and Caltech scientists together with the Israel Space Agency (ISA) to meet the need for a wide field space telescope for studying transient astronomical events, in a small satellite such as those suitable for SMEX. In the preliminary investigation phase, various other bands were considered, including X-ray. The ultraviolet was selected due to the technology maturity, the higher chances of successful implementation and the need to continue exploring this wavelength region.Barstow, M., 2004 \\"Does ultraviolet astronomy have a future?\\", Astronomy and Geophysics Oct 2004 The importance of this project is confirmed in Gezari et al, 2013,\\"The GALEX Time Domain Survey\\", The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 766, Issue 1, article id. 60 which says that the discovery rate for UV variable sources and UV transients could increase by several orders of magnitude with the launch of a space-based UV mission with a wide field of view (several deg2) and Arcavi et al, 2014, \\"A Continuum of H- to He- rich Tidal Disruption Candidates With a Preference for E+A Galaxies\\", The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 793, Issue 1, article id. 38 which states that \\"The proposed ULTRASAT mission could discover hundreds of tidal disruption events per year in the UV. The project, originally called LIMSAT, was renamed ULTRASAT ‚Äì Ultraviolet TRansient Astronomy SATellite in 2011 when a proposal was submitted to NASA for the [Explorers program] 2012 Mission of Opportunity section, in collaboration with NASA's Ames Research Center. Due to the sequester and NASA budget cuts, no proposal was selected that year. Following considerable changes in the configuration of the telescope, the planned orbit and the satellite bus, a new proposal was submitted in December 2014 in collaboration with JPL, which achieved the rating \\"Category II\\", meaning high scientific and technological merits, but was not selected for financing. The current project will not involve NASA, as indicated above. From a concept of eight small refractive UV telescopes on a satellite in low earth orbit, ULTRASAT evolved to a single wide-field Schmidt telescope in geosynchronous orbit. Science Time domain astronomy has potential for making unusual discoveries. Specifically the ultraviolet (UV) variable sky is relatively poorly explored, even though it offers exciting scientific prospects. Welsh, 2005, describes the discoveries made by GALEX, which would be vastly increased by ULTRASATWelsh et al, 2005, The Astronomical Journal 130 825 doi:10.1086/431222 One field where short cadence UV observations can make a big difference is the explosion marking the death of a star, known as a supernova (plural: Supernovae, abbreviated to SNe). In the article by Ganot, 2015Ganot et al, 2015, ‚ÄúThe detection rate of early UV emission from supernovae: A dedicated GALEX/PTF survey and calibrated theoretical estimates‚Äù it is estimated that ULTRASAT would detect more that 100 SNe per year. The UV signals from SNe precede the optical signal, enabling discovery of the SN at an early stage when the light curve is uncontaminated by later processes. Since for a transient event there is typically no early warning and the event's position in the sky is of statistical nature, most transients are discovered by ground telescopes with limited fields of view, often long after the start of the event, although dedicated surveys are reducing this to around one day. In order to detect transients in large numbers, near continuous observations of large patches of the sky are required. Based on the volume of space monitored and the measured SNe rate (from ground surveys) it is expected that at least 100 such events per year will be detected by ULTRASAT within less than a day of the explosion. The wide field of view and the advanced UV detectors will enable the discovery and monitoring of transient sources within a cosmic volume 300 times larger than that of the most powerful UV satellite to date, GALEX Martin et al, 2005, ‚ÄúThe Galaxy Evolution Explorer: A Space Ultraviolet Survey Mission‚Äù, The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 619, Issue 1, pp. L1-L6). Analysis of the early light curve provides valuable information (stellar radius and surface chemical composition) on the progenitor star (before it exploded) that cannot be found by other means. In supernovae, an initial burst of high intensity in the UV is followed by radiation in longer wavelengths as the ejected material cools. UV can only be observed from space satellites, because of the blocking effect of the ozone; ground telescopes see only the later stages of the event. ULTRASAT has been designed to cover an unprecedentedly large field of view with a highly sensitive UV camera, with repeat image times as short as 5 minutes. To maximize the number of detected events, ULTRASAT will point to regions at high celestial latitudes, avoiding the Milky Way with its high concentration of \\"nearby\\" stars, diffuse background and galactic dust blocking much of the light from distant galaxies where these events occur. Combined space-UV and ground-based optical observations triggered by a UV transient explorer would yield a wealth of data about massive star explosions, going beyond the stellar radius (and thus the stellar class of the progenitor: red or blue supergiant, or W-R star). In addition to detecting early supernovae, ULTRASAT will measure UV light from the large number of stars in its field of view at high temporal resolution, possibly enabling the detection of planetary transits.Gottesman et al, 2012, \\"Exoplanets detection in the UV: ULTRASAT ‚Äì The first Israeli space research mission\\", Israel Physical Society Conference 2012Ofir et al, 2015, \\"Finding unique exoplanets with ULTRASAT\\", International Astronautical Congress 2015, Session B4.2.3 ULTRASAT can also be pointed to \\"Targets of Opportunity\\" when other instruments give an alert for an interesting event. One of the key science goals of ULTRASAT is the discovery of electro-magnetic emission following the detection of Gravitational waves (GW) from the mergers of binaries involving neutron stars, referred to as KilonovaArcavi, Iair, 2018, The First Hours of the GW170817 Kilonova and the Importance of Early Optical and Ultraviolet Observations for Constraining Emission Models, https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aab267. Such detections will be the key to using these events for addressing fundamental physics questions, such as the origin of the heaviest elements and the expansion rate of the universe. ULTRASAT will be able to slew in minutes to >50% of the sky, and its wide field-of-view amply covers the angular error regions expected to be provided by GW detectors in the 2020s. It will provide continuous UV light curves as well as early alerts that will enable ground-based follow-up spectroscopy and monitoring of optical and infrared emission predicted to arise later.

It was founded and is led by Firas Bitar, a captain who defected from the Syrian Arab Army in 2012. Until 2016, its sole opponent was the Syrian Armed Forces and its allied militias; it rejected any fighting with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant until ISIL attacked its fighters in February 2016. In September 2015, the Sham Liberation Army and other rebel groups in the Qalamoun Mountains formed Saraya Ahl al-Sham (; Company of the People of the Levant). History In November 2014, Colonel Abdullah al-Rifai of the 11th Special Forces Division of Saraya Ahl al-Sham was arrested by the Lebanese Armed Forces near Arsal. He was detained by the General Directorate of General Security and released on 2 January 2015. On 14 August, he was assassinated in Arsal. On 30 September 2015, Sham Liberation Army, along with 12 other FSA and Islamist rebel factions, formed Saraya Ahl al-Sham in the western Qalamoun Mountains. The group maintained \\"good\\" relations with al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front and other groups in the former Army of Conquest's Qalamoun branch. In February 2016, the SLA along with eh Saraya Ahl al-Sham rejected the inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, remaining neutral in the conflict and stating that its only opponent is the Syrian government. However, during the eastern Qalamoun offensive (September‚ÄîOctober 2016), the group joined with the other rebels in fighting ISIL. In February 2017, negotiations between Saraya Ahl al-Sham and Hezbollah began in order to install a ceasefire and for residents to return to the contest towns and villages between Hezbollah and the rebels. On 27 May 2017, Tahrir al-Sham and Saraya Ahl al-Sham clashed with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the western Qalamoun Mountains near Arsal. 33 fighters were killed from both sides. On 27 July 2017, a ceasefire agreement was reached by Hezbollah with Tahrir al-Sham and Saraya Ahl al-Sham in the Lebanese portion of the Qalamoun Mountains. The agreement called for Tahrir al-Sham forces to withdraw from Lebanon to Idlib, Saraya Ahl al-Sham forces to withdraw to the eastern Qalamoun Mountains, where opposition forces maintain a pocket of control, and exchanges of prisoners from both sides. On 14 August 2017, the last 400 fighters of Saraya Ahl al-Sham coalition and their families departed the Lebanon‚ÄìSyria border and headed to the eastern Qalamoun Mountains. In April 2018, the SLA, along with the rest of Saraya Ahl al-Sham evacuated to Afrin.

The filaments are visible as the four yellow vertical lines. An LED filament light bulb is an LED lamp which is designed to resemble a traditional incandescent light bulb with visible filaments for aesthetic and light distribution purposes, but with the high efficiency of light emitting diodes (LEDs). It produces its light using LED filaments, which are series- connected strings of diodes that resemble, in appearance, the filaments of incandescent light bulbs. They are direct replacements for conventional clear (or frosted) incandescent bulbs, as they are made with the same envelope shapes, the same bases that fit the same sockets, and work at the same supply voltage. They may be used for their appearance, similar when lit to a clear incandescent bulb, or for their wide angle of light distribution, typically 300¬∞. They are also more efficient than many other LED lamps. History An LED filament type design light bulb was produced by Ushio Lighting in 2008, intended to mimic the appearance of a standard light bulb. Contemporary bulbs typically used a single large LED or matrix of LEDs attached to one large heatsink. As a consequence, these bulbs typically produced a beam only 180 degrees wide. By about 2015, LED filament bulbs had been introduced by several manufacturers. These designs used several LED filament light emitters, similar in appearance when lit to the filament of a clear, standard incandescent bulb, and very similar in detail to the multiple filaments of the early Edison incandescent bulbs. LED filament bulbs were patented by Ushio and Sanyo in 2008. Panasonic described a flat arrangement with modules similar to filaments in 2013. Two other independent patent applications were filed in 2014 but were never granted. The early filed patents included a heat drain under the LEDs. At that time, luminous efficacy of LEDs was under 100 lm/W. By the late 2010s, this had risen to near 160 lm/W.http://www.runlite.cn/en/product- detail-129.html Design The LED filament consists of multiple series- connected LEDs on a transparent substrate, referred to as Chip-On-Glass (COG). These transparent substrates are made of glass or sapphire materials. This transparency allows the emitted light to disperse evenly and uniformly without any interference. An even coating of yellow phosphor in a silicone resin binder material converts the blue light generated by the LEDs into light approximating white light of the desired colour temperature‚Äîtypically 2700K to match the warm white of an incandescent bulb. Degradation of silicone binder, and leakage of blue light are design issues in LED filament lights. A benefit of the filament design is potentially higher efficiency due to the use of more LED emitters with lower driving currents. A major benefit of the design is the ease with which near full \\"global\\" (360¬∞) illumination can be obtained from arrays of filaments, but two zones emitting less light appear diagonal to the substrate. http://yuanleicom.hkhost1.baten.cc/userfiles/file/20160901/20160901084246_29396.pdf Flickering of dimmable filament LED lamp as interference with a digital camera frame rate The lifespan of LED emitters is reduced by high operating temperatures. LED filament bulbs have many smaller, lower power LED chips than other types, avoiding the need for a heatsink, but they must still pay attention to thermal management; multiple heat dissipation paths are needed for reliable operation. The lamp may contain a high thermal conductivity gas (helium) blend to better conduct heat from the LED filament to the glass bulb. The LED filaments can be arranged to optimize heat dissipation. The life expectancy of the LED chips correlates to the junction temperature (Tj); light output falls faster with time at higher junction temperatures (the \\"Auger Droop Effect\\"). Achieving a 30,000 hour life expectancy while maintaining 90% luminous flux requires the junction temperature to be maintained below 85¬∞C. Also worth noting is that LED filaments can burn out quickly if the controlled gas fill is ever lost for any reason. The power supply in a clear bulb must be very small to fit into the base of the lamp. The large number of LEDs (typically 28 per filament) simplifies the power supply compared to other LED lamps, as the voltage per blue LED is between 2.48 and 3.7 volts. Some types may additionally use red LEDs (1.63 V to 2.03 V). Two filaments with a mix of red and blue is thus close to 110 V, and four are close to 220 V to 240 V, compared to the mains voltage reduction to between 3 V and 12 V needed for other LED lamps. Four filaments are usually used, and the appearance is similar to an overrun carbon filament lamp. Typically, a mix of phosphors is used to give a higher color rendering index (as distinct from color temperature) than the early blue LEDs with yellow phosphor. The simple capacitive or resistive dropper power supply used by some cheaper bulbs will cause some flickering at twice the frequency of the mains alternating current, which can be difficult to detect, but possibly contributes to eyestrain and headaches. Also, due to the falling reactance of a capacitor with increasing frequency, the current delivered by capacitive power supplies increases with mains frequency, e.g., from 50 to 60 Hz.
