Early life Born on September 26, 1921, in Baltimore, Maryland, Murray moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, at age one. After graduating from Wilmington's New Hanover High School in 1938, he attended the University of North Carolina. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942, after his third year of college. World War II Arriving in northeastern France in October 1944, Murray was assigned as a replacement platoon leader to Company C of the 30th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. The division had landed in Saint-Tropez on the southern coast of France months earlier and was pushing northward towards Germany. On December 8 of that year, Murray became company commander. Early on December 16, Company C crossed the Weiss River in the northern Vosges Mountains and established a defensive position atop Hill 512, just south of the village of Kaysersberg. Later that morning, Murray, by then a first lieutenant, led a platoon-sized group on a reconnaissance mission to the southeast, towards Ammerschwihr. Descending the vineyard-covered hill along a winding footpath, the group noticed German soldiers in a sunken road, about away, firing on an American hilltop position. Creeping forward to a point from which he could see the German unit, about 200 men strong, Murray made a radio call for artillery support. When the artillery landed slightly off target, he attempted to call for a range correction but the radio went dead. Not wanting to send his patrol against the much larger German force, he retrieved rifle grenades from his men and returned to his vantage point to begin a single- handed attack on the position. Although his fire alerted the Germans to his location, he continued to shoot grenades and later an automatic rifle into the German unit. As the soldiers attempted to withdraw, he disabled a truck which was carrying out three mortars. Members of his patrol brought up their own mortar, and Murray directed its fire until the Germans had scattered towards Ammerschwihr. Continuing on the footpath, he and his men captured ten German soldiers. An eleventh soldier approached him with his helmet off and his arms raised. When Murray turned to shout orders, the soldier tossed a grenade; the explosion knocked Murray to the ground and sent eight pieces of shrapnel into his left leg. After getting back to his feet, he stopped his men from killing the prisoner. Only after organizing the patrol into a defensive position did he turn over command of the company and find an aid station. Murray with his wife Anne after returning from Europe in September 1945 After receiving medical treatment, Murray rejoined his unit on December 28, 1944. He learned that he had been recommended for the Medal of Honor in March of the next year and, per Army policy, was soon removed from combat. He remained with his division and was in Salzburg, Austria, on May 7, 1945, when a ceasefire was declared. The next day, Germany's surrender was finalized and the war in Europe was over. Murray was issued the Medal of Honor on August 1, 1945, eight months after the fight near Kaysersberg. It was formally presented to him during a ceremony in Salzburg, with the entire 3rd Infantry Division in attendance. He arrived home in Wilmington in September to a hero's welcome, but later returned to Europe and served four years of occupation duty. During this time, he was stationed in Salzburg and became the head U.S. intelligence officer in that city. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Murray received three Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars with Valor devices, a Purple Heart, and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his World War II service. Later life Murray being congratulated at his military retirement ceremony at Fort Jackson on July 30, 1973 Murray remained in the Army after World War II, serving with the 82nd Airborne Division and participating in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. He eventually rose to the rank of colonel and commanded the 3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard), a ceremonial unit tasked with guarding the Tomb of the Unknowns, among other duties. In 1970, he transferred to Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina, from where he retired in 1973. As a civilian, Murray worked for the South Carolina Department of Corrections until his final retirement. He and his wife, Anne, lived in Columbia, South Carolina until his death from congestive heart failure on August 12, 2011.Langer, Emily, \\"Retired Col. Charles P.

A cigarette case (sometimes called a cigarette tin) is a sturdy container used to store small numbers of cigarettes and prevent them from being crushed. A typical cigarette case is a flat box (commonly made of metal) that opens symmetrically into two halves. Each half stores a row of cigarettes, which are often held in place by a spring or an elastic strap. Some cigarette cases are simply sturdy cases used to store standard cigarette packs.  Types and uses  In modern times cigarette cases are also made of plastic. Some cigarette cases come with additional features, such as built-in lighters or ashtrays. A cigarette box, much like a cigar humidor, is a larger item often stored on desktops or coffee tables. Made of wood, metal, glass, or ceramic, a cigarette box holds a larger number of cigarettes for use by the homeowner and guests. Typical cigarette tins in the United States of the 1920s–1930s stored 50 cigarettes.

Common \\"silver cigarette cases\\" are most often chrome-plated, although there are silver- plated or polished aluminum cases in addition to genuine sterling ones. Cigarette cases used to be popular with soldiers, and many World War I and World War II veterans (e.g., James Doohan) stated that cigarette cases saved their lives by stopping bullets. In 2003 the European Union witnessed a surge in cigarette case sales, attributable to the introduction of prominent black- bordered warning labels on cigarette packs, e.g., \\"Smokers Die Younger\\", etc., by an EU directive in January 2003. Cigarette cases were a way to avoid the invasive labels (another way being various satirical stickers, with slogans such as \\"You could be hit by a bus tomorrow\\").

Indian rebels attacked a column of British troops which had relieved a garrison at Agra, but although they surprised the column, they were defeated and dispersed. This allowed the British to establish communications across all of Northern India, and to concentrate troops for the vital Relief of Lucknow. Background Before the rebellion broke out, Agra was an important centre of British administration and commerce. Stationed in the military cantonments nearby were the 3rd Bengal Fusiliers (a \\"European\\" regiment of infantry of the East India Company's army), a battery of artillery also manned by white troops, and the 44th and 67th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry. The loyalty of the sepoys (Indian soldiers) of the Bengal Army had been wavering for several years, as they feared that the actions and reforms of the East India Company were threatening Indian society and their own caste and status. After increasing unrest during the early months of 1857, the sepoys at Meerut broke into rebellion on 10 May 1857. They subsequently moved to Delhi, where they called on more sepoys to join them, and for the Emperor Bahadur Shah II to lead a nationwide rebellion. News of the revolt spread fast. In Agra, the news prompted the local British commanders to disarm the two Bengal Native Infantry regiments on 31 May, thus forestalling any potential uprising, although the regiments had apparently made no hostile moves in the fortnight since news of the events at Delhi had reached them. Nevertheless, the news of the events at Delhi and the increasing unrest in the countryside prompted 6,000 refugees (British civilians and their families and servants) to converge on Agra and take shelter in the historic Agra Fort. Although the fort was well provisioned, the sanitation and medical facilities were poor. After an uprising in the city in June, the British were blockaded in the Fort. They endured a desultory siege for three months. Morale was poor, and the understrength Bengal Fusiliers were mainly raw and untrained troops. Delhi however, was too strong an attraction for the sepoys and other rebels. Many thousands of these moved to Delhi, where they were unable to dislodge a British force on the ridge to the north-west, but none of the rebel leaders there attempted to organise a force to clear the comparatively easy target of Agra. Relief On 21 September, the Siege of Delhi ended with the storming of the city by the British. Within days, the victorious besiegers had organised columns which secured the countryside around the city. The strongest column consisted of 750 British soldiers, and 1,900 Sikh and Punjabi soldiers, under Brigadier Edward Greathed (formerly the commanding officer of the 8th (King's) Regiment). It moved out of the city on 24 September. Several officers were surprised that the column was able to move so promptly, given the exhausted and debauched state of many units after the siege and storming of the city. Greathed's column moved along the Grand Trunk Road, taking indiscriminate punitive measures against several Indian villages. Although Greathed intended to move directly to Cawnpore, which had been recaptured by the British in July (see Siege of Cawnpore), he received several urgent requests for aid from Agra. Some of the rebels who had retreated from Delhi were said to have rallied at Muttra near Agra, and the garrison were alarmed at what seemed to be an imminent threat. Greathed accordingly marched his troops and his large baggage train of elephants, camels and bullock carts to Agra in twenty-eight hours. On arrival, his force received a cool reception from the garrison. His battle-weary British troops in worn khaki dress were mistaken at first for Afghan tribesmen by some of the civilians. By contrast the soldiers of the garrison were still splendid in scarlet uniforms with pipeclayed white belts. The battle Having recovered from their earlier state of panic, the senior officers of the garrison now assured Greathed that the enemy had retreated across the Khara Naddi, a stream distant. Fatigued and without any apparent danger, the column retired to rest without posting sufficient pickets. Greathed himself went to take breakfast in the fort. Taking advantage of this lapse in security, the rebels launched a surprise attack. Round shot from 12 sepoy cannons raked the British bivouac area. Cavalry descended upon the British, musket balls filled the air and there was hand-to-hand combat between the British and their attackers. The veteran British, Sikhs and Punjabis nevertheless rallied, fell into their ranks, and returned the fire. The British cavalry outflanked the attackers on both flanks. The rebels fled, but regrouped and tried to stand along the road to Gwalior. Grape shot from British cannon and a cavalry charge broke their line. The British cavalry then pursued those fleeing for miles. Results This small but fierce action broke organised opposition to the British between Delhi and Cawnpore. Most of the victory was due to the hardbitten British and Indian troops, who had been marching and fighting continuously for four months. They were very short of British officers, and Greathed himself was regarded disparagingly by many of his junior officers. (He nevertheless led a brigade at the Relief of Lucknow and the Second Battle of Cawnpore.)

The film was produced by Larry Schlessinger, Lisa Halpern, and Emery for the True Stories Project, Emery's production company. The original version of the film premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival in May 2005. After a successful run in the festival circuit (see below), the film was edited further and received its theatrical premiere in July, 2007 at the Seattle Cinerama. Synopsis From the official website: :What do you get when you fall in love? \\"Inlaws & Outlaws\\" cleverly weaves together the true stories of couples and singles— both gay and straight — and all into a collective narrative that is as hilarious as it is heartbreaking. :At the top of the film, you meet real people one on one. You don’t know who’s gay or straight or who’s with whom. As their stories unfold and stereotypes fall by the wayside, you won’t care because you’ll be rooting for everybody. With candor, good humor, great music and real heart, Inlaws & Outlaws gets past all the rhetoric to embrace what we have in common: We love. Distribution Since its theatrical premiere, Inlaws & Outlaws has been distributed through the True Stories Project's Hearts + Minds Campaign a grassroots distribution mechanism where the film is presented largely by community activists, LGBT and marriage equality organizations, colleges & universities and congregations.

Life Lloyd began racing in 1969. In 1972 he came seventh in the Milk Race before going on to win the William Tell GP, beating Francesco Moser and Freddy Maertens, and riding in the Munich Olympics. In 1973 he turned professional with Raleigh, and over the next three years he won the national 5000m pursuit championship twice and set a national 50-mile road record. In 1976 a heart condition forced a three-year break from cycling. On recovery he restarted as an amateur and over six years won 125 of 133 races. In 1982 he won the Points, King of the Mountains and Overall in the Girvan 3-Day beating a strong field of riders that included Paul Curran, Joey McLoughlin and Jeff Williams. In 1984 he returned to the professional sport, and finally retired from cycling two years later. Lloyd was a framebuilder for 13 years. Living in south Wirral, he is now a cycling coach and is behind The Dave Lloyd Mega Challenge. In September 2009 he planned to return to amateur road racing by entering the Derby Mercury road race.

He was the great-great grandson of Jean Baptiste I Chiquot (or Cicot, Sicotte/Cicotte), who was born in France and immigrated to New France in 1662. He was the third child of twelve born to Jean Baptiste Cicotte and Angelica Poupard. His birthdate is disputed, ranging from 1775 to 1781. Brothers and sisters include older sisters Angelique and Agathe and younger siblings Joseph, Theresa, John Baptiste, James, Francis Assisi, Francois Xavier, Louis, Marianna and George. His grandfather, Zacharie, was an only child. His great grandfather was Jean Baptiste II Sicotte, the only son of the original Sicotte/Cicotte to come to North America. Around 1802, Cicott arrived in the area to trade with the local Indians up and down the Wabash River. He was successful and became wealthy. He married a Potawotomie woman and they had two children, John Battiece and Sophia. Shortly before the War of 1812, General William Henry Harrison at Vincennes directed Cicott to join him there to act as an army scout since he was very familiar with the area. He left Warren County immediately and went down the river, returning later with the army and passing back through Warren County to reach Tippecanoe County where the Battle of Tippecanoe took place on November 7, 1811. Around 1816, after the war was over, Cicott resumed his trading on the Wabash. In 1817 he built a log house which became a rendezvous for travelers and settlers, and in 1832 he platted the town of Independence, Indiana and lived there until his death in 1850; he was buried in the town cemetery. For some years before his death he was partially paralyzed, probably from a stroke, and had difficulty speaking. As of 1883 the log house still stood, though it was badly deteriorated. Cicott Park, located at Independence, was established in 1993 and contains the site of his home and trading post.

The vessel was named in honor of Chehalis, a city in Lewis County, Washington. Chehalis was laid down on 6 November 1943 at Savage, Minnesota, by Cargill, Inc.; launched on 15 April 1944; sponsored by Mrs. John H. MacMillan, Sr.; and commissioned on 5 December 1944, Lt. Edward G. Rifenburgh, D-M, USNR, in command.  World War II service  Following her shakedown, Chehalis cleared Galveston, Texas, on 5 January 1945 to call at San Diego, California, en route to Pearl Harbor, which she reached on 6 February. Until 14 April, she carried out fueling operations in the Hawaiian Islands and at Canton in the Phoenix group, aiding the many ships conducting their training in these areas. Sailing west, she put into Kossol Roads, Palaus, before arriving in San Pedro Bay, Philippine Islands, on 5 May with a cargo of aviation gasoline and lubricants for forces in the Philippines. For the next three months, she fueled motor torpedo boats and U.S. Army crash boats operating along the Leyte coast, and from 6 August to 23 November provided similar service to motor torpedo boats at Okinawa, her crew developing \\"a fine sense of familiarity with their battle stations\\" despite never being a direct target of Japanese aircraft during the course of hostilities.  Surviving typhoons  Thrice during Chehalis's time at Okinawa, twice in September and once in October, typhoons forced a suspension of normal operations and compelled the ship to get underway to ride out the storms. Having finished her task in the western Pacific Ocean, the ship departed Buckner Bay on 26 November for Olympia, Washington, reaching her destination on 19 December to receive the \\"warm welcome of the people of the city of Chehalis...who had paid for the ship with their war bonds [and who] expressed their thanks to the Navy in the hospitality shown her crew.\\"  Post-war activity  After overhaul at Puget Sound, Chehalis returned to the Hawaiian Islands on 23 March 1946, and for the next three and a half years carried aviation gasoline, airplane lubricating oil, and diesel oil among the Hawaiian group and to the Pacific islands to the westward, calling at Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Samoa, Canton Island, Kwajalein, Midway Island, Saipan, Truk, Manus, Iwo Jima, and Eniwetok.  Disaster in Samoa  At 01:23 (Samoan time) on 7 October 1949, as Chehalis lay alongside the navy dock at Tutuila, American Samoa, one of her gasoline tanks exploded, killing six of her 75-man crew. The ship burst into flames, capsized, and sank in 45 feet of water. She later slid off the ledge, atop of which she had originally sunk, into 150 feet of water. She was stricken from the Naval Register on 27 October 1949. Her salvaged hulk was later sold to the government of American Samoa in a contract entered into on 21 October 1955. Chehalis was carrying a cargo of ammunition and petroleum when it sank. After evidence of significant leakage of fuel from the wrecked ship, environmental risk assessments indicated that the remaining fuel aboard needed to be removed. The fuel was removed by April 2010, but no steps were taken to remove the ammunition aboard the wreck as it was not considered to be necessary.

Biography Oresko was born in Bayonne, New Jersey on January 18, 1917. He was the descendant of Ukrainian people.Ukrainian Institute of National Memory (in Ukrainian) World War II He joined the US Army in March 1942.WWII Army Enlistment Records He was sent to Europe and arrived in France in September 1944, three months after the Normandy landings. A platoon sergeant in Company C, 1st Battalion, 302nd Infantry Regiment, 94th Infantry Division, he spent the next several months with his unit mopping up pockets of German soldiers who had been bypassed in the Allies' initial push through the northern part of France. In December 1944, the 93th Division was redeployed to replace the 90th Infantry Division as part of General Patton's Third Army. The 95th Division assumed positions opposite the Westwall and the German's 11th Panzer Division. On January 23, 1945, near Tettingen, Germany, Master Sergeant Oresko single-handedly and under enemy fire, took out a German bunker position that was armed with a machine gun. Seriously wounded by another enemy machine gun from another bunker, he attacked that bunker under fire and destroyed that enemy position. Nine months later on October 30, 1945, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. President Harry Truman formally presented Oresko the medal during a ceremony at the White House. Post World War II In 2015, the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory produced posters depicting ten outstanding Ukrainians who fought during World War II. Among them was Nicholas Oresko. In September 2017, an Army Reserve Army School System Building at Fort Lee, VA was named in his honor. Death Oresko died while undergoing surgery for a broken femur on October 4, 2013. He was 96 years old. Medal of Honor citation Master Sergeant Oresko's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > M/Sgt. Oresko was a platoon leader with Company C, in an attack against > strong enemy positions. Deadly automatic fire from the flanks pinned down > his unit. Realizing that a machinegun in a nearby bunker must be eliminated, > he swiftly worked ahead alone, braving bullets which struck about him, until > close enough to throw a grenade into the German position.

Unlike other more sectarian churches, the Evangelical Association does not forbid its member congregations to simultaneously belong to other denominations and fellowships, as the local churches continue to practice congregational polity.  History  The EA began in 1998 from meetings between the clergy of First Protestant Church in New Braunfels, Texas and St. John's Evangelical Protestant Church in Cullman, Alabama, two large UCC congregations of Evangelical and Reformed (German Protestant) heritage. A core group resulting from interested churches of like mind brought about this initiative to provide a more orthodox alternative fellowship to the UCC in particular matters such as ministerial placement and foreign missions work. Many of the founding churches had been active in the Biblical Witness Fellowship organization, a renewal group similar to others in connectional denominations such as the United Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church (USA). The incident that caused many of the EA's current congregations to depart the UCC was that denomination's action at its 2005 General Synod to permit same-sex marriages. Some congregations that had been considering disaffiliation expedited the process in order to disassociate from national entities as quickly as possible. Nearly 300 churches withdrew from the UCC over a four-year period following the General Synod's measure. As of September 2017, the Association listed 105 congregations as affiliates, with Pennsylvania and North Carolina having the greatest concentration of churches. The congregations in the EA represent all five strands of the UCC, including Reformed, Evangelical, Congregational, Christian and German Congregational Churches. Unlike the UCC, the EA is a dues-paying organization, which means that it is not reliant on congregational benevolent support, as the UCC's conferences and national entities are; there is also no \\"free-riding,\\" e.g., a congregation receiving services from the organization without paying for them.  Faith & Practice  Members of Cross Community Church, an EA affiliated congregation in Berne, Indiana, pose for a photo published on the Evangelical Association's Desk Calendar The EA requires its constituent churches to affirm both the Apostles' Creed and Nicene Creed and to subscribe to a statement of faith, which explicitly proclaims exclusive salvation in Jesus Christ and denounces extramarital sexual activity or encouragement of the same. Other than those requirements for membership, the EA considers each local congregation as a \\"complete church\\" that possess all of the rights and responsibilities of the Universal Church as bestowed upon it by the Holy Spirit and set forth in God's Word. Each local church has the right to govern its own affairs, including the right to ordain its own clergy. Local churches ordain in a manner similar to other Congregational bodies, through ecclesiastical councils made up of area ecumenical Christian clergy who review candidates who have completed either a Bible college or seminary education.\\"Guidelines for Ordination,\\" Evangelical Association of Reformed & Congregational Christian Churches: Getting Affiliated: How ministers, individuals, and churches gain recognition. The combination of creedal subscription on the one hand and the rights of self-governance on the other makes the EA very similar to Lutheran denominations, which reflects the Evangelical Synod heritage of some of its congregations. Otherwise, the polity is in effect almost identical to that of the UCC, which almost all the group's congregations once belonged to. EA churches recognize two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion, which local churches are permitted to administer according to their own customs; like the UCC, the EA has no official doctrine pertaining to those ordinances. EA churches administer both infant and adult baptism, by sprinkling (namely among former E&R; congregations) or believers' baptism by immersion (former Christian Connection churches).

The Seychelles (Isle de Séchelles) were part of the French Empire from 1770 until 1814. The islands were transferred to Great Britain under the Treaty of Paris in 1814. The Seychelles islands were captured and freed several times during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. They are descendants of French, British, and other European, Creole, Chinese, Indian and African. Like the French colonists of North Africa, they are called Pieds-Noirs in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, French-speaking Switzerland, Andorra and Monaco. They consist of the descendants of French people dissatisfied with British colonial rule. Many Seychelles citizens migrated to Europe during and after the Second World War. Seychellois students sent to study in Britain formed the first Seychelles Student Association. Origins of the diaspora There was a modest Seychellois community in Kenya,Eusauo Tanganyika, Uganda, Zanzibar, Congo and Rhodesia who were compelled to leave after independence of those countries. They migrated mostly to Britain, Canada and Australia. Seychelles nationals migrated to Britain under a special colonial work quota agreement because of the economic situation in Seychelles; many worked in catering, hotels and hospitals. A large number went to Italy. At this time, a program was set up to recruit young SeychelloisSeynews for the British Army. Another significant migration of Seychelles people to Europe was after the coup-d'etat on 5 June 1977, when many families fled the Seychelles and go into exile across the European Union mostly in Britain, France, the Netherlands and Germany. This continued until 1991 when a multi-party government returned to Seychelles. A significant number of students who came to Europe to study do not want to return to Seychelles when they complete their studies, having found employment and made their homes in the EU. As a result of the tourism industry, many Seychelles nationals have married EU nationals and have come to live in the EU. In spite of political and economic change many young Seychelles nationals choose to migrate to the EU for economic reasons. It is estimated Seychellois residing in the EU number 17,000 – 21,000. The communities are in Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Britain, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, and also some of the new member states of the EU. Switzerland also has a Seychellois community. They also have a pan-European organisation, through which their affairs are looked after by leading families and unofficially elected representatives. They have a portal where some information and history can be researched. Under the Treaty of Rome, they lobbied with important support from president François Mitterrand, and other European heads of state, that they be given the rights to be responsible for their French, European archaic, heritage and other rights due under the EU Human Rights Charter. They have contributed very importantly that political and democratic change came to Seychelles under a joint exile return program started in 1986/7 under the Seychelles International Repatriation Onward Program, which included most of the exiled political faction. They continue to play an important role in supporting democracy and economic progress in Seychelles. They are very active in the EU promoting their history, culture and community needs. They have made many efforts to acquire voting rights like Mauritius nationals – this has not happened. They also support a political party of their choosing and fly to Seychelles for important election. Under the Schengen agreement, Seychelles nationals do not require visas to visit or enter the EU and are allowed to remain up to six months. It is yet to become official.European Union visa lists Exodus The French Wars of Religion began with a massacre at Vassy on 1 March 1562, when 23 Huguenots (some sympathetic sources say hundreds of them) were killed, and about 200 were wounded. The Huguenots transformed themselves into a definitive political movement thereafter. Protestant preachers rallied an army and cavalry, which came under the leadership of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny. Henry of Navarre and the House of Bourbon allied themselves with the Huguenots. This added wealth and holdings to the Protestant strength, which at its height grew to sixty fortified cities, and posed a serious threat to the Catholic crown and Paris over the next three decades. Protestantism spread throughout France in the 16th century and led to civil wars. Henry IV, of the Bourbon dynasty, issued the Edict of Nantes (1598), granting religious tolerance to the Huguenots. They were forced into exile and fled, mainly to Britain and North America. A large community found their way to South Africa, Mauritius, Réunion and thence to Seychelles. Indian Ocean early discovery Louis XVI of France The history of Isle de Séchellestyreldepoix Seychelles, Isle D'abondance and Isle Labourdonais is unknown prior to European colonisation. Polynesians, who eventually settled in Madagascar, perhaps lingered here, circa 200–300 BC. Arab navigators on trading voyages across the Indian Ocean were probably aware of the islands, although they did not settle them. A manuscript dated AD 851, written by an Arab merchant, refers to the Maldives and higher islands beyond them, which may refer to the Seychelles. Arabs were trading coco de mer nuts, found only in Seychelles, long before European discovery of the islands. The nuts sink in water, so it is unlikely they were found, as the Arabs claimed, washed ashore in the Maldives. The Chinese may have encountered the islands during the Tang Dynasty, according to a recent documentary. In 1502, Vasco da Gama sighted islands which became known as the Amirantes, during his crossing from India to East Africa. The granitic islands began to appear on Portuguese charts as the Seven Sisters. In March 1608, a trading fleet of the English East India Company set sail for India. Lost in a storm, the Ascension's crew saw \\"high land\\" on 19 January 1609 and headed for it. They anchored \\"as in a pond\\". They found plentiful fresh water, fish, coconuts, birds, turtles and giant tortoises with which to replenish their stores. The Ascension sailed, and reported what they had found, but the British took no action. Towards the end of the 17th century, pirates arrived in the Indian Ocean from the Caribbean and made a base in Madagascar, from where they preyed upon vessels approaching and leaving the Red Sea and the Gulf. The French had occupied the Ile de France (renamed Mauritius by the British in 1810) since 1710. This colony was growing in importance, and in 1735 an energetic administrator, Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais (1699–1723) was appointed. His brief was to protect the French sea route to India. La Bourdonnais, himself a sailor, turned his attention to making a speedier passage from Mauritius to India. To this end, in 1742, he sent an expedition under the command of Lazare Picault to accurately chart the islands northeast of Madagascar. On 21 November 1742, the Elisabeth and the Charles anchored off Mahé at Anse Boileau (not Baie Lazare, later mistakenly named as Picault's landing place). They found a land of plenty. In fact, Picault named the island Île d’Abondance. Picault's mapping was poor, so in 1744 he was sent back and renamed the main island Mahé, and the group the Iles de la Bourdonnais. He had high hopes for the Iles de la Bourdonnais. However, the islands were once more forgotten when La Bourdonnais was replaced in 1746. The outbreak of war between France and England reminded the authorities on Mauritius about the islands. Two ships were sent to claim them, commanded by Corneille Nicholas Morphey. He renamed the largest island Île de Séchelles in honour of Viscount Jean Moreau de Séchelles, Minister of Finance during the reign of Louis XV of France. The name was later Anglicised to Seychelles. This was later used for the island group, whilst Mahé was again used for the largest granitic island. Morphey took possession for his king and the French East India Company on 1 November 1756. The end of the Seven Years' War and France's corresponding loss of Canada and status in India, caused the decline of the French East India Company, which had formerly controlled Mauritius. This settlement, and thus Seychelles, now came under direct royal authority. The new intendant of Mauritius, Pierre Poivre (1719–1786), was determined to break the Dutch East Indies monopoly of the lucrative spice trade. He thought Mahé would be perfect for spice cultivation. In 1768, Nicolas Dufresne arranged a commercial venture, sending ships to collect timber and tortoises from the Seychelles. During this expedition, French sovereignty was extended to cover all the islands of the granitic group on Christmas Day. In 1769, the navigators Rochon and Grenier proved that a faster route to India could safely be taken via the Seychelles and thus the importance of Seychelles' strategic position became realised. Meanwhile, Poivre had finally obtained seedlings of nutmeg and clove, and 10,000 nutmeg seeds. His attempts to propagate them on Mauritius and Bourbon (later Réunion) met with little success and he thought again of Seychelles. It was considered fortuitous when Brayer du Barré (unknown-1777), arrived on Mauritius with royal permission to run a settlement on St Anne at his own expense. On 12 August 1770, 15 white colonists, seven slaves, five Indians and one African woman settled on St Anne. Du Barré stayed in Mauritius seeking funds. After reports of initial success, he begged the government for more money. However, reports reached the authorities that ship captains could get no supplies of fresh produce from the islands. Du Barré's appeals for help to Mauritius and Versailles fell on deaf ears. In desperation, he went to the Seychelles to try to rescue the situation, but to no avail. A ruined man, he left for India and died there shortly afterwards. In 1771, Poivre sent Antoine Gillot to Seychelles to establish a spice garden. By August 1772, Du Barré's people had abandoned St Anne and moved to Mahé or returned home. Gillot worked on at Anse Royale, establishing nutmeg, clove, cinnamon and black pepper plants. When British ships were seen around Seychelles, the authorities were spurred into action, dispatching a garrison under Lieutenant Charles Routier de Romainville,CGB Reunion also a cartographer. In October 1778, they built L'Etablissement du RoiNation (Royal Settlement) on the site of modern Victoria. Gillot was nominally in charge of the civilian colonists, but had no real authority over them. Mauritius sent as Jean Baptiste Philogene de Malavois replacement. He drew up 30 decrees which protected the timber and tortoises. In future, only sound farming techniques and careful husbanding of resources would be tolerated. He assumed command of the settlement in 1788. In 1790, as a result of the French Revolution, the settlers formed a Colonial Assembly, and decided they would run their colony themselves, according to their own constitution. Land in Seychelles should only go to the children of existing colonists, who should dispose of the colony's produce as they chose, not as Mauritius dictated. They did not want abolition of slavery, as they believed that without labour that was free of cost to them, they could not survive. Jean-Baptiste Queau de Quincy (1748–1827), whose name was later Anglicized to Quincy, took command of the colony in 1794. A wily man, he used skill and expediency to steer Seychelles through the years of war ahead. Seychelles acted as a haven for French corsairs (pirates carrying lettres de marque entitling them to prey legally on enemy shipping). Quincy hoped this might go unnoticed, but in 1794 a squadron of three British ships arrived. The British commodore, Henry Newcome, gave Quincy an hour in which to surrender. Through skilful negotiations, Quincy obtained a guarantee of his honour and property and surrendered. The British made no effort to take over the Seychelles; it was considered a waste of resources. The settlers decided that unless they were sent a garrison, they could not be expected to defend the French flag. Therefore, they would remain neutral, supplying all comers. The strategy worked. The colony flourished. Quincy's favourable terms of capitulation were renewed seven times during the visits of British ships. On 11 July 1801 the French frigate Chiffonne arrived with a cargo of French prisoners sent into exile by Napoleon. Then HMS Sybille arrived. Quincy had to try to defend the Chiffonne, but after a brief battle, the Chiffonne was taken. Captain Adam of the Sybille wanted to know why Quincy had interfered, in contravention of his capitulation terms. Quincy managed to talk his way out of the difficulty, and even persuaded Adam to agree to Seychelles' vessels flying a flag bearing the words Seychelles Capitulation, allowing them to pass through the British blockade of Mauritius unmolested. Napoleon I On 15 September 1801, a memorable sea battle took place just off the settlement. The British ship Victor was seriously disabled by damage to her rigging, but she was able to manoeuvre broadside to the French vessel La Flêche and rake her with incessant fire. La Flêche began to sink. Rather than surrender her, her captain ran her aground, torching her before abandoning ship. The opposing commanders met ashore afterwards, the Englishman warmly congratulating his French counterpart on his courage and skill during the battle. The British tightened the blockade on the French Indian Ocean colonies. Réunion surrendered, followed in December 1810 by Mauritius. In April 1811, Captain Beaver arrived in Seychelles on the Nisus to announce the preferential terms of Quincy's capitulation should stand, but Seychelles must recognise the terms of the Mauritian surrender. Beaver left behind a Royal Marine lieutenant, Bartholomew Sullivan, to monitor the Seychelles situation. There was little Sullivan could do alone to stop the settlers continuing to provision French frigates and slavers. Slave ownership was not then against British law, although slave trading was. Sullivan, later given the title of Civil Agent, played cat and mouse with the pro-slaver colonists. Once, acting on a tip-off, Sullivan was rowed over to Praslin and was able to confiscate a cargo of newly landed slaves. It was but a small triumph amidst many frustrations, and Sullivan, complaining that the Seychellois had \\"no sense of honour, shame or honesty\\", resigned. The first civilian administrator of the British regime was Edward Madge. He had a bitter feud with Quincy, who remained in the administration as Justice of the Peace. In the following years, the islands became a backwater ticking over quietly. Seychellois landowners had a pleasant life, though making ends meet given the fickle markets for their produce was not always easy. The British had allowed all customary French practices to remain in place. The administrator may have been British, reporting to London, but he governed according to French rules. The biggest grievance the colonists had with their new masters was the colony's dependence on Mauritius. The other cloud on the planters' horizon was British anti-slavery legislation. In 1835, slavery was completely abolished. The plantations were already in decline, their soils exhausted by years of cultivation without investment in renewing fertility. The plantocracy believed they could not farm without free labour. Some planters took their slaves and left. The liberated slaves had no land, and most squatted on the estates they had tended in bondage, working sporadically to keep themselves from starvation, but generally refusing to work at all. It was a poor sort of freedom, and the colony entered a period of stagnation. There were no exports, and no money to pay for new infrastructure. The situation was only improved when planters realised they could grow coconuts with less labour and more profit than the traditional crops of cotton, sugar, rice, and maize. Soon, they also had a source of virtually free labour once again. The British took their anti-slavery stance seriously, and operated patrols along the East African coast, raiding Arab dhows transporting slaves to the Middle East. Slaves liberated south of the Equator were brought to Seychelles, and apprenticed to plantation owners. They worked the land in return for rations and wages. Over a period of thirteen years from 1861, around 2,400 men, women and children were brought to Seychelles. The town, called Victoria since 1841, began to grow. Licences granted in 1879 give some idea of the range of businesses in the town. There was a druggist, two auctioneers, five retailers, four liquor stores, a notary, an attorney, a jeweller, and a watchmaker. There was a disaster on 12 October 1862, when torrential rain and strong winds hit Mahé. An avalanche of mud and rocks fell on the town from the hills. It has been estimated that over 70 persons lost their lives. Seychelles yearned to be a colony in its own right. The authorities in the mother colony supported them. Sir Arthur Gordon, the Mauritian governor, sent a petition on their behalf to London. Concessions were made, but Seychelles did not become a Crown Colony in its own right until 1903, when its first Governor, Sir Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott took office. Befitting its new status, the colony acquired a botanical gardens, and a clock tower in the heart of Victoria. The British, like the French before them, saw Seychelles as a useful place to exile troublesome political prisoners. Over the years, Seychelles became a home to prisoners from Zanzibar, Egypt, Cyprus and Palestine, to name but a few. The first in the line of exiles was the ex- Sultan of Perak who arrived in 1875 after his implication in the murder of the British Resident of Perak. Like many of the exiles who followed, he settled well into Seychelles life and became genuinely fond of the islands. He took home with him one of the popular local tunes, and incorporated it into the national anthem of his country. With new words, it later became the national anthem of Malaysia. Perhaps the most famous of the political prisoners was Archbishop Makarios, who arrived in 1956. He likewise fell in love with his prison. \\"When our ship leaves harbour\\", he wrote, \\"we shall take with us many good and kindly memories of the Seychelles... may God bless them all.\\" Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India Superpower involvement – challenges The Republic of Seychelles, Réunion and Diego Garcia (British Indian Ocean Territory) have long formed part of a long chain of complex attempts by the superpower rivals to dominate and control a strategic region of the world. Other than Madagascar, none of these nations were like other countries in Africa – where a great deal of blood was lost in the process of colonisation. In reality the powers involved were interested primarily in important economic gains, whether that involved slaves, gold, diamonds, copper, tin, bauxite, precious stones, timber, animal trade and their precious parts. In the case of Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles, and Diego Garcia, the countries had a strategic interest. The colonising power, be it Portuguese, Dutch, French, British, Spanish, German, or Austrian, felt the necessity to create protective outposts to secure their respective interests. With economic and political powers like the African Union, Gulf States, Australia, Asian economic bloc, Pakistan, combined with the issues facing those nations with nuclear capabilities, vying for power in the Seychelles, the people of this region have had to deal with all the countries involved. It is important for nations around the world to understand the issues involved prior to the upcoming independence in spite of the notion and talk of isolation. The educated, figurative, populace had recognised the gravity, consequences and dangers of the superpower rivalry in the 1960s. This was aggravated by developments in East Africa, such as the revolution in Zanzibar, a formerly strong Arab colonial enclave. The decision by Britain and the US to remove several key strategic island from the Seychelles Group and create a new political, military strategic entity, namely the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) ensued. Those two parties were prepared to use their resources to the national and public disadvantage. Over the past 35 years some of the very important regional conflicts – past and ongoing wars, such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan have an impact upon the community and nation. In colonial practise, visiting navies would often stay, something which prevailed until independence. The US High Command setting up a tracking station facility in 1963, which closed in 1996, contributed to its inhabitant acquiring more awareness of the issues and the possibility of such facilities creating more problematic situations. The Seychelles People's United Party was involved in many confrontations, public protests and demonstrations, demanding its closure, while in fact they capitalised upon the facility and used it to gain public support and popularity for their cause, the Call for Independence. The paramount colonial powers then was Britain, the United States and France, while the Soviet Union and China were seen as emerging threats, specially after independence, all of which created a need for greater attention to security. Prior to independence, the Seychelles had the full protection of the British Empire, particularly the Royal Navy. Upon independence, as a young nation with limited resources, the Seychelles was now required to take care of all eventualities. The Liberal Party of Seychelles of Dr Stevenson Delhomme, the Seychelles Democratic Party of James R Mancham and the SPUP of FA Rene all had differing vews of what was best for the Seychelles nation. The Seychelles of today and that of the 1960s have greatly changed those individuals who understood the gravity and development. The Seychelles became embroiled in superpower conflict after its independence. The involvement of the Soviet Union became involved in the region during the \\"Cold War era\\" as a result of its need to strengthen its position to outmanoeuvre, outgun and outplay the US, colonial position and interest. The USSR played a paramount role in supporting and bolstering the one-party political system of the second Republic and FA Rene government; without them the system and government would not have survived. Seychelles had signed major military, diplomatic alliance and economic protocol with the USSR, which allowed the USSR to embed itself in Seychelles. This had a significant impact on government operations and general policies, from media to education. China took a political long-term interest in the region from both economic and diplomatic aspects, notwithstanding the \\"friendly rivalry\\" with Soviet Union political and social ideology. Both countries intervened and became highly embroiled in our domestic and international politics and geopolitics. Hence, the Western political and economic bloc attempted to use any means necessary to dislodge and rid them from Seychelles; this involved the NATO policy and military resources and Western intelligence services. This had a significant impact on Seychelles' international relations with communities in Europe and across the world, particularly the Exile and refugee communities which had come into existence because of the warring superpower interests and ambitions. The role of France between 1972 and 1991 was complicated by the fact that it was not a member of NATO, which as a result complicated its relationship with Seychelles, its Indian Ocean complex interest. Often the political, diplomatic and economic outcome of events were out of the hands of the nationals of Seychelles. This displayed itself until 1991, the return of multiparty elections. Inevitably, those forming the Seychelles Government in Exile, the many groups of exiles and refugees, were under constant scrutiny and monitored. The position of their national institutions and media did not help, improve or contribute to the situation. If anything, it aggravated the situation. Hence, the Seychelles Communities in exile in Europe, the US, South Africa, Australia, Canada had to be more imaginative and competitive. Their decision to develop appropriate network, using their European, French, British and others, ingenuity to involve their ancient military and other such connections, including Royal with the objective of finding a solution. The process they went through, the experience they have acquired, knowledge gained have lend importantly that they understand the greater and more complex geostrategic position of the Indian Ocean region. As such they are able to relate become pro active in some of the more complex similar working issues of the EU, its role today in the world and the future. It is relevant and important to state that today in terms of community size in EU, the Seychelles community have gained and acquired respectable acknowledgement on their positions, views and approaches to the aforementioned issues from the US, Russia, NATO, China, Japan, the African Union (AU), Gulf Region nations and Australia, including nation of South America. Without which they would not have been able to contribute to the important political, economic, military and social change of their nation and contribute to play such important and crucial role. With the fall of the COMECON, the Warsaw Pact, the break-up of the USSR, emergence of China as a leading world superpower, development in the Gulf region, Asia, India and Pakistan military, diplomatic and economic posturing, the position of the Non- Aligned Nations is affected by the coming into existence of the African Union, the new role of the European Union and NATO in the region. The gravity with which the major industrial nations view such issues is affected by their concern their economic and vital interest being affected, disrupted or infringed. The new world order and approach to resolving conflicts to the detriment of the small or regional governments and their people. The major concerns are that things could escalate and the outcome for the world major capitals, and citizens would be poor. Independence 1962–1976 Harry Hockady Payet, founder of the Seychelles Islands United Party (SIUP) Harry Payet was born in 1925, in Zanzibar of Seychellois parents and died at Praslin in 1997. His second given name, “Hockaday” meaning the second Tuesday after Easter, is derived from an ecclesiastical festival styled Hokeday or Hocktide. That feast ceased to be observed after the Reformation. It is a rare given name, presumably the first one in the Seychelles, perhaps it was because he was born on the second Tuesday after Easter. Harry Payet served with the British armed forces in North Africa and later in the Civil Service in the Seychelles. He was the first to demand that free speech was a right for all Seychellois and also the first to form a political party that feared the colonial authorities and the big landowners in the Seychelles. He created, with F V Julienne and Guy Fontaine “Seychelles People’s Convention Party” the first Political party in Seychelles; he also formed his second party the “Seychelles Archipelago Action Group”. Later, he formed the “Seychelles Islands United Party” (SIUP) with Rifned Jumeau. As Secretary General of SIUP, Harry Payet made an eloquent speech on 28 April 1963 at Gordon Square. He was the Seychelles’ first natural persuasive orator, sadly now forgotten, presumably, because of his unique cultivated eloquence that was envied by most of the early Seychellois politicians. In January 1958, when he applied for permission to hold a public meeting on Gordon Square, he was told that no permission was required. However, he was warned to be in conformity with the law, and the meeting was arranged for the 26th January of the same year. His first political meeting (which was in fact the first political public meeting in the Seychelles), started at 4.58 pm and finished at 6 pm, it attracted over a thousand people. Harry Payet used his articulacy gift to inflame the poor, and condemned in violent terms their .oppressors. According to the police the following influential people were the main supporters of Harry Payet: Charles Evariste Collet, R A Mullery, Captain Harvey-Brain, Alexandre Deltel, R Murray, Sir Michael Nethersole and a few rich Indian merchants. The Seychelles authorities and Collet thought that Harry Payet’s speech might stir violence. On 11 February 1958, Collet was at the Government House with Governor Thorpe. He told Thorpe that he was not a supporter of Harry Payet. However, (he indirectly supported Harry Payet’s views) he warned Thorpe that the destitution will cause unrest if things continue as such. Collet who was at the first public meeting of Harry Payet, told Thorpe that before he arrived at the scene there was a whispering campaign to the effect that he was a “Black protestant” from Northern Ireland sent here to wage a campaign against the Catholic Church and that he was removed from St Lucia because irate Catholics had burnt down Government House.. Harry Payet’s movement later pushed Collet and Arthur Savy jnr. to form the “Seychelles Progressive Association” a political group that took part in the election on Praslin. The principal details of Harry Payet’s speech were: The return of the Seychelles to France; Emigration to East Africa; the health situation; the police; the hardship of the poor. agriculture; grant in aid; and the British elite officers. He denounced the government as absolutism; and said that all members of the council were “yes men” who depended on favours from the government. He went on to say that if his grievances were not met he and his ex-servicemen would enforce change by bloodshed. Prior to making a maiden speech at Gordon Square the Police Special Branch managed to get a draft copy of his long speech. The police was alarmed by his subversive approach and with pressure from the Executive Members, the big landowners and expatriates; they prepared a case of sedition against him. The file was sent to André Sauzier (the good catholic), the newly appointed Attorney General who was pressured to proceed with the case. After studying the case Sauzier was swift, to point out his neutrality. He reminded Governor Thorpe that the responsibility of a prosecution is his and will remain so. In other words, the Governor and Executive Council could not intervene and pressured him to file a case. He explained further about the weakness of the case which would not stand in the Court of law. Even though the police had produced a draft copy of the speech, they did not have whole speech that Payet made. Without that he could not be able to proceed with the case of treason. The Executive wanted Payet to be deported to Zanzibar and they indirectly put pressure on Payet’s supporters. One of them was Maurice Adam later acted like Judas Iscariot and betrayed Payet. The episode of Adam could well be made into a film! Adam was formerly an election agent for Harry Savy at Praslin. Later, while being a strong supporter of Payet, he secretly betrayed the latter and requested a meeting with Mr Francis Dereck Jackeway, the then Secretary to the Government. He told the Private Secretary that he had something very important to say about Harry Payet. When he met Jackeway on Friday 7 February 1958, he apologised for being rather shabbily dressed. He told Jackeway that he had spent his childhood in France and was a member of the Slavocracy whatever his appearance. His parents were large landowners, but he had been cheated out of his share and wasted much of his substances for the past 20 years trying to obtain his rights. At age of twenty one he had to chose between French and British citizenship; he choose British and he received no reward for doing so. He told Jakeway that Harry Savy had approached him in order to stop Payet speaking for a second time, and that according to the poor at Praslin Harry Savy was “the Governor’s biggest yes- man”. According to Adam, Payet was a stooge supported by Collet. Jakeway reminded Adam that Seychelles was a free country and he could not stop Payet from speaking. The next day Jakeway met Harry Savy at the Seychelles Club. Harry Savy told him that Adam was a ne’er-do-well whom no one could help much and who lived more or less on charity, [he was touni (a poor man)]; and was twice fired from the Government service. According to Harry Savy, Adam came to see him before Harry Payet’s first speech telling him to use his influence to get him (Adam) a Government job and preferably one for Harry Payet. Harry Payet who wanted the return of the Seychelles to France, questioned the legality of the last Capitulation. He wrote many letters to England and met John Profumo at the Tobruk Club. In one of his petitions he concluded the famous slogan “Seychelles for Seychellois” this was later adopted by Guy Sinon of SPUP. He was also the first Seychellois politician who made a public speech in French, he also wanted the French language to be the medium of teaching in school instead of English. In one of his memorable speeches he ended with the following words: «Vive nos vieux Français, Vive nos vieux frères maristes, Vive la France , Vive de Gaulle. Et trois cheers (à la santé) pour de Gaulle». Later, his attachment to France and his admiration for General de Gaulle cost him dearly. The French Consul at Mahé provided a car for the Police to spy on him; after they were making arrangement with the British authorities to send him with two other Seychellois wrongly labelled as agitators, to join the French Foreign Legion. Later, Sir James Mancham the first President of Seychelles, more or less suffered the same fate during the planning of the Coup d’état for being a strong supporter of General de Gaulle. Harry Payet was the only political figure ever jailed during the colonial times, for tearing up a picture of Queen Elizabeth II in public in Gordon Square. He became a member of Seychelles People’s United Party (SPUP), when his party, the “Seychelles Islands United Party” was replaced by SPUP under the leadership of Mr France Albert René. In the General Election of 1967, he stood as an SPUP candidate for West Mahé against Chamery Chetty of SDP. In 1969 he was also a candidate in the Victoria District Elections, where he stood in the St Louis constituency, against Clément Confait.https://www.facebook.com/todayinsey/posts/historyharry-hockaday- payetseychelles-first-forgotten-prominent-oratorby-julien-/1015812758456534/ Rifned Jumeau, the founder of the first political party in Seychelles died on February 7, 2019 and was buried this afternoon in the presence of family and friends at his former electoral district of Mont Fleuri on the island of Mahe. Seychelles was still a British Colony when Rifned Jumeau and Harry Payet launched in 1963 his SIUP (Seychelles Islanders United Party). He was determined to fight for workers rights in an era when the mass did not even enjoy the right to vote and when the British Governor was still nominating part of the Legislative Councils Members. In 1964 Rifned Jumeau merged his political party with Albert Rene and it became the Seychelles People’s United Party (SPUP). Rifned Jumeau was elected in 1969 for the Mont Fleuri Ward for the Victoria District Council elections, before being elected in 1970 for the Victoria South Electoral District as the member of Legislative Assembly. He was a mobilizer and organised the longest protest march ever staged in Seychelles from Anse Aux Pins to Victoria to bring out the cost of living in Seychelles. A gifted public speaker with a wit that attracted many to be present only to hear him speak. Rifned Jumeau remained a man of principle and he remained a Seychellois politician who wanted to see a better Seychelles for every Seychellois. His saw Seychelles move from being a British Colony to becoming an Independent State in 1976, and lived through Seychelles under its 1st, 2nd and 3rd Republic era.https://www.eturbonews.com/245274/political- icon-of-seychelles-rifned-jumeau-is-no-more Historic coup d'état One party state era 1977 onward Widespread involvement of Seychellois in their own political affairs began in 1948 after World War II, when Britain granted suffrage to approximately 2,000 adult male property owners, who then elected four members to the Legislative Council that advised the governor. The winning candidates were drawn from a group known as the Seychelles Taxpayers' and Producers' Association (STPA), which represented the landed strata of society — known colloquially as the grands blancs (great whites). The STPA defended its members' interest in matters of crop marketing and other issues and was the principal political force in the nation until the early 1960s, when representatives of the small new urban professional and middle class began to win seats. Over the past 25 years, the Seychelles community in the EU has presented briefly the issues and reasons why those that had formed the Planters Association—Grand Blanc—had wanted to charter and plan a different course of history for Seychelles then under British Colonial Rule. They involved the elite of Seychelles of French descent in the British government Colonial Administration=, the Police, the Public Work Department, Treasury, the Local Banks, Cable and Wireless, the hospital, the Harbour and Agriculture Department. One of the most important historic and political events for the Seychelles Planters Association was the Algeria debacle. They had long been betrayed by France, under the Monarchy, the French Revolution, then the first Republic of Bonaparte. Algeria's proximity to Seychelles and the Indian Ocean, and the Suez Canal were also issues. The First and Second World War epoch, the ensuing economic and political development.SIROP Two parties emerged to represent Seychelles' interest and workers interest: the DP, led by James Mancham, and the SPUP, led by France-Albert René. Both men were London- educated lawyers who had returned to Seychelles determined to improve local conditions and to develop popularly based local politics. Although community rivalries and the differing styles of the two leaders were important in attracting followers, the two parties also differed in substantive ways. The SPUP called itself socialist, favoured worker-oriented policies, and pressed for complete independence from Britain and a nonaligned foreign policy. The pressure for independence was intensified after Britain in 1965 removed Île Desroches, the Aldabra Islands, and the Farquhar Islands from Seychelles and made them part of the BIOT. The DP took a more laissez-faire capitalist approach and wanted to continue the association with Britain and to allow British and United States bases on the islands. Steps toward independence, 1967–76 Continuous and mounting demands for an increased share in running the colony's affairs prompted Britain to enact a series of constitutions for Seychelles, each of which granted important new concessions. In 1967 Britain extended universal suffrage to the colony and established a governing council to run it, the majority of whose members for the first time were elected by the Seychellois rather than appointed by the British government. That year almost 18,000 Seychellois voted, and the DP emerged in control of the council. In 1970 Britain set up a ministerial form of government and gave Seychellois the responsibility to administer all but external affairs, internal security, the civil service, and the government's broadcasting service and newspaper. The DP won ten seats, and the SPUP won five in the Legislative Assembly. Mancham became the islands' chief minister and René, the leader of the opposition. The opening of an international airport on the east coast of Mahé in 1971 improved contact with the outside world. Before this most journeys to and from Seychelles had involved long voyages on bimonthly steamers running between East Africa and India and often required inconvenient transits in Mombasa and Bombay. Air service had been available only on a restricted basis at an airstrip used by the United States in building a satellite station on Mahé. The end of the islands' relative isolation triggered tourism and concomitant booms in foreign capital investment and the domestic construction industry. The construction of the international airport changed the economy from a traditional agricultural and fishing one within a few years into one where services accounted for the major portion of employment and gross domestic product (GDP). The two parties differed on the ways to manage the new tourist industry and to apportion its benefits. The SPUP favoured controlling the growth of tourism and at the same time developing the entire economy, whereas the SDP wanted to stimulate the rapid growth of tourism and to establish the islands as an international financial center. Independence from Britain was the dominant issue between the two parties in the early 1970s, however. The SPUP insisted on cutting the colony's ties with Britain, whereas Mancham argued for even closer association. But when it became plain that the independence issue was popular and Britain showed no interest in retaining close relations, the SDP also shifted to a proindependence policy. Moreover, the disfavor with which African and Asian nations viewed colonialism had put the SDP into disrepute in the region. The SDP won the election campaign in 1974 but the election provoked angry controversy. The SPUP charged that the results had been rigged; because of the way constituencies had been demarcated, the SDP won thirteen of the fifteen seats with only 52.4 percent of the vote, lending credibility to the charges. Thereafter, relations between the two parties, already personalised and bitter, worsened steadily. Despite their differences, the two parties formed a coalition under Mancham to lead Seychelles to independence. Five members from each party were added to the Legislative Assembly in an attempt to equalise political representation. One year later, Britain granted the colony complete independence, and on 29 June 1976, the Republic of Seychelles became a sovereign nation, with Mancham as president and René as vice-president. As a gesture of goodwill, Britain returned Île Desroches, the Aldabra Islands, and the Farquhar Islands. In addition, Britain made a series of grants to the new nation to smooth the transition to an independent economy. Both parties agreed to support the coalition government until elections were held in 1979. Coup by René supporters, 1977 On 4–5 June June 1977, sixty supporters of the SPUP who had been training in Tanzania staged a coup and overthrew Mancham while he was in London. René, who denied knowing of the plan, was then sworn in as president and formed a new government.Virtual Seychelles A year later, the SPUP combined with several smaller parties and redesignated itself the Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF), or simply the Front. A new constitution adopted in 1979 stipulated that the SPPF be the sole recognised party. The constitution provided for a strong executive headed by the president and a legislature of twenty-three elected and two appointed members. In the first election, held in June 1979, René was the single candidate for president. He won with 98 percent of the vote. The results were viewed as a popular endorsement of the socialist policies pursued by the government in the two years following the coup. The SPPF proceeded with its program to set minimum wage levels, raise government salaries, improve housing and health facilities, broaden educational opportunities, increase social security coverage, and generate employment in agriculture and fisheries. The lives of most Seychellois were enhanced, and most citizens appeared to favour the government's policies. The decision to turn the nation into a one-party state based on socialist ideology, as well as certain initiatives of the government, caused some bitterness, especially among the upper and middle classes. Censorship of the media and control over public expression were unpopular. A number of groups attempted to oust the René government between 1978 and 1987. The most notable was a group of mercenaries who tried to enter the country in 1981 disguised as tourists from South Africa. The mercenaries were exposed as they came through customs at the international airport but most of them, including their leader, Colonel Michael \\"Mad Mike\\" Hoare, escaped after commandeering an Air-India passenger plane to South Africa. Although the South African government prosecuted and jailed some of the mercenaries for aircraft hijacking, Hoare testified that South African military and intelligence officials were involved in the coup attempt. During this period, the Seychelles government received support from Tanzania, which deployed troops to the islands to strengthen the government's hand. Some of the devastating outcome included the imprisonment of many of the leading original settlers Seychelles families, while others were persecuted, forced into exile, their properties confiscated in the process of purging the Seychelles of its rich colonial heritage, history and archaic heritage, as well as Europeans. It also created the situation that Seychelles exile/refugee in EU very often were confronted aggressively by supporters, agents of FA Rene Socialist Party, Black and Arab, COMECON, Latin American supporters, as they went about their existence, educating their children and rebuilding their lives. Hence began also the situation of black Seychellois controlling and dictating a vast array of national issues; their efforts to purge Seychelles of its rich history and heritage resulted in some of today's political problems and grave undercurrents. Non-aligned nations & Asian nations involvement Historic exodus to Europe The Algeria debacle was a significant event for the Seychelles Planters Association. France, under the Monarchy, the French Revolution, then the French First Republic, had not treated them well. Algeria proximity to Seychelles – the Indian Ocean, the Suez Canal issues. The First and Second World War epoch, Colonial Britain, the ensuing economic and political development. Then came the East African Independence, followed by the Zanzibar revolution. In Rhodesia the efforts and attempts by the White minority Settlers to have and force a Unilateral government. All those in Colonial Seychelles together with their European expatriate friends, who watched and monitored events with trepidation – it was a matter of time and they would be next. Over the past 25 years, the EU community has presented the issues and reasons why those that had formed the Planters Association – Grand Blanc had wanted to charter, plan a different course of history for Seychelles then under British Colonial Rule 1963. Having failed they all mostly knew they were in the process of losing 150 years of hard work and toil and they would probably lose their lives too. Those who had the means, transferred their money abroad. For most and the vast majority, the events of 5 June 1977 coup d'état which will be remembered in history. The establishment of a One Party system and abolition of opposition, imprisonment, deportation and confiscation of Private properties, land, etc. All those who had to flee for their lives and seek exile and refuge in Europe. The attitude of the French, British and other European governments and the media changed. During the next 15 years, from 1977 to 1991, they lived a life of sheer suffering, racial oppression, bitter hardship in diaspora and embitterment. Many of the old families who were forced to leave Seychelles never returned. The role of OAU League of Arab Nations, India and Pakistan United Nation involvement engagement  The formation of a distinctive Seychelles Community  The formation of a distinctive Seychelles community in Europe began 30 years ago shortly after 5 June revolution in 1977, and the historic and important events which followed. There was already a group of Seychellois in Britain as Seychelles had been a British colony, who had adapted to the British colonial system and way of life, language, and religion, having the means to migrate for various reason, mostly economic. The next most important category were economic migrants of the 1960s who, as was the practice with other British colonies, were allowed to emigrate to the UK to work in various sectors of the British economy. A similar program in Italy made it possible for a number of Seychelles nationals, mostly of Creole black descent, to go and work in Italy and become citizens. Another distinctive group, with their very cultural uniqueness were the many families of Seychelles origin who had gone to work and live in East Africa, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Zanzibar under Britain colonial rule and Seychelles proximity. After the coming of independence to East African countries from the 1950s they were forced to migrate to Britain. They are known as the Kenya born and East African Seychelles. They also influenced events and affairs at Home. Families had been returning to France between 1900 and 1976, mostly because of the British colonial practice, favouritism and economic reasons. There were issues related also to the 1914 and 1944 wars. They were first, second or third generation French colonial descent and so were able to integrate easily, unlike the situation in Algeria where emigrants from Seychelles were confronted by the Native Algerian population. They maintained contact with families and acquaintances in Seychelles, Reunion, Mauritius and Madagascar, East Africa and had their distinctive circles. They also exerted their distinctive French colonial influence on Seychelles and affairs of the Indian Ocean region – South Africa, Australia and India. They maintained contacts with families in Canada, and the United States. There were other small groups of Seychelles families of either French, mixed blood creole in most part of Europe – Scandinavia. The community has started working for funds to collect statistics, enrolled the help of voluntary organisations in Europe to address the issues with poor response. The events of 5 June 1977 radically changed how they had lived and functioned till then. In spite of the significant Seychelles colonial history, various events such as the independence of India, the Suez crisis, crises in former Somali, the Mau Mau Uprising, revolution in Congo, East Africa independence, the bloody revolution in Zanzibar, and Rhodesian independence, residents of Seychelles had not expected it to happen in Seychelles. The shock that engulfed not only Seychelles, also affected deeply the groups, communities and families in Europe, both the pro and con groups. This was followed by the first government in Exile of the Seychelles headed by Sir James Mancham and his former Cabinet Ministers which was supported by Britain, US, France, South Africa, Australia, Israel and Kenya. The media coverage and attention Seychelles received. Communities in Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy have their fair share of oppression, exclusion, race motivated attack, persecutions, and has drawn strength from North Africa and Ireland. In Seychelles after the events of 5 June 1977, the very important exodus of Seychelles families had begun, as those who opposed FA Rene were deported. Among the most important challenges was basic: find housing, food and other basic needs such as education or employment. Additionally, however, there was the constant fear of the situation in Seychelles and those involved making life very difficult for those who opposed or had opposed FA Rene government. In 1978, Seychelles exiles in South Africa, acting in behalf of ex-president James Mancham, discussed with South African Government officials launching a coup d'état against the new president France-Albert René. The military option had been decided in Washington, D.C., after concerns for United States access to its new military base in Diego Garcia island, and the determination that René was not corruptible in favour of the Americans.[2][3] Associates of Mancham contacted Mike Hoare, then in South Africa as a civilian resident, to fight alongside fifty-three other mercenary soldiers, including South African special forces (Recces), former Rhodesian soldiers, and ex-Congo mercenaries[4]. Hoare agreed to fight for Mancham. After the failed attempted coup of Mike Hoare, the Seychelles exiles made up of a number of leading Seychelles nationals formed the first important opposition party in exile namely MPR and SNM under the leadership of Mr Gérard Hoarau, another government in exile was formed – to become the principal opposition force and voice representing the Seychelles to the British and international media attention and involvement. Important issues and events included the Cold War, Seychelles' strategic position in the Indian Ocean, the Eastern Bloc involvement, China, OAU, the USSR, the COMECON – Warsaw Pact, Arab State, Cuba and Latin America. 1981List of coups d'état and coup attempts Failed coup in Seychelles led by Mike Hoare, the Italian Secret Service involvement, US Central Intelligence Agency, aspect of the France Secret Service DGSE, involvement – our community. A third government in exile was put together involving former Cabinet ministers, Executives of MPR/SNM and other exile factions. It also involved France leading French mercenaryCulture of the Indian Ocean Islands – Bod DenardAcid They later would form the leadership of a successful peaceful exile/refugee return program – SIROP. These international issues and events caused the former President of Seychelles, Sir James Mancham – his ministers, the Leader of opposition Mr Gérard Hoarau and the MPR/SNM executive to call for the deposing of FA Rene government. It was decided after consultation with the European continental community, UN agency and other caritative, voluntary agencies to consider very importantly to building long-term grass root structures and supporting bodies for our community in EU. A number of exile factions and long established community members had endeavoured to establish such working body and structures. A proposal was put forth to the United Nations and other leading international institutions and governments, based on the Seychellois community's contribution to Europe, for the EU to assist in rebuilding Seychelles and establish NGO in Seychelles. The most important was UKSCA, with a charity registration and supported by several London Councils. It became the first Seychelles NGO in EU to build a network with London's ethnic and exile communities and emphasised the role of the Seychelles exile political parties. It became involved in local, national and international political issues of interest to the Seychelles community. This approach was expanded across the EU. The recognitions of the Seychelles community in EU began to acquire and good will upon which it implemented the SIROP – CDU, Alliance, DP, SNP, SNM exile return program. This radically changed the way the community would be regarded in the EU by the public, the news media and relevant institutions. A pan European organisation was also chartered for the future of our EU community in the eventuality that most of the Leadership return to Seychelles and the future of the community in the EU – named FECAS ECSVS. The community had studied closely other communities with similar interests, cultural back ground, history.Riots France Given the colonial life it had had, and its ancestors, the community worked to include the church in its work and community across the EU. This was not an easy task, as it had to meet and discuss with Seychelles individuals across the community, learn to listen their advice, aspiration and needs. It also learned how other communities worked to establish a national identity, whether the Mauritius, the Greek, Zanzibar – Ismaili, Lebanese, the Irish, the Jews, the Armenians, the Turks and several communities from former COMECON, among these the Polish community. In France the excellent rapprochement with the many North African communities of Maghreb, and importantly the former Algerian colony, the Harkis, Madagascar, and Comores. International syndicate For the Seychelles generation of 2000, there is a need to educate them about the point of reform in the Seychelles. The concept of syndicating for greater economic, diplomatic, political end, purpose and objective is inherent as our European culture as are the rival colonial powers and their approach to over coming resources shortage, the need to \\"create special friendship with sometime enemies to achieve a greater objective\\", and sharing the booty, the spoil and end product or project. In Seychelles, the practise and concept of syndicating has existed since the First Group of Colon came to the Indian Ocean, with the development of various economic structures, diplomatic and military. Under British colonial rule, they attempted to obliterate this practise of French and European culture. They created their own colonial system which absorbed much of the old system under different name. The Planters of Seychelles knew about syndicated practise, ethics and benchmarks. In East Africa, the Seychelles communities developed their brand of syndicated working as did the Pied Noir of Congo, and North Africa. The Italian communities brought along their own brand of syndicated working from the colonial Seychelles. The Indian – Asian communities had their practise and approach. So too did the Chinese and the Parsi merchant communities. The Seychelles communities abroad decided to rebuild this syndicated network, foremost in France, other European capitals, the colonies they had departed to Canada, South America, South Africa, and the US. Out of the one party state system which came into place in 1977 and lasted over 35 years, their particular approach to developing and international syndicated and Cartel remains. Whilst the government maintained a strictly socialist/communist approach to the need of the people, they had and were compelled to develop more sophisticated syndicated system, methods of working with the international communities in all manner as very many spheres of corporate, financial, commodity and military areas. Upon the return of multi party government, the fusion of the experience and knowledge acquired remained. The Seychelles Communities in EU over the past 35 years has amassed a vast experience, and wide achievements in this field involving international and multinational economic projects at European level, and elsewhere in the COMECON, USSR, Gulf Region, African Union – former OAU, Latin America, and Asia – China. This knowledge allowed the establishment of the SIROP exile/refugee program, the Phase ll Seychelles development program, and the role we played in helping to put in place the Rim Association. The Seychelles Community was involved in the process of changes in the COMECON, and likewise in the USSR, based on the experience gained with the Seychelles, as were the former OAU – the African Union-nations. Important influential role of EU The impact of the Seychelles community is widespread, despite clashes until as late as 1985. This was divided into five categories: * Pro-British, Commonwealth and their institutions, military alliance. * French, Francophone and their institutions, military alliance. * Strong pro-US, Western, capitalist oriented democracy, political system, ideology, values and military alliance. * Socialist USSR, COMECON, and others sharing the communist ideology, political system, education, economic system, socialist values and military alliance. * A small minority back in the 1960s and 1970s who had begun to study, court European political ideology, institutions, economic and diplomatic reasoning. Each of the above had their political, economic and military agendas and interests in the Seychelles, the Indian Ocean strategic issues, who controlled the region and their motives. In 1979, the small group of Seychelles exiled refugees based on the Continental Europe, who began looking at the Europe role in the distant future to replace the system so divisive to the country's inhabitants. When they approached the SNM, MPR, and SDP leadership in Britain, London they were labelled Nazi/pro-German, Austrian ideological supporters. There developed important divisions among the exiled refugee community as a result. This group followed their belief that in the course of time and near future: \\"The Power that would bring greater stability in the affairs of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean region and their European Communities would be Europe and its vast arrays of then Institutions, values, cultures, heritages, belief, science, diplomacy – military resources, experiences, expertise\\". Hence the departure from attempts to change Seychelles by military force; instead they worked towards finding economic and political solutions which would underpin the preferred belief, objective and values. Upon such, the SIROP exile/refugee return program was conceived, planned and implemented. The communities in EU developed engaged in the greater and important working of Europe from 1979 to date, building effective networks. From 1976 to date, the treaties have benefited the EU of today and the Seychelles communities within it. This include the historic Treaty of Lisbon. The measure of success have been due importantly to their French, British European heritage, culture, Christian and institutional connections, values, education, challenges as a Community in EU. Since the return of multiparty government in 1991 in the Seychelles, the refugee communities in the EU have become pro-active in supporting democracy and strong civic engagement in the Seychelles, the Indian Ocean, the Gulf Region and OAU – African Union, Asia subcontinent, and also cultural exchanges throughout the region. Community important international scientific involvement Struggle historic exile return program 1986/87 – COMECON, Warsaw Pact collapse, Changes in South Africa. The BIOT Diego Garcia issue BIOT and Diego Garcia, with all their complexities and taboos, are very important to the Seychelles community. The Seychelles exile communities in the EU have worked to build democratic consensus with each other to avert war and enable its citizens to live a peaceful life. The past 30 years have seen an increase in the relevancy, importance of our community European heritage. The Seychelles and Diego Garcia communities is governed by laws of EU – the very vast majority of members of the community are EU citizens, so it is inevitable that the community is influenced by EU foreign policy and politics. The Seychelles and exiles elsewhere have come to take over the major and principal responsibilities, rights of French and other European ancestors in addition to the laws, institutions, culture – history will allow. From this prospective we see the problematic in other prospectives.iloistrust As a part of the European community within the norms of democratic responsibilities and practices, the Seychelles has important responsibilities. In the EU the democratic practice, civil practice is to allow communities influence in the government process by involving them in it. The Seychelles community in Britain in particular have paid and is paying a price for what was started 40 years ago. The so-called Grand Blanc, plantation owners, members of the Victoria District Council, did not want to entertain the notion at all, for fear of risking their vested economic interest. Unlike the Chagossians they were educated and articulate. They have had three or four generation of colonial British rule. They knew what had taken place in Mauritius, Reunion, the Chagoss Group. They have experienced the exodus they have made from France from 1000AD. It was with those experience they addressed their concern then. For the past 30 years the Seychelles community in Britain, EU have suffered directly. Officials and their institutions have created a barrier to full participation of the Seychelles community. There have been four important wars during the past 30 years associated with Diego Garcia. The situation in the EU government excludes its citizen from active democratic participation and due process because of the status – war, military modalities that have been put into place despite its participation. The EU regards the BIOT/Diego Garcia debate as an African Union debate. However, the AU does not function like EU democratic debates. The AU head of state, institutions would have stood to benefit importantly – because we formed part of the original issue. In Africa today, they are endeavouring to promote our community in EU vis a vis EU laws; the importance of Diego Garcia would have resulted into over flow. They cannot understand this practice by EU lawmakers. Seychelles communities world wide outside of the EU US The Seychelles community in the US is concentrated in the Sun belt – Florida. In the 1960s, 1970s because of the strategic location of Seychelles, the US built one of their satellite tracking facilities on Mahe at La Misere, which was nicknamed \\"the golf ball\\" because of its unique dome shape. There were several leading United States Air Force contractors, Philco Ford, Pan Am, Nasa, Loral Corporation and Johnson Instruments, IBM, including base defence, military, intelligence personnel. They numbered some 250 including Voluntary Corps. The vast majority were bachelors – this resulting in marrying and partnering some of the daughter of the elite Seychellois families, after their term of Service in Seychelles migrated with their families to the US. After the coup d'état of 5 June 1977, a number of families sought refuge in the US. It is estimated there are some 1500 Seychellois in the US. Australia Seychelles families have been migrating to Australia for as long as the white Mauritian migration to Australia, and for the same reasons. After the independence of East Africa and Rhodesia, a number of Seychelles families were compelled to leave those countries and migrate to Australia to seek livelihoods and stability. The second most important wave of migration,womenaustralia exile took place after 5 June 1977 coup d'état and the abolition of multiparty democracy. Since 1991 and the establishment of the Third Republic, a number of Seychelles individuals have been migrating to Australia for economic, educational, vocational and political reason. It is estimated there are some 12,000 Seychelles nationals settled in Australia. Canada Some of the more affluent Seychelles families started migrating in the early 1800, the French families, distant relatives who had gone to settle their from Mauritius, Reunion and France. They were dissatisfied with colonial life, opportunity and prospect. The colonial favouritism which existed. After the independence of East Africa, Rhodesia a number of Seychelles families were compelled to leave those countries and migrate to Australia. This continued until 1977 when there was a wave of migration, exile, refugee fleeing Seychelles due to the coup d'état. It is estimated there is some 4,500 Seychellois in Canada. South Africa Prior to the establishment of Apartheid there have been Seychellois of white, French, British – other European migrating to South Africa. This continued until event of 5 June 1977, the coup d'état. A number of leading Seychelles individuals attended schools, higher training in South Africa. After Independence in Rhodesia, Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika some of those Seychelles families who migrated to South Africa to restart their lives and rebuild their families. Because of their skill, education and abilities they were welcomed. History repeated itself over from East Africa, historic events of 5 June 1977, the Seychelles families who fled to South Africa, seek exile there, they had been persecuted, imprisoned, they had lost their properties, among them the family of the leader of the exile Opposition Mr Gérard Hoarau. It is estimated there are some 750 Seychellois in South Africa. They are to be found in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria. East Africa Seychelles individuals and families started migrating to East Africa in the early nineteenth century. With the event of the first world war and the shipping connection, those settled in Mombasa, Nairobi, Kampala, then Zanzibar – the Sultanate, Dar es Salaam in Tanganyika then British Colonies. They went to work for British established colonial companies, many reaching high positions. They were regarded in high esteem by the colonial communities. With the opening of the Kilembe copper mine, the processing plant at Jinja and concomitant need for skilled, responsible workers some 200 Seychellois were employed in various work positions. A large number of them intermarried, took up the national citizenship after independence – because they had faced no alternatives. The Seychelles community in Uganda was hit most under Idi Amin and the wars which followed; they fled to Britain, France, Canada, Australia, South African and Seychelles. The Tanganyika was equally impacted upon independence and the introduction of one-party system; some had worked for the large Greek sisal plantations in high positions. In Kenya they fared better as they had adopted the cross culture between colonial life and East African life and became known as \\"Kenya born\\". However, many chose to migrate as life and economic existence became more pressing and difficult. The situation in Zanzibar was far worse – many had very important and respectable position and work. With independence, the brief new government and finally the Zanzibar Revolution which cost some estimated 25,000 lives, most fled for their lives to Seychelles, later Australia, Canada, South Africa and Britain. From EU, Canada, Australia and South Africa they lent their support to help – contribute to the dream of African Union – the AU today and the future. It is estimated there are some 1500 Seychellois or Seychellez in Swahili (as they are known in East African today) across Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.

DeHaven survived a plane crash while training as a Royal Canadian Flying Corps pilot during the First World War, and became interested in improving human survivability in vehicle crashes. He has been called \\"Father of Crash Survivability\\".Comparative Study into Occupant Support Concept with Respect to Crash Response - Page 22 Early life DeHaven was born in 1895 in Brooklyn, New York. His father was a steel worker and inventor. He attended Fessenden School in West Newton, Massachusetts from 1906 to 1909 before attending The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania from 1909 to 1914. Following graduation DeHaven attended Cornell University from 1914 to 1915, and Columbia University from 1915 to 1916. He tried to join the US Army Air Corps in 1916, but was rejected. He joined the Royal Flying Corps Canada in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.The Hugh DeHaven, PhD (1895-1980) Papers While training as a pilot during the First World War, DeHaven survived a plane crash.Hugh DeHaven - Dynamic Sciences Inc While recuperating from a ruptured pancreas, he tried to understand why he, and only he, survived that crash, noting that his cockpit was the only one that remained intact. Early work Hugh Robertson Dehaven was an inventor of long standing. Between 1924 and 1933 DeHaven filed seven patent applications related to his design of a self- sharpening single edge safety razor. Between approximately 1930 and 1936 his De Haven Razor Corporation marketed a number of different models based upon these designs. DeHaven himself retired in 1933. DeHaven was issued US Patent 2710649 in 1955 for the first three-point seat belt. Early in the 20th century, DeHaven established the Aviation Safety and Research Facility at Cornell University.Safety and Health Hall of Fame In 1939, DeHaven recommended the use of helmets and seat belts at a 45° angle in airplanes. He created the inertial reel and the concept of the \\"delethalized\\" instrument panel. Crash Injury Research (CIR) In 1942, DeHaven started the Crash Injury Research project at Cornell, and published the classic Mechanical analysis of survival in falls from heights of fifty to one hundred and fifty feet. He concluded: ::The human body can tolerate and expend a force of two hundred times the force of gravity for brief intervals during which the force acts in transverse relation to the long axis of the body. It is reasonable to assume that structural provisions to reduce impact and distribute pressure can enhance survival and modify injury within wide limits in aircraft and automobile accidents.Head Knocker/Hugh DeHaven and Collision Safety In 1950, DeHaven published a report pointing to the second collision and the risk involved in vehicle ejection. He created the concept of \\"packaging\\" car occupants. He concluded:Hugh DeHaven - Still Relevant for Rollovers In 1953, the project split into two sub-projects, namely the Automobile Crash Injury Research (ACIR) and the Aviation Crash Injury Research (AvCIR) projects.

The book is one of the earliest novelistic accounts of life in British India, and its plot strongly mimics the biography of its author. Set in India about the time of the First Afghan War, the novel describes the unhappy experiences of the eponymous Edward Oakfield, a graduate of Oxford who enlisted with the East India Company's military service because he tired of the metaphysical debates dominating that university. In India, Oakfield is disgusted by what he sees as an absence of Christian gentlemanliness among the Company's military officers, and he soon retreats to the comradeship of a few like-minded people. Major themes The novel is an indictment of the moral standards of the British regiments in India. Indeed Arnold, fearing resentment, originally published the novel using the pseudonym Punjabee. The second edition, of 1854, reveals the author's identity and adds a preface which functions as an apologia.

Ross (right) being congratulated by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 Wilburn Kirby Ross (May 12, 1922 – May 9, 2017) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in World War II.  Early life  Ross was born in Strunk, Kentucky. As a boy he would practice his marksmanship by placing a match in the crook of a tree and lighting it from a distance with a round from his .22 caliber rifle.  Military career  He started working in coal mines at age 18, but he soon joined the United States Army. By October 30, 1944, he was serving as a private in Company G, 30th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. On that day, near Saint-Jacques, France, Ross manned a machine gun through repeated German assaults, holding off the enemy even after his supporting riflemen had run out of ammunition. During the incident, Ross noticed what he thought was the body of a deceased German soldier. This individual was in fact alive, and an American Lieutenant, who was watching Ross the entire time. This lieutenant later reported Ross' acts of valor and recommended him for the Medal of Honor which was issued six months later, on April 14, 1945. Following World War II, he re-enlisted after a short period working a government job. Deployed to fight in Korea he was injured after nine days in combat. Remaining in the Army until 1964, Ross retired as a master sergeant.  Personal life  For a two-year period before 1950, Ross worked for the Kentucky Highway Authority. Ross married in 1960, and after retiring from the U.S. Army, lived in DuPont, Washington. He and his wife raised six children. After retiring from the Army he worked for a veterans hospital as well as a pickle factory in Washington. His wife, Monica, died in 2011. Death Ross died in Tacoma, on May 9, 2017, three days before his 95th birthday.

At 11:30 a.m. on 30 October 1944, after his company had lost 55 out > of 88 men in an attack on an entrenched, full-strength German company of > elite mountain troops, Private Ross placed his light machinegun ten yards in > advance of the foremost supporting riflemen in order to absorb the initial > impact of an enemy counterattack.

The Sith Order are depicted as an ancient monastic and kraterocratic cultist organization of supernaturally gifted Force-wielders driven by a machiavellian agenda of galactic domination and revenge against their arch-rivals, the Jedi Order. Sith are ruthless and totalitarian by design, in which a supreme autocratic authority is concentrated in a single individual granted the honorific Dark Lord of the Sith. Sith culture is of perpetual self-destruction and reinvention; transfer of power is conducted through state-sanctioned assassinations: when a Sith Lord grows complacent, begins to show weakness, and is eventually killed, their property and authority are transferred to the apprentice who killed them. Robberies, betrayal, and sabotage are commonplace; murder is acceptable so long as the culprit is not caught. Sith teach their apprentices to revere the dark side of the Force and to believe that the galaxy was theirs to rule by cosmic right. This kraterocratic system ensures that Sith society nurtures some of the most vicious and competitive individuals in the galaxy and is only governed by those strong enough to seize control. Etymology The word Sith was first used in the 1974 rough draft of Star Wars with the first published use being the 1976 novelization of Star Wars as a title for the key villain Darth Vader, the \\"Dark Lord of the Sith\\". Sith characters had also been portrayed as such in some non-canonical Star Wars Legends works prior to the release of The Phantom Menace, and in archived footage for the original Star Wars.Dark Horse Comics, Dark Empire Prior to the formal introduction of the Sith, the term \\"Dark Jedi\\" was sometimes used for characters who would be later identified as Sith, or had goals and practices similar to the Sith. In his novel series The Thrawn Trilogy, author Timothy Zahn labeled Sith Lord Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine as \\"Dark Jedi\\", and the term \\"Sith\\" was never mentioned in the series until later reprints of the novels. \\"Dark Jedi\\" is also the name given in the Star Wars universe to antihero fictional characters attuned to the Force and adept in its Dark Side. However, the concept of \\"Dark Jedi\\" is not referenced anywhere in any of the theatrical Star Wars films, and they exist by that name only in non-canonical Star Wars Legends media, including video games such as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and the Star Wars: Jedi Knight series. The Sith were not mentioned by name in canonical stories until the prequel trilogy used the word on film starting with 1999's The Phantom Menace. Influences George Lucas acknowledged that the Jedi, Sith, and other Force concepts have been inspired by many sources. These include: knighthood, chivalry, paladinism, samurai bushido, Shaolin Monastery, Feudalism, Hinduism, Qigong, Greek philosophy and mythology, Roman history and mythology, parts of the Abrahamic religions, Confucianism, Shintō, Buddhism and Taoism, and numerous cinematic precursors. The works of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of Star Wars. In particular, the contrasting narrative relationship between the Dark Side-using Sith and light side-using Jedi mirrors several modern and classical literary tropes. Most prominently, the conflict between the Sith and Jedi employs the classic trope of black and white moral dualism—an elemental contrast between evil (the \\"darkness\\") and good (the \\"light\\") first postulated and elaborated in Zoroastrianism, from which the core mythos of Star Wars is much influenced.Featurette \\"The Chosen One\\", Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD The ongoing struggle of the humanistic \\"light side\\"-affiliated Jedi to permanently defeat the egoistic \\"Dark Side\\"-affiliated Sith is framed not only as a contest of values, but as a deep metaphysical conflict: The Dark Side of the Force is viewed by the Jedi, and generally represented within Star Wars media, as not only a dangerous expedient but as a form of existential corruption which must be purged for the universe, or a person, to attain spiritual balance. Jedi are often depicted as imperfect individuals, but their cause of selfless heroism is ultimately on the right side of an inexorable cosmic struggle against evil, embodied in the power-hungry Sith and the Dark Side of the Force. The dualistic relationship between the Sith' and the Jedi' concepts of \\"purity\\" mirrors the philosophical and literary concept of \\"Apollonian and Dionysian\\": the Jedi are portrayed as embracing purity, reason, temperance, altruism and other humanistic virtues; the Sith, by contrast, embrace curiosity, emotion, conflict, power, instincts, unfettered self-interest and other hedonistic vices. However, whereas the classic Greek concept did not necessarily view the Apollonian and Dyonisian principles as opposed, Star Wars frames the Jedi and Sith as opponents in a dire moral struggle, with the Sith cast as corrupted villains apparently destined to defeat or self-destruction in the end. Although a path to temporary power, the Sith way inevitably leads to ruin. Within the Star Wars narrative, the Jedi and Sith naturally have different self-understandings. In Sith rhetoric, the relationship between the philosophies of the Jedi and Sith closely mirrors Nietzsche's concept of master–slave morality. Sith value \\"master\\" virtues, such as pride and power, whereas the Jedi value altruistic virtues like kindness and empathy. The goal of the Sith is tangible greatness: the ability to shape and destroy the world according to one's will alone. The goal of the Jedi is moral goodness: freedom from inner, and outer, turmoil and suffering. However, the Sith consider the Jedi's aspirations to be either hopeless or pathetic. To the Sith, greater power is the only authentic goal. Development Originally, George Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel had served Adolf Hitler. In developing the backstory for The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Darth Vader. Fictional backstory Sith Ideology Sith philosophy lionized conflict as a catalyst for growth and as a tool for purging the weak, disloyal, undisciplined and unworthy. Sith academies were structured with rules, lectures, and classes, with an underlying \\"kill or be killed\\" mentality amongst the apprentices. Sith emphasize \\"survival of the fittest\\" and view restraint as a weakness. Members adhere to master morality, are characterized by the desire to seize power by any means necessary, leveraging force (both physical and supernatural), social maneuvering, and political cunning to their advantage. The Sith cultivate a connection to the dark side of the Force, which provides them with easy access to superhuman power and arcane knowledge; however, the trade-off is the severe cost of adopting a dark triad personality that corrodes their basic capacity for empathy, kindness, and love. Throughout Star Wars media and in popular culture, the Sith are infamous as the dualistic antagonists to the Jedi, an affiliation of altruistic warriors who strive to use their own martial training and connection to the \\"light side\\" of the Force to promote peace and the common welfare throughout the galaxy. The Sith have a philosophical framework that \\"justifies\\" their ruthless and self-serving actions, but their agenda are considered appalling by society in general, and the Jedi who actively oppose them. To counteract the Jedi's benevolent influence, the Sith were responsible for secretly instigating many small regional conflicts as part of their larger plan to destabilize the Republic and eventually take control of the galaxy. Hiding in the shadows, their fingerprints are everywhere, in every conflict in the galaxy, and their subversive influence reaches far and wide. Over their long storied history, the Sith have established great empires, come close to realizing their ambitions of galactic conquest, and nearly eradicated the Jedi. Ultimately, however, they are self-defeating, their grand plans undone time and again by internal strife, rebellion inspired by their vicious tactics, and the psychologically noxious effects of their dark arts and philosophy. The Dark Side of the Force The Sith are dedicated to the \\"Sith Code\\" and to mastering the Dark Side of the Force. The Sith Code identifies conflict as the fundamental dynamic of reality, and holds that the search for lasting peace, within or without, is both quixotic and misguided. Rather, Sith embrace strife and dark passion as salutary and emancipatory forces, as they believe that violent struggle purges the decadent and weak, and that emotions such as aggression and hate provide the strength and resolve to secure freedom through victory. Although Sith seek dominion, Sith philosophy stresses that power belongs only to those with the strength, cunning, and ruthlessness to maintain it, and thus \\"betrayal\\" among the Sith is not a vice but an endorsed norm. Accordingly, the Sith reject altruism, self-abnegation and kindness, as they regard such attitudes as founded on delusions that fetter one's perceptions and power. In connection with their philosophy, the Sith draw on the Dark Side of the Force through severe negative emotions, a technique antipodal to that of their archenemies, the Jedi, who rely on the Force's \\"light side,\\" i.e., the Force as experienced through disciplined states of quietude and compassion. Notably, both the Jedi and Sith shun romantic and familial love, as the Jedi fear such love will lead to attachment, and thus selfishness, and the Sith fear it will compromise their ruthlessness and connection to the Dark Side of the Force. Although the Sith are intimately linked to the Dark Side, not every user of the Dark Side is a Sith, nor is every user of the light side a Jedi. The Dark Side of the Force is stigmatized as seductive, corruptive, and addictive by the Jedi, who view it as evil, whereas the Sith consider the Dark Side of the Force to be its most powerful manifestation, and regard the abstemious Jedi as blinded by false virtue. As portrayed in all Star Wars- related media, the Dark Side provides users with powers similar to those of the light side-using Jedi, but as it leverages passion and violence, its use is enhanced by negative raw and aggressive emotions and instinctual feelings such as anger, greed, hatred, and rage. By deciding to learn the ways of the Dark Side of the Force, the Sith may also acquire powers and abilities considered by some in the Star Wars universe to be unnatural.Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith A notable example is a form of directed dielectric breakdown called \\"Force Lightning,\\" infamously used by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious to torture Jedi-initiate and rebel Luke Skywalker. Darth Sidious claimed that his own master, Darth Plagueis, could even use the Force to avert the natural deaths of those whose lives he wished to save. Being uninhibited in their use of the Force, Sith could also repurpose abilities shared with the Jedi, such as telekinesis, to new and terrifying effect: Darth Vader was infamous for his use of telekinetic strangulation, or \\"Force Choke,\\" as a means of execution or intimidation. Extended indulgence in the Dark Side reshapes the user's psychology, resulting in a loss of humanity, morality, empathy, and the ability to love, leaving every Sith, to varying degrees, amoral, cruel, sadistic and violent. Considering this dark change in personality to be a transformation into a different person altogether, some who turn to the Dark Side take on a different name, as they regard their former persona as dead and destroyed. Sith Lords, in particular, adopt a new name upon their initiation into the Order, prefixing it with the title Darth (e.g., \\"Darth Vader\\"). Severe saturation in the Dark Side may even lead to physical degradation. Although Sith are deeply affected by the Machiavellian methods and dark arts they practice, they are not portrayed as necessarily irredeemable: Some Sith, most famously Darth Vader in the final moments of his life, have renounced the Order and the Dark Side of the Force. Martial arts are a core part of the Sith tradition, and Sith featured in the Star Wars film series have all been highly trained warriors who further augment their abilities with the Force. Like the Jedi, the Sith's signature armament is an extremely lethal focused energy melee weapon known as a lightsaber, which (generally) only those trained in the ways of the Force can use effectively. Sith use lightsabers in combination with Force-derived powers, such as telekinesis, enhanced dexterity and precognition, to achieve superhuman combat prowess. A fully trained Sith is depicted as being at least a match for a well-trained Jedi Knight, and either can handily defeat multiple ordinary attackers armed with projectile weapons. In matters of dress, Sith may adopt any attire consistent with their plans or guise; they commonly favor black robes, armor and gis when presenting themselves authentically. Fictional backstory (Legends) In the Legends continuity, the Sith Order began around 6,900 BBY, during a period known as the Hundred Year Darkness. A series of conflicts began between the rebellious dark Jedi, a faction of the Jedi Order, and the rest of the Order. The dark Jedi were defeated and cast out, exiled to the unknown regions. These Exiles came across the planet Korriban, and its native species, the Sith. The strongest among the Exiles, Ajunta Pall, became the first to hold the title Dark Lord of the Sith. His contemporaries, such as Karness Muur and XoXaan became Sith Lords. The human Dark Jedi interbred with the Sith species, who also had an affinity for the Dark Side. They would become the original Sith Empire. One of the earliest leaders of this Sith Empire was Tulak Hord. He expanded the Sith territories and conquered the Dromund System, home to Dromuund Kaas, later the capital of the Sith Empire. He was eventually followed by Marka Ragnos, the last ruler of a period known as the Golden Age of the Sith. Upon the passing of Ragnos, two contenders for the throne of Dark Lord, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, dueled at his funeral. Eventually, after a series of conflicts, Sadow was victorious, and Kressh apparently killed. Sadow began the Great Hyperspace War, invading the Republic and laying siege to its planets. Sadow's efforts were initially met with success, his forces amplified by illusions that Sadow projected from his meditation sphere. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord's concentration was broken when his apprentice turned on him. With his illusions dispersed, Sadow's forces were forced to retreat. Upon returning to Sith space, they found that Kressh had not been killed, and engaged him in a space battle. Sadow was victorious again, but they were soon attacked by Republic forces. Sadow escaped by causing the Denarii Binary Star to go supernova. The Sith Empire would eventually rise again, with the rise of Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma. The spirit of the deceased Dark Lord, Marka Ragnos, declared Kun Dark Lord of the Sith, and made Qel-Droma his apprentice. Allying themselves with warriors such as the Mandalorians, Kun and Qel-Droma declared war on the Galactic Republic. During a raid on the Jedi Library at Ossus, Qel-Droma dueled and killed his brother, but was captured. Qel-Droma was redeemed and was instrumental in Kun's downfall, when the latter retreated to Yavin 4. At some point following the Mandalorian Wars, the individuals known as Revan and Alek declared themselves Sith Lords, and became Darth Revan and Darth Malak respectively. Their brutal campaign against the Republic was hugely successful. Revan was eventually betrayed by Malak, allowing a Jedi strike team to capture him. Malak continued his conquest without Revan's tactical leadership until a redeemed Revan defeated him, and the Star Forge, the source of the Sith Fleet was destroyed. Remnants of Revan's Sith Empire, led by the Sith Triumvirate, consisting of Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, began a shadow war against the Jedi. This First Jedi Purge, brought the Jedi Order to the brink of extinction. Their downfall came about when Meetra Surik, a Jedi who was exiled after the Mandalorian Wars, returned to known space. She defeated the three Sith, and without the Sith leadership, and the destruction of their base of operations on Malachor V, the remaining Sith forces faded into obscurity. Around 300 years later, the original Sith Empire, now under the leadership of Emperor Vitiate, emerged from the Unknown Regions and declared war on the republic. This war, dubbed the Great Galactic War, was halted when Vitiate, on the cusp of victory, was restrained by the telepathic prowess of Revan. After a period of non-fighting, called the Galactic Cold War, tensions boiled over, and the Galactic War began. The Sith empire eventually fell to infighting and mostly disappeared. Occasionally, a Dark Lord such as Darth Rivan or Darth Ruin, would rise and fall, but the Sith did not become a major threat again until around 2,500 years later. At this point, the Brotherhood of Darkness arose, led by the Sith Lord Skere Kaan. They focused on controlling the infighting between the Sith. This policy allowed them to make great progress in their war against the Republic. Ironically, one of their own, a Sith Lord by the name of Bane turned on them, because he disapproved of their methods. He manipulated the Brotherhood into extinction, and they were defeated. Bane started the Rule of Two, which evolved into the Sith as they are seen in the films. Fictional history The Star Wars saga began with the film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, which was released in 1977. Since then, films, books, computer games and comics have been released, all set in the fictional universe of Star Wars, which has expanded the history of the Sith within their stories. The schemes of the Sith are key to the overarching plot of the Star Wars films and much other fictional material in the franchise. Their background has varied among depictions, but the Sith have always been insidious archenemies of the Jedi leveraging dark arts in pursuit of power and revenge. The Sith were first mentioned in A New Hope in a scene ultimately cut from the film. They were expanded upon heavily in the following years in books, comics, games and other multimedia. The Sith were formally introduced on-screen with the release of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace in 1999 as a shadowy martial order manipulating the movie's political factions into a galaxy-spanning civil war. Star Wars: The Clone Wars first aired on Cartoon Network in 2008. This series took place between Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. During this time, Anakin Skywalker is a full-fledged Jedi Knight and the series shows how he progresses into his fall to the Dark Side of the Force. Count Dooku is the active Sith Lord and leader of the Separatist Alliance. The series also explores Dooku's attempts at training secret apprentices like Asajj Ventress and Savage Opress in order to eventually defeat Darth Sidious and become the ruling Sith Lord. Emergence of the Sith Order The origin, agenda, abilities and philosophy of the Sith are intertwined with their relationship to the Force. With proper training, the Force may be called upon by rare individuals capable of \\"sensing\\" or \\"touching\\" it to achieve extraordinary feats such as telekinesis, precognition and mental suggestion. Not all psychological states are conducive to employing the Force; discipline is required. However, both quietude and focused, intense passion alike can be effective. The Sith originated in a species of Force-sensitive warriors who discovered the efficacy of passion as a tool to draw on the Force at least 5,000 years prior to the events of the first Star Wars film. Fully embracing this approach, they became defined and corrupted by it. The warriors who would become the first Sith were apparently heterodox members of an older martial order of Force- sensitive sapient beings in the Star Wars universe: The Jedi. The Jedi served as a space-faring knightly order within the Galactic Republic, a representative democracy encompassing most developed worlds. The Jedi Order sought to use the powers of the Force to help defend the weak and advance the rule of law across the galaxy, in keeping with their ethics of self-sacrifice and service to the common welfare. The Jedi creed mirrored their method of utilizing the Force, and Jedi doctrine favored states of serenity, detachment, compassion, and humility as the proper means of accessing its power. When members of the Jedi Order began to experiment with passion as an alternative, controversy emerged. The Jedi establishment saw these innovations as a threat to the ethos of the Jedi, opening members to the seduction of aggrandizement and cruelty. Eventually, this controversy led to a sectarian conflict in which the heterodox Jedi were defeated and exiled.Marvel Comics, Star Wars 9 – \\"Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part II\\" In exile, the dissident Jedi were free to explore the relationship between passion and the Force. They concluded that the martial and ethical disciplines of the Jedi establishment were foolish and misguided: Passion, not quietude, was the most potent means of accessing the Force, and conflict, not peace, was the natural and healthy state of the universe. Rejecting the self-abnegation of their forebears, the exiles now embraced ruthless personal ambition, believing that power belonged to those with the cunning and strength to seize it. In their training, the dissidents would seek to master the Force by cultivating dark passions such as anger and hate, a practice anathematized by the Jedi as taking recourse to the Force's \\"Dark Side.\\" Guided by their kratocratic and egoistic philosophy and armed with taboo Dark Side techniques, the former Jedi exiles would reemerge to menace the galaxy as the Sith Order, aiming to conquer the Galactic Republic and exact revenge against the Jedi. A succession of Sith-led regimes would arise to challenge the Jedi and the Galactic Republic.Star Wars: The Clone Wars – \\"Escape from Kadavo\\" However, internal power struggles would prove decisive in thwarting the Sith's designs. The paradox of reconciling endless personal ambition with corporate action would become a great practical and philosophical concern for the Sith. Ultimately, this paradox would be “resolved” through a drastic reorganization effected by a leader named Darth Bane, who recast the Sith in an esoteric lineal master-apprentice tradition known as “The Rule of Two.”Star Wars: The Clone Wars – \\"Sacrifice\\" Thereafter (at least, as a matter of orthodoxy) there would be only two Sith at a time: One to embody power, and another to crave it. While concealing their identity as Sith, a succession of Sith masters and apprentices would work through the centuries to inveigle or force themselves into positions of power and undermine responsible government, preparing the Galactic Republic for eventual usurpation. The Banite tradition encouraged each apprentice to eventually challenge and slaughter his or her master, and take an apprentice in turn. In this way, Darth Bane guaranteed the conspiracy remained a secret for a thousand years; he believed that the kratocratic essence of Sith philosophy could be reconciled with a sustained project of galactic domination and revenge against the Jedi. The first six Star Wars films chronicle the consummation, and eventual undoing, of this ancient scheme. Ascent to power of the Sith Darth Bane's plan would come to fruition through Sheev Palpatine, a Naboo Senator, later Supreme Chancellor, of the Galactic Republic, and secretly a Dark Lord of the Sith (“Darth Sidious”). By manipulating disgruntled factions within the Galactic Republic, Palpatine orchestrated civil war. This conflict, known within the Star Wars universe as the \\"Clone Wars\\", provided a justification for consolidating power in the Galactic Republic's chief executive and assembling a large army of hastily cloned soldiers—surreptitiously conditioned to obey certain key commands issued by Palpatine. Although the Jedi eventually discovered Palpatine's identity as a Sith and attempted to arrest him, this action was anticipated by Palpatine, who framed their actions as an attempted coup, providing in turn a pretext for annihilating the Jedi by activating “Order 66,” one of the clone soldiers’ embedded protocols. In the course of effecting his designs, Palpatine also manipulated the Jedi's most powerful initiate, Anakin Skywalker, into his service, by promising to teach Skywalker Dark Side techniques that could save the life of Padmé Amidala, a Galactic Senator to whom Skywalker was secretly married in violation of Jedi rules, and whose death in childbirth Skywalker had preternaturally foreseen. In a tragic irony, Amidala's sheer horror at discovering Skywalker's collaboration with Sidious in destroying the Jedi would itself be the cause of her death during childbirth, though Sidious would trick Skywalker into believing that an episode of Skywalker's physical abuse of Amidala had been the actual cause of her death. Skywalker's subsequent emotional collapse would lead him to fully embrace the Dark Side of the Force and assume the persona of Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith. With Darth Vader at his side, the Emperor would rule the newly styled Galactic Empire for approximately 20 years as its Emperor. Initially unknown to Vader and Sidious, two children were delivered by Padme before her death. Sith temples The Rebels episode \\"Twilight of the Apprentice\\" features a forbidden planet called Malachor, home of an ancient Sith temple. The temple contains a superweapon, and can only be activated by placing a special Sith Holocron in an obelisk at the summit of the pyramid inside the temple. Thousands of years prior, a battle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants. Somewhere between the events of his last appearance in Solo: A Star Wars Story and this Rebels episode, Darth Maul had become stranded on the planet. When Ahsoka Tano, Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger arrive, Ezra is separated from them. He is discovered by Maul, and together, they use the Force cooperatively to solve a series of tests, and retrieve a Sith Holocron. With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka, they fought three Inquisitors, all of whom are killed by Maul. Maul then betrays his allies, blinding Kanan, and proceeds to activate the superweapon. Maul is defeated by a sightless Kanan, and Darth Vader arrives with the intention of retrieving the holocron, but is challenged by Ahsoka, his former Padawan. While the superweapon is preparing to fire, Kanan and Ezra retrieve the holocron and escape, preventing the weapon of mass destruction from being used. Even though the temple is destabilized, Ahsoka and Vader keep fighting to the death within the rapidly crumbling building, until it eventually explodes, wounding Vader. The Star Wars Resistance episode \\"The Relic Raiders\\" depicts a Sith temple hidden underneath a later Jedi temple. End of the Sith Anakin's children, Leia, and Luke Skywalker would become key members of the Rebel Alliance to restore the Galactic Republic. Luke would be secretly tutored in the ways of the Force by Vader's own former Jedi master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a powerful elder Jedi, Yoda, who also survived Palpatine's purge. Ironically, during a final confrontation between Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and the Emperor aboard a mobile battle station known as the Death Star, the Sith lineage would end as Darth Bane prescribed that it proceed. Darth Sidious offered Skywalker an ultimatum to enter his service or die, and proceeded to use his Force-derived powers to torture and kill Skywalker when the latter refused to embrace the Dark Side of the Force. Experiencing a crisis of conscience at the imminent death of Skywalker, whom Vader now knew to be his son, Darth Vader chose to intervene and kill his former master, Sidious fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. Vader would die of his own injuries shortly thereafter, thus apparently bringing an end to the Sith and their ancient vendetta. The 2019 film The Rise of Skywalker depicts the climax of the conflict between the Sith and the Jedi, and features the group known as the Sith Eternal, led by a resurrected Darth Sidious. When Sidious meets his final demise at the hands of his granddaughter, Rey, the moment also marks the definitive end of the Sith. Overview Timeline of members *Before the films - At an unknown point in time, numerous Jedi become disillusioned with the Order and exile themselves, forming the Sith Order. Thousands of years later, a centuries-long war between the Jedi and the Sith takes place, which culminates with the apparent defeat of all the Sith. The sole survivor, Darth Bane, takes an apprentice and goes on to create the Rule of Two, allowing the Sith to continue existing in secret for almost a millennium. Almost 1000 years after Bane's death, Darth Plagueis trains Sidious, who ultimately kills Plagueis in his sleep and takes Darth Maul as his first apprentice. * Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace - Sidious and Maul. The latter is seemingly killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi. * Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones - Sidious and Darth Tyranus. Maul lives, but is still presumed dead and does not appear in the film. * Star Wars: The Clone Wars film and series - Sidious, Tyranus, and Maul. Tyranus also takes Asajj Ventress as an informal apprentice, before replacing her with Savage Opress. Opress later betrays Tyranus and becomes the apprentice of his brother Maul, who now operates on his own as a crime lord. Ventress gives up her Sith ways and becomes a bounty hunter, but gets killed by Tyrannus. Opress also gets killed by Sidious. * Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith - Sidious and Tyranus. The latter is killed and replaced by Anakin Skywalker, who becomes Darth Vader. Maul also lives, but does not appear in the film. * Solo: A Star Wars Story - Maul. Sidious and Vader also live, but do not appear. * Star Wars Rebels - Sidious, Vader, and Maul. The latter no longer sees himself as a Sith and lives in exile; he is later killed in a duel with his long-time rival, Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Inquisitors are trained by Vader as Jedi hunters, but none are official Sith; the Grand Inquisitor, the Fifth Brother, the Seventh Sister, and the Eight Brother Inquisitors are all ultimately killed. * Rogue One and Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope - Vader. Sidious lives, and is only mentioned as \\"The Emperor\\". * Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back - Sidious and Vader. * Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi - Sidious and Vader. The latter gets redeemed by his son, Luke Skywalker, and dies while killing Sidious (who secretly survives by transferring his spirit into a clone body). * Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens - Snoke, Kylo Ren, and the Knights of Ren, although none are official Sith. Sidious also lives, but does not appear in the film. * Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi - Snoke and Kylo Ren. The former gets killed by Ren. Sidious and the Knights of Ren also live, but do not appear. * Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker - Sidious, Kylo Ren, and the Knights of Ren. Sidious gets killed by Rey, Ren redeems himself and dies to save Rey, and the Knights of Ren get killed by the redeemed Kylo Ren.  Members   In film  = Darth Sidious = Darth Sidious (Sheev Palpatine) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith who appeared in each trilogy of the Skywalker Saga. Originally the eldest son of an aristocratic family from the planet Naboo, he rose to power within the Galactic Republic's government system starting from Senator of his homeworld, then to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and finally to self-proclaimed Emperor of the Galactic Empire. This was done by cultivating a public image as a humble and competent politician while secretly mastering dark Sith arts studying under Plagueis, and planning the destruction of the Jedi Order and Republic. Eventually, by manipulating disaffected political groups and using double agents to sow discord, Palpatine fomented a civil war that provided an opportunity for him to seize absolute power. He had three known Sith apprentices: Darth Maul, Darth Tyranus, and Darth Vader. He was eventually betrayed and killed by his last, Vader, at the end of Return of the Jedi. He returned more than 30 years later in The Rise of Skywalker, having managed to cheat death through powerful mastery of the dark side of the Force. He was finally killed by his granddaughter, Rey, who deflected his Force lightning back at him using the Skywalker lightsabers. Darth Sidious' death marked what appears to be the definitive end of the Sith. In Legends continuity, Darth Sidious would return using clones and ancient Sith powers, returning in several clone bodies over the course of several novels and comics. During this time he would briefly turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side of the Force through sheer power as much as by guile, though Luke would later be redeemed by his sister Leia and restored to the light side of the Force and defeated Palpatine once and for all. Shortly before his first death, Palpatine had sent a psychic command through the Force to Mara Jade, planting in her the need to kill Luke. She eventually fulfilled this command by slaying a clone of Luke called Luke Skywalker, whom Palpatine had made in an attempt to use him against the original, though this plot ultimately would fail due to Mara's fatal attack on the clone. = Darth Maul = Darth Maul (Maul) was a male Dathomirian Zabrak Sith Lord who served as the first apprentice of Darth Sidious. He first appeared in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, where he was ordered by his master to capture Queen Amidala of Naboo in order for her to sign a treaty that would legalize the Trade Federation's invasion of the planet. After tracking the Queen's personal starship to Tatooine, he briefly attacked Qui-Gon Jinn, the Jedi sent to escort Amidala to Coruscant, but he escaped. Later, Maul travelled to Naboo to aid the Federation's invasion and again fought Jinn, along with his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi in the plasma refinery complex beneath Theed Palace. Though he managed to kill Jinn, he was then defeated by Kenobi, who sliced him in half, leading to everyone, including Sidious, to believe he had died. In reality, however, Maul survived his injuries and ended up on the junk planet Lotho Minor, where he would become a cyborg and be driven to insanity. He was eventually rescued by his brother Savage Opress twelve years later, during the Clone Wars. After being provided with a pair of new robotic legs by the Nightsisters, led by Maul's mother, Talzin, he sought revenge against Kenobi. In the process, he recruited several crime syndicates to his cause, forming the Shadow Collective. He took over Mandalore, only to be defeated and captured by Sidious. Maul later escaped and managed to rebuild his criminal empire. Near the end of the war, he engineered a conflict on Mandalore to lure out and kill Anakin Skywalker. Ahsoka Tano was sent to deal with him instead, and he was captured, only to be freed by Tano when Sidious executed Order 66, causing the clone troopers to turn on their Jedi generals. During the Galactic Empire era, Maul, having abandoned his Sith persona, led the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate, until being stranded on the Sith world of Malachor for years. He escaped after meeting Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger, whom he attempts to turn to the dark side, and later forced to assist in locating Kenobi. Upon tracking him down to Tatooine, he confronted Kenobi and fought him one final time.

He played an important role in Sidious' plans to take over the galaxy, engineering the Clone Wars by recruiting the bounty hunter Jango Fett as the template for a clone army that would be used by the Republic, and forming the Confederacy of Independent Systems, consisting of numerous planets and systems who wanted to become independent from the Republic. Dooku served as the figurehead of the Separatist Alliance throughout the Clone Wars until meeting his demise at the hands of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, who decapitated him at Chancellor Palpatine's (secretly Darth Sidious) urgings, thus revealing that Sidious never cared about Dooku and merely used him to aid his plans. Dooku was succeeded by Anakin himself, who fell to the dark side of the Force shortly after and became Sidious' third apprentice, Darth Vader, accomplishing what Dooku couldn't: helping Sidious wipe out the Jedi Order and form the Galactic Empire. = Darth Vader = Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker) was a male human-cyborg Dark Lord of the Sith and the third and final apprentice of Darth Sidious, who first appeared in the Star Wars original trilogy, and later in the prequel trilogy.

After helping Sidious kill Jedi Master Mace Windu, he swore allegiance to the Sith and was given the name Darth Vader before setting out to destroy all Jedi left on Coruscant. After being sent by Sidious to assassinate the Separatist council members on Mustafar, Vader was badly injured in a duel with Kenobi, resulting in the loss of his remaining organic arm, both legs, and severe burn injuries. He was saved by Sidious, and encased in a black suit of armor with extensive cybernetics which kept him alive. As the Galactic Empire was established and continued to grow, Vader became the Emperor's immensely feared second-in-command and was given the task of finding surviving Jedi and the Rebel Alliance's base. After the destruction of the first Death Star, Vader was charged with tracking down the Rebel Alliance and destroying their headquarters.

One of the prophecies said that evil would disappear yet appear again once the righteous had lost its light, which many believed that was referring to the return of the Sith. At that time, Qui-Gon believed that the prophecy talked about Darth Wrend's return from the dead and that it had already been fulfilled, although it would later be revealed that the prophecy referred to the Jedi learning about Darth Sidious' existence and that the Sith had lived in secret for almost a millennium. = Darth Tanis = Darth Tanis was an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who lived at least 4,000 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope, as Sith accounts from the year 3966 BBY described kyber weaponry developed by him on the planet Malachor.

Once Jedi heroes who led the Republic to victory in the Mandalorian Wars, Revan and his comrade, Alek, turned to the dark side after stumbling upon the Sith Empire, hidden in the Unknown Reaches of space, and being tortured by the Sith Emperor. Upon escaping, the pair formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Alek, now Darth Malak, as his Sith Apprentice. As a Sith, Revan prepared to battle with the Jedi who boarded his flagship, but Malak, in the hopes of destroying both Revan and Bastila Shan, betrayed his master, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge. Revan was critically injured and taken by Bastila Shan to the Jedi Council Enclave. The Council chose to wipe Revan's memory, and imprint him with a false identity. Revan later awoke on a starship under attack and encountered Malak, who eventually revealed the truth of his identity. Following this, Revan defeated Malak in a final battle, claiming victory for the Republic. Revan later married Bastila Shan with the approval of the Jedi Council and eventually departed into the Unknown Regions to confront the Sith Emperor, but was imprisoned for 300 years until his descendant Satele Shan rescued him. However, due to being imprisoned for centuries, his lighter half had perished and became a Force spirit, leaving only his darker half, which sought to destroy the Sith Emperor once and for all. Since the Emperor's physical body had already been destroyed, leaving only his spirit, Revan planned to resurrect him so that he could then kill him for good. However, he was ultimately defeated by the combined forces of the Republic and his lighter half. The two halves of Revan then merged in peace and died for the final time, although, unbeknownst to everyone, the Sith Emperor had been resurrected and escaped into the galaxy.

Momin was eventually rescued by a woman named Shaa, who trained him in the dark ide of the Force and whom he eventually killed after believing that he had become more powerful than his master. Momin then built a superweapon to destroy an entire city and perished when the Jedi intervened to stop him, losing control over the energy he wielded and causing his physical body to be destroyed, leaving only his mask with his consciousness inside. Years later, the mask would be retrieved from the Jedi Archive vault by Darth Sidious, who gave it to his apprentice Darth Vader as a gift for his journey to Mustafar, which Vader sought to make his personal stronghold. After Momin's spirit killed some of his personnel, Vader examined the mask and learned of Momin's past, before letting him possess the body of a Mustafarian and build a fortress for him. Shortly after Momin finished building of the fortress, Vader was distracted by an invasion of Mustafarians, which Momin took advantage of to open the door to the Dark Side and resurrect himself. However, after challenging Vader to a duel, Momin met a quick demise by being crushed with a giant rock. Despite Momin's death, his dark essence would remain in the mask for years to come. At one point, Momin's mask was located aboard the Imperial yacht Imperialis, when a group of thieves led by Lando Calrissian attempt to rob the ship. After Momin's spirit possessed the bodies of two thieves, the others abandoned them and destroyed the ship, seemingly ending Momin's legacy.

His public persona was Rugess Tome, a legendary artisanal starship designer with a galaxy-spanning reputation, and he was known for being a scientific genius and master planner, as well as for his breathing apparatus. Tenebrous' secret plan was to possess the Chosen One once he would appear, but he was eventually killed by Plagueis during a mission on the planet Ban'demnic. However, Tenebrous wasn't too surprised at Plagueis's betrayal and instead congratulated him with his dying breath, because his conscience would soon be able to enter his apprentice's body. Despite managing to cheat death, Tenebrous' plan failed, because, during his time in Plagueis' body, he foresaw him being killed by his own apprentice before the appearance of the Chosen One, meaning that Tenebrous would never be able to possess him. Tenebrous then tried to escape from Plagueis' body, but only saw the mummified remains of his original body, as decades had passed since his death. As such, Tenebrous was cursed to remain a vague spirit for the rest of eternity, unable to gain a physical body ever again. In the Star Wars canon continuity, Darth Tenebrous is only mentioned in The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Tenebrous many years after his death and had the 26th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him. = Darth Plagueis = Darth Plagueis was a male Dark Lord of the Sith and Darth Sidious' master, first referenced in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.

She first appeared in the now non-canonical 2003 series Star Wars: Clone Wars, in which Darth Sidious assigned her to kill the then-Padawan Anakin Skywalker. After tracking the young war hero to the planet Muunilinst, Ventress engaged Anakin's Republic fighter forces fighting above the Separatist-occupied world and baited him in a chase to Yavin 4, where a fierce battle from the forest to the Massassi temple took place. Though she initially gained the upper hand in the ensuing lightsaber duel, Anakin called upon his immense connection to the Force to brutally overpower her, causing the Dathomirian to fall over the edge of a cliff. She luckily survived the landing and continued to serve her master throughout the Clone Wars on several occasions. In Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Ventress was a recurring antagonist during the first seasons, as she assisted Dooku with several schemes, most of which were thwarted by the Jedi. After being replaced with Savage Opress for her failures, Ventress returned to the Nightsisters until General Grievous led a massacre against them, which only she and Mother Talzin survived. From there, she helped Boba Fett's team of bounty hunters on a dangerous mission, which thus marked the start of her own bounty hunting career. Ventres later appeared in the novel Star Wars: Dark Disciple, which was intended for a story arc in the TV series. In the novel, she teamed up with Jedi Quinlan Vos to assassinate Count Dooku, and, along the way, the two fell in love. However, their attempt to kill Dooku failed, and Dooku captured Vos, turning him to the dark side. Ventress managed to turn Vos back, but died saving him from an angered Dooku and was later buried on Dathomir, amongst her fallen sisters. = Savage Opress = Savage Opress was a male Dathomirian Zabrak Sith Shadow Hand first trained under Darth Tyrannus and later under his own brother, Darth Maul, as well as a major antagonist in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Originally a Nightbrother under Mother Talzin on Dathomir, he was handpicked by Asajj Ventress as part of her scheme to kill Darth Tyrannus for the attempt on her life. His mind was eventually altered by the Nightsisters, making him more of a berserker on Ventress' call to the point of killing his brother Feral without remorse. Opress managed to become Tyrannus' new Shadow Hand and learned only a little about the ways of the Sith before Ventress had him help her fight their master due to his actions under him getting unwanted attention from the Jedi. However, in the heat of the moment and provoked by both of them, Opress tried to kill both Tyrannus and Ventress before escaping back to Dathomir. There, he was instructed by Mother Talzin to find Maul so that he could complete his training to defend himself against the numerous enemies he had made. After finding his long-lost brother as a shell of his former self on a junk planet, Opress managed to stir up Maul's grudge with Obi-Wan Kenobi to aid him in his revenge against the Jedi. From there, the Zabrak duo were able to set up a Confederacy against the Republic separate from the Separatists, and soon took over Mandalore. However, they received an unexpected visit by Darth Sidious, who considered Maul's sudden rise to power a threat to his rule, and dueled both him and Opress. The latter met a quick demise after being stabbed with Sidious' two lightsabers, and died in Maul's arms. = Inquisitorius = The Inquisitors were an organization of Force- sensitive warriors in the service of the Galactic Empire prior to the events of A New Hope, where it is implied that they all became defunct, as Darth Vader and Darth Sidious were the only known Force-wielders at that time.

Over the years, the Inquisitor worked his way up the Empire's ranks and eventually became the highest-ranking Inquisitor, being tasked (along with his subordinates) with hunting down Force-sensitive children across the galaxy and preventing them from becoming Jedi. The Grand Inquisitor first appeared as the main antagonist of the first season of Star Wars: Rebels, where he was assigned to hunt down Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger. He was eventually defeated by Kanan in combat and chose to commit suicide rather than face the infamous wrath of Darth Vader for his failure. A vision of the Grand Inquisitor in his old Jedi Temple Guard attire later appeared to Kanan in the Jedi Temple on Lothal and dueled him as part of his final trial to become a Jedi Knight. *The Second Sister - Trilla Suduri was the Padawan of Jedi Knight Cere Junda and one of the few survivors of the Great Jedi Purge.

She first appeared in the novel Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith, where she assisted Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother and the Tenth Brother in hunting the Jedi Ferren Barr on the planet Mon Cala. After Barr used the Force to turn the Imperial stormtroopers present against them, the Ninth Sister was betrayed by the Sixth Brother, who severed her right foot and left her behind to die so that he could escape, although she managed to survive the ordeal as well. She later appeared as an antagonist in the video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, where she joined the Second Sister in the hunt for Cal Kestis. The Ninth Sister was ultimately defeated by the young Padawan on Kashyyyk, who severed her right hand as well.

Later, the Fifth Brother informed Vader of her actions and, believing it to be an act of treason, he tried to kill her in front of the other Inquisitors. She managed to escape with the help of her fellow Twi'lek Inquisitor, but they were both eventually caught following a long chase through Coruscant and chose to commit suicide rather than be killed by Vader. *Unnamed Twi'lek Inquisitor - A black- skinned male Twi'lek Inquisitor appeared in the novel Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith, where he assisted Darth Vader, the Fifth Brother and another red- skinned female Inquisitor in hunting Jedi Master Eeth Koth.

He trained under Snoke to become a powerful dark side wielder, and later proved his loyalty by killing his father when he tried to help him get redeemed. However, Ren eventually betrayed and killed his master after siding with the Jedi Padwan Rey, with whom he shared a unique connection called a \\"dyad in the Force\\". However, instead of turning back to the light side, he took over as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and invited Rey to join him, but she refused. Later, Ren had a confrontation with Luke, only to discover that he was a Force projection, meant to distract him and allow the Resistance to escape; nontheless, Luke died as a result of the effort to create the projection, leaving Rey the only living Jedi. Eventually, Ren discovered that the Sith Lord Darth Sidious was still alive and plotted to kill this potential rival, but instead sided to him after he revealed an armada of Xyston-class Star Destroyers equipped with axial superlasers capable of decimating entire planets, which he promised to give Ren control of in exchange for killing Rey, revealed to be his grandaughter. Secretly, however, Ren planned to have Rey help him kill Sidious, and engaged her in a duel when she refused, which Ren lost after his mother gave her life to reach out to him through the force. After a conversation with a memory of his late father, Ben Solo was redeemed and came to Rey's aid in defeating Sidious. After Rey died to kill the Sith Lord, Ben revived her using the Force, and shared a kiss with her, but then died as a result of using all his life energy to save her, becoming one with the Force. = Knights of Ren = The Knights of Ren were an organization of masked Force-wielding warriors, who served as antagonists in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The Knights were neither Sith or Jedi, but a new generation of dark side warriors that emerged to fill the void left by the supposed demise of the last Sith Lords, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. They had a code, to which they were flexible in the following: living life the way they wanted, taking what the galaxy gave them, and consuming what the dark side sent them. Their name came from a lightsaber called \\"Ren\\", which was at the base of their code and could only be wielded by their leader. The Knights consisted of seven individuals named Ren (their leader), Vicrul, Ap'lek, Cardo, Kuruk, Trudgen, and Ushar. After his fall to the dark side, Ben Solo joined the Knights and eventually killed Ren, becoming their new leader, under the alias Kylo Ren. After Kylo became the Supreme Leader of the First Order, the Knights became his personal guards, though they ultimately sided with the resurrected Darth Sidious after Ben returned to the light side, which led to their demise at the hands of the redeemed Ben. Sith Eternal The 2019 film Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker depicts thousands of Sith cultists and loyalists known as the Sith Eternal. They are located on the Sith planet Exegol, which is described in the film as the \\"hidden world of the Sith\\". The film depicts the Sith loyalists as having built a secret armada of superlaser-equipped Star Destroyers at the behest of Emperor Palpatine (Darth Sidious). They are also revealed to have artificially created and cloned Snoke, whom Palpatine used as a puppet to control the First Order and seduce Kylo Ren to the dark side. At the end of the film, the Sith Eternal are present during Palpatine's rejuvenation through the Force and his demise at the hands of Rey, the last Jedi and Palpatine's granddaughter. The Sith Eternal are disintegrated in the explosion following Palpatine's death. The novelization of The Rise of Skywalker goes into more detail about how Palpatine transferred his consciousness into the cloned body the Sith Eternal prepared for him.  Legends non-canonical members of the Sith  Following the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, Lucasfilm rebranded most of the licensed Star Wars novels, comics, and other fictional media published since the original 1977 film (previously identified as the Star Wars Expanded Universe) as Star Wars Legends and declared them non-canonical to the franchise in April 2014. The Sith feature heavily in many stories of the Star Wars Expanded Universe (EU), appearing in a variety of media created prior to the advent of the 2015 feature film Star Wars: The Force Awakens.Ars Technica Op-ed: Disney takes a chainsaw to the Star Wars expanded universe, 1/10/2014 Future authors and screenwriters are not required to honor all of the events depicted in this material, but the Expanded Universe has remained a source of creative inspiration. The EU thoroughly details the schism between the dissident “Dark Jedi” and the Jedi establishment that led to the creation of the Sith Order, as well a series of conflicts between the Sith, Jedi and the Galactic Republic spanning the millennia prior to the events of the Star Wars motion picture series, and certain events thereafter. In the EU, the Sith trace their origins to the followers of a dissident Jedi named Ajunta Pall, who endorsed the use of the Dark Side of the Force, contrary to Jedi orthodoxy.Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side After Pall and his “Dark Jedi” followers were exiled for their practices, they eventually settled on a planet named Korriban, which was occupied by the \\"Sith,\\" a red-skinned humanoid race with a high prevalence of Force-sensitives. Over the course of centuries of intermingling between the ethnic Sith and Dark Jedi, the name \\"Sith\\" would come to apply to the martial philosophy and political affiliation created by the former Jedi exiles on Korriban, rather than a specific race. This Sith regime would strike out at the Galactic Republic and Jedi on numerous occasions. Notable conflicts between the Sith and the Galactic Republic include the \\"Great Hyperspace War,\\" in which the Sith would launch a massive invasion of the Republic but succumb to infighting, and the “Sith Holocaust,” in which the Galactic Republic failed in its attempt to exterminate the Sith from known space, leading the Sith survivors to take a vow of eternal vengeance on the Galactic Republic. The EU also describes the exploits of Sith characters following the collapse of Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire and the restoration of the Republic, such as the attempt by “Darth Krayt” to establish a New Sith Order on Korriban. The first Expanded Universe novel was Splinter of the Mind's Eye, written by Alan Dean Foster and published in 1978. The setting for the novel takes place between Episode IV: A New Hope and Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. It provides a new adventure that includes Princess Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. In the story, Darth Vader tries to get the Kyber Crystal to use it for his evil schemes. Other novels that depict Sith characters are Darth Maul: Saboteur and Cloak of Deception by James Luceno. Cloak of Deception describes the political background surrounding the Republic in the time period before The Phantom Menace, as well as Darth Sidious' plans to rule the galaxy, starting with the blockade of Naboo. In Darth Maul: Saboteur, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious sends Darth Maul to destroy InterGalactic Ore and Lommite Limited. In Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter, by Michael Reaves, Darth Sidious sends his apprentice, Darth Maul, to investigate the traitor who leaked the secret of his plan to take down the Republic. Shadow Hunter provided insight into the Sith while detailing how Darth Sidious brought his plan of usurpation into action. Dark Horse Comics purchased the copyrights to several Star Wars stories. With their publication of Star Wars: Dark Empire #1 in 1991, they initiated what has become a large line of Star Wars manga and comics. The Sith appear as major antagonists throughout this story's plot. Many of the comics that were published helped expand the backstory of the characters and followed the rise and fall of the Dark Lords of the Sith. Star Wars video games have also been adapted from the plots of the films, novels, and TV shows. The games follow the basic plot of the story, but they can also include alternative, non- canonical, endings depending on which character is being played. Some of the video games that have a heavy focus on Sith characters and lore are Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, released in 2003, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords, released in 2004 and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, released in 2008. = Darth Caedus = Darth Caedus (Jacen Solo) was a Dark Lord of the Sith born as the oldest son of Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo. A Jedi hero of the Yuuzhan Vong War, he eventually fell to the Dark Side years later and masterminded the Second Galactic Civil War. He was eventually killed by his twin sister Jaina for his actions. = Marka Ragnos = Marka Ragnos was an ancient Sith-human hybrid Sith Lord, who lived during the time of the first Sith Empire, and seized the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, serving as the ruler of the Empire. After his death, two Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, fought to occupy his throne, only for Ragnos' spirit to appear before them and claim that only the most worthy should succeed him. Ragnos lived on as a Force spirit following his death, trapped within his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. A thousand years after the Dark Lord's death, Exar Kun summoned Ragnos from his grave through the use of talismans. Ragnos crowned Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord, with Ulic Qel-Droma as Kun's apprentice, as an attempt to resurrect the lost empire thousands of years prior. Several thousands of years after that, in the video game Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy (set during the New Republic era), a cult dedicated to Ragnos, led by the Dark Jedi Tavion Axmis, raised as a new threat to the galaxy, with the intent of resurrecting the Sith Lord using an old artifact called the Scepter of Ragnos. After absorbing Force energy from numerous locations across the galaxy using the scepter, Tavion and her cult traveled to Korriban and almost succeeded in resurrecting Ragnos, but were stopped by Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. Inside Ragnos' tomb, the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr defeated Tavion, before Ragnos' spirit emerged and possessed her body, attempting to kill the Jedi. However, Jaden was able to defeat Ragnos, whose spirit left Tavion's body and returned to the depths of the Force, swearing revenge against the Jedi. = Darth Venamis = Darth Venamis was a Bith Dark Lord of the Sith who served as Darth Tenebrous' secret apprentice, as it was a violation of the Rule of Two. After Tenebrous was killed by his other apprentice, Darth Plagueis, he eventually found and defeated Venamis, before capturing him and using him as a test subject for his midi-chlorians experiments over the following years. After decades of torture and being killed and then brought back to life over and over again, Plaugeis finally allowed Venamis to die, having served his purpose. However, he later revived again in the presence of his new apprentice, Darth Sidious, until Venamis' organs finally ceased to function, and he died for the final time. = Knights of the Old Republic series = = Darth Malak = Darth Malak (Alek) is the main antagonist of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Once a Jedi Knight and Revan's best friend, the two of them fought together in the Mandalorian Wars. At some point, Alek was injured in battle and had his entire lower jaw cut off, forcing him to don a prosthetic jaw instead. Later, Alek and Revan unwittingly discovered the Sith Empire in the Unknown Regions and were captured by the Sith Emperor, who, using Sith sorcery, turned them to the dark side, but the two broke free from his control and formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Alek, now Darth Malak, as his Sith Apprentice. When Revan prepared to battle the Jedi who boarded his flagship, Malak betrayed him, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge, so that he could take over the Sith Empire for himself. However, Revan survived the ordeal and was taken to the Jedi Council Enclave, where he had his memory wiped, so that he would become a Jedi once again. Eventually, Revan faced off against Malak, who revealed the truth of his identity, but was ultimately killed in battle by his former friend and Sith Master, which also led to the downfall of his Empire. = Darth Traya = Darth Traya (Kreia) is a mentor to the \\"Jedi Exile\\" and the hidden main antagonist of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords. She is revealed to have been a Sith Master at the end of the game, and is ultimately killed in battle. = Darth Sion = Darth Sion, also known as the Lord of Pain, is an antagonist in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords. Alongside Darth Nihilus, he served as one of Traya's apprentices, until ultimately betraying her and driving her into exile. Sion managed to achieve immortality by calling on his pain, anger and hatred every time he was facing certain death, at the expense of all-consuming agony, which also led to his extremely disfigured appearance. The player's character eventually defeated Sion, and was then given the option to turn him back to the light side. Regardless, upon being shown the price he paid for immortality, Sion finally let go of his hate and allowed himself to die permanently. = Darth Nihilus = Darth Nihilus, also known as the Lord of Hunger, is an antagonist in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords. Alongside Darth Sion, he served as one of Traya's apprentices, until ultimately betraying her and driving her into exile. Nihilus imbued his dark soul into his mask and robes and had the power to drain the life force out of any living thing. Following the betrayal of his master, Nihilus used the might of the Sith Armada not to conquer planets, but to contain them so that he could \\"feed\\" off the Force energy of each planet's lifeforms, wiping planets of life. However, Nihilus was later drawn out and tricked into launching an attack on Telos, believing it to contain the last Jedi. The Exile confronted Nihilus on his ship, and Nihilus was killed either after his former slave Visas sacrificed herself due to their shared link in the Force, or after his attempt to feast on the Exile's connection to the Force backfired and weakened him. Despite his death, Nihilus' soul would continue to live in his mask and robes for millennia to come, as well as inside his own Sith holocron. = Lord Vitiate = Known for much of his 1300-year life as \\"the Sith Emperor\\", Lord Vitiate was a sociopathic young lord in one of the earliest iterations of the Sith Empire. When that empire fell, he led an exodus of survivors to the other side of the galaxy to establish a continuation of it, with himself as Emperor. It was Vitiate who corrupted Revan and Malak, but Revan's redemption and Malak's defeat seemingly derailed his plans. Three hundred years after Revan's disappearance, the Emperor launched a surprise attack on the Republic, setting the stage for the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. = Darth Malgus = Darth Malgus (Veradun) is a major antagonist in Star Wars: The Old Republic. A male human Dark Lord of the Sith who trained under Vindican, Malgus served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Republic. Following the recapture of Korriban from the Jedi, Malgus killed his master and later led a surprise assault on Alderaan, only to be defeated by his nemesis and former opponent from Korriban, Satele Shan. Malgus was severely injured in the fight against Shan, forcing him to wear a respiratory apparatus for the rest of his life. Sometime later, Malgus was tasked by his superior, Darth Angral, with leading an assault team on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, which Malgus and his forces destroyed, disgracing the Jedi Order in the eyes of the Republic. Although Malgus believed that the Battle of Coruscant was the first step of destroying the Republic, it only served as leverage in the peace negotiations that took place on Alderaan. While the Alderaanian summit progressed, the Sith settled into an occupation of Coruscant. Malgus was placed in charge of orbital security, but the Sith Lord defied his orders and traveled back to Coruscant's surface to strike against the renegade Jedi Aryn Leneer, who wanted to avenge her master Ven Zallow, killed by Malgus during the attack on the Jedi Temple. Although Leneer ultimately failed, the conflict caused Malgus to become disillusioned with the Empire and to kill his lover Eleena Daru, seeing their relationship as a weakness that prevented him from preserving his own power, which he later used to cleanse the Empire of the politicians whom he blamed for allowing the Republic to survive. During the Cold War years that followed the successful peace negotiations, Malgus led Sith forces into the Unknown Regions, claiming previously-unknown territories for the Empire. Towards the end of the war, following the presumed death of the Sith Emperor and his service on the Dark Council, Malgus formed his own Empire, free of the infighting of the Dark Council. However, the Republic and the Sith Empire forces soon teamed up to fight against Malgus' Empire and managed to track him down to his secret base, where they defeated him. Despite his apparent death, Malgus later resurfaced during the Invasion of Ossus at the start of the Third Galactic War, once again serving as a commander within the Sith Empire. However, following the Battle of Corellia, Malgus went rogue, determined to expunge all physical and mental restraints used to keep him under control. Thousands of years after his death, Malgus was still remembered as one of the most powerful Sith Lords to have ever lived. At one point, Darth Sidious acquired some surviving excerpts of Malgus's journals, which he bounded into his Book of Sith, an anthology of Sith historical writings. In popular culture Prominent Sith Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine have become iconic villains in popular culture. Their personae are frequently used as exemplars of Machiavelianism, authoritarianism, brutality and evil in serious, humorous and satirical settings. Palpatine is archetypal as the \\"Evil Emperor\\"—a cunning tyrant who rules through deception, propaganda, fear and oppression. Although usually considered as a villainous \\"enforcer\\" of such power, Darth Vader has also been regarded as a tragic figure and cautionary study in the corruption of a hero who loses sight of the greater good and resorts to evil practices out of fear and desperation. A \\"turn to the Dark Side\\" has become a popular idiom to describe an (often misguided) individual or institution's embrace of evil out of a desire for power.

Types  Glycemic index Glycemic index is a ranking of how quickly food is metabolized into glucose when digested. It compares available carbohydrates gram-for-gram in foods to provide a numerical, evidence-based index of postprandial (post-meal) blood sugar level. The concept was invented by David J. Jenkins and colleagues in 1981 at the University of Toronto.Brouns et al. (2005). \\"Glycaemic index methodology.\\" Nutrition Research Reviews 18; 145–171. The glycemic load (GL) of food is a number which estimates how much a food will raise a person's blood glucose level. Guiding Stars Guiding Stars is a patented food-rating system which rates food based on nutrient density with a scientific algorithm. Foods are credited with vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, whole grains and Omega-3 fatty acids, and discredited for saturated fat, trans fats, and added sodium (salt) and sugar. Rated foods are tagged with one, two or three stars, with three stars the best ranking. The program began at Hannaford Supermarkets in 2006, and is found in over 1,900 supermarkets in Canada and the US. Guiding Stars has expanded into public schools, colleges and hospitals. The evidence-based, proprietary algorithm is based on the dietary guidelines and recommendations of regulatory and health organizations, including the US Food and Drug Administration and Department of Agriculture and the World Health Organization. The algorithm was developed by a scientific advisory panel composed of experts in nutrition and health from Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Tufts University, the University of North Carolina, and other colleges. Nutripoints Nutripoints is a food- rating system which places foods on a numerical scale based on their overall nutritional value. The method is based on an analysis of 26 positive factors (such as vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber) and negative factors (such as cholesterol, saturated fat, sugar and sodium) relative to calories. The Nutripoint score of the food is the end result. The higher the value, the more nutrition per calorie (nutrient-dense) and the fewest negative factors exist in the food. Nutripoints was developed by Doctor of Public Health Roy E. Vartabedian during the 1980s and was released in 1990 with his book, Nutripoints, which was published in thirteen countries in ten languages. The food-rating system is part of a program to help people measure, balance, and upgrade their diet for improvement in well-being. The system rates over 3,600 foods, from apples and oranges to fast foods and brand-name products. Nutrition iQ The Nutrition iQ program is a joint venture of the Joslin Clinic and the supermarket operator SuperValu. The labeling system consists of color-coded tags denoting a food product's status. This is based on attributes such as vitamin and mineral content, fiber content, 100%-juice content, Omega-3 or low saturated-fat content, whole-grain content, calcium content, protein content, low- or reduced-sodium content and low- or reduced-calorie content. The first phase of the program began in 2009, covering center-store food products; coverage of fresh-food departments followed in 2011. Points Food System Weight Watchers developed the Points Food System for use with its Flex Plan. The system's primary objective is to maintain a healthy weight and to track weight loss or gain over time. It is designed to allow users to eat any food, tracking the number of points for each food consumed. Members try to keep to their points target for a given time within a given range, which is personalized based on the member's height, weight and other factors (such as gender). A weekly points allowance for is established to provide for special occasions and occasional overindulgences. Naturally Nutrient Rich  Developed by Adam Drewnowski of the University of Washington, the Naturally Nutrient Rich system is based on mean-percentage daily values (DVs) for 14 nutrients in food with 2,000 calories. It proposes to assign nutrient- density values to foods within and across food groups. The score allows consumers to identify and select nutrient-dense foods, permitting flexibility in discretionary calories consumed. ReViVer Score Developed by ReViVer, a nutritionally-oriented restaurant in New York City,\\"ReViVer Serves Healthy Food Backed By Science.\\" Wall Street Journal August 4, 2014. the ReViVer Score expresses nutrient density of menu items relative to calories from a variety of fast-food and casual restaurants based on ten nutrients: vitamins A, C, and E, folate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, fiber, and omega-3 fats. A score of 100 indicates that a meal provides at least 100% of the recommended daily intake for all ten nutrients, proportional to its energy (calorie) content. Past systems NuVal The overall nutritional quality index was a nutritional-rating system developed at the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. It assigned foods a score between 1 and 100 which reflected overall nutrition relative to calories consumed. Marketed as NuVal, it was widely adopted in United States grocery stores before it was discontinued in 2017 amid accusations of conflicts of interest and for its refusal to publish the scoring algorithm. Scoring inconsistencies occurred, in which processed foods scored higher than canned fruits and vegetables. Smart Choices Program Launched late in 2009, the Smart Choices Program (SCP) was a rating system developed by a coalition of companies from the food industry. The criteria for rating food products used 18 different attributes. The system had varying levels of acceptability based on 16 types of food which allowed for wide discretion in the selection of foods to include in the program. The program was discontinued in October 2009 after sharp criticism for including products such as \\"Froot Loops,\\" \\"Lucky Charms,\\" and \\"Frosted Flakes\\" as Smart Choices. On August 19, 2009, the FDA wrote a letter to SCP manager saying: \\"FDA and FSIS would be concerned if any FOP labeling systems used criteria that were not stringent enough to protect consumers against misleading claims, were inconsistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, or had the effect of encouraging consumers to choose highly processed foods and refined grains instead of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\\" SCP was suspended in 2009 after the FDA's announcement that they will be addressing both on front-of- package and on-shelf systems. SCP Chair Mike Hughes said: \\"It is more appropriate to postpone active operations and channel our information and learning to the agency to support their initiative.\\"  See also  * Nutrition * Digestion * Enzyme * Cardiovascular disease * Diabetes * Eating disorder * Malnutrition * Obesity * Childhood obesity * Starvation * 5 A Day * Canada's Food Guide * Food group * Fruits * Functional food * Grains * Junk food * Vegetables * Healthy diet * Dieting * Eating * Healthy eating pyramid * Nutrient profiling * Diets (list) * List of food additives * List of unrefined sweeteners * Carbohydrates * Mineral (nutrient) * Dietary supplements * Nutrient * Fat * Essential fatty acids * Micronutrients * Nootropics * Nutraceuticals * Phytochemical * Complete protein * Essential amino acids * Protein combining * Protein (nutrient) * Vitamins * Dietitian * Nutritionist * Health * Auxology * Exercise * General fitness training * Life extension * Orthomolecular medicine * Physical fitness References External links *2020 Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label in the United States, US Food and Drug Administration, 30 August 2019 Category:Nutrition ","title":"Nutritional rating systems"},{"id":"13115993","text":"Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx is a painting by the Flemish Northern Renaissance artist Joachim Patinier. Dating to c. 1515–1524, it is in the Museo del Prado of Madrid, Spain. Landscape with Charon Crossing Styx fits into common Northern Renaissance and early Mannerist trends of art. The 16th century witnessed a new era for painting in Germany and the Netherlands that combined influences from local traditions and foreign influences. Many artists, including Patinier, traveled to Italy to study and these travels to the south provided new ideas, particular concerning representations of the natural world. Patinier's religious subjects, therefore, incorporate precise observation and naturalism with fantastic landscapes inspired by the northern traditions of Bosch. Iconography It depicts the classical subject related by Virgil in his Aeneid (book 6, line 369) and Dante in the Inferno (book 3, line 78) at the centre of the picture within the Christian traditions of the Last Judgment and the Ars moriendi. The larger figure in the boat is Charon, who transports the souls of the dead to the gates of Hades. The passenger in the boat, too minute to distinguish his expressions, is a human soul deciding between Heaven, to his right (the viewer's left), or Hell, to his left. The river Styx divides the painting down the centre. It is one of the four rivers of the underworld that passes through the deepest part of hell. On the painting's left side is the fountain of Paradise, the spring from which the river Lethe flows through Heaven. On the right side of the composition is Patinier's vision of Hell, drawing largely on Boschian influences. He adapts a description of Hades, in which, according to the Greek writer Pausanias, one of the gates was located at the southern end of the Peloponnesus, in an inlet still visible on the Cape Matapan. In front of the gates is Cerberus, a three- headed dog, who guards the entrance of the gate and frightens all the potential souls who enter into Hades. The soul in the boat ultimately chooses his destiny by looking toward Hell and ignoring the angel on the river-bank in Paradise that beckons him to the more difficult path to Heaven. Composition and colour Patinier utilised a Weltlandschaft (\\"world landscape\\") composition with a three-colour scheme typical of his work, moving from brown in the foreground, to bluish-green, to pale blue in the background). This format, which Patiner is widely acknowledged as popularising, provides a bird's-eye view over an expansive landscape. Furthermore, the painting uses colour to visibly depict heaven and hell, good and evil. To the viewer's left is a heavenly place with bright blue skies, crystal blue rivers with a luminous fountain and angels accenting the grassy hills. On the far right of the painting is a dark sky engulfing Hell and the hanged figures on its gate. Fires blaze in the hills. The foreground of the painting consists of brown rocks in Heaven and brown burnt trees in Hell. In the middle-ground is the river and the grasslands in bright hues of blue and green. The background, which is cut off by the horizon line of the darker blue river, is a pale blue sky highlighted with white and gray clouds. This compositional form is applied here by the crowded left and right sides bracketed by hills, which pushes the viewer's eye into the open space in the middle and reinforces that the men in the boat are the main focus of the painting.

Buehner was born in Stuttgart, Germany. As a child, his family emigrated to Salt Lake City, Utah. Buehner was a graduate of the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Prior to his call as a general authority, Buehner served in the LDS Church as a bishop and stake president and was a member of the Church Welfare Committee. In 1952, he was called as second counselor to the church's Presiding Bishop Joseph L. Wirthlin. He served in this capacity until 1961, when Wirthlin was succeeded by John H. Vandenburg. Immediately following his release, Buehner was called as second assistant to Joseph T. Bentley in the general superintendency of the church's Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association. When Bentley was succeeded by G. Carlos Smith in 1962, Buehner again served as second assistant until 1967, when he was succeeded by George R. Hill. Buehner later served as a regional representative. He was also president of the Great Salt Lake Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He was awarded the Silver Beaver for his contribution to the Boy Scouts. In 1968, Buehner was nominated by the Utah Republican Party as a candidate for the state governorship. Buehner was defeated easily by Democratic incumbent Cal Rampton.Utah History to Go: Calvin L.

Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse, Gambit was a member of the X-Men and one of Magneto's closest friends. Like his Earth-616 counterpart, Gambit too fell in love with Rogue, which prompted him to leave the X-Men when Rogue chose Magneto, whom she could touch due to the two possessing magnetism- based powers (she had permanently absorbed the powers and memories of Polaris just as she had done to Ms. Marvel on Earth-616). Gambit, as a member of the Thieves Guild, maintained a certain connection with Candra, who was also one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse, until she was killed. Despite having left the X-Men, Gambit still fought for \\"the Dream\\" in his own way. He assembled a group of thieves which he named \\"X-Ternals\\", who stole from Apocalypse's regime and the mutant aristocracy to provide food and medicines to the humans still living in New York. He also had an affair with Lila Cheney, despite the fact that he had not gotten over Rogue.Gambit and the X-Ternals #1 When Magneto put into action his plan to save Charles Xavier, Gambit agreed to steal a shard of the M'Kraan Crystal with the aid of his X-Ternals. Gambit and the X-Ternals were chased by Mudir Rictor and later faced the Shi'ar. However, Gambit obtained the shard of the Crystal, giving up in exchange for it his undying love for Rogue. Gambit thought that he had now lost his ability to love. The group returned to Earth; however, Gambit lost both the Crystal shard and Magneto and Rogue's son, Charles, to the traitor Guido when he threatened to kill Lila.Gambit and the X-Ternals #2-4 Despite this, Gambit was accepted back into the X-Men when they launched a mission to get into Apocalypse's citadel to rescue Magneto and put his plan into action. Gambit killed the crazed Colossus when his desire to save his sister Illyana threatened the mission.X-Men: Omega Following the death of Apocalypse and the fall of his regime, Gambit once again became a member of the X-Men.X-Men: Age of Apocalypse \\"1 During the AoA's 10th anniversary, Gambit was part of the X-Men and helped Magneto eliminate the remaining forces still loyal to Apocalypse. This included helping the X-Men get rid of the Hellions. Magneto later became injured while telling the Morlocks that they were free, and when he was recuperating, Quicksilver detected mutant signatures of Apocalypse's former soldiers in Mexico. Magneto then left with Quicksilver, Gambit, and Sunfire.X-Men: Age of Apocalypse #3 The Guthrie siblings later attacked the X-Men's base, taking Rogue and Charles Lensherr captive. Magneto, Sunfire, Gambit, and Quicksilver returned to the base and defeated the Guthries. Magneto then revealed his secret regarding Sinister, leading the X-Men to Sinister's lab in New York. The X-Men then fought the Sinister Six, and during the fight, Gambit, Nightcrawler, and Dazzler were sucked into Cloak. Nightcrawler managed to save Dazzler, but not Gambit, resulting in Gambit's presumed death, though it was not confirmed. The X-Men later buried their dead and created a tombstone for Gambit whose full text is not seen, but ending in \\"... luck always be on his side.\\"X-Men: Age of Apocalypse #6 However it appears that luck was indeed at Gambit's side after all, as he was rescue in time from the Darkforce Dimension at some point and was greeted in the X-Men team later.Uncanny X-Force #12 When the X-Force team of Earth-616 came to the Age of Apocalypse to retrieve a Celestial life seed to prevent Warren to ascend as the new Apocalypse, Gambit was part of Fantomex team to retrieve the seed from the deceased Celestial and he give his life so the team could retrieve the object from the cosmic being.Uncanny X-Force #13 Bishop's future In the future timeline that is the home of the X-Man Bishop (Earth-1191), the X-Men were wiped out in 1996 by someone recorded only as 'The X-Traitor'. However, there was apparently one survivor of the attack, a man called \\"The Witness.\\" He had a Cajun accent and long hair. He and Bishop had an antagonistic relationship in that time. When Bishop came to the past, he recognized Gambit's face as that of the Witness.X-Men #4 Later, the Witness was revealed to have been living happily in New Orleans, unchanged from how Bishop will know him in 80 years' time. He met the young Remy Lebeau, and had a set of trophies from countless battles across time (fans noticed Captain America's shattered shield, the red power suit from The Greatest American Hero, and Hellboy's Right Hand of Doom). He claimed to be pantemporal, capable of seeing all things in all realities at all times. The fact that he was even capable of conversing with Bishop or anyone else in a linear fashion is apparently due to his sense of humor.X-Men II #200 Exiles 200px In Exiles, Gambit of Earth-371 was the team leader of Weapon X (the ruthless counterpart to the heroic Exiles), having replaced Sabretooth. With Weapon X they had to work with Iron Man, the fascist monarch of Earth, to kill all of the Inhumans. They succeeded and went to the next reality.Exiles #23Exiles #25 It appeared that he and Storm on his team had been in a relationship and that back in his alternative reality he and Storm (another one from his alternative reality) were married. Storm was now dead and replaced by Hyperion. In this mission, Weapon X was supposed to kill the ten remaining mutants in this reality, but this evil version of Hyperion wanted to be the ruler of this Earth. The heroes did not want to murder anyone, but a battle with Hyperion soon followed. Hyperion shot off Gambit's arm, forcing Gambit to retreat into the Morlock tunnels. Hyperion murdered most of the Weapon X team.Exiles #38Exiles #40 Exiles #43Exiles #45 Finally, the Exiles appeared and determined the true nature of the mission although they initially refused to go through with it. They were to kill six members of Weapon X and the Exiles. Hyperion and an evil version of Ms. Marvel (who had already taken care of most of the killing) forced them to fight. In the end, Hyperion was seemingly killed by Gambit after Blink had injured him sufficiently to make him vulnerable. Gambit was disintegrated in the blast. It was revealed later that Hyperion resurrected himself and took control of the Panoptichron. It was also revealed that every Weapon X and Exiles team member who died or was sent home were frozen into a crystal wall in that palace. When the Exiles found the place, there were many fallen heroes—-Gambit among them. Gambit's body is returned to his home dimension for burial in.Exiles #83 New Exiles In New Exiles #2-4, a very different version of Gambit was shown. Still called Remy, attracted to Rogue and sometimes speaking approximate Cajun, this version was the son of Namor and Sue Storm. He has four siblings and the power to breathe underwater as well as the force field projection capabilities of his mother. He saved Rogue when she was injured and drowning to her death. He was then flown by her to his family, which they saved together.New Exiles #2 He then went on to join the Exiles team.New Exiles #4 House of M Gambit makes a brief appearance in House of M as a thief being caught by Carol Danvers.House of M #2 Marvel Zombies A zombie Gambit is seen as one of the dozens of super-powered zombies attacking Doctor Doom's castle trying to reach the uninfected humans inside. This is after being seen on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s helicarrier between Colossus and Magneto. This takes place in Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness. In Marvel Zombies #3, Gambit is one of the many zombies trying to slay and eat the Silver Surfer. Next, Gambit's chest is blasted through, then his head, from the jaw up, is knocked off, from the cosmically powered zombies.Marvel Zombies #3 Mutant X In the Mutant X universe, Gambit was in a fatal accident when he was attempting to save his foster daughter.Mutant X #16 He was accompanied by Bloodstorm at the time, and begged her to turn him into a vampire so that he didn't have to die. She reluctantly accepted his request and became Gambit's sire. He was very unhappy with the creature he had become, blaming Bloodstorm for what she had done to him, and ran away.Mutant X #16 Since his eyes were naturally red, no one in the Thieves' Guild noticed any difference in Gambit, only making it easier for him to continue to feed. For a time, Gambit worked to prevent Bloodstorm from feeding on sentient beings, such as the thieving Marauders and otherwise innocent vampire- wannabes. Later, Gambit was forced to join Havok's team The Six, and while there, received a partial cure for his vampirism from the Brute. With the serum he devised, it granted both Gambit and Bloodstorm a reprieve from their blood lust and gave them the ability to walk in the sunlight. However, Gambit's appreciation did not run deep. When the team was in crisis fighting the combined might of the Goblyn Force, Count Dracula, and the Beyonder, Gambit stole the team's jet and flew away with his adopted daughter Raven, never to be seen again.Mutant X #31Mutant X #32 New Son (Sun) Appearing in the 1999 Gambit mini-series, Gambit is called New Son (Sun) (X-Cutioner II) in Earth-9923 reality. In his own reality, the New Sun's kinetic charging powers had flared out of control, burning the world and killing everyone. As a result, the New Sun hunted down and killed versions of himself in other realities to ensure that they would not repeat his mistakes. New Sun is not limited to inorganic matter and can convert matter into energy at a sub- molecular level so it vaporizes or explodes. He also has the ability to time travel, can propel himself by a wave-like aura and can transplant matter through time and space, as well as being able to biokinetically augment all his physical abilities to superhuman levels.Gambit vol.3 #7 In this reality, New Sun was never adopted by the Thieves Guild, so his real name is not \\"Remy LeBeau\\". New Sun was raised with his full power and intended to become the fulfillment of an ancient Guild prophecy to create Heaven on Earth. However, things went wrong when he charged up his power in a special ritual—a chain reaction was started that caused everyone on Earth beside himself to burn up. Failing to remake time, the New Sun traveled to other universes, hoping to prevent the same thing from happening there. However, he found many worlds in ruins, often because of that world's version of Gambit. Coming to the main Marvel Universe (616), he first attempted to create a new world where everyone would eventually be transported to, using the main reality's Gambit to help (without revealing to him who he truly was). When he learned that his plan wasn't possible, he tried to kill Gambit, transporting both of them to his destroyed home world before Gambit became a threat to the main universe's Earth world as well. During their final conflict, Gambit finally blasted the New Sun, burning out his recently increased powers, just as the New Sun died. Due to New Sun's immense power, it is speculated that New Sun was an omega- level mutant in his home dimension, and likely mutant alpha on Earth-9923; this, however, cannot be confirmed.Gambit vol.3 #23 Ultimate Marvel In this universe, Remy LeBeau is a Cajun thief, similar to the normal mainstream version. A flashback shows that Remy was beaten maliciously by his father.Ultimate X-Men #13Ultimate X-Men #14 He was subsequently brought up by a thief who taught him the arts of stealing. His connection to Sinister has been hinted, but yet to be made clear, though it is noticeable that in flashbacks his father has red eyes like Mr. Sinister. When he confronted Hammerhead, the latter mentioned Sinister while bantering with Gambit. Later as an adult, Remy lived on the streets of New York, performing card tricks with his \\"magic\\", and he continued to steal. It also shows he has trouble controlling his powers where in Ultimate X-Men #14, where he states to the mobsters he just defeated that he is a mutant but struggles with controlling his powers. He also does not have his bo staff at this time. At one point, Charles Xavier offered Gambit the chance to join the X-Men, but he refused. While trying to save a young girl's life, Gambit also faced Hammerhead and defeated him by making the mobster's adamantium skull explode.Ultimate X-Men #13 At some point Gambit met scouts in New Orleans who represented Andreas and Andrea Von Strucker, the Fenris Twins. The twins were presidents of Fenris International and secretly mutants. Their goal was to obtain mutant supremacy through economic empowerment. To accomplish this, they needed to find out the secrets of their business rivals. The twins made Gambit an offer that he could not refuse to participate in espionage activities. In addition to paying him, they cleaned up his accent, and helped him control his powers. Gambit ran into the X-Men again at the Coney Island Fair where he was sent by the Fenris Twins to recruit Rogue. To accomplish this Gambit had to get her alone and away from the X-Men team. He accomplished this by defeating the entire team by playing to their desire to avoid any bystander injuries.Ultimate X-Men #50 He collapsed a giant Ferris wheel (i.e., the Wonder Wheel) taking much of the team out of equation (knowing that they would go to rescue the people on the ride) and defeated Wolverine by threatening to explode Wolverine's skeleton, which would destroy a large part of the near area. He then proceeded to explode his bo staff in Wolverine's mouth, thus giving him enough time to take Rogue. The Fenris Twins felt Rogue would be an ideal employee since her powers (which include viewing others’ memories) would be useful for learning others' secrets. However, because of the unethical aspect of the job, Rogue refused. In response to seeing the fury of the twins, Gambit assisted Rogue in subduing the twins, and escaping. As Rogue and Gambit escape, an enraged Wolverine finally tracks them down, beating Gambit badly with only his fists, preventing Gambit from making contact with his skeleton. Rogue stops Wolverine from killing Gambit and called him the true animal in this situation. Afterward, Gambit asked Rogue to come with him, commenting on how she and he were both alike. Rogue agreed and left the X-Men with him.Ultimate X-Men #50Ultimate X-Men #53 In a battle with Juggernaut, Gambit appeared to suffer fatal injuries. As Rogue gave him a last kiss, she completely absorbed his powers and memory, killing him and getting control over her ability to siphon the memories and abilities of others.Ultimate X-Men Annual #1 As of Ultimate X-Men Annual #2, Gambit's powers have faded from Rogue. X-Men: The End In this version, he is married to Rogue, and they have two children, a son (Olivier) and a daughter (Rebecca \\"Becca\\").'X-Men: The End vol.3 #3 In the miniseries X-Men: The End: Heroes and Martyrs, Gambit was revealed to be the clone of Mister Sinister, created from Sinister's own pre-mutated DNA. Sinister wished to destroy his master, Apocalypse, and to do so he needed a body that had not been subject to Apocalypse's altering. He then engineered mutant powers for the clone, using the DNA of Cyclops. This technically makes him the third Summers brother; in that alternative reality. However, Apocalypse learned of Sinister's plan and had the child stolen and left it in the care of the Thieves Guild. It was originally believed that Gambit died in the series The End disguised as Sinister and trying to defeat the Shi'ar. However, in GeNEXT, a series about the children of the X-Men, Olivier talks about how he and his father (Gambit) have not really made contact since his mother (Rogue) died and that Gambit didn't have the heart to continue on as an X-Man. They only communicate through Rebecca.GeNext: United #5 Age of X In the Age of X timeline, Gambit feels, for reasons unknown, compelled to rescue Rogue, who was being hunted by Moonstar and her team.X-Men Legacy #246 They are seemingly killed by Magneto, but are later commissioned by him to break into a secret chamber.New Mutants #23 X-Men Noir In X-Men Noir, Remy LeBeau is depicted as the owner of the Creole Club, a nightclub and casino, also acting as an information source for his friend Thomas Calloway, a costumed detective and reporter for the Daily Bugle calling himself The Angel.X-Men: Noir #1 He is, however, shown as an unscrupulous person, as he is not above collecting on debts with force.X-Men: Noir #1-2 X-Men: Forever In X-Men: Forever he's referred to as Remy Picard.X-Men: Forever #7 Old Man Logan In the \\"Old Man Logan\\" storyline, Gambit is among the X-Men who perish at the hands of Wolverine when he is tricked by Mysterio into believing his friends are super- villains attacking the mansion.Old Man Logan Vol. 1 #5.

Description  It can measure 30 m in height and one metre in diameter. The trunk is straight and branched, and the bark is gray with longitudinal fissures. Leaves are opposite and subopposite, elliptical to aovate-elliptical, and they have entire margins; they are glossy green above and glaucous below. The apex is rounded or slightly emarginated and the base is lightly wedge-shaped. The leaves are about 3-7.5 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with pubescent petioles 2–5 mm long. The hermaphrodite flowers are arranged in inflorescences about 5–6 cm long. The pedicellate flowers are 4–6 mm and greenish-yellow in color.Patagonian Plants, 2009 The fruit is a green, globose drupe with a single seed, 1.5–2 cm in diameter, with a point at the apex. Ecology It grows at altitudes up to 1800 m above sea level, and it has an acceptable frost tolerance within this mostly tropical genus.

He is known as King Yalambar in History of Nepal, as Barbarika in Mahabharata and Āaju meaning First King in NepalBhasa. The temple of Akash Bhairav is supposed to have been a palace of the first king of Nepal, Kiranti King Yalambar around 3100–3500 years back. The surrounding of Akash Bhairav is known as Yen to symbolize Ne of Nepal. Ne means Midland in Kiranti language. The head of the Aakash Bhairav was dug up several hundred years ago in Kathmandu. It is taken out once a year on the occasion of Yenya Festival and blessed by the Kumari, the living goddess who lives in the nearby Kumarichok. This ceremony is held in the month of August/September. During the ceremony, large number of worshippers come to visit this temple. They offer Peda (sweets made from milk), flowers, money and several others things. We could have witnessed the late dynasty exchanging the swords with that of Akash Bhairav. Most recently by the previous king Gyanendra of Nepal and late King Birendra of Nepal before him. In reality, they had made the offering and shown deep respect towards the historic icon. History of the Deity The Akash Bhairab is said to be the Kirati king Yalambar himself. Legend has it that, Yalambar was the first king to establish this nation and even extended towards Tista in east and Trishuli in the west. He is believed to have gained the powers through tantric worshipping. During the famous battle of the Mahabharat, the first king of Kirat dynasty, Yalambar in disguise of Bhairab, went to the battlefield to help the losing party. When Lord Krishna heard of it, he tried to test the ability of Bhairab, turned out that if Bhairab was to be allowed to join the losing side, the war would continue till both parties were to be annihilated, for whichever side Bhairab will have overwhelming advantage that the arrow, Bhairab (Yalamber is kirat king, and kirats are known to be great hunters whose primary weapon is bow and arrow) possessed could even penetrate the body of Krishna who is considered divinity. So Krishna asked Bhairab if Bhairab could give something as gift, for Bhairav is/was the greatest of all warrior in the gathering of Mahabharata, as Bhairav agreed, Krishna asked or the head of Bhairab and he promptly chopped Yalambar's head, which reached Kathmandu through the sky, hence the name given to the sky god or the Akash Bhairab. Preparing Akash Bhairav for Indra Jatra Aakash bhairav during Indra Jatra Iconography Aakash Bhairav has often been depicted in Buddhist iconography by a large blue head with a fierce face, huge silver eyes and a crown of skulls and serpents. The deity head resides on a silver throne that is carried by lions, accompanied by Bhimsen (Bhima) and Bhadrakali on either side. The idol face is understood to represent the mask that King Yalamber wore on his way to the Kurukshetra. The Indrachok idol is somewhat milder in demeanor than many of the Buddhist idols. Lord Aakash Bhairav, the 'god of the sky', is also regarded by Nepalese as a progenitor of the Maharjan caste, especially the peasant groups. Pictured on Aakash Bhairav's head is an image that the Buddhists identify as Buddha, and the Hindus identify as Brahma, thus making the idol of Yalamber/Barbarika/Aakash Bhairav worshipped by all. Worship The traditional Akash Bhairav Puja is accompanied by Upasana and Anusthan. Sacred water, sandalwood, flowers, fruits, incense, and naibedya are some of the offerings for this ceremony. Legend has it that worship of the Bhairav is usually a mark of safety and strength. In the Nepali imagination, the Akash Bhairav symbolizes protection and goodwill for the nation and its people. Religion, nation, people, belief, faith and traditional thanksgiving are all interwoven in this manifestation of Bhairav worship. The Akash Bhairav is also believed to be the Jeevan-Tatwa. Culturalism is seen in Bhairav worship and the temple itself. It stands as a grand testament to a cultural personification of Upasamhar. For eight days during the Indra Jatra, celebrations in the temple consist of adorning the temple and the deity. This is followed by the Tantrik Puja, the Sagun Puja, and the Kal Puja. The worshipper and the deity are held together in a uniquely 'reciprocal' dynamic. In September 2007 Nepal's state-run airline confirmed that it had sacrificed two goats to appease Akash Bhairab, whose symbol is seen on the company's planes, following technical problems with one of its aircraft.Goats sacrificed to fix Nepal jet, BBC News, 5 September 2007.

The Acts (Latin: Acta, Greek: Πράξεις Práxeis) are important for many reasons, one of them being the concept of apostolic succession.Ehrman (2003), p. 167. They also provide insight into the valuation of \\"missionary activities among the exotic races,\\" since some of them feature missionary work done among, for instance, the Cynocephaly.Friedman (2000) p. 59.  Examples   The canonical Acts of the Apostles  Only one work in this genre is included in the New Testament canon, entitled the Acts of the Apostles, sometimes called the Book of Acts or simply Acts, and primarily concerns the activities of Saint Peter, John the Apostle, and Paul the Apostle, who converts to Christianity in chapter 9 and becomes the main character. It is presumably the second part of a two-part work, the Canonical Gospel of Luke being the first part, with both works being addressed to Theophilus, and sharing a similar style. Almost all scholars believe that they were written by the same person. The book narrates how the resurrected Jesus makes the apostles his witnesses, and instructs them to convert all peoples to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). Through the Holy Spirit, God then empowers the apostles in their missionary work, with the ability to perform miracles such as healing the sick, casting out demons and raising the dead, while spreading Jesus' gospel. Problems such as anti-Christian persecutions, and conflicts about whether converts should first become Jewish before they can become Christians, are overcome. The Book of Acts was probably written around the year 80 or 85 CE. It is not so much concerned with historical accuracy as it is with furthering a particular theology from a certain religious point of view.  Non-canonical acts  Other books with similar titles or narratives have not been included into the Bible, and are classified as by mainstream denominations as New Testament apocrypha. These acts narratives tend to be later, legendary accounts about the early apostles written in the 2nd and 3rd century CE. The books normally do not claim to be written by apostles, but are anonymous, and thus they are not considered pseudepigrapha and forgeries. Unlike the canonical Book of Acts, they tend to focus on the exploits of individual apostles. As a genre, the apocryphal acts tend to feature \\"travels, dangers, controversies, deliverances, thwarted sexual trysts, miraculous demonstrations of the power of God\\" within an episodic narrative. They bear a resemblance to the five surviving ancient Greek novels and the two surviving ancient Roman novels in Latin (The Golden Ass and the Satyricon). The overarching theme in these popular pagan romances is that heterosexual marital love is the basis for social peace and prosperity. The general plot is that a man and a woman from the upper classes fall in love, but become tragically separated before they can consummate their sexual love until the very end of the story, overcoming various hardships before being reunited. The Christian apocryphal acts turn these characteristics on their heads, however: the wealth and beauty of this world are to be despised, and any sexual activity is condemned as 'impure', in favour of love for God and preparation for the coming heavenly afterlife. Five of the non-canonical acts have survived almost completely, namely the Acts of John, Peter, Paul, Andrew, and Thomas. A large number of other narratives only exist in fragmentary form.  List of acts  The following list is not exhaustive. * Acts of Andrew, c. 180 CE in Greek,Roig Lanzillota, Fernando, (2004) The Apocryphal Acts of Andrew; A New Approach to the Character, Thought and Meaning of the Primitive Text p. 60–61. reconstructed from Greek, Latin, Coptic and Armenian fragments * Acts of Andrew and Bartholomew, 5th century in Greek * Acts of the Apostles, canonical, c. 80 to 85 CE in Greek * Acts of Barnabas, 5th century in Greek * Acts of John, late 2nd century in Greek * The Lost Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, probably a 19th-century forgery in English without a Greek original * Acts of Mar Mari, 600–650 CE in Syriac * Acts of the Martyrs, term for a group of writings describing the martyrdom of various apostles, including: ** Martyrdom of Polycarp, c. 4th century in Greek ** Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs, c. 200 CE, probably the earliest Christian text in Latin ** Passion of Saint Perpetua, Saint Felicitas, and their Companions, 3rd century in Latin and Greek ** Acta proconsularia Cypriani ** Acta Maximiliani ** Acta Alexandrinorum, late 2nd to early 3rd century collection * Acts of Paul, a collection of four texts known primarily from Greek and also other manuscripts from c. 160 CEJones, Timothy Paul (2007), Misquoting Truth, InterVarsity Press, p. 167. ** Acts of Paul and Thecla, some scholars regard the text a 1st-century creation that was later included in the Acts of Paul collectionCeresa-Gastaldo has shown that Jerome’s “care for the chronology is constant and fundamental”; from this he was able to deduce from the De viri illustribus and Chronicon that the “History of Paul” (incorporating the earlier Acts of Paul and Thecla) was originally published between AD 68-98: Studia Patristica 15 (1984) 55-68.

The battle resulted in communist victory was one of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post World War II era. Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to “maintain order” in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek’s own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek’s before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek’s objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek’s orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek’s ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. Communist strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders’ surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. Battle The 7th Column of the New Fourth Army launched its offensive against the Japanese and their puppet regime force that refused to surrender station at the town of Shaobo (邵伯) of Jiangdu (江都) County of Jiangsu province on December 19, 1945. By December 21, the battle was over with communist victory. The communists managed to have killed more than 110 Japanese troops, over 100 troops of Japanese puppet regime troops, capturing over 40 Japanese troops and over 550 troops of Japanese puppet regime force. In addition, the poorly equipped communists also captured one heavy machine gun, one infantry support gun and over 300 rifles. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek’s attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek’s secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists’ loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. The communists did not have the dilemmas faced by the nationalists and enjoyed popular support, and thus was able to easily overwhelm their nationalist adversary, and thus achieving victory without much difficulty. Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, the political gain was much greater than the military one for the communists as result of this battle.

He played all or part of four seasons in Major League Baseball between 1948 and 1953. Seventeen-year-old Mauro was signed as an amateur free agent by the Chicago Cubs before the 1944 season. The young outfielder was farmed out to the Lockport Cubs of the class D PONY League, where he appeared in 89 games and hit .294. Carmen spent his first five seasons in the minors, hitting over .300 twice: first in 1945, in a split season with the class B Hagerstown Owls and the Portsmouth Cubs, hitting .305 with 6 homers; secondly in 1947, when he hit .308 for the Des Moines Bruins of the class A Western League. Mauro got about as late a season call-up as a man could get when the parent Chicago Cubs brought him to Wrigley Field on October 1, 1948. He appeared in three games, picking up two base hits in five at-bats, his first big league hit being an inside-the-park homer off Murry Dickson of the St. Louis Cardinals. He spent two full seasons with the Cubs, hitting .227 in 1950 but only .172 in 1951. The Cubbies traded him to the Brooklyn Dodgers for Toby Atwell in December, who sent the 25-year-old Mauro to the International League for his career year, hitting .327 with eleven homers in 140 games for the Montreal Royals in 1952. Carmen's balloon more or less burst in 1953. He started out with the Dodgers, getting into only eight games before being taken off waivers by the Washington Senators in May, and then again off waivers by the Philadelphia Athletics in June. He managed to hit an aggregate .255 for the season, his last in the bigs, finishing his four-year big league career with a .231 average and two home runs in 456 plate appearances. He spent five more years in the minors, almost all in the Pacific Coast League with the Seattle Rainiers, ending a 14-year minor league career in 1958 with a .295 average and 84 home runs. When his playing days were over, he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in education at the University of Washington and served as the Huskies' head baseball coach from 1961 to 1963. From 1964 until his retirement in 1986 he taught, directed student services and coached baseball at Cuesta Junior College in San Luis Obispo, California. An accomplished pianist, organist and accordionist, he was honored with the establishment of a Carmen Mauro Music Scholarship at Cuesta in 1990. He died at 77 on December 19, 2003 in Carmichael, California.

Users can use this analytic storage engine to create a table that is “archive” only. Data cannot be deleted from this table, only added. The Archive engine uses a compression strategy based on the zlib library and it packs the rows using a bit header to represent nulls and removes all whitespace for character type fields. When completed, the row is inserted into the compression buffer and flushed to disk by an explicit flush table, a read, or the closing of the table. One of the current restrictions of Archive tables is that they do not support any indexes, thus necessitating a table scan for any SELECT tasks. Archive tables, however, are supported by the MySQL Query Cache, which can dramatically reduce response times for Archive table queries that are repetitively issued.https://web.archive.org/web/20100212100829/http://dev.mysql.com/tech- resources/articles/storage-engine.html The MySQL 5.0 Archive Storage Engine (archive date 20100212) MySQL is examining index support for Archive tables in upcoming releases. The engine is not ACID compliant. Unlike OLTP engines, it uses a \\"stream\\" format to disk with no block boundaries. The head of the Archive file generated is a byte array representing the data format and contents of that file. In MySQL 5.1, a copy of the MySQL FRM file is stored in the header of each Archive file. The FRM file, which represents the definition of a table, allows an Archive file to be restored to a MySQL server if the Archive file is copied to the server. Despite the use of zlib, archive files are not compatible with gzio, the basis of the gzip tools. It uses its own azio system that is a fork of gzio. Archive differs from the other MySQL analytical engine, MyISAM, by being a row level locking engine and by keeping a constant version snapshot throughout a single query (making it MVCC). This means that Archive does not lock for concurrent bulk inserts. For bulk inserts it performs an interlaced INSERT, so unlike MyISAM, order is not guaranteed. Users can use the archive_reader tool to take an online snapshot of a table and to change the characteristics of an archive file. To create an Archive table, specify the following engine string: create table t1 ( a int, b varchar(32)) ENGINE=ARCHIVE The MySQL Archive Storage Engine was authored and is maintained by Brian Aker.

Wiedorfer received basic training at Camp Lee, Virginia. He was then assigned to the Quartermaster Corps, and then passed the examination for cadet air training. He was training to be a pilot, but the Army switched him to infantry because of greater need. On the way to England he crossed the Atlantic Ocean on , and by December 25, 1944, was serving as a private in Company G, 318th Infantry Regiment, 80th Infantry Division. On that Christmas Day, near Chaumont, Belgium, Wiedorfer single-handedly charged across of open ground, destroyed two German machine gun emplacements and took six Germans prisoner. He was subsequently promoted to staff sergeant and on May 29, 1945, issued the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. While crossing the Saar River, he was severely wounded February 10, 1945, by a mortar shell that blew up near him; shrapnel broke his left leg, ripped into his stomach, and seriously injured two fingers on his right hand. The soldier next to him died from his wounds and Paul credited that soldier for saving his life. Recent research has discovered the soldier's name to be PFC Milton C Smithers of Huntingdon, New Jersey. Paul was evacuated to the 137th United States Army General Hospital in England where he was placed in traction. While in the hospital a sergeant reading Stars and Stripes asked him how he spelled his name, and then told him he had received the Medal of Honor. Later, on May 29, 1945, Brigadier General Egmont F. Koenig with a band entered the ward to present him with his medal. Wiedorfer reached the rank of master sergeant before retiring from the Army. In addition to the Medal of Honor he was also awarded a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. He returned to Baltimore on June 11, 1945, and was given a ticker tape parade with General George C. Marshall and Maryland governor Herbert O'Conor in attendance. After the war he spent another three years recovering in different Army hospitals and then returned to Baltimore Gas & Electric, and retired in 1981 after 40 years of service. He and Alice had four children. Wiedorfer died in Baltimore on May 25, 2011, at age 90. He was buried in Baltimore's Moreland Memorial Park Cemetery on June 7, 2011. Medal of Honor citation Wiedorfer's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > He alone made it possible for his company to advance until its objective was > seized. Company G had cleared a wooded area of snipers, and 1 platoon was > advancing across an open clearing toward another wood when it was met by > heavy machinegun fire from 2 German positions dug in at the edge of the > second wood.

Data extracted from the The genus was first described in 1937 by Pocock and named by Pockock in 1953 (Stein 1958).  Taxonomy  It was formerly placed in the monotypic family Astrephomenaceae. Astrephomenaceae is now considered obsolete, and Astrephomene is now classified within the Goniaceae.  Description  Astrephomene gubernaculifera is a colonial, flagellated volvocine green algae. It consists of 16, 32, 64 or 128 cells, 2 to 7 of which are small and oriented such that their flagella form a rudder (Stein 1958). Each cell is surrounded by a gelatinous matrix and contains an eyespot, two flagella and 1-3 contractile vacuoles at the anterior end. Astrephomene gubernaculifera can reproduce sexually or asexually. During asexual reproduction of Astrephomene, rotation of daughter protoplasts occurs in conjunction with the movement of basal bodies during successive cell divisions, ending with the anterior end of all cells of the daughter colony outside after the first nuclear and cytoplasmic division.Yamashita S, Arakaki Y, Kawai-Toyooka H, Noga A, Hirono M, Nozaki H.

This type of asexual reproduction is unique among the colonial volvocine green algae (Pocock 1953). By contrast, in Eudorina, protoplast rotation is lacking during successive divisions; a spheroidal colony is formed by means of inversion after successive divisions. Astrephomene gubernaculifera has two mating types that reproduce to form zygotes. Schematic diagrams of the two mechanisms of spheroidal colony formation in the volvocine algae. In Astrephomene, rotation of daughter protoplasts occurs in conjunction with the movement of basal bodies during successive cell divisions. In Eudorina, protoplast rotation is lacking during successive divisions; a spheroidal colony is formed by means of inversion after successive divisions. Evolution Colony inversion is believed to have arisen twice in the order Chlamydomonadales. Spheroidal colony formation differs between the two lineages: rotation of daughter protoplasts during successive cell divisions in Astrephomene, and inversion after cell divisions in Eudorina. Schematic representation of the phylogenetic relationships of the volvocine algae and the parallel evolution of the spheroidal colony. Volvocine algae range from the unicellular Chlamydomonas to the multicellular Volvox through various intermediate forms and are used as a model for research into the evolution of multicellularity. The spheroidal colony is thought to have evolved twice independently within this group: once in the Volvocaceae, from Pandorina to Volvox, and the other in the genus Astrephomene. The phylogeny is based on previous reports. All drawings and photographs represent side views of individuals with anterior ends orienting toward the top of this figure.  Habitats  Astrephomene gubernaculifera is often found in organically rich temporary pools, often in pasture ponds. It typically persists for 1–3 weeks after ponds are formed in beginning of the wet season (Pocock 1953). It has been collected from South Africa, Australia and the United States (Pocock 1953).

The book is about Earth, in a postapocalyptic time, being invaded by a parasitic alien race known as \\"Souls\\", and follows one Soul's predicament when the consciousness of her human host refuses to give up her body. The Host was released on May 6, 2008, with an initial print run of 750,000 copies. An international version of the novel was released on April 2, 2009, in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia and Hong Kong by the UK publishing division.Twilight Lexicon The Host in multiple forms It was translated into many languages. Plot A species of parasitic aliens called \\"Souls\\" have invaded Earth, deeming the humans too violent to deserve the planet. When a Soul is implanted into a host body, the consciousness of the original owner is erased, leaving their memories and knowledge. Wanderer, a Soul, is placed into the body of Melanie Stryder. However, Melanie's consciousness is still alive and begins to communicate with Wanderer mentally. Wanderer's assigned \\"Seeker\\" suggests that she could be placed into Melanie to retrieve the memories before disposing of the defective body, but Wanderer makes several attempts to deny her Seeker's wishes. As Wanderer starts to uncover some of Melanie's memories of her younger brother Jamie Stryder and her boyfriend Jared Howe, Melanie gets her to follow a series of landmarks throughout the Arizona desert to find her Uncle Jeb, hoping that Jared and Jamie are with him. By doing so, she would be denying the Seeker Melanie's memories and the humans they would lead her to. When Jeb comes across Melanie's dying body, he realizes what had happened to her but still leads her to his hideout: a network of caves housing more than thirty people. Most of the other humans wanted her to be killed with the exception of Jared and Jamie, and later on Ian O'Shea, who develops feelings for Wanderer. As days pass and she starts to become a part of the community, many of the community members start to trust her with jobs and eventually gave her a teaching role among the colony. She is also given the name Wanda in replacement of the name Wanderer. After tending to a cancer patient one night, Wanda is attacked by Ian's brother, Kyle. After managing to save both herself and Kyle from drowning, the two are taken into the infirmary. Shortly after recovering, Wanda stumbles across a slew of mutilated bodies that cause her to hide by herself in terror for three days. During her time in isolation, Wanda learns from Jeb that the humans are trying to cut Souls out of their hosts in attempt to restore the consciousness and life of the humans but so far each attempt has resulted in a dead body. When Jamie is suffering from a fever caused by infection from a leg injury, Wanda realizes that she must recover medicine from the Souls to cure Jamie before it is too late. With the assistance of Jared, the two manage to cure Jamie's ailments in time. Thanks to her efforts, Wanda is entrusted with attending raids for supplies and it is now believed by many that Melanie is still present inside Wanda's mind. Not long after the raiders return to the colony, they learn that the caves have been attacked and Wanda's Seeker has been captured. After coming to a conclusion about the Seeker's life, Wanda decides to tell Doc how to properly remove Souls from human bodies. The Seeker is sent back into space. Wanda devises another plan to remove herself from Melanie's body and let herself die in order to allow Melanie to return to Jared once more. Learning of Wanda's plan, Ian becomes furious and calls a tribunal to stop her plans. Despite his attempts, Wanda manages to get herself to Doc's beforehand. Before going through the procedure though, Wanda declares her love for Ian. To her surprise, Wanda wakes up in a new host whose consciousness has not returned. In her new body, Wanda gains wide acceptance from the humans and is free to be in a relationship with Ian while Melanie goes back with Jared. Over the course of time following the surgery, the colony begins to grow and many of its residents become more prosperous than ever before. The novel ends with their discovery of another group of humans like theirs who have a Soul named Burns in their group. Main characters Wanderer – Nicknamed Wanda, a parasitic alien Soul who is inserted into Melanie Stryder's body. She received her name because of the number of planets she has lived on, having never settled on one she truly liked. She is later nicknamed \\"Wanda\\" by Mel's Uncle Jeb. Initially only interested in enjoying her new life, Melanie's love for her brother and boyfriend spills over to Wanda and she finds herself abandoning her kind to seek them out in the desert. She slowly develops sympathy for humans, eventually acknowledging that they have a right to their own lives, and attempting to sacrifice herself so that Melanie can have her life back. Like all Souls, she is naturally altruistic, horrified by violence, and finds it difficult to believably lie (to humans). She hates upsetting people and so suffers endlessly trying to be as little of a burden as possible. Melanie Stryder – Melanie is a human rebel who was captured and implanted with a Soul after years of evading the Seekers. She is Wanderer's host body. Melanie's consciousness survives and resists Wanderer's control as best she can. She likes the feeling of being physically strong and berates Wanderer for neglecting to keep her that way. She has a temper and is often quick to use threats of violence, much to Wanda's displeasure. Melanie is passionately in love with Jared and shares a strong bond with her brother, Jamie, of whom she is fiercely protective. Despite initial anger at Wanderer for stealing her life, their shared love of Jamie and Jared turns them into unwilling allies. Their relationship grows to the point where Melanie tearfully begs Wanda not to give her body back, knowing the alien plans to kill herself once removed. Melanie is described as having hazel eyes, dark hair and tan skin and is half Latina on her mother's side. Ian O'Shea – Wanderer calls Ian \\"as kind as a Soul, but strong as only a human could be\\". Like most of the group, he has a strong dislike of the Souls in the beginning, but quickly abandons it once he begins to empathize with Wanderer. Other characters seem to view him as mostly level-headed. Ian befriends Wanderer and gradually falls in love with her because of her personality, insisting he cares very little about Mel's body. He is constantly annoyed at how selfless and self-sacrificing she is, worrying that she is willing to do things she does not want because she thinks it will make others happy. Once Wanda is put into a new host they begin a relationship. He does not help Melanie find a new body for Wanda, which surprises Melanie. Ian said that he did not care what she looked like; he loved Wanda for her personality. He is described as being tall and muscular, with black hair, sapphire blue eyes and fair skin. Jared Howe – Melanie's lover. Jared met Melanie while they were both stealing food from the same house, each believing the other to be a Soul; when he realized he had found another human he was so excited he kissed her. Loving, aggressive and somewhat excitable in Melanie's memories, by the time Wanderer meets him he has become bitter and hardened. He originally despises Wanda for taking Mel's life, but he cannot bring himself to let Doc experiment on her. He starts to change his views on the Soul when he sees her comforting a dying friend. His survival skills are an asset to the group, and he is often charged with leading the raids because of his rationality and levelheadedness. He has a somewhat parental relationship with Jamie, whom he continued to care for after Melanie's capture. He is described as being muscular and tall, with tan skin, sienna-colored eyes and naturally dark, but sun-bleached hair. Jamie Stryder – Jamie is Melanie's younger brother. Unlike most characters, he holds no animosity towards Wanderer for stealing his sister's body or life and quickly comes to view her as a substitute sibling. He is fascinated with Wanda's stories about the other planets and the species that live on them. Despite his apparent innocence and naivete, Jamie wants to be treated like an adult; he yearns to go on raids with the others, and is uncomfortable with the coddling he receives when he is injured. Uncle Jeb – Jebediah \\"Jeb\\" is Melanie's eccentric uncle. A paranoid survivalist before the invasion, Jeb had constructed an elaborate hide-out in caves beneath the Arizona desert. He maintains strict control over the hide-out by virtue of having the only firearm. He believes Wanderer can fit in with the humans and pushes for this to the point of creating great strain within the group. He is calm and deliberate in his decision-making, and despite being one of the most welcoming towards Wanderer, nonetheless does not hesitate to explain and justify the human perspective to her. The Seeker – The Soul who originally caught Melanie. Her calling is to search for and track down humans who have managed to avoid implantation, although she takes her job more seriously than most others. Mutual spite towards the Seeker is the basis of Melanie and Wanderer's early relationship. She is unusually irritable and edgy for her species, at one point even shooting a human in cold blood, despite most Souls not being able to even pick up a gun. She mocks Wanderer for not being able to completely drive out Melanie's consciousness. This is later revealed to be because of her insecurity at having failed to subdue her own host, Lacey, who speaks to her like Melanie does to Wanda. Lacey is just as abrasive as the Seeker. Kyle O'Shea – Kyle, Ian's brother, is impulsive, quick-tempered, and often considered a pain by the others. His hate for Souls is extreme, even among the group. He tries to kill Wanda, despite being warned not to hurt her, and ironically has to be saved by her from falling to his death after he is knocked out in the struggle. When he realises the Seeker's host was able to get her body back, he leaves to kidnap Sunny, the Soul now inhabiting Jodi's body, and takes her back to the cave to see if he can get Jodi back. He is shocked to discover that Sunny is not scared and feels an attachment to him, the way Wanderer did to Jared. When Jodi does not wake up after Sunny is removed, he allows Sunny to stay. Although still wishing Jodi could return, he becomes close to Sunny and they are described as being inseparable. Doc – A tall, slim human who was a surgeon and serves as the group's doctor. Wanda's initial impression of him is that he is a cold-hearted torturer, but he is later shown as being deeply affected by the suffering of his patients and is one of the first humans to accept Wanda. He is fascinated by how effective Soul medicine is and is desperate to find a way to remove Souls without killing either the parasite or the host. Doc is prone to alcoholic binges when he fails in these endeavors. His real name is Eustace, as he mentioned to Wanda before he removed her from her host. A man of his word, Doc is only stopped from letting Wanda die like he promised her because Jared threatens him with a hunting knife. Some of his characteristics were influenced by Meyer's younger brother, Seth. Major themes In an interview with Vogue, Meyer stated that body image was a major aspect of her novel. She noted that she is \\"very critical\\" of her body, but not others'. In The Host, she tried to convey \\"what a gift it is to just have a body, and really love it\\". This is something most humans would take for granted before being captured, and something of which Melanie is all-too aware once she loses control of her body. Other themes Meyer explored were the mother/child bond, the need to change our lives for the ones we love or because our community expects of us something other than what we want, and not fitting in. In other interviews, various themes were noted including the value of the Soul and faith in a world that has been destroyed, tolerance, forgiveness and understanding. Identity issues are also frequently mentioned, as Wanderer notes whether other characters differentiate between her personality and Melanie's identity as they interact with her. References to other works The scenario of alien parasites taking over and impersonating humans is familiar from the Heinlein science fiction novel The Puppet Masters, the film versions of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and the Robert Silverberg short story Passengers. \\"The Host\\" also bears several similarities to the book series \\"Animorphs\\" by K.A. Applegate. Like Meyer's other books, The Host includes a poem at the beginning of the novel. The poem, by May Swenson, is titled Question, and ties into the idea of the mind's reliance on the existence of the body, just as Melanie experiences when inhabited by Wanderer. Sequels Meyer has said that she is working on additional books in The Host series and that she intends to write a trilogy. She said in an interview that, if published, the first sequel would be entitled The Seeker and the second The Soul.'Twilight' Writer Stephenie Meyer Wants Matt Damon For 'Host' Movie, MTV Movie News In November 2009, she said, \\"I'd like to eventually have The Host be part of a trilogy.\\"Extra chapter FAQ In February 2011, Meyer said that she had outlines for the sequels and had done some writing on them. , there have been no further developments, other than fan speculation, regarding a follow up novel to The Host. Reception In a review of the book for The Guardian, Keith Brooke wrote, \\"When it's good, the novel works well, and will appeal to fans of the author's hugely bestselling Twilight series, but it is little more than a half-decent doorstep-sized chunk of light entertainment.\\"Keith Brooke, \\"The Host by Stephenie Meyer\\", The Guardian, August 1, 2009 The Host was a #1 New York Times best seller,Books - Best-Seller Lists - New York Times and remained on this list for 26 weeks.

It is mostly a marine organism, though there are a few freshwater species that tend to be more rare. It is a genus where certain species can accumulate relatively large amounts of β-carotenoids and glycerol in very harsh growth conditions consisting of high light intensities, high salt concentrations, and limited oxygen and nitrogen levels, yet is still very abundant in lakes and lagoons all around the world . It becomes very complicated to distinguish and interpret species of this genus on simply a morphological and physiological level due to the organism’s lack of cell wall that allows it to have malleability and change shape and its different pigments that allows it to change colours depending on the environmental conditions. Molecular phylogeny analysis has become a critical protocol in discovering the taxonomy of Dunaliella. The genus has been studied for over a hundred years, becoming a critical model organism for studying algal salt adaptation processes. It has remained relevant due to its numerous biotechnological applications, including β-carotenoid cosmetic and food products, medicine, and biofuel research.  History of knowledge  Dunaliella was originally called Haematococcus salinus by a French botanist named Michel Félix Dunal, who first sighted the organism in 1838 in saltern evaporation ponds in Montpellier, France. However, when the organism was officially described and labelled as a new and distinct genus in 1905 Bucharest, Romania by Emanoil C. Teodoresco, the name was changed to Dunaliella in honour of the original discoverer. To describe the genus, Teodoresco studied live samples from Romanian salt lakes and noted details like colours, movement, and general morphologies. The genus was also described by another biologist in 1905 named Clara Hamburger in Heidelberg, Germany, but unfortunately Teodoresco’s paper was published first while she was in the final stages of her own article’s production. Hamburger’s description was more thorough since she studied material imported from Cagliari Sardinia and was able to study live as well as dead material and could create sections to view inner cell contents and also described different life stages. Since then, various other studies on Dunaliella have been performed. Notable ones include Cavara’s article in 1906 expanding on the Cagliari, Sardinia saltern study by Hamburger, Peirce’s article in 1914 on Dunaliella in the Salton Sea, California, Labbé’s various ecological studies of the algae in salterns of Le Croisic, France, Becking et al.’s studies on Dunaliella organisms from all over the world, and in-depth taxonomic studies by Hamel and Lerche. In 1906, Teodoresco described two species named Dunaliella salina and Dunaliella viridis. The distinct classifications came from D. salina being notably bigger in size and being red in colour due to large amounts of carotenoid pigments. D. viridis was described as smaller as well as green in colour. These descriptions were extensively challenged by other biologists such as Hamburger and Blanchard, who insisted that they were not different species, but simply different life stages with the green cells being the juvenile form . Then, in 1921, Labbé performed a study in which he placed samples of Dunaliella from saltern brines into a lower salinity environment and observed that the organisms adapted to the new conditions of the fresh water and lost their brown-red pigment and became greener – meaning that the red colour must have originated through very euryhaline chlorophyll-filled cells changing to a red colour in extremely saline conditions after permanently damaging their chlorophyll pigments. It is now known that there are actually very few Dunaliella species that can accumulate β-carotenoids and those that do, do so only under high light intensity, high salinity, and limited nutrient growth conditions. Cells then can revert to a yellow to green colour when environmental conditions become less harsh . Through even more in-depth studies by Lerche et al., we now know that D. viridis is actually a heterogenous group and can be split into different species such as D. minuta, D. parva, D. media, and D. euchlora, though these groups are often grouped into one and called D. viridis. D. salina is now recognized as its own species and will soon become a very important one for biotechnological applications. Things do become more complicated, however, as various molecular studies have been performed on Dunaliella since 1999 to characterize its exact phylogeny. It has become apparent, though hardly confirmed, that there have been many misnamed cultures and synonymous species labelling in the genus that has yet to be worked out through molecular taxonomic research.  Habitat and ecology  Halophilic Dunaliella species such as D. salina are notable for living all around the world in hypersaline environments such as salterns, salt lakes, and crystallizer ponds. Some of these are at lower salt concentration (~0.05M,) and some are at, or very close to, the saturation levels of NaCl (~5.5M). Its ability to flourish in such a wide range of salt concentrations allows it outcompete most other organisms in its habitat, since their tolerances are often not as high. Though the genus and its species have been studied for over a hundred years, very is little is known about their exact ecological dynamic with specific environmental conditions and with other organisms. They are mostly marine, however there are few freshwater species of Dunaliella that have even less information on them in terms of ecology. It is known, however, that in hypersaline ecosystems, Dunaliella is a critical primary producer that organisms, such as filter feeders and a variety of planktonic organisms, sustain themselves. The organisms can depend almost completely or wholly on the carbon that the photosynthetic alga fixes. Notably, it is important food for the brine plankton Artemia, so much so that increases in Artemia populations often correlate with decreases in Dunaliella populations. In the Great Salt Lake, Dunaliella is a very relevant organism, particularly in the north arm where it is the main or possibly sole primary producer, and in the south arm where it is a significant component of the phototrophic community. In the 1970’s, Dunaliella dominated the north arm planktonic community, since the waters were too salty for other algae to thrive. The organisms were horizontally and rather randomly distributed on the surface, especially in places with minimal sunlight such as underneath rocks and logs. They were found in densities of 200-1000 cells/ml−1 and sometimes in peak densities of 3000-10000 cells/ml−1. At times they were even found to be more abundant at deeper depths, though little is known on whether this was due to intolerable light intensities at the surface. Even in the less saline south arm, Dunaliella was responsible for various short-lived blooms with up to 25000 cells/ml−1. Unfortunately, populations in both arms went into decline after periods of increased precipitations that decreased the Great Salt Lake’s salinity. Dunaliella started to become outcompeted by other phototrophs like the cyanobacterium Nodularia. It has been reported that in the winter months, when temperatures reach 0 °C, there is a large accumulation of round cyst-like cells that deposit themselves on the bottom of the Great Salt Lake. This encysting property of Dunaliella must have been critical for its survival in the Dead Sea, where salt concentrations have risen to intolerable amounts, such that the organism cannot be found in the water column today. In remote sensing, however, they found that when they diluted the upper waters, Dunaliella showed up; perhaps emerging from the shallow sediments where they had encysted. Back when the alga was found in the water column, however, population rate monitoring revealed that Dunaliella growth was inhibited by high concentrations of magnesium and calcium ions. Dunaliella blooms can therefore only occur in the Dead Sea when the waters become sufficiently diluted by winter rains and when the limiting nutrient phosphate is available. Dunaliella species, especially D. salina, is responsible and quite famous for turning lakes and lagoons into pink and red colours such as the Pink Lake in Australia. The hypersaline environments are dominated by β-carotenoid pigments and show up quite distinctly.  Morphology and cellular processes  Dunaliella is a biflagellate green algal and mostly marine protist that, in its vegetative motile form and depending on the species, exhibits ellipsoid, ovoid, and cylindrical shapes that sometimes taper at the posterior end. It can also exhibit more circular shapes in its vegetative non-motile cyst state. The cells are typically 7-12 μm in length, though there are few species larger or smaller than this. D. salina, for instance is larger in size, typically ranging from 16-24 μm. Sizes of the cells vary with environmental conditions such as light, salinity, and nutrient availability . Their two equal-length apical flagella are about 1.5X – 2X the length of the cell and beat rapidly, pulling the cell forward to cause abrupt turning motions and rotations along the longitudinal axis. The basal bodies of the flagella are interconnected by a distal fibre that is bilaterally cross-striated. The morphology of Dunaliella is very similar to that of Chlamydomonas, however it can be distinguished through its lack of cell wall and contractile vacuoles. Instead of a rigid cell wall, the plasmalemma of Dunaliella has a notable thick, mucilaginous coating. Olivera et al. noticed that the cell coating was affected by proteolytic enzymes and neuraminidase and concluded that its makeup must be mostly glycoproteid with some neuraminic acid residues. Instead of contractile vacuoles, marine species of Dunaliella replace the organelle’s usual spot in most other Chlorophyceae cells, with two to three dictyostomes that lie in a characteristic parabasal position with their forming faces toward the plasmalemma and ER. Dunaliella cells consist of a large, cup-shaped plastid that takes up the majority of the cell. Its large pyrenoid, which sits in the centre of the chloroplast, is another defining feature that is the same in all Dunaliella species. It is covered by a starch shell with numerous starch grains and pairs of thylakoids entering but not going completely through the pyrenoid exterior into its matrix. Starch grains are also scattered all throughout the chloroplast. Depending on how high the light intensities and salt concentrations are, the thylakoids can form stacks with up to ten units. Within the thylakoid membranes, β-carotenoids can accumulate, especially in high salinity and light intensity conditions, in oil globules. The pigments are made of neutral lipids and give the green alga its orange to red to brown colouration. The accumulation of β-carotenoids serves to protect the cells in high light intensity environments by absorbing and dissipating excess light better than chlorophyll can. In milder conditions, chlorophyll pigments make the cells look yellow to green. The chloroplast of Dunaliella also has an eyespot that sits at an anterior peripheral position and is made of one to two rows of lipids. The reason Dunaliella is able to be so halo- tolerant is due to its very effective osmoregulatory process. Firstly, the lack of cell wall allows the cell to easily expand and contract to maintain liveable internal salt concentrations. Secondly, when triggered by the changes in cell volumes and in levels of inorganic phosphate and pH following osmotic shock, plasma membrane sensors and various soluble metabolites activate glycerol synthesis. Either produced via photosynthesis or starch degradation, intracellular glycerol allows the cells to adapt to the high osmotic stress by counterbalancing the external and pressures and thus, preventing cell swelling. Freshwater species of Dunaliella are much more rare and thus, less studied. Their descriptions have hardly changed since their original publications and various ones are still being debated for whether they warrant the classification as Dunaliella due to certain species having differently placed pyrenoids, missing eye spots, unusual cell division, etc. The nucleus of Dunaliella lies more or less centrally in the anterior part of the cell and has a defined nucleolus. Lipid droplets and vacuoles lie around it, obscuring it and making it difficult to observe.  Life cycle  When conditions are unfavourable due to prolonged dryness or exposure to low salinity waters, Dunaliella cells undergo sexual reproduction. Two haploid vegetative motile cells will touch flagella and then fuse their equal-sized gametes with one another in a very similar way to Chlamydomonas by the formation of a cytoplasmic bridge. After this isogamous fertilization, the diploid zygote, which is red and/or green in colour, develops a thick and smooth wall and takes on a circular shape very similar to the cyst form of Dunaliella. In fact, after observing zygotes, there was discussion on whether the cysts seen after and algal bloom at the Dead Sea in 1992 were in fact, zygotes. The wall of the zygote will serve to protect the cell during a resting period in the harsh conditions until finally, the zygote will undergo meiosis and release up to 32 haploid daughter cells via a tear in the cellular envelope. Asexual resting cysts may be a possibility, though has not been studied enough to confirm. In its vegetative motile state, cells divide through mitosis as haploids through longitudinal fission. In the chloroplast, the pyrenoid actually starts dividing first during preprophase and then the entire chloroplast finally divides during cytokinesis.  Genetic approach  In the past, species descriptions and definitions have arisen through physiological characteristics like halotolerance and morphological characteristics like β-carotene content. However, this has led to numerous misidentifications, especially in marine species, since different conditions changing cell volumes, shapes, and colours make it very difficult to decide what organism is different to another. Since 1999, molecular analysis is used as the primary tool in Dunalliela identification due to its ability to analyze data independent of environmental factors 11. To characterize species, the 18S rNA gene, Internal Transcriber Spacer region (ITS), and ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase gene are being used. Re-naming has already been done for several species, though it is an on-going process to create a reliable and accurate taxonomic system.  Practical importance  Economically, Dunaliella, particularly D. salina and D. bardawil, serves great value due to its high accumulation of β-carotenoids. The pigment is exploited for a variety of uses such as cosmetics, natural food-colouring agents, nutritional supplements, and animal feed. It is also used for treating harmful wastewater plants through adsorbing, sequestering, and metabolizing heavy metal ions. Its biotechnological potential has long been exploited ever since it was found that certain species can have up 16% of their dry-weight being composed of β-carotenoids and that lakes and lagoons that turn pink or red, contain very high populations of D. salina that make up as much as 13.8% of the dry organic matter – such as in Pink Lake, Victoria, Australia. Dunaliella also serves as a very important model organism in understanding how algae adapts to and regulates itself in different salt concentrations. In fact, the idea for developing solutes to maintain osmotic balance in other organic matter originated from the osmoregulatory abilities of Dunaliella. D. salina and D. bardawil are also widely studied and currently used in biopharmaceuticals. An example includes nuclear transformations that led to the production HBsAg protein. This protein has significant epidemiologic importance to the hepatitis B virus as well as the potential of being carrier of epitopes for many other pathogens. Dunaliella is also used in the context of medicine for asthma, eczema, cataracts, and even cancer. On top of its involvement in the consumer, food, and health industries, Dunaliella is also becoming very useful in biofuel research. D. salina in particular can accumulate very high amounts of starches and lipids under stressful conditions; both of which are very critical in creating successful biofuels. Since other genera of green algae have complications in growth effectiveness under stressful conditions such as hypersaline environments, D. salina serves as very helpful organism for researching optimal stress levels for optimal biomass production conditions.

He has been a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea since July 2007, representing the electorate of Talasea Open. He has been Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology in the government of Peter O'Neill since July 2016, and was previously the Deputy Speaker of the National Parliament from 2007 to 2012. He has variously represented the Pangu Party (2007–2012), the Papua New Guinea Party (2012–2013), the United Resources Party (2013–2014) and the People's National Congress (2014–present). Early life and election to parliament Marus was born in East Sepik, but was raised in West New Britain Province.\\"West New Britain declares 3 new members\\". Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, July 25, 2007. He was educated at Galai Primary School and Hoskins High School before completing adult matriculation, and was a businessman before entering politics. He subsequently undertook an executive MBA at the University of Papua New Guinea, graduating in 2014. Marus first contested the Talasea seat at the 2002 election, but was defeated by independent John Vulupundi, finishing third overall.\\"Vulupindi beats NA's Lowa\\". Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, July 9, 2002. He contested the seat again for the Pangu Party at the 2007 election, defeating Vulupindi on the second attempt, and was selected as Deputy Speaker the following year. In June 2010, criminal William Kapris accused Marus, Tony Aimo and Patrick Pruaitch of corruption, alleging that they benefited from his crimes. Marus declared his innocence and welcomed an investigation. Deputy Speaker and Acting Speaker Marus was Acting Speaker through a difficult period in 2010 and 2011 involving a series of disputes around parliamentary process. In December 2010, the Supreme Court overturned the election of Paulias Matane as Governor-General and directed Marus to recall parliament within forty days. Marus launched an unsuccessful Supreme Court challenge to the decision, with the court ruling his application was \\"incompetent, unmeritorious and an abuse of process\\". The continued vacancy of the Governor-General at a time when the opposition was claiming the Prime Minister's position to be also vacant due to the absence of Michael Somare sparked what was referred to in some quarters as a \\"constitutional crisis\\". Marus subsequently recalled parliament for the Governor-General vote, but declared that he would not entertain any other business at a time of moves to oust the government. The opposition was unable to reach Marus at his office, home or elsewhere and accused him of intentionally disappearing to prevent them giving him notice of a motion of no-confidence in the government. On 14 January 2011, Michael Ogio was appointed Governor-General, thus ending one stand-off; however, issues around the survival of the government remained. In August 2011, Marus was one of the defectors from the government as Peter O'Neill ousted Somare as Prime Minister, with Speaker Nape presiding over parliament. In December 2011, with O'Neill and Somare still disputing who was validly Prime Minister, Nape became Acting Governor-General and Marus once again became Acting Speaker. In January 2012, he referred Somare to police over an incident where Somare and colleagues had entered parliament to physically present Marus with a court order reinstating Somare to office. In May 2012, he made international news when he reportedly \\"stunned MPs\\" by ruling that, following the Supreme Court decision, that Somare had been the validly elected Prime Minister, but could not reassume the role as he had been disqualified from parliament for missing three sittings, thereby rendering the Prime Minister position vacant. He initially sought to stop an immediate new vote, declaring that both Somare and O'Neill were \\"at the root of the political crisis\\", but relented in the face of a dissent motion in his position, leading to O'Neill being re-elected in a 56-0 vote. In the same month, he crossed to the Papua New Guinea Party ahead of the 2012 election. Second term Marus was re-elected at the 2012 election, defeating a challenge from former Police Commissioner Gari Baki. He was nominated for Speaker by his PNG Party but was defeated by Theo Zurenouc in a vote of 88 to 17. His party went into opposition, and he became Shadow Minister for Forestry, Climate Change and Environment and Conservation under Belden Namah. In May 2013, he crossed from the opposition to the government, joining the United Resources Party. In June 2014, he again changed parties, joining the People's National Congress. He was promoted to Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology in July 2016.

They were located in Union City, Tennessee, and played their home games at Turner Memorial Field. Originally known as the Union City Greyhounds, the team had affiliations with the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, and Cleveland Indians. They changed their name to the Union City Dodgers upon becoming a Brooklyn Dodgers affiliate in 1953. Over 19 seasons of competition, Union City played in 2,106 regular season games and compiled an all-time win–loss record of 1,002–1,104.

History First run (1935–1942) The Union City Greyhounds became members of the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League in 1935. Their home games were played at Turner Memorial Field in Union City, Tennessee. They lost their inaugural Opening Day game on May 22 to the Portageville Pirates, 3–2, on the road. The Greyhounds got their first win two games later on May 24, defeating the Pirates, 4–2. They ended their first season in second place with a 49–43 (.533) record but missed the playoffs having not won either half the league's split season. In 1936, the Greyhounds became an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. They succeeded in winning the second half and posting a full-season record of 73–45 (.619), tied with the Paducah Indians for first place. They then met the first-half champion Indians in the playoffs. After Union City won the first game, 6–2, on September 15, Paducah refused to continue the series, claiming the Greyhounds had two ineligible players on their roster. The championship was subsequently awarded to Union City, and Paducah's manager and seven players who refused to play were banned from professional baseball. Red Schoendienst of the 1942 Greyhounds was inducted in National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989.

Having lost some US$3,500 due to low attendance brought on by poor play, Union City announced it would drop out of the KITTY League after their game on June 19, 1942. The Bowling Green Barons were also forced to withdraw, and the remaining clubs voted to discontinue the circuit on June 19. The Greyhounds dedcided against playing their final game after receiving word from St. Louis that their players would not be compensated for the game. The club was last of six teams with a 9–35 (.205) record in the abandoned season. Over eight seasons of competition, the Greyhounds accumulated a regular season record of 415–495 (.456).

The 1949 club just missed the postseason with a 65–60 (.520) record, placing fifth. Union City severed its ties with Cleveland after the 1949 season and had no affiliation in 1950. They placed seventh at 43–72 (.374) in 1950 and sixth at 43–72 (.374) in 1951. The 1952 Greyhounds qualified for the playoffs with a fourth-place 63–56 (.529) record.

This is her first album produced by Carlos Jean and is also her first studio album since Soy Yo released in 2002. This album received gold status on Spain nine weeks after its release, after selling 40,000 copies .  Recording  From the 12 tracks, the singer herself co-wrote five, like the second single \\"Levantate\\" (Get Up), which is co-written by her husband Jesús Cabañas and \\"Tienes Que Vivir\\" (You Have To Live) dedicated to her daughter Paula. In this album, Marta Sanchez invited Alaska and the recorded the Carlos Jean's original \\"Si Me Cambias Los Recuerdos\\" (If You Change My Memories), an up- tempo track because the singer has stated that she and Alaska could not do a ballad. Thanks to technology she has a collaboration with Tino Casal on the reworked version of his song \\"Embrujada\\". This was picked as the 5th single of the album. The first single, \\"Superstar\\", features a sample from Depeche Mode's hit Just Can't Get Enough, because this was one of the favorite songs of the singer in her youth. About the title (\\"Miss Sanchez\\"), the singer says: \\"I've always been a miss even when I missbehave\\" . The track \\"Frida y sus Flores\\" (Frida and her flowers) pays tribute to Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. \\"Te Imagino\\" (I Imagine You) came last minute to the recording sessions and is a brand new song from Manuel Alejandro. \\"Desafinados\\" is a song from Victoria Gastelo, a new writer, and the singer named it \\"a classic\\". \\"Reina de la Radio\\" (Queen of the radio) is a track written by Marta Sanchez about the effect of music on people, and another self-penned song (\\"High Energy\\") is a story about the night life. \\"Contradicciones\\" (Contradictions) ia ballad written by Jorge Luis Piloto (who also wrote the #1 Latin hit \\"Quitame Ese Hombre\\" sung by Yolandita Monge and later by Pilar Montenegro). \\"La Noche Que Acabó\\" (The Night Over) is a piano and voice only recording.

The brewery was located at what is now the corner of California Avenue and Birch Street in Palo Alto, California. It produced steam beer and sold it in kegs to local saloons. The brewery was shut down by Prohibition.  History  The Mayfield Railroad Brewery was started in 1868 in Mayfield, California (later annexed by Palo Alto) by Michel Kleinclaus, a native of Alsace. The brewery was started on Lincoln near Third (now California Ave. and Park Blvd.) but was soon moved to the corner of Second and Lincoln (now California Ave.and Birch St.). At some point the brewery dropped \\"Railroad\\" from the name to become The Mayfield Brewery (probably after another brewery in the area operating as The Mayfield Brewery shut downadvertisements in the Mayfield Enterprise newspaper). In 1871, Christopher Ducker bought the brewery from Kleinclaus. Ducker, a local merchant who was also running a saloon with his brother Henry, would go on to become a prominent citizen of Mayfield and a member of Mayfield's first board of trustees when the town incorporated in 1903. For many of the years of Ducker's tenure as owner of the brewery, Mayfield came under pressure to become a dry town and close its saloons. Mayfield had missed out on becoming Stanford University's service town because the town refused to close its saloons when Leland Stanford asked them in 1886. Palo Alto was later formed and prospered as a dry university town while Mayfield maintained its image as a rowdy drinking town. In 1904, soon after the town had incorporated, the town's board of trustees voted to become dry. Chris Ducker, a member of the founding board, was the lone dissenting vote. But, by a thin margin and with much debate, the board later voted to grant The Mayfield Brewery a special wholesale license to continue operating. Ducker ran the brewery, sometimes with business partner Leonard Distel, until 1906 when he retired. Ernest Klevesahl bought the brewery from Ducker in 1906 and ran it with his son, Carl Klevesahl, until it closed in 1920 due to Prohibition.

Riebe played in the minor leagues in Beaumont, Texas, Alexandria, Louisiana, Muskegon, Michigan, Henderson, Texas, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Rieber later recalled: \\"Detroit really moved players around a lot.\\" In August 1942, the Tigers called Riebe up to the big leagues. He played his first major league game in Philadelphia on August 26, 1942, in the second game of a Sunday double-header. Riebe hit a two-run double down the left field line. He went 2-for-4 in his major league debut and 4-for-4 a week later in his first game at Briggs Stadium. In all, Riebe hit .314 in 11 games for the Tigers in 1942.

Kyoto Sentō Imperial Palace  Seika-tei tea house with pond of Sentō Imperial Palace The ) is a large garden in Kyoto, Japan, formerly the grounds of a palace for retired emperors. It is administered by the Imperial Household Agency and is opened to visitors.  History  Sento Imperial Palace was completed in 1630 for Emperor Go-Mizunoo's retirement, along with the corresponding Ōmiya Palace for the Empress Dowager Nyoin. Both palaces were repeatedly destroyed by fire and reconstructed until a blaze in 1854, after which the Sento palace was never rebuilt. (Ōmiya Palace was, however, reconstructed in 1867 and is still used by the emperor whenever he visits Kyoto). Today only two Sento structures, the Seika-tei and Yushin-tei teahouses, remain. The excellent gardens, laid out in 1630 by renowned artist Kobori Masakazu (Kobori Enshu), are now its main attractions.  Layout  The palace grounds are located within the southeast corner of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and entered via a stately wooden gate within its surrounding earthen wall. A carriage house with graceful triple gables sits just within, but still outside the garden's unadorned inner wall, whose gate leads directly to a fine view opening westward across the garden pond. The garden's primary feature is a large pond with islands and walkways, whose north and south segments were linked by a short canal in 1747. The north pond was extended and reworked from 1684-1688; the south pond is notable for its expansive \\"ocean shore\\" of rounded stones and cherry trees, an edging of mixed natural and hewn stones, and a separate, understated embankment of squared stones. The ponds contain a variety of highly picturesque islands and six bridges in a varied styles, including one with an impressive wisteria trellis (built 1895). Two teahouses complete the garden: Seika-tei, single-roofed and spare, at the southern end of the south pond; and Yushin-tei, thatched and rustic with a notable round window, at the western side of the north pond.

In 1964, Buchek played in only 35 games, largely as a backup to shortstop Dick Groat and second baseman Julián Javier, collecting six hits in 30 at bats. But it was a memorable season, as the Cardinals prevailed in a late-September four- team pennant scramble to win their first National League title in 18 years.

After graduating from the School of Visual Arts in 1995 specializing in cartooning, illustration, and silk-screening, he began as a freelance storyboard artist for various ad agencies, and a storyboard revisionist for MTV Animation. Later he was able to exercise more creative and personal styles while shifting into the world of music-related visual art and packaging. He has since developed a name and devoted following creating seminal record covers and screeprint posters for a wide variety of bands including legends such as Earth, Sunn O))), Sleep, Howlin' Rain, High on Fire, The Black Crowes, Kvelertak, and Windhand among many others. His influences include a wide variety of artists and styles ranging from comic art and fantasy art to graphic design and classic illustration. He was a contributing artist to the highly regarded and cutting-edge Arthur Magazine during the mid 2000s. Arik has also designed hand-made screen-printed posters for a pantheon of concerts and events including Sound on Sound Fest, Roadburn Festival, and Desert Daze Festival. Roper's work encompasses a diverse field of design and distinct style, ranging from graphic black and white illustration, to meticulous lettering and logo design, to rich abstract psychedelic color and landscapes that often seem to exist in their own universe. The imagery springs from the depths of a fertile imagination, invoking psychedelic visions, ancient dreams, and idyllic natural environments. With an interest in mythology, consciousness, psychology, religion and other timeless subjects, Roper mixes the light and the dark within his art to reveal imagery which is at once strangely unique, distantly familiar and always soaked with an earnestly fantastic aesthetic. His book, Mushroom Magick (Abrams, 2009), is a vividly surreal collection of exotic fungal species from around the world. His art has also appeared in books such as De Gotham City a Metropolis by French Paper Art Club, Juxtapoz New Contemporaries, and Revisionaries: A Decade of Art in Tokion.

Symptoms Diffuse tightness and tenderness over the entire belly of the tibialis anterior muscle that does not respond to elevation or pain medication can be early warning signs and suggestive of Anterior Compartment Syndrome. Other common symptoms include excessive swelling that causes the skin to become hot, stretched and glossy. Pain, paresthesias, and tenderness in both the ischemic muscles and the region supplied by the deep common fibular nerve are exhibited by patients suffering from this condition. Sensitivity to passive stretch and active contraction are common, and tend to increase the symptoms. Pathology A compartment space is anatomically determined by an unyielding fascial (and osseous) enclosure of the muscles. The anterior compartment syndrome of the lower leg (often referred to simply as anterior compartment syndrome), can affect any and all four muscles of that compartment: tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and peroneus tertius. This term is often mistakenly used to describe various related/proximal conditions, including Anterior Shin Splints. It is important to distinguish between the two, as shin splints rarely causes serious health problems, while Anterior Compartment Syndrome can lead to irreversible damage. The true compartment syndrome arises due to increased pressure within the unyielding anterior compartment of the leg. The pressure obstructs venous outflow, which causes further swelling and increased pressure. The resultant ischemia leads to necrosis (death of tissue) of the muscles and nerves. The process can begin with swelling of the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and/or the peroneus tertius muscles in response to strong eccentric contractions sufficient to produce postexercise soreness. Diagnosis If these symptoms are observed/experienced it is important to contact a physician specializing in sports medicine (MD/DO), a doctor of podiatric medicine (DPM), or other qualified health care professional immediately so as to get the appropriate advice/treatment before serious damage occurs. The 5 Ps of Anterior Compartment Syndrome: #Pain #Pallor #Paresthesia #Pulselessness #Paralysis (If not treated) Treatment The only option to treat acute compartment syndrome is surgery. The procedure, called a fasciotomy, involves a surgeon cutting open the skin and the fascia to relieve the pressure. Options to treat chronic compartment syndrome include physiotherapy, shoe inserts, and anti-inflammatory medications.

It is based on the rearrangement of the Michaelis–Menten equation shown below: :{ [S] \\\\over v } = { [S] \\\\over V_\\\\max } + { K_m \\\\over V_\\\\max } where Km is the Michaelis–Menten constant and Vmax is the maximum reaction velocity. J B S Haldane stated that this method was due to Barnet Woolf. It was also used by Charles Samuel Hanes, even though he neither mentions nor cites Woolf. Hanes pointed out that the use of linear regression to determine kinetic parameters from this type of linear transformation is flawed, because it generates the best fit between observed and calculated values of 1/v, rather than v. The equation can be derived from the Michaelis–Menten equation as follows: :v = {{V_{\\\\max} [S]} \\\\over {K_m + [S]}} invert and multiply by [S]: : {[S] \\\\over v} = {{[S](K_m+[S])}\\\\over{V_{\\\\max} [S]}} = {{K_m+[S]}\\\\over{V_\\\\max }} Rearrange: : {[S] \\\\over v} = {1 \\\\over V_\\\\max }[S] + {K_m \\\\over V_\\\\max } As is clear from the equation, perfect data will yield a straight line of slope 1/Vmax, a y-intercept of Km/Vmax and an x-intercept of −Km. Like other techniques that linearize the Michaelis–Menten equation, the Hanes–Woolf plot was used historically for rapid determination of the important kinetic parameters Km, Vmax and Vmax/Km, but it has been superseded by nonlinear regression methods that are significantly more accurate and no longer computationally inaccessible. It remains useful, however, as a means to present data graphically. One drawback of the Hanes–Woolf approach is that neither ordinate nor abscissa represent independent variables: both are dependent on substrate concentration. As a result, the typical measure of goodness of fit, the correlation coefficient R, is not applicable.

It has been described as harem in Arabic.  Private space  In traditional Persian residential architecture the andaruni is a part of the house in which the private quarters are established. This is specifically where the women of the house are free to move about without being seen by an outsider (na mahram). This is also the place where women can interact with their kin (maharim) without following the dress code or without wearing the hijab. In case the patriarch of the house had more than one wife, each wife is given her own section in the andaruni as is the case for her mother-in-law or sister-in-law if they live with the family. The only men allowed in this area are those directly related to the lord of the house (his sons) and the lord himself, which may include boys under the age of puberty, and guests allowed in under special circumstances. The court (usually in the talar) of the house would usually be situated in the andaruni.  Dichotomy  Andaruni's equivalent space for men is called biruni. These two sections, which are both built around a garden, are part of the so-called interior-exterior dichotomy of Persian houses, which denotes the spatial divide between andaruni and biruni segment. The former is the private space while the latter represents the public quarter as it is also the place where business and ceremonies are conducted. Messengers, who are usually young boys, are employed in the interaction between the two quarters.

The two largest presumed remnants of the parent asteroid are main-belt asteroids 298 Baptistina and 1696 Nurmela. The Baptistina family is part of the larger Flora clan. It was initially speculated that the Chicxulub impactor was part of the Baptistina family of asteroids, but this was disproven in 2011 using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The Baptistina family consists of darkly colored asteroids and meteoroids in similar orbits. Many mountain-sized fragments from the collision would have leaked into the inner solar system through orbital resonances with Mars and Jupiter, causing a prolonged series of asteroid impacts. Previously, this collision was believed to have occurred about 160 million years ago, and many impacts between 100 and 50 million years ago were attributed to it. However, in 2011, data from WISE revised the date of the proposed collision which broke up the parent asteroid to about 80 million years ago. Composition It was originally thought that the Baptistina family may consist of uncommon carbonaceous chondrite. In 2006, nine asteroids within the Baptistina family were given known classifications: three are S-type asteroids, two are X-type asteroids, another two are A/R-type asteroids, one is C-type and one is V-type. However, any conclusions taken from this were highly speculative, as very few members in the family were classified, and not even the albedo of the meteors was known at the time. Following the impact of the Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013, a paper published in the journal Icarus showed that shock produced during impact of a large asteroid can darken otherwise bright silicate material. Spectral analysis of the darkly-colored portions of the non-carbonaceous Chelyabinsk meteorite closely matched the color of members of the Baptistina family, showing that a low albedo does not necessarily indicate the composition of the family.  Suspected impacts  In 2007, it was proposed that chromium concentrations in 66-million-year-old sediment layers at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary) on Earth suggested that the impactor that gouged out Chicxulub Crater and caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event belonged to the Baptistina family. Concerns were raised regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints existed of the asteroid or family.Majaess D., Higgins D., Molnar L., Haegert M., Lane D., Turner D., Nielsen I. (2008). New Constraints on the Asteroid 298 Baptistina, the Alleged Family Member of the K/T Impactor , accepted for publication in the JRASC One year later, it was discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same chemical signature as the source of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary.Reddy V., et al. (2008). Composition of 298 Baptistina: Implications for K-T Impactor Link, Asteroids, Comets, Meteors conference. Because of the timeframe, it had also been suggested that the impactor that produced the lunar crater Tycho 108 million years ago was also a member of the group, as well as the Venusian craters Mead, Isabella, Meitner, and Klenova. In 2011, data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) revised the date of the proposed collision which broke up the Baptistina parent asteroid to about 80 million years ago. If correct, this data means it is very unlikely that the K–T impactor was part of this family of asteroids, as it typically takes many tens of millions of years for an asteroid to reach a resonance with Earth and then collide, much more than the 15 million between this breakup and the collision of the K–T impactor. \\"As a result of the WISE science team's investigation, the demise of the dinosaurs remains in the cold case files,\\" said Lindley Johnson, program executive for the Near Earth Object Observation Program.

It is a part of Vernon Township (the Vernon Township building was previously located in Prairie View for many years). Prairie View has not been annexed entirely by either Lincolnshire or Buffalo Grove, although tiny portions of it have been. In historic Prairie View there are many shops and some owners come and go but, Hoffmann Strings is the longest running business in all of historic Prairie View. Development In recent years, Prairie View has been divided into two sections as surrounding towns have annexed their neighboring settlements and tiny portions of Prairie View itself. The northern section, which contains the Prairie View Metra station, is near Stevenson High School and is bordered by Vernon Hills to the north, Lincolnshire to the east and Buffalo Grove to the south and west. This section receives its water, sewer, and fire emergency service from Lincolnshire; all other services are provided by Vernon Township and Lake County. A modern subdivision (consisting of about 50 homes) located in this section was built during the 1990s on what had previously been farmland and is called Krisview Acres. The original homes in the area (approximately 28), located exclusively on Easton Avenue and Main Street, were built between the late 19th century and early 1980s. The other section is a short distance south and is completely surrounded by Buffalo Grove. This subdivision is called Horatio Gardens and is close to the Buffalo Grove train station. The residents of this subdivision resisted being overtaken by Buffalo Grove Park District and currently still defend their rights to be an independent part of unincorporated Prairie View. Demographics Prairie View was originally made up almost entirely of white/caucasian people, however since the 1990s it has become more diverse and currently contains a very large Jewish population. A well known Chabad shul is located there.Northwest Suburban Chabad - Serving Chicago's Northwest Suburbs Schools Northern Prairie View is served by Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103. Schools that comprise this district are Daniel Wright Junior High School, Half Day Intermediate School, and Laura B. Sprague Elementary School (all in Lincolnshire). Most inhabitants of Prairie View who attend District 103 schools graduate to Stevenson High School. Residents of the southern portion of Prairie View are served by the Aptakisic-Tripp School district, made up of Tripp Elementary School, Pritchett Elementary School, Meridian Middle School, and Aptakisic Junior High School. Churches Local churches include the Westminster Reformed Presbyterian Church (founded in 1906 as the Grace Evangelical Church, later renamed Grace United Methodist Church after merging first with the United Brethren in Christ and then the American Methodist Church). Entertainment Prairie View has one roadhouse-style tavern, known as The Prairie House. For many years, an American Legion post stood on Easton Avenue, however it moved to a new building in the 1990s and the original building currently houses offices. Transportation Prairie View has a stop on Metra's North Central Service, which provides daily rail service between Antioch, Illinois and Chicago, Illinois (at Union Station).

History The band was formed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1965 by their leader, Robert Walter \\"Bo\\" Donaldson. They were first discovered while touring with The Osmonds in the early 1970s and signed with Family Productions, releasing their first single in 1972, \\"Special Someone,\\" but their big break came after moving to ABC Records and working with the record producer Steve Barri in 1973. Although their first single with ABC, \\"Deeper and Deeper,\\" failed to make a big impression on the charts, beginning in 1974, the band began a string of hit songs. Their first two (and largest two) hits were cover versions of British hit songs whose original versions had not been hits in the U.S.: \\"Billy Don't Be a Hero\\" (a cover of a #1 UK Paper Lace song that reached #1 for 2 weeks on the Hot 100 with the Heywoods' version) and \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\" (written by Clive Scott & Des Dyer of Jigsaw, which originally became a hit for Candlewick Green and reached #15 on the Hot 100 with the Heywoods' version). This was followed by their last top-40 hit, \\"The Heartbreak Kid\\" (#39 Hot 100), and their ominously titled last Hot 100 hit, \\"Our Last Song Together\\" (#95 on the Hot 100, another UK hit, originally recorded by its songwriter Neil Sedaka). \\"Billy Don't Be a Hero\\" sold over three and a half million copies, receiving a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in June 1974. Despite the song's popularity, many people disliked it, and it was voted #8 on Rolling Stone magazine's readers' poll of \\"10 Worst Songs of the 1970s.\\" In 1975, they began a migration across three other record labels as the hits dried up by the end of the decade. By 1978, they were known as \\"The Bo Donaldson Band\\" and eventually split after trying country music with no success in the 1980s. They reformed again in 1996 as a nostalgia act and still make appearances, most notably in the Barry Williams hosted nostalgia show, Original Idols Live. In 1996, Varese Vintage Records released Best of Bo Donaldson And the Heywoods, a 15-song compilation of material originally released on Family Productions (1972) and ABC Records (1973–1975). The CD contains all their charted singles and, in fact, includes 9 of the 11 songs featured on the 1974 LP Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods (#97 on the Hot 200). The CD booklet includes liner notes written by Gordon Pogoda and the CD features such highlights as \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\", \\"The House on Telegraph Hill\\", and \\"The Heartbreak Kid\\". In 1975, the band was working on a second album of material for ABC including \\"Our Last Song Together\\", released as a single (and which made the pop charts), and \\"Take Me Make Me Yours\\", which to this day remains unreleased. Ultimately the group left the label and joined Capitol Records, where they recorded songs by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, the writing/producing team behind the UK act The Sweet, and released the album \\"Farther On\\" in 1975.

The ranch was named the Flying-M by its previous owner, Stanfield Murphy. Barron Hilton said he did not change the name because his wife, who died in 2004, was named Marilyn. The ranch contains an airfield with a runway that is . A hangar on the airfield contains about a dozen historic aircraft, which are still airworthy. Because the surrounding desert offers good thermal soaring conditions, the airfield on the ranch was often used for gliders. On September 3, 2007, aviator and adventurer Steve Fossett took off alone from the Flying-M Ranch in a Bellanca Super Decathlon, a single-engine two-seater airplane and never returned. An extensive search was launched but nothing was found for almost one year. On September 29, 2008, a hiker found Fossett's identification cards in the Ansel Adams Wilderness near Mammoth Mountain, at a height of 10,100 feet (3,100 m). The identification cards led to the discovery of airplane wreckage and human remains; the remains were subsequently identified by DNA analysis as belonging to Fossett. In 2016, the ranch was sold to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The purchase price was $19.4 million. The purpose of the sale was to acquire water rights to supply water to Walker Lake.

The composition of Hemacite was touted as susceptible to a high polish, impervious to heat, moisture, atmospheric changes, it acted very similarity to the material Pykrete. Hemacite was cheap to produce due to blood and sawdust both being cheap materials in order to make the product. Fall Although Hemacite is a cheap material Bakelite was cheaper to produce, the popularity of plastics like Bakelite almost entirely replaced the production of Hemacite by the mid to late-1900s.

Artur Rubinstein remarked that the Polonaise in A major is the symbol of Polish glory, whilst the Polonaise in C minor is the symbol of Polish tragedy.Huneker, James. Chopin: The Man and His Music, Dover Publications, Inc., 1966.  Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1  The beginning opens with an A major chord and continues in a typical polonaise rhythm. The key then changes into D major in the middle of the polonaise for a trio section, after which the opening is repeated with no changes except disregarding the repeat signs. The piece is almost entirely played forte or louder, which makes for a bombastic performance. During the September 1939 German invasion of Poland at the outset of World War II, Polskie Radio broadcast this piece daily as nationalistic protest, and to rally the Polish people. The beginning of this piece is used as the interval signal for Polskie Radio. This piece is played in the famous scene in the Polish film Ashes and Diamonds at the end of an all-night party celebrating the end of the war. In Season 3, episode 2 of Rectify, the closing credits roll to the A major Polonaise after Teddy is shown stalking Tawny, his estranged wife.  Polonaise in C minor, Op. 40, No. 2  Polonaise in C minor, Op. 40, No. 2 performed by Luis Sarro The second polonaise's main theme, a contrast to the majestic and joyful one in the first, features an even rhythm of quaver chords in the right hand starting with C minor, and a mournful melody played in octaves by the left, with occasional lines played by the right hand. It is interspersed with a more serene theme, before switching to the trio section in A♭ major, which incorporates typical polonaise rhythms. The main theme is then repeated but largely abridged, with an added dramatic melody in the right hand.

James was an outfielder over all or parts of six Major League Baseball seasons (1960–65) with the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds, appearing in 510 games. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, he grew up in suburban Rock Hill and graduated from Webster Groves High School. James was also a letterman as a football halfback for the University of Missouri Tigers in 1956 and 1957 before starting his professional baseball career. He later earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. James threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and . He signed with his hometown Cardinals and began his baseball career in the high minors in 1958, where he collected 104 runs batted in in the Double-A Texas League and made the Triple-A International League's All-Star team in successive seasons. The Cardinals recalled him in August 1960, and he spent the rest of his baseball career in the majors. James platooned in right field with left-handed hitter Joe Cunningham in , then was the Redbirds' most- used right-fielder in , starting 95 games and hitting a career-best .276. In , he shared the left field job with Baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial in Musial's last season in the game. He began as the Cardinals' regular left fielder, but after he had started 40 games, St. Louis acquired future Hall of Famer Lou Brock from the Chicago Cubs on June 15, and Brock took command of the position, hitting .348 and leading the Cardinals into the 1964 World Series. James spent the rest of the season as an occasional right fielder and frequent pinch hitter, and his batting average fell to .223.Retrosheet: 1961–1964 fielding logs for Charlie James In the World Series against the New York Yankees, James was hitless in three at bats as a pinch hitter, but the Cardinals prevailed in seven games and James earned a championship ring. James was traded to the Reds that offseason but his playing load was reduced even further in . He appeared in only 26 games and collected only eight hits in 39 at bats. Although he went to spring training with the Reds, he did not make the early-season 28-man roster, and retired rather than report to Triple-A. In his 510 MLB games, James batted .255 with 358 hits, 56 doubles, nine triples, 29 home runs, and 172 runs batted in. With his degree in electrical engineering, he built a successful business career as the president of a Missouri-based manufacturing company, retiring in 1998.

Although their functional role is unclear, J-receptors respond to events such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary emboli, pneumonia, congestive heart failure and barotrauma, which cause a decrease in oxygenation and thus lead to an increase in respiration. They may be also stimulated by hyperinflation of the lung as well as intravenous or intracardiac administration of chemicals such as capsaicin. The stimulation of the J-receptors causes a reflex increase in breathing rate, and is also thought to be involved in the sensation of dyspnea, the subjective sensation of difficulty breathing.A.A. Majid, A.N.Kingsworth, Fundamentals of Surgical Practice. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 2006. .J.C. Bennett, F.Plum ed. Cecil Textbook of Medicine, 20th ed., W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia PA, 1996. The reflex response that is produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia, and hypotension (pulmonary chemoreflex). The physiologic role of this reflex is uncertain, but it probably occurs in pathologic states such as pulmonary congestion or embolization. These receptors were discovered by Dr. A.S. Paintal. Because these receptors have been found in the walls of bronchi, the larynx, and the nose, they appear to be part of a widespread population of nociceptors found in most tissue. For this reason, they are now usually referred to as pulmonary C-fiber receptors.

Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous, while the Saxon Army maintained a lesser degree of autonomy. The armies of the other German states were integrated into the Prussian Army with limited autonomy. The division was formed on November 27, 1815, as an Infantry Division of the Würzburg General Command (Infanterie-Division des Generalkommandos Würzburg).Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück, 1993), Bd. 1, p. 664; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deutschen Heeres (1905), p. 1248. It was called the 4th Army Division between 1822 and 1848, again between 1851 and 1859, and again from 1869 to 1872.Wegner, p. 664; Bredow, p. 1248. It was called the 4th Infantry Division from 1848 to 1851 (as well as during wartime) and was named the Würzburg General Command from 1859 to 1869.Wegner, p. 661; Bredow, p. 1242. From April 1, 1872, until mobilization for World War I, it was the 4th Division. In Bavarian sources, it was not generally referred to as a \\"Royal Bavarian\\" division, as this was considered self-evident, but outside Bavaria, this designation was used for it, and other Bavarian units, to distinguish them from similarly numbered Prussian units. The division was headquartered in Würzburg. The division was part of the II Royal Bavarian Army Corps. Combat chronicle The division fought against Prussia and its allies in the Austro- Prussian War of 1866, seeing action at Roßdorf and Roßbrunn. In the Franco- Prussian War of 1870-71, the division fought alongside the Prussians. It saw action in battles of Weissenburg, Wörth and Sedan, and in the Siege of Paris.Bredow, p. 1248. During World War I, the division served on the Western Front. It fought in the Battle of the Frontiers against French forces in the early stages, and then participated in the Race to the Sea, fighting along the Somme and in Flanders, including the First Battle of Ypres. It remained in the trenchlines in Flanders and the Artois, and fought in the Second Battle of Artois and the Battle of Loos in 1915. In 1916, the division fought in the Battle of the Somme. In 1917, the division fought in Flanders, including in the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendaele. For most of 1918, the division remained in Flanders, fighting at Armentières, Kemmel, Hébuterne, and Monchy-Bapaume. Late in the year, the division went to the Champagne region, where it faced the Allied Meuse-Argonne Offensive. After more fighting along the Aisne and the Aire, the division was withdrawn from the line, and spent the last week of the war on border defense in southern Bavaria and Tyrol. Allied intelligence rated the division as first class and of the highest quality.4\\\\.

Train-Abteilung Order of battle on mobilization On mobilization in August 1914 at the beginning of World War I, most divisional cavalry, including brigade headquarters, was withdrawn to form cavalry divisions or split up among divisions as reconnaissance units. Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from their higher headquarters. The 4th Bavarian Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Max Montgelas, was renamed the 4th Bavarian Infantry Division. Its regular 8th Bavarian Infantry Brigade was sent to the Main Reserve at Fortress Metz and replaced by a reserve formation, the 5th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Brigade with two reserve infantry regiments. The division's initial wartime organization (major units) was as follows:Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935) *7. bayerische Infanterie- Brigade **Kgl. Bayerisches 5.

During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\"). The 4th Bavarian Infantry Division was triangularized in March 1915, sending the 8th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment to the newly formed 10th Bavarian Infantry Division. An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, and the engineer contingent was increased. Divisional signals commanders were established to better control communications, a major problem in coordinating infantry and artillery operations during World War I.

It is usually a small round metal case and contains two or more of the following: a mirror, pressed or loose face powder with a gauze sifter and a powder puff. History Compacts date from the early 1900s, a time when make-up had not gained widespread social acceptance and the first powder cases were often concealed within accessories such as walking sticks, jewellery or hatpins. From 1896, American handbag manufacturer Whiting & Davis created lidded compartments in its bags where powder rouge and combs could be stowed. In 1908, Sears' catalogue advertised a silver-plated case with mirror and powder puff (price 19 cents) and described it as small enough to fit in a handbag. In the US, manufacturers such as Evans and Elgin American produced metal compacts with either finger chains or longer tango chains. Designed to be displayed rather than fitted in a handbag, they required more ornate designs and many from this era are examples of sleek Art Deco styling. As make-up became more mainstream and women were increasingly active outside the home, compacts became more popular. British manufacturer Stratton began importing part-finished powder boxes from the US for assembly at its Birmingham plant in 1923 and by the 1930s it was creating them from scratch and producing half the compacts used by the UK cosmetics industry. The company developed self-opening inner lids in 1948, designed to protect the powder and prevent damage to fingernails, and by the 1960s it was exporting to agents worldwide. Designs and variations Compacts were heavily influenced by prevailing fashions – for instance, the 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb spawned Egypt-inspired obelisks, sphinxes and pyramids, while the growing popularity of the car meant compacts were incorporated into visors, steering wheels and gears. Jewellers such as Van Cleef & Arpels, Tiffany and Cartier began producing minaudières, metal evening bags/vanity cases carried on a metal or silk cord that contained a compact plus space for a few other small items, many were inlaid with jewels or personalised. By the 1930s, compacts were regularly updated to match the season's fashion trends and gimmicks such as watches and even miniature windscreen wipers were included in designs. Later, compacts became popular souvenir items, both the Chicago and New York world's fairs of the 1930s included souvenir powder cases, and during holidays. Demise Although compacts continued to be in widespread production up to the 1960s, their popularity diminished as the cosmetics industry created plastic containers that were designed to be discarded once the powder ran out. These began to be heavily advertised from the 1950s. Writing in Americana, Deirdre Clemente suggested that changing make-up trends, notably for natural rather than pale and powdered complexions from the late 1950s on, contributed to the declining popularity of the compact.

It is located in the present-day city of Hirakata, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. It flourished as a port along the Yodo River and traces of the post town can still be seen today. History Hirakata was formed in 1596, under the order of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Though initially developed for other purposes, it became a post town when Tokugawa Ieyasu extended the Tōkaidō with the creation of the Ōsaka Kaidō in 1601.History of Hirakata-shuku . Hirakata-shuku Machikyo. Accessed December 3, 2007. In 1758, it was said that the Tōkaidō extended from Shinagawa-juku to Moriguchi-juku, and Hirakata-juku was again described as part of the Tōkaidō in 1789. Because Hirakata is located at the approximate midpoint between Osaka and Kyoto, it was a major travel intersection. However, it not only flourished as a land-based center of traffic, but also as a port for the shipping that took place on the Yodo River. Those who traveled through Hirakata-juku for sankin kōtai were generally those who were direct descendants of Ieyasu, including the fudai. In 1841, when Tokugawa Nariyuki participated in sankin kōtai, he brought with him 1,639 warriors, 2,337 servants and 103 horses. It was such a large traveling party that clan representatives traveled months ahead to help prepare for the party. During the Meiji period, train lines were developed, which had a negative effect on the post town's economy. The JR Kyoto Line (originally developed in 1876) and the Keihan Electric Railway (developed in 1910) both provided a faster and cheaper means of transport, when compared to boats on the Yodo River. Description of the Post Town Hirakata-juku was located in the modern-day city's Okashin-machi, Oka, Mitsuya and Doro-machi's Yongamura. It was approximately from Kyoto and from Osaka. The roads through the post town stretched approximately and were wide. It was a long and thin post town that was bordered to the north by the Yodo River, the south by Hirakatagaoka, and the west by Mount Mannenji. In Mitsuya, which was the center of the post town, there was one honjin and two sub-honjin, in addition to numerous other buildings for other travelers, whether they were coming by land or river.

World War II  Following shakedown exercises along the U.S. Gulf Coast, Maquoketa took on aviation gas, diesel oil and lube oil at Houston, Texas, and departed for the Pacific Ocean, 28 March 1945. She arrived in the Marshall Islands 23 May and immediately began discharging her cargo into the waiting ships. For the next three months the tanker plied regularly between Majuro, Kwajalein, and Tarawa. At Majuro when hostilities ceased, Maquoketa made one more voyage to Kwajalein and then sailed to Ulithi, arriving 29 August. From the Carolines she steamed on to Okinawa, remaining there for 1½ months before continuing to Japan. She moored at Nagasaki 23 October and commenced supplying ships assigned to the occupied areas. During the remainder of her western Pacific deployment she called at most of the ports in the Japanese home islands and in the American zone of Korea in addition to making regularly scheduled visits to Jinsen, Korea, Sasebo, Yokohama, and Nagoya.

Little is known of him, though by tradition he began life as a swineherd, and was promoted to bishop at an advanced age after a chance encounter with Alfred the Great. Life and tradition Denewulf was consecrated as Bishop of Winchester between 878 and 879. He died in 908.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 223 Chroniclers beginning with John of Worcester in the 12th century recorded a tradition that Denewulf was originally an illiterate swineherd who had a chance encounter with King Alfred the Great. According to these versions, Alfred was taking refuge from the Danes in the forest where Denewulf was feeding his pigs. He was so impressed with the elderly swineherd's character that he sponsored his education and had elevated him to bishop.John of Worcester Chronicle, vol. II, pp. 312-315 Denuwulf's name subsequently became attached to an older story regarding Alfred's encounter with a swineherd. According to this story, first recorded in the tenth-century Life of Neot, Alfred stayed with a swineherd and his wife for several days while fleeing the Danes. One day, the wife berated him for not turning her cakes on the stove when they began to burn; the humbled king subsequently helped her with the baking. This swineherd was identified as Denewulf in John Hardyng's verse chronicle, first published in 1543; in this version Alfred made Denewulf bishop following his wife's death. The story of Alfred and the cakes was often repeated as an example of the suffering the king endured for his realm; modern retellings usually play up the humorous aspect.

Spiritual reading is devoted to the reading of lives of saints, writings of Doctors and the Fathers of the Church, theological works written by holy people, and doctrinal writings of Church authorities. It is different from lectio divina which focuses on the bible. The biblical basis is St. Paul's advice \\"Attend to reading\\" (1 Tim 4:13) which meant that Timothy his disciple should \\"apply to the reading of holy books, not in a passing way and for a short time, but regularly and for a considerable time,\\" said St. Alphonsus Liguori, Doctor of the Catholic Church on Moral theology. St. Bernard of Clairvaux said that \\"spiritual reading and prayer are the arms by which hell is conquered and paradise won.\\" Basis and advantages The biblical basis of this practice is St. Paul's advice to his disciple Timothy whom he appointed bishop. St. Paul told him to \\"Attend to reading.\\" The word \\"attend\\" an allusion to the many other concerns that a bishop has to attend to. By this, according to St. Alphonsus Liguori, Doctor of the Church on Moral theology, the Apostle Paul \\"wished him to apply to the reading of holy books, not in a passing way and for a short time, but regularly and for a considerable time.\\" The Fathers of the Church recommended this practice: St. Jerome says that when we pray we speak to God; but when we read, God speaks to us. St. Ambrose of Milan says the same: \\"We address him when we pray; we hear him when we read.\\" Spiritual reading is an instruction in prayer and virtue, according to St. Bernard of Clairvaux, and thus he said that \\"spiritual reading and prayer are the arms by which hell is conquered and paradise won.\\" St. Josemaría Escrivá explained that spiritual reading \\"builds up a store of fuel. — It looks like a lifeless heap, but I often find that my memory, of its own accord, will draw from it material which fills my prayer with life and inflames my thanksgiving after Communion.\\" (The Way 117) Spiritual reading provides access to spiritual advice from masters of spirituality, says St. Alphonsus Liguori. Thus, St. Pius X further thoroughly explained: :Everyone knows the great influence that is exerted by the voice of a friend who gives candid advice, assists by his counsel, corrects, encourages and leads one away from error. Blessed is the man who has found a true friend; he that has found him has found a treasure. We should, then, count pious books among our true friends. They solemnly remind us of our duties and of the prescriptions of legitimate discipline; they arouse the heavenly voices that were stifled in our souls; they rid our resolutions of listlessness; they disturb our deceitful complacency; they show the true nature of less worthy affections to which we have sought to close our eyes; they bring to light the many dangers which beset the path of the imprudent. They render all these services with such kindly discretion that they prove themselves to be not only our friends, but the very best of friends. They are always at hand, constantly beside us to assist us in the needs of our souls; their voice is never harsh, their advice is never self- seeking, their words are never timid or deceitful. \\"When I read holy books,\\" says St. Gregory the Theologian about the books of St. Basil the Great, \\"then the spirit and body are illumined and I become the temple of God and the harp of the Holy Spirit, played by divine powers through them I am corrected and through them I receive a kind of divine change and I am made into a different person.\\" Reading of holy books is also a way to fight temptations: \\"Endeavor to have always in your hand a pious book,\\" advised St. Jerome to his disciple Salvina, \\"that with this shield you may defend yourself against bad thoughts.\\" All the founders of religious institutes have strongly recommended this holy exercise to their religious, said St. Alphonsus. Examples of sanctifying effect Throughout the history of Christian spirituality, spiritual reading has been seen to be of great benefit to many souls, and according to St. Pius X, \\"There are many striking examples of the salutary effects of the reading of pious books.\\" St. Ignatius of Loyola decided to be a man of God after reading the life of Jesus and some saints Some examples are: *St. Augustine of Hippo, considered one of the greatest Fathers of the Church, converted to the Catholic Church upon hearing a boy tell him\\" \\"Take, read; take, read.\\" He recounted that \\"I took (the epistles of Paul the Apostle), I opened, I read in silence; it was as though the darkness of all my doubting was driven away by the light of peace which had entered my soul.\\" *St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of what is considered as the largest religious order in Catholicism, decided to live a saintly life, after reading a volume of the lives of the saints which he accidentally took up while he was in a hospital bed. *St. Edith Stein, Patron of Europe, converted to Catholicism after reading the autobiography of St. Teresa of Ávila on a holiday in Göttingen in 1921, at the age of 29. One evening Edith picked up an autobiography of St. Teresa of Ávila and read this book all night. \\"When I had finished the book, I said to myself: This is the truth.\\" She went out the next day to buy a missal and a copy of the Catholic catechism. *Thomas Merton, a known spiritual writer, read a book by Étienne Gilson, on \\"The Elements of Christian Philosophy,\\" and decided to study Catholicism. He later converted and became a Trappist monk. Practice St. Alphonsus recommends some principles and attitudes for spiritual reading. *Ask God for help beforehand, because through reading it is God who speaks to us. Thus he recommended the prayer of Samuel: Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening. Speak, O my Lord, for I wish to obey you in all that you will make known to me to be your will. *The exclusive purpose of the reading is to advance in divine love, and not to acquire learning and indulge in curiosity. To do spiritual reading with false intentions is \\"a study unprofitable to the soul,\\" and \\"lost time.\\" *Read slowly and with attention. \\"'Nourish your soul,' says St. Augustine, 'with divine lectures.'\\" To be nourished, he said, one must chew and well and ponder well, and apply the teachings to oneself. \\"And when what you have read has made a lively impression on you, St. Ephrem counsels you to read it a second time...Besides, when you receive any special light in reading, or any instruction that penetrates the heart, it will be very useful to stop, and to raise the mind to God by making a good resolution, or a good act, or a fervent prayer. St. Bernard says, that it is useful then to interrupt the reading, and to offer a prayer, and to continue to pray as long as the lively impression lasts.\\" *Select some sentiment of devotion, at the end of reading. \\"Carry it with you as you would carry a flower from a garden of pleasure.\\" External links *Haerent Animo by Pius X *St. Alphonsus Liguori on Spiritual reading *Read any books lately?

Frithestan is first recorded in 904 as a deacon who witnessed two charters in which King Edward the Elder granted land to the Old Minster, Winchester.Yorke \\"Frithestan\\" According to William of Malmesbury, he was one of seven bishops who were consecrated on the same day in 909 by Plegmund, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Farmer Oxford Dictionary of Saints Shortly after he was appointed, the diocese of Winchester was divided, and the area which is now Wiltshire and Berkshire was transferred to the new bishopric of Ramsbury. When King Edward died in July 924, Ælfweard, his eldest son by his second wife Ælfflæd, was elected king by the nobles of Wessex at Winchester, while Æthelstan, Edward's son by his first wife Ecgwynn, was elected in Mercia. Ælfweard died within four weeks of his father, but resistance to Æthelstan centred on Winchester appears to have continued, and Frithestan was not present when Æthelstan was crowned king on 4 September 925.Foot Æthelstan pp. 39-40, 75 Frithestan first witnessed a charter of Æthelstan's in April 928, and thereafter he witnessed regularly until his resignation in 931, but he always attested in a lower position than his seniority would normally have entitled him to.Foot Æthelstan pp. 82-83, 98 In 1827, St Cuthbert's tomb at Durham was opened, and among the objects found was a stole and maniple which appear from inscriptions on them to have been given by Queen Ælfflæd to Bishop Frithestan, presumably before Edward put her aside to marry his third wife in about 919. Æthelstan probably took them from Winchester to donate to Cuthbert's tomb, another indication of his bad relations with Frithestan.Foot Æthelstan pp. 122-23 Frithestan was remembered at Winchester for establishing good relations between the Old and New Minsters. One of the regulations he laid down was that when a priest of either minster died, members of both would take part in the funeral observances. Frithestan resigned between 23 March and 29 May 931,Powicke Handbook of British Chronology p. 257 and died in 932 or 933. He was buried in the Old Minster, but by William of Malmesbury's day in the twelfth century the location of his tomb had already been lost. There was some attempt to develop a cult of him as a saint at Winchester, and he was listed in some later martyrologies, but his cult never became popular. His feast day is 10 September.

Early life James Liston was born in Dunedin on 9 June 1881, one of a family of five children of James Liston, a hotel-keeper, and his wife, Mary (née Sullivan). His parents were both born in Ireland. He was educated at Christian Brothers' School, Dunedin. At the age of 12 in 1893 he began his training for the priesthood at St Patrick's Seminary, Manly, Sydney. He later attended Holy Cross College, Clonliffe, Dublin (1897–1900), and then went on to the Irish College in Rome from which he graduated in 1903 with a doctorate of divinity. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Verdon in St Joseph's Cathedral, Dunedin on 31 January 1904. Bishop Verdon placed a strong emphasis on Roman models and on devotion to the Holy See. Liston was deeply influenced by Verdon, who encouraged his vocation, sponsored his studies and was Liston's bishop for the first 14 years of his priesthood. He regarded Verdon as his ultimate role model and throughout his career kept a photograph of Verdon on his desk \\"for guidance through reflection on his way, and for seeking his heavenly intercession\\".Nicholas Evan Reid, The bishop's paper: a history of the Catholic press of the Diocese of Auckland, Catholic Publications Centre, Orewa, 2000, pp. 35, 183. He was Rector of the college from 1910. On 12 December 1920, Liston was consecrated as coadjutor Bishop of Auckland under Bishop Cleary, the sixth Roman Catholic Bishop of Auckland, in St Joseph's Cathedral.

Bishop of Auckland In December 1929 Liston became Auckland's seventh Roman Catholic bishop and remained so for the next 41 years. Liston's decisive support of Bishop Lyons of Christchurch enabled the establishment of Holy Name Seminary as a minor seminary in that city in 1947. Rugby league involvement He was the president of the Marist Rugby League Club in 1933. Honours In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In 1953, he was given the honorary title of \\"archbishop\\". Two years later, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) from the University of Auckland. Liston was appointed Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur as a foreigner, by a French decree of 15 September 1938, in recognition of his service as Bishop of Auckland. Last years and death In 1970, aged 88, he retired. He died, aged 95, at the Mater Hospital on 8 July 1976. Notes Sources * E.R.

Ryan's material was largely derived from personal interviews with nearly 100 former gymnasts and figure skaters as well as trainers, sports psychologists, physiologists, and other experts, focusing on the physical and emotional hardships young women endured for the sake of Olympic glory. Advocacy Ryan began writing the book after performing research for a series of articles initially published in the San Francisco Chronicle, where she was working as a sportswriter. The book criticized contemporary training practices. In a 2018 interview, Ryan stated the thesis of the book was that abuse had become part of the normal culture of these sports. Ryan argues that the image of these athletes' beauty, glamour, class, and sophistication conceals a troubled reality of physical problems (weakened bones, stunted growth, debilitating and fatal injuries), psychological issues (eating disorders, depression, and low self-esteem), and life sacrifices (dropping out of school, losing the chance to \\"be a child\\", and becoming isolated from their peers and families). While decrying these practices, Ryan advocates for systemic change in figure skating and gymnastics, calling for raised minimum-age requirements, mandatory licenses for coaches, careful scrutiny by national governing bodies, and a requirement for athletes to remain in regular schools at least until they are 16. Ryan presented a relatively one-sided, bleak view of the sports, ignoring successes like Mary Lou Retton. Bela Karolyi was singled out for particular criticism in the book for his influence on USA Gymnastics (USAG), which resulted in what she called \\"a system of abuse\\". Ryan's general points have been supported by medical experts, as noted in a 1996 report published in the New England Journal of Medicine describing the emotional and physical harm suffered by elite female gymnasts. When Ryan was working on an update to the book in 2000, she interviewed Nancy Thies Marshall, a former gymnast who was then directing USAG's wellness program. The wellness program had been formed in response to the criticism USAG had received after the initial publication of the book in 1995. Marshall had written a 100-page manual with 30 recommendations and a referral network, but the wellness program had its budget slashed in half by the time Ryan contacted Marshall, and Marshall resigned shortly thereafter in 2001. The manual was praised by former US national sports team physician and convicted serial child molester Larry Nassar in the introduction. Reception The review published by the San Francisco Chronicle, where Ryan was a sportswriter, called the book a \\"scathing and profoundly important study.\\" Ann Sjoerdsma, reviewing for the Tampa Bay Times, added the book was \\"a damning indictment of girls' gymnastics and figure skating\\" and wondered \\"if the traumas and trials that the champions undergo can ever be worth their sacrifice. Conspicuously absent here are happy voices. I would have liked to have heard from the 'success stories'\\" such as Shannon Miller, Retton, Kristi Yamaguchi, or Nancy Kerrigan.  Film adaptation  A made for television movie based on the book and starring Swoosie Kurtz and Courtney Peldon aired in 1997 on Lifetime Television. It portrays a fictionalized account of a teenage girl whose family relocates to Los Angeles to pursue Olympic gold with a difficult coach and rigorous schedule, drawing on many of the stories Ryan recounts in the book. It depicts young female gymnasts dealing with prescription painkiller abuse, skipping meals, enduring intimidation, and generally pushing their bodies to the breaking point in order to achieve perfection.

The company was founded by Manuel Gutierrez Novelo and Isidoro Pessah in Mexico in 2001 and moved to the United States in 2004. The company has asserted that there were problems with some 3D deployment technologies, including lack of compatibility with 2D existing pipelines, side effects due to visual artifacts, and detriment on the quality, color, or resolution of the stereoscopic images. The company designed a stereoscopic system that it claims can reduce some of these side effects by providing full HD left and right images to each eye rather than using interpolation or pixel sub-sampled images. This included a deployment methodcodec called TDVCodec AKA 2D+Delta unveiled in 2007, designed to work with current hardware, such as Blu-ray discs, DVDs, set top boxes, and satellite receivers. The 2D+Delta method is similar to that used in the MPEG-2 Multiview profile and the more recent MVC (Multiview Video Coding) standard. Other TDVision products include the first consumer electronics stereoscopic 3D full HD video camera called TDVCam in 2006 and a head-mounted display for 3D stereoscopic full HD 720p video viewing Head Mounted Display device called TDVisor in 2007.  Products   TDVisor  TDVisor is a head-mounted display for stereoscopic 3D video viewing. In 2007, it was supported in a Northrop Grumman system called RainStorm., and many other training, remote controlled operations, surveillance, unmanned vehicles, educational and immersive video gaming applications.  TDVCodec  TDVision developed and patented world wide the 2D+Delta method of Stereoscopic Video Coding for an encoding and decoding method in 2003, also called the TDVCodec. Key features of the encoding format include up to Full HD (1920x1080) per-eye stereoscopic resolution, and 2D backwards compatibility with existing televisions and Cable television, Satellite Television, Blu-ray, ATSC decoders and PC based systems. The first demonstration of a full HD 3D Blu-ray Disc running on 2D+Delta and compatible with 2D legacy players in the world was made by TDVision in April 2008 during the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Trade Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, as recorded on the press release Stereoscopic 3D Content at Home, Brought to You By TDVision's TDVCodec and then mentioned on the article 3D Blu-ray Closer to Reality in May 2008. The company was then listed as key IP holder on the MVC standard on the ISO JTC Patent Database and the initiative evolved to what is now known as the selected spec of the Blu-ray Disc Association as mentioned in the article Final 3-D Blu-ray Specification Announced where all the characteristics of the 2D+Delta method were confirmed: \\"The Blu-ray 3D specification calls for encoding 3-D video using the Multiview Video Coding (MVC) codec, an extension to the ITU-T H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) codec currently supported by all Blu-ray Disc players. MPEG4-MVC compresses both left and right eye views with a typical 50% overhead compared to equivalent 2-D content, and can provide full 1080p resolution backward compatibility with current 2-D Blu-ray Disc players.\\"  Comparison of the 2D+Delta method to other deployment related technologies  Other deployment formats like pixel sub-sample (side-by-side or over-under or checkerboard, quincunx) require interpolation, filters and antialiasing to reconstruct the views.

Built by 1800, it was the home of inventor Jethro Wood (1774-1834), whose 1819 invention of an iron moldboard plow revolutionized American agriculture. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. and It is a private residence, and is not normally open to the public. Description and history The Jethro Wood House is located on the south side of Poplar Ridge Road, west of the village center of Poplar Ridge in Ledyard, New York. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It has a five-bay front facade, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the main entrance. The entrance is sheltered by a gable-roof portico supported by metal fixtures, and is framed by sidelight and transom windows. The house was purchased about 1800 by Jethro Wood, who grew up in Washington County, New York and engaged in farming when he moved here. In 1814 he was granted the first patent for a cast-iron plow with replaceable parts, improving on extant single-piece plows. This first effort was not a commercial success, but in 1819 he was awarded a second patent which was. His improvements made it possible for farmers to more rapidly prepare land for planting, enabling them to work more land. Jethro Wood was also the area's first postmaster. His wife, Sylvia Howland, was the aunt of Emily Howland, an active abolitionist, philanthropist, and educator. He spent his earnings fighting patent infringements. When he died in 1834, his children tried in vain to carry on his efforts at obtaining a renewed patent. The house underwent a major restoration in the late 20th century. Jack and Mary Lou Charles, the previous owners, purchased the home in 1979 and lived there until 2019. They spent many years painstakingly restoring it. They re-glazed every 24-paned window with vintage glass gathered from local old structures, re- plastered the interior walls, and re-siding the exterior in clapboard (removing old aluminum siding). Current owners Thomas Hoppel and his partner extensively renovated in 2020 both inside and out and have added a porch to resemble a previous addition in the back of the house.

She was a founder and committee member of the Fellowship of Australian Writers. Life Deamer was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, daughter of George Edwin Deamer, a physician from Lincolnshire, and his New Zealand-born wife, Mable Reader. She was taught at home by her mother, who had been a governess. She married Albert Goldie, a theatrical agent, in Perth, Australia, on 27 August 1908. She bore six children, but separated from Goldie in 1922.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, ed. Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 274. Career Deamer in leopard-skin costume (1924) In the 1920–30s Dulcie Deamer was a poet, playwright and author in Sydney, where she was Australia's first female boxing reporter. Deamer was known as the \\"Queen of Bohemia\\" due to her involvement with Norman Lindsay's literary and artistic circle, the Bohemian world of Kings Cross, Sydney, and vaudeville.Adelaide (1988) p. 48 During the inter-war years, many balls were held in Sydney, including those known as the \\"Artists' Balls\\" which had been held as far back as the 1880s. Dulcie Deamer attended every Artists' Ball for 30 years. The leopard-skin costume with dog-tooth necklace that she wore to the 1923 Artists' Ball in Sydney \\"has come to symbolise the joie de vivre of the decade, despite Deamer's own protest regarding its relevance.\\" The balls regularly made the newspapers and behaviour at the 1924 Ball, which Dulcie referred to as \\"The Night of the Great Scandal\\", resulted in the introduction of restrictions on alcohol and a greater police presence for subsequent events. Hooligans took control of Sydney Town Hall basement during the progress of the Artists' Ball on Friday night, and had to be ejected by the police. Prior to this two persons had to be arrested for drunkenness, and two as being suspected persons. Several free fights developed, and many persons were injured when beer bottles were thrown. The Inspector-General of Police agrees that there were many instances of unseemly conduct. He attributes them to unlimited supplies of liquor and lack of efficient control. Queanbeyan Age and Queanbeyan Observer 2 September 1924 A modern critic has noted that Deamer's work \\"demonstrates a fascination with religion, mythology and classical literature (typical of associates such as Norman Lindsay, Rosaleen Norton and Hugh McCrae) and is characteristically ornamental in style.\\" Poems written by Deamer appeared in the souvenir program of the 1924 ball along with those of Kenneth Slessor.

The first feature film of Melville, Le Silence de la Mer (1949), attracted the attention of Jean Cocteau, who commissioned him to direct the film version of Les Enfants Terribles. Plot Élisabeth looks after her bedridden mother and is very protective of her teenage brother Paul, who has been injured in a snowball fight at school and has to rest in bed most of the time. The siblings are inseparable, sleeping in the same room, fighting, playing secret games, and rarely leaving the house. Paul's friend, Gérard, often drops by to stay with them. When the mother dies, Élisabeth becomes a model for a couturier, where she meets Agathe and brings her home to live with them. The shy girl bears a strong resemblance to Dargelos, a schoolboy whom Paul had a crush on and the same boy who injured him. Paul and Agathe are immediately attracted to each other but neither can declare it, fearing Élisabeth's reaction. Élisabeth and Paul's relationship is a game, in which during arguments the winner is the one with the last word. Élisabeth has met a rich businessman who she marries, but he dies days after in a road accident, leaving her his mansion and fortune. She brings Paul, Agathe and Gérard to live with her. Paul decides he must tell Agathe he loves her and posts a letter, which Élisabeth destroys when it arrives. Élisabeth then pushes Gérard and Agathe into marrying each other, so they move out and she has Paul to herself. Gérard visits them with a present from Dargelos of an exotic poison, a subject that had fascinated the two at school. Having lost Agathe and now a virtual prisoner of Élisabeth, Paul in despair takes the poison. When Agathe visits him on his deathbed, they discover how Élisabeth has destroyed their love. Élisabeth realises that Paul's death would end the game with him winning. Subsequently, to ruin their reconciliation and to avoid being on her own, Élisabeth openly shoots herself and dies seconds before Paul. A traumatised Agathe is left with two bodies.

Pearce received a significant upgrade in salary for the 2015 season; settling on a salary of $3.7 million with the Orioles, well above the $700,000 he had made the previous season. His 2015 season was not as successful as his 2014 season, while he did hit 15 home runs he ended the year with a batting average of .218 and an on base percentage of .289 over 92 games and 325 plate appearances. Tampa Bay Rays On January 28, 2016, Pearce signed a one-year contract worth $4.75 million with the Tampa Bay Rays. The deal also had up to $1.25 million in bonuses for plate appearances, as well as a $250,000 bonus if he was traded by the Rays. Throughout his stint with Tampa Bay, Pearce was utilized as the designated hitter for the team but also played first base, second, and third at times. In 60 games, he hit .309 with 10 home runs. Third stint with the Orioles On August 1, 2016, the Rays traded Pearce to the Orioles for Jonah Heim. With the 2016 Orioles, Pearce appeared in 25 games, batting 13-for-60 (.217) with three home runs and six RBIs. Toronto Blue Jays Camden Yards On December 5, 2016, Pearce signed a two-year, $12.5 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. Pearce and Kendrys Morales were meant to be a replacement for departed star Edwin Encarnacion. On May 14, 2017, Pearce suffered a strained calf while sliding into second base during a game against the Seattle Mariners; forcing him to leave the game and subsequently be placed on the disabled list. He returned to the lineup on June 16 and hit a home run against the Chicago White Sox. Pearce hit the third walk-off grand slam in franchise history on July 27, lifting the Blue Jays to an 8–4 victory and a four-game sweep of the Oakland Athletics. Three days later, he hit another walk-off grand slam, giving the Blue Jays an 11–10 win over the Los Angeles Angels. In doing so, Pearce became the 29th player in MLB history to hit an ultimate grand slam, and the third player to hit two walk- off grand slams in a season, joining Cy Williams and Jim Presley, who did so in 1926 and 1986 respectively. Pearce also became the first player in MLB history to hit multiple walk-off grand slams within the span of a single week. With the 2017 Blue Jays, Pearce batted .252 in 92 games, with 13 home runs and 37 RBIs. With the 2018 Blue Jays, Pearce appeared in 26 games through June 27, batting .291 (23-for-79) with four home runs and 16 RBIs. Boston Red Sox On June 28, 2018, Pearce was traded to the Boston Red Sox for minor league infielder Santiago Espinal and $1.5M. In his MLB career, Pearce has now played for all five teams in the American League East division. The next day, Pearce went 2-for-4 in his debut game with Boston, an 8–1 loss to the rival Yankees. On August 2, in a game against the Yankees, Pearce hit three home runs and led the Red Sox in a 15–7 rout at Fenway Park. He became just the sixth player to hit three home runs in a Red Sox–Yankees game. After the game, Pearce was called the best acquisition the Red Sox made during the 2018 season. During the regular season, Pearce batted .279 for the Red Sox, with seven home runs and 26 RBIs in 50 games played. After an injury to regular first baseman Mitch Moreland in Game 2 of the American League Division Series, Pearce became the everyday first baseman for the Red Sox in the playoffs. On October 16, in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series, Pearce hit a go-ahead home run off Joe Smith in the sixth inning at Minute Maid Park in a game the Red Sox eventually won, 8–2. In the 2018 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Pearce hit a game-tying solo home run off of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen in the top of the eighth inning of Game 4. In the next inning, Pearce came up with the bases loaded and hit a base–clearing double, putting the Red Sox up 8–4 in a game they would go on to win 9–6. In Game 5, Pearce hit a two-run home run in the first inning off of former Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw, and added a second home run in the eighth inning off Pedro Báez to extend the lead to 5–1. The Red Sox would go on to win the game and the series, giving Pearce his first World Series ring. He became the first Red Sox player to hit three home runs in the World Series since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967, and in three fewer games. He joined Babe Ruth and Ted Kluszewski as the only players 35 or older to have a multi-home run game in the World Series. Pearce was named World Series MVP. On November 16, 2018, Pearce re-signed for one year and $6.25 million. He was placed on the 10-day injured list prior to Opening Day of 2019, due to a left calf injury, then activated on April 4. Pearce batted .180 in 29 games through June 1, when he was placed on the injured list due to a low back strain. He was sent on a rehabilitation assignment with the Lowell Spinners on June 14, and with the Pawtucket Red Sox on June 18. His rehabilitation assignment was stopped by the team on July 1, for what was later described as a posterior ligament injury to his knee. Pearce was moved to the 60-day injured list on August 11, and did not play again during the season, finishing with one home run and nine RBIs in the 29 games he appeared in. He became a free agent on October 31. Pearce announced his retirement on April 13, 2020.

It is located on John Brown Road in North Elba, near Lake Placid, New York, where John Brown moved in 1849 to lead freed slaves in farming. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998. and It has been managed by the state since 1896; the grounds are open to the public on a year-round basis, and tours of the house are offered in the warmer months. Description and history The John Brown Farm is located south of the village of Lake Placid, between the village of North Elba and the Lake Placid Airport, on John Brown Road (New York State Route 910M). The property is in size, of which the northern third houses the developed part of the site, with the balance in now reforested hills. The developed area includes John Brown's farmhouse and barn, as well as a caretaker's house and other infrastructure for visitors. The family graveyard is also part of the site, encircled by an iron fence. A statue of John Brown, placed in 1935, stands nearby. The house is a 2-1/2 story timber framed structure, with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. Its front is four bays wide, with the entrance in the left center bay, topped by a transom window. Most of the finishes, both interior and exterior, are restorations performed in the second half of the 20th century to bring about a c. 1860 appearance. John Brown arrived in upstate New York in 1848, as part of a project funded by Gerrit Smith to assist freed slaves in the learning to become self-sufficient farmers. Pursuant to that end, he and his sons purchased this land in 1850. In 1855, Brown moved to Kansas to support his sons' efforts to keep Kansas as a free-state under the popular sovereignty laws, leaving his wife and several of his children behind. Brown returned to visit his family at Lake Placid several times. In 1859, Brown attempted to start a liberation movement among enslaved African Americans by seizing the arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). For this, he was tried for treason against the State of Virginia and hanged. The family sold the property (except for the graveyard) in 1863. In 1870 it was purchased by journalist Kate Field, who formed an association to oversee its preservation and make it accessible to visitors. It was acquired by the state in 1896. A cenotaph on the grave of John Brown was originally erected and inscribed for his father, Capt. John Brown who died September 5, 1776, while serving in the Continental Army, and originally sat at the elder Brown's gravesite in Connecticut until 1831, when it was replaced with a larger tombstone and moved to the younger Brown's farm in New York. The younger Brown had an inscription written for his son Frederick after Frederick was killed by pro-slavery forces at the Pottawatomie massacre in 1856 and buried in Kansas, and then directed before his hanging that the names and epitaphs of his sons Oliver and Watson be inscribed alongside his own on the cenotaph. The remains of Oliver and Watson are buried next to those of John Jr. Gallery File:John-Brown-Pollia-1935.jpg|Sculpture by Joseph Pollia File:House at John Brown's Farm.jpg|Farmhouse Image:John Brown's Tombstone.jpg|John Brown's Tombstone, North Elba Image:Parlor in John Brown's Farmhouse.jpg|Parlor in John Brown's Farmhouse Image:Kitchen in John Brown's Farmhouse.jpg|Kitchen Image:First floor Bedroom in John Brown's Farm.JPG|First floor Bedroom Image:Bedroom in John Brown's Farmhouse.jpg|2nd Floor Bedroom See also * List of New York State Historic Sites * List of National Historic Landmarks in New York * List of reference routes in New York References External links New York History Net, John Brown's Farm *Aboard the Underground Railway: John Brown Farm and Gravesite, at National Park Service *Exhibit about Timbucto, the \\"Freed Slave Utopian Experiment\\" * Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:New York (state) historic sites Category:National Historic Landmarks in New York (state) Farm and Gravesite John Brown Farm and Gravesite Category:Houses completed in 1849 Category:Historic house museums in New York (state) Category:Biographical museums in New York (state) Category:Slavery in the United States Category:Parks in Essex County, New York Category:Houses in Essex County, New York Category:Adirondack Park Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in New York (state) Category:1849 establishments in New York (state) Category:Lake Placid, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Essex County, New York ","title":"John Brown Farm State Historic Site"},{"id":"13118420","text":"The McCumber relation (or McCumber theory) is a relationship between the effective cross-sections of absorption and emission of light in the physics of solid-state lasers.D.E.McCumber. Einstein relations connecting broadband emission and absorption spectra. PRB 136 (4A), 954-957 (1964)P.C.Becker, N.A.Olson, J.R.Simpson. Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: fundamentals and theory (Academic, 1999). It is named after Dean McCumber, who proposed the relationship in 1964. Definition Let \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega) be the effective absorption cross-section \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega) be effective emission cross-sections at frequency \\\\omega, and let ~T~ be the effective temperature of the medium. The McCumber relation is :(1) \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega)}{\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega)}\\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega}{k_{\\\\rm B} T}\\\\right) =\\\\left(\\\\frac{N_1}{N_2}\\\\right)_T =\\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_{\\\\rm z}}{k_{\\\\rm B} T}\\\\right) where \\\\left(\\\\frac{N_1}{N_2}\\\\right)_T is thermal steady-state ratio of populations; frequency \\\\omega_{\\\\rm z} is called \\"zero-line\\" frequency; \\\\hbar is the Planck constant and k_{\\\\rm B} is the Boltzmann constant. Note that the right-hand side of Equation (1) does not depend on ~\\\\omega~. Gain It is typical that the lasing properties of a medium are determined by the temperature and the population at the excited laser level, and are not sensitive to the method of excitation used to achieve it. In this case, the absorption cross-section \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega) and the emission cross-section \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega) at frequency ~\\\\omega~ can be related to the lasers gain in such a way, that the gain at this frequency can be determined as follows: :(2) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~G(\\\\omega)=N_2 \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega)-N_1 \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega) D.E.McCumber had postulated these properties and found that the emission and absorption cross-sections are not independent; they are related with Equation (1). Idealized atoms In the case of an idealized two-level atom the detailed balance for the emission and absorption which preserves the Planck formula for the black-body radiation leads to equality of cross-section of absorption and emission. In the solid- state lasers the splitting of each of laser levels leads to the broadening which greatly exceeds the natural spectral linewidth. In the case of an ideal two-level atom, the product of the linewidth and the lifetime is of order of unity, which obeys the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In solid-state laser materials, the linewidth is several orders of magnitude larger so the spectra of emission and absorption are determined by distribution of excitation among sublevels rather than by the shape of the spectral line of each individual transition between sublevels. This distribution is determined by the effective temperature within each of laser levels. The McCumber hypothesis is that the distribution of excitation among sublevels is thermal. The effective temperature determines the spectra of emission and absorption ( The effective temperature is called a temperature by scientists even if the excited medium as whole is pretty far from the thermal state ) Deduction of the McCumber relation Fig.1. Sketch of sublevels Consider the set of active centers (fig.1.). Assume fast transition between sublevels within each level, and slow transition between levels. According to the McCumber hypothesis, the cross- sections \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a} and \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e} do not depend on the populations N_1 and N_2. Therefore, we can deduce the relation, assuming the thermal state. Let ~v(\\\\omega)~ be group velocity of light in the medium, the product ~n_2\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega) v(\\\\omega)D(\\\\omega)~ is spectral rate of stimulated emission, and ~n_1\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega) v(\\\\omega)D(\\\\omega)~ is that of absorption; a(\\\\omega)n_2 is spectral rate of spontaneous emission. (Note that in this approximation, there is no such thing as a spontaneous absorption) The balance of photons gives: :(3) ~~~ n_2\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega) v(\\\\omega)D(\\\\omega)+n_2 a(\\\\omega)= n_1\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega) v(\\\\omega)D(\\\\omega) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{\\\\rm (balance)} Which can be rewritten as :(4) ~~~ D(\\\\omega)= \\\\frac{\\\\frac{a(\\\\omega)}{\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega) v(\\\\omega)}} {\\\\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega)}{\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega)}-1} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{\\\\rm (D1)} The thermal distribution of density of photons follows from blackbody radiation e2 :(5) ~~~ D(\\\\omega)~=~ \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi^2} \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2}{c^3}} {\\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega}{k_{\\\\rm B}T}\\\\right)-1} ~~~~~ {\\\\rm (D2)} Both (4) and (5) hold for all frequencies ~\\\\omega~. For the case of idealized two- level active centers, ~\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega)=\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega)~, and ~n_1/n_2=\\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega}{k_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\right), which leads to the relation between the spectral rate of spontaneous emission a(\\\\omega) and the emission cross-section ~\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega)~. (We keep the term probability of emission for the quantity ~a(\\\\omega){\\\\rm d}\\\\omega{\\\\rm d}t~, which is probability of emission of a photon within small spectral interval ~(\\\\omega,\\\\omega+{\\\\rm d}\\\\omega)~ during a short time interval ~(t,t+{\\\\rm d}t)~, assuming that at time ~t~ the atom is excited.) The relation (D2) is a fundamental property of spontaneous and stimulated emission, and perhaps the only way to prohibit a spontaneous break of the thermal equilibrium in the thermal state of excitations and photons. For each site number ~s~, for each sublevel number j, the partial spectral emission probability ~a_{s,j}(\\\\omega)~ can be expressed from consideration of idealized two-level atoms: :(6) ~~~ a_{s,j}(\\\\omega)=\\\\sigma_{s,j}(\\\\omega) \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2 v(\\\\omega)}{\\\\pi^2c^3}~~. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{\\\\rm comparison1} ~~{\\\\rm partial} Neglecting the cooperative coherent effects, the emission is additive: for any concentration ~q_{s}~ of sites and for any partial population ~n_{s,j}~ of sublevels, the same proportionality between ~a~ and ~\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}~ holds for the effective cross-sections: :(7) \\\\frac{a(\\\\omega)}{\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega)}= \\\\frac{\\\\omega^2 v(\\\\omega)}{\\\\pi^2c^3} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(\\\\rm comparison)(av) Then, the comparison of (D1) and (D2) gives the relation :(8) \\\\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}(\\\\omega)} {\\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}(\\\\omega)}= \\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega}{k_{\\\\rm B}T}\\\\right)~~. ~~~~~~~~{\\\\rm (n1n2) (mc1)} This relation is equivalent of the McCumber relation (mc), if we define the zero- line frequency \\\\omega_{Z} as solution of equation :(9) ~\\\\left(\\\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\\\right)_{\\\\\\\\!T}= \\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_{\\\\rm Z}}{k_{\\\\rm B}T}\\\\right)~~~~,~~~ the subscript ~T~ indicates that the ratio of populations in evaluated in the thermal state. The zero-line frequency can be expressed as :(10) \\\\omega_{\\\\rm Z}=\\\\frac{k_{\\\\rm B}T}{\\\\hbar} \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\\\right)_{T} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.~~{(\\\\rm oz)} Then (n1n2) becomes equivalent of the McCumber relation (mc). No specific property of sublevels of active medium is required to keep the McCumber relation. It follows from the assumption about quick transfer of energy among excited laser levels and among lower laser levels. The McCumber relation (mc) has the same range of validity as the concept of the emission cross-section itself. Confirmation of the McCumber relation The McCumber relation is confirmed for various media. In particular, relation (1) makes it possible to approximate two functions of frequency, emission and absorption cross sections, with single fit . Violation of the McCumber relation and perpetual motion right|400px|thumb|Fig.2. Cross-sections for Yb:Gd2SiO5 versus \\\\lambda=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi c}{\\\\omega} In 2006 the strong violation of McCumber relation was observed for Yb:Gd2SiO5 and reported in 3 independent journals. Typical behavior of the cross-sections reported is shown in Fig.2 with thick curves. The emission cross-section is practically zero at wavelength 975 nm; this property makes Yb:Gd2SiO5 an excellent material for efficient solid-state lasers. However, the property reported (thick curves) is not compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. With such a material, the perpetual motion device would be possible. It would be sufficient to fill a box with reflecting walls with Yb:Gd2SiO5 and allow it to exchange radiation with a black body through a spectrally-selective window which is transparent in vicinity of 975 nm and reflective at other wavelengths. Due to the lack of emissivity at 975 nm the medium should warm, breaking the thermal equilibrium. On the base of the second Law of thermodynamics, the experimental results were refuted in 2007. With the McCumber theory, the correction was suggested for the effective emission cross section (black thin curve). Then this correction was confirmed experimentally.

The Miami Beach Resort and Spa is a historic resort hotel opened in 1963 as the Doral Hotel On-The-Ocean on the famous Millionaire's Row at 4833 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach, Florida. History Designed by architect Melvin Grossman and constructed by builder Robert Turchin,http://www.miamibeachfl.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=71504 the hotel, also known as the Doral Beach Hotel, was named for its owner and his wife, Doris and Alfred Kaskel. The hotel opened on February 15, 1963, as the sister hotel to the Doral Country Club on the mainland (now in Doral, Florida), where the Doral Open was played until 2006. The Doral Beach Hotel was long considered the most elegant and luxurious hotel in the area. It won several of the coveted Mobil Five Star awards.2007 Gold Awards The hotel hosted the headquarters of George McGovern during the 1972 Democratic National Convention.The Democratic Principals - Printout - TIME The Doral was home away from home for movie stars and presidents. Several scenes from the hit 1972 film The Heartbreak Kid were shot on location at the hotel. The movie shows the lobby, room 1704, the bar adjacent to the Starlight Roof restaurant on the 18th floor of the hotel, and the pool area and beach. In the 1990s the hotel changed hands several times. It was first purchased from the original family in the early 1990s by a French company and renamed the Doral Ocean Beach Resort. The French OBR company then sold it to Interstate Hotels in 1997 and it became a Westin, The Westin Resort Miami Beach. In September 1998 the hotel was purchased by Wyndham and renamed the Wyndham Miami Beach Resort. In 2006 the Blackstone Group, a large conglomerate, purchased the Wyndham hotel chain. Some of the Wyndham hotels were merged into LXR, another chain owned by Blackstone. Today, the hotel is known as the Miami Beach Resort and Spa, an LXR hotel. The property is now closed by the new owners the Shetrits. No longer operating as a resort. OBR retained a portion of the property adjacent to the hotel when it was sold to Interstate. Originally containing a parking lot, two tennis courts and additional beach access, OBR built the Grand Beach Hotel on this land in 2009. In addition, OBR retained the rights to the Doral name.

There is a vida of Jordan which exists in several manuscripts, some with an accompanying razo. Like typical vidas, it tell us where he was from and whom he loved. He was from Pena d'Albeges (modern Penne).Schutz, 227. At some point he had a love affair with Elis (Lucia) de Montfort, wife of Guillem de Gordon (c. 1165) and then Bernart de Casnac (c. 1214). This affair was originally in a vida of Bertran de Born, but it was cut out and placed in Jordan's own vida-razo at a later date. Jordan was a contemporary of Bertran and partook with him in the Revolt of 1173–1174 as a partisan of Henry the Young King against Henry Curtmantle, Duke of Aquitaine and King of England.Poe, 316. He may have received a near fatal wound on the same campaign in which the Young King died in 1183.Poe, 317. Jordan's own wife fell in with \\"heretics\\" (ereges), certainly Cathars, though one document calls them Patarics. Of Jordan's literary output, twelve poems survive.Gaunt, \\"Review\\", 970. They include eleven cansos and one tenso (and possibly a sirventes). The incipit found at the end of a razo introducing one of his cansos says maintas bonas chansos fetz: \\"he made many good cansos.\\"Aubrey, 128. The melody of Jordan's Vas vos soplei, domna, premieramen also survives. It was copied by the later troubadour Peire Cardenal for his Rics homs que greu ditz vertat e leu men.Perrin, 319. The most recent modern edition of his works is Il trovatore Raimon Jordan edited by Stefano Asperti (Modena: Mucchi, 1990). Jordan's work is generally ahistorical and his poetry \\"suggests a jazz musician working over well-worn themes to move inexorably deeper into the poetic imagination.\\"Stäblein, 239. His innovations have led to comparisons with Thelonious Monk. Though Jordan is not usually regarded as a master by modern standards, the Monge de Montaudon, writing in the 1190s in the generation after him, gave him a high place in his Pos Peire d'Alvernh'a cantat. Jordan was one of the early troubadours to employ the mythology of the \\"wild man\\" in his poems. He refers to the \\"solace of the savage\\" (aissi farai lo conort del salvatge) and remarks that the expectation of joy makes him brave and that therefore he should better enjoy the snowfall rather than the blossoming of the flowers. In general Jordan's poetry emphasises the accompanying suffering of love and the stoic embrace of the suffering as a necessary consequence to be endured. The sufferings of love were compared to the buffeting of a tempestuous sea, a metaphor which was common enough in the literature of the time, when the sea was typically viewed as dangerous: > :Com hom e mar quan se sent perilhar :Que dins son cor sospir'e dels olhs > plora :E contra.l vent non pot nul genh trobar . . .Archer, 91. In another passage, Jordan explains that his song is an \\"interpreter\\" of his sorrows to the lady for whom he is suffering: > :Si saubes cilh don m'agr'ops mantenensa :Tan coralmen me destrenho.l > cossir, . . . :Mas ma chansos li sera latiniers, :A leis per cui fatz tan > greu abstenensa.Gaunt, \\"Sexual Difference and the Metaphor of Language in a > Troubadour Poem\\", 311. \\"If the woman whose support I need knew how deeply my > sorrows torment me in this, . . . but my song will be an interpreter to her > for whom I undertake such great abstinence.\\" Indeed, his devotion to a lady knew no bounds and he was a sacrilegious poet. In one of his more famous passages he exclaims that he would give up eternity in Paradise for one night with a certain lady: > :Que tan la desir e volh :Que, s'er'en coita de mort, :Non queri'a a Deu tan > fort :Que lai el seu paradis ::M'aculhis :Com que'm des lezer :D'una noit ab > leis jazer.Sargent, 599. Jordan wrote one canso for performance by women. In it he attacks the misogyny of earlier troubadours (antic trobadors) who have \\"slandered and misled women in their love poems\\".Léglu, 19. The song also attacks a satirist for \\"adopting the manner of a preacher\\" for the express purpose of criticising women publicly. In the last stanza of the canso, the female performer says: > {valign=\\"center\\"Que quascus hom deu razonar son fraire > E queia domna sa seror . . . > E s'ieu per so velh far razonamen > A las domnas, no m'o reptes nien. |valign=\\"center\\"For each man must reason > with his brother, > And every woman with her sister . . . > And if I wish to reason with women, > Don't reprove me for it at all. |} Otherwise, his work is characterised by \\"striking feudal metaphors.\\" References *Archer, Robert. \\"Symbolic Metaphor and Reading-Processes in Ausiàs March\\".

Smith, eds., The Predecessors of Shakespeare: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1973; pp. 153-7. Publication The Wounds of Civil War was entered into the Stationers' Register on 24 May 1594, and was published in quarto later that year by the bookseller John Danter. The title page of the quarto identifies Lodge as the author, and states that the play was performed by the Admiral's Men. The 1594 quarto is the only publication of the play before the nineteenth century.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 410. Date The date of the authorship and premier performance of the play is not known with certainty. Many scholars have considered the scene in Act III that includes a chariot drawn by four Moors as an imitation of the famous similar scene in Marlowe's Tamburlaine, indicating that Lodge's play must post-date Marlowe's.William A. Armstrong, \\"Tamburlaine and The Wounds of Civil War,\\" Notes and Queries 5 (1958), pp. 381-3. The Wounds of Civil War is generally dated to the 1587-92 period.

The eponymous rock formation, one of the highest points in Greenville County, is a granitic gneiss outcrop at above sea level on the Blue Ridge Escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains and rests roughly above the Piedmont below. (The origin of the name “Caesars Head” is disputed, though the outcrop was most probably named for an early mountaineer’s dog.)Nawal Jaber, et al., “The Dramatic History of Caesar’s Head,” \\"Echoes\\" (Northwest Middle School, Travelers Rest, South Carolina), Spring 1987, 16. Caesars Head State Park and Jones Gap State Park are jointly administered by the state Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism as part of the Mountain Bridge Wilderness. History In 1825 the state engineer and noted architect Robert Mills described Caesars Head as a \\"mass of granite, rising from the vale, through which a rapid river winds its turbulent way...the ledges of stone, rising almost perpendicular, and at length, hanging over at [the] top, so that they seem to totter to their fall.\\"Robert Mills, Statistics of South Carolina (Charleston: Hurlburt and Lloyd, 1826), 579. After the completion of the Jones Gap Road in 1848, a former state senator, Benjamin Hagood, purchased about 2,400 acres around Caesars Head where he built a summer cottage, and later a hotel, “to take advantage of the area’s cool breezes, moderate temperatures, and breath-taking views.”Judith Bainbridge, “Caesar’s Head Continues to Attract Tourists,” Greenville News, July 8, 2009, City People, 2. The hotel closed in 1862, and Hagood died in 1865, leaving the property to his daughter Eliza and her husband, Dr. Francis Miles, the first physician in Pickens County. During the Civil War, the area was frequented by deserters from the Confederate Army,Archie Vernon Huff, Jr., Greenville: The History of the City and County in the South Carolina Piedmont (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1995), 142. but by 1876 the Mileses were operating a health resort on the mountain.Greenville Paper, July 8, 1879; Greenville Mountaineer, September 18, 1897, in Mann Batson, The Upper Part of Greenville County, South Carolina (Taylors, SC: privately printed, 1993), 568-71. In the 1870s it took five to six hours to reach Caesars Head from Marietta, about sixteen miles away. Bainbridge, 2. In 1880, Miles sold the hotel to E. M. Seabrook of Charleston, who enlarged the inn and associated cottages but was unable to pay off the mortgage. In 1885, the property reverted to Miles, who was said to have been “a model innkeeper” of a “comfortable primitive hotel.” In 1897, the Mileses deeded the property to Furman University in exchange for an annuity and free room and board for the rest of their lives.Bainbridge, 5. Miles died in 1903, his wife in 1918. In 1924, Furman sold the property to a development company interested in selling lots for summer homes. The hotel continued to operate even when the land developer failed during the Depression. In 1946 brothers Pete and Tom Marchant bought the property and added tennis courts and a swimming pool. The hotel a cottage, and the adjacent servants' quarters—the original Hagood house—burned in the early morning of September 9, 1954.Bainbridge, 5; Huff, 311; “The Dramatic History of Caesar’s Head,” 27-28; Greenville News, September 10, 1954, 1; Greenville Piedmont, September 10, 1954.

Hartford House, now known as Hartford Hall, is a historic house on the campus of Westchester Community College. It was built in 1930–32 by John A. Hartford (1872–1951), company president of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A&P;). The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977 for its association with Hartford, who oversaw the rise of A&P; into the nation's first national chain grocer. and The building now houses the office of the college president, among other uses. Description and history The John A. Hartford House stands on the campus of Westchester Community College, located west of the village of Valhalla. The college is located on a portion of the original Hartford country estate. The house is a large Tudor Revival structure, designed by Mann and MacNeille, an architecture firm from New York City, and completed in 1932. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, built mainly out of fieldstone and covered by a slate hip roof. The stone is laid in rough courses, with wooden beams interrupting some of them. Red brick chimneys with corbelled tops dot the structure. The interior is finished with rich woodwork, marble, and plasterwork. Despite the building's adaptation to institutional use, it retains some feeling of a home, and still includes some of John Hartford's furnishings. John Hartford purchased over of land in 1930 from Joseph Daly, a New York lawyer who had used the estate for breeding horses. Hartford had the house built, along with other trappings of a country estate, including a nine-hole golf course. Of Hartford's estate buildings, only the house and a greenhouse survive. Hartford is considered by historians of business to be the principal force in the expansion of A&P; to national scope; the company was founded in 1859, but its expansion took place in between 1910 and 1930, with Hartford and his brother George at the corporate helm. After Hartford died in 1951, the property was controlled by the John A. Hartford Foundation, which leased it to Yale University for use in a forestry program. In 1957, the foundation sold the property to the county at a discounted price, for use as an educational facility. The county had been seeking a home for the community college, whose administration it had taken over from the state.

It is often a part of regional planning and national historic preservation. History New Jersey passed the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964 to mitigate the loss of farmland to rapid suburban development through the use of favorable tax assessments. But by the late 1970s, the value of farmland had outstripped the tax benefits of the act, so the state purchased deed restrictions on farms through the Agriculture Retention and Development Act of 1981. Regional efforts in Monmouth County, New Jersey include the Navesink Highlands Greenway, a project of the Monmouth County Farmland Preservation Program, which, along with the Monmouth Conservation Foundation, purchased the development rights of the Holly Crest Farm in Middletown in September 2008 for US $2.5 million.

History Bernard Brisbois was born in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in 1808, to Michel Brisbois, a French-Canadian voyageur, and his second wife Domitelle (Madelaine) Gautier de Verville. Like his father, Brisbois also began his career in the fur trade, working as agent for the American Fur Company. Bernard married Thérèse Lachappelle [daughter of metis Pélagie LaPointe (herself the daughter of Pierre Lapointe and Etoukasahwee) and Antoine Lachapelle]. Later he engaged in the mercantile business in Prairie du Chien until 1873 when he was appointed consul at Verviers, Belgium. He returned to Prairie du Chien in 1874 and lived there until his death in 1885. Etoukasahwee's parents are listed as Gaa-dawaabide (Broken Tooth or DeBreche) and Obenege shipequay. Gaa-dawaabide was a long-time Ojibwe chief of the Sandy Lake village, whose family belonged to the Aan'aawenh (Pintail) doodem or clan. Gaa-dawaabide (1750–1828), son of Biauswah II, was at the taking of Michilimackinac. He married Obeneg eshipequag. His sons were Maangozid (Loons Foot), Gaa-nandawaawinzo (Ripe berry hunter) and Zagataagan (Spunk) and daughters Charlotte, who married Charles Oakes Ermitinger, Nancy (Keneesequa) born 1793 married 1822/23 Samuel Ashmun and a daughter who married Hole in the Day. He was principal spokesperson at Sandy Lake before 1805. The name DeBreche attributed to him is likely one of his sons as it was used at the signing of treaty in 1837 at Fort Snelling after his death. Bernard Brisbois is buried at Brisbois Cemetery on a bluff above Prairie du Chien. Brisbois Store Located on St. Feriole Island in the city of Prairie du Chien, the historical Brisbois Store was built in 1851-52 by Bernard Brisbois. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, the stone building sits on land with a long association with the North American fur trade. Prior to the War of 1812, the property was owned by a number of prominent traders and companies. During the War a log structure on the property was used by U.S. soldiers for housing while nearby Fort Shelby was under construction. After the War, the property became the site of a U.S. Fur Factory. In the 1820s the land was sold to the American Fur Company who held it until its sale to Bernard Brisbois in 1850. Through much of the twentieth century the building was known as the Riverside Boat Repair. The Brisbois Store was acquired by the Wisconsin Historical Society in the 1970s and was established as the Fur Trade Museum. The Brisbois Store is listed as a National Historic Landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places. Brisbois House (II) : For Brisbois House (I), see Michel Brisbois House Also located on St. Feriole Island, the second Brisbois House was built by Joseph Rolette as part of a separation contract negotiated in 1836 for his estranged wife, Jane Fisher Rolette. The limestone house was erected on property owned by Jane's maternal relatives, the Brisbois. The limestone for the building came from the surplus stone sold by the United States government after the construction of Fort Crawford. After Rolette's death, Jane married his business partner, Hercules Dousman, and transferred the property to her cousin, Bernard Brisbois, and the house remained in his family until the end of the 1900s. In the 1950s the Cornelius family restored the residence and gave the property to the Wisconsin Historical Society. Like the Brisbois Store, the second Brisbois House is listed as National Historic Landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places.

Ron Hubbard, and an associated movement. It has been variously defined as a cult, a business or a new religious movement. Hubbard initially developed a set of ideas which he represented as a form of therapy, called Dianetics, which he then promoted through the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. The foundation soon entered bankruptcy, and Hubbard lost the rights to his publication Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health in 1952. He then recharacterized the subject as a religion and renamed it Scientology, retaining the terminology, doctrines, the E-meter, and the practice of auditing. Within a year, he regained the rights to Dianetics and retained both subjects under the umbrella of the Church of Scientology. The Church of Scientology says that a human is an immortal, spiritual being (thetan) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable past lives and it is observed in advanced Scientology texts that lives preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth were lived in extraterrestrial cultures. Scientology doctrine states that any Scientologist undergoing auditing will eventually come across and recount a common series of events. Hubbard describes the etymology of the word \\"Scientology\\" as coming from the Latin word scio, meaning know or distinguish, and the Greek word logos, meaning \\"the word or outward form by which the inward thought is expressed and made known\\". Hubbard writes, \\"thus, Scientology means knowing about knowing, or the science of knowledge\\". Hubbard's groups have encountered considerable opposition and controversy. In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners brought proceedings against Dianetics Foundation on the charge of teaching medicine without a license. During the 1970s Hubbard's followers engaged in a program of criminal infiltration of the U.S. government. Hubbard-inspired organizations and their classification are often a point of contention. Germany classifies Scientology groups as an \\"anti-constitutional sect\\", while in France they have been classified as a dangerous cult by parliamentary reports.A 1995 parliamentary report lists Scientology groups as cults, and in its 2006 report MIVILUDES similarly classified Scientology organizations as a dangerous cultLe point sur l'Eglise de Scientologie, Le Nouvel Observateur History L. Ron Hubbard L. Ron Hubbard and Thomas S. Moulton in Portland, Oregon, in 1943 L. Ron Hubbard (1911–1986) was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard, a United States Navy officer, and his wife, Ledora Waterbury. Hubbard spent three semesters at George Washington University (in Washington, D.C.), but was placed on probation in September 1931. He failed to return for the fall 1932 semester.Wallis, p. 21 During World War II in July 1941, Hubbard was commissioned as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve. On May 18, 1943, his subchaser left Portland. That night, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire 35 depth charges and a number of gun rounds at what he believed were Japanese submarines.Atack, p. 75 His ship sustained minor damage and three crew were injured. Having run out of depth charges and with the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by other ships, Hubbard's ship was ordered back to port. A navy report concluded that \\"there was no submarine in the area.\\" A decade later, Hubbard claimed in his Scientology lectures that he had sunk a Japanese submarine. On June 28, 1943, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire on the Coronado Islands. Hubbard apparently did not realize that the islands belonged to US-allied Mexico, nor that he had taken his vessel into Mexican territorial waters.Miller, p. 139 He was reprimanded and removed from command on July 7. After reassignment to a naval facility in Monterey, California, Hubbard became depressed and fell ill. Reporting stomach pains in April 1945, he spent the remainder of the war as a patient in Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California.Atack, p. 82 According to his later teachings, during this time Hubbard made scientific \\"breakthroughs\\" by use of \\"endocrine experiments\\". On October 15, 1947, Hubbard wrote a letter to the Veterans Administration formally requesting psychiatric treatment, and said he was unable to afford to pay for it himself. Within a few years, Hubbard would condemn psychiatry as evil, and this would grow into a major theme in Scientology. Excalibur and Babalon Working In April 1938, Hubbard reportedly reacted to a drug used in a dental procedure. According to his account, this triggered a revelatory near-death experience. Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with the working titles of \\"The One Command\\" or Excalibur. The contents of Excalibur formed the basis for some of his later publications.Hubbard, \\"The Anatomy Of Thought\\". Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter 26 April 1970R, revised March 15, 1975. Arthur J. Burks, who read the work in 1938, later recalled it discussed the \\"one command\\": to survive. This theme would be revisited in Dianetics, the set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body which became the central philosophy of Scientology. Hubbard later cited Excalibur as an early version of Dianetics. In August 1945, Hubbard moved into the Pasadena mansion of John \\"Jack\\" Whiteside Parsons, an avid occultist and Thelemite, follower of the English ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley and leader of a lodge of Crowley's magical order, Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO).Miller, p. 113 Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the \\"Babalon Working\\", a sex magic ritual intended to summon an incarnation of Babalon, the supreme Thelemite Goddess.Urban, Hugh B. Magia sexualis: sex, magic, and liberation in modern Western esotericism, p. 137. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2006. In 1969, The Church of Scientology admitted to Hubbard's involvement with Parsons while claiming that Hubbard, a US Navy Officer, was \\"sent in to handle the situation\\". In the late 1940s, Hubbard practiced as a hypnotist and he worked in Hollywood posing as a swami. The Church says that Hubbard's experience with hypnosis led him to create Dianetics.Hubbard, What is Scientology?, 1998 softcover edition, pg. 529. Dianetics L. Ron Hubbard in 1950 In May 1950, Hubbard's Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science was published by pulp magazine Astounding Science Fiction. Originally published by Stephen A. Kent in December 1999. In the same year, he published the book-length Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, considered the seminal event of the century by Scientologists. Scientologists sometimes use a dating system based on the book's publication; for example, \\"A.D. 25\\" does not stand for Anno Domini, but \\"After Dianetics\\". Dianetics uses a counseling technique known as auditing in which an auditor assists a subject in conscious recall of traumatic events in the individual's past. It was originally intended to be a new psychotherapy and was not expected to become the foundation for a new religion.Wilson, Bryan (1970). Religious Sects: A Sociological Study, McGraw-Hill, p. 163 Hubbard variously defined Dianetics as a spiritual healing technology and an organized science of thought. The stated intent is to free individuals of the influence of past traumas by systematic exposure and removal of the engrams (painful memories) these events have left behind, a process called clearing. Rutgers scholar Beryl Satter says that \\"there was little that was original in Hubbard's approach\\", with much of the theory having origins in popular conceptions of psychology. Satter observes that in \\"keeping with the typical 1950s distrust of emotion, Hubbard promised that Dianetic treatment would release and erase psychosomatic ills and painful emotions, thereby leaving individuals with increased powers of rationality.\\" According to Gallagher and Ashcraft, in contrast to psychotherapy, Hubbard stated that Dianetics \\"was more accessible to the average person, promised practitioners more immediate progress, and placed them in control of the therapy process.\\" Hubbard's thought was parallel with the trend of humanist psychology at that time, which also came about in the 1950s. Passas and Castillo write that the appeal of Dianetics was based on its consistency with prevailing values.Passas, Nikos, and Manuel Escamilla Castillo. \\"Scientology And Its 'Clear' Business\\". Behavioral Sciences & The Law 10.1 (1992): 103–116. Academic Search Premier Shortly after the introduction of Dianetics, Hubbard introduced the concept of the \\"thetan\\" (or soul) which he claimed to have discovered. Dianetics was organized and centralized to consolidate power under Hubbard, and groups that were previously recruited into Dianetics were no longer permitted to organize autonomously. Two of Hubbard's key supporters at the time were John W. Campbell Jr., the editor of Astounding Science Fiction, and Campbell's brother-in-law, physician Joseph A. Winter. Dr. Winter, hoping to have Dianetics accepted in the medical community, submitted papers outlining the principles and methodology of Dianetic therapy to the Journal of the American Medical Association and the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1949, but these were rejected.Wallis, Roy (1977). The Road to Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology, Columbia University Press, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health spent six months on the New York Times bestseller list.June 18, 1950 to December 24 According to religious studies professor Paul Gutjahr, Dianetics is the bestselling non-Christian religious book of the century. Publisher's Weekly gave a posthumous plaque to Hubbard to commemorate Dianetics' appearance on its list of bestsellers for one hundred weeks. Studies that address the topic of the origins of the work and its significance to Scientology as a whole include Peter Rowley's New Gods in America, Omar V. Garrison's The Hidden Story of Scientology, and Albert I. Berger's Towards a Science of the Nuclear Mind: Science-fiction Origins of Dianetics. More complex studies include Roy Wallis's The Road to Total Freedom. Dianetics appealed to a broad range of people who used instructions from the book and applied the method to each other, becoming practitioners themselves. Dianetics soon faced criticism. Morris Fishbein, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association and well known at the time as a debunker of quack medicine, dismissed Hubbard's book. An article in Newsweek stated that \\"the Dianetics concept is unscientific and unworthy of discussion or review\\". Hubbard asserted that Dianetics is \\"an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of natural laws on the order of those of the physical sciences\\". Hubbard became the leader of a growing Dianetics movement. He became a popular lecturer and established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he trained his first Dianetics counselors or auditors. Some practitioners of Dianetics reported experiences which they believed had occurred in past lives, or previous incarnations. In early 1951, reincarnation became a subject of intense debate within the Dianetics community. Hubbard took the reports of past life events seriously and introduced the concept of the thetan, an immortal being analogous to the soul. This was an important factor in the transition from secular Dianetics to the religion of Scientology. Sociologists Roy Wallis and Steve Bruce suggest that Dianetics, which set each person as his or her own authority, was about to fail due to its inherent individualism, and that Hubbard started Scientology as a religion to establish himself as the overarching authority. Also in 1951, Hubbard incorporated the electropsychometer (E-meter for short), a kind of electrodermal activity meter, as an auditing aid. Based on a design by Volney Mathison, the device is held by Scientologists to be a useful tool in detecting changes in a person's state of mind. The global spread of Scientology at the latter half of the 1950s was culminated with the opening of churches in Johannesburg and Paris, while world headquarters transferred to England in Saint Hill, a rural estate. Hubbard lived there for the next seven years. Dianetics is different from Scientology in that Scientology is a religion while Dianetics is not. The purpose of Dianetics is the improvement of the individual, the individual or \\"self\\" being only one of eight \\"dynamics\\". \\"According to Hugh B. Urban, Hubbard's early science of Dianetics would be best comprehended as a \\"bricolage that brought together his various explorations in psychology, hypnosis, and science fiction\\". If Dianetics is understood as a bricolage, then Scientology is \\"an even more ambitious sort of religious bricolage adapted to the new religious marketplace of 1950s America\\", continues Urban. According to Roy Wallis, \\"Scientology emerged as a religious commodity eminently suited to the contemporary market of postwar America.\\" L. Ron Hubbard Jr. said in an interview that the spiritual bricolage of Scientology, as written by Hugh B. Urban, \\"seemed to be uniquely suited to the individualism and quick-fix mentality of 1950s America: just by doing a few assignments, \\"one can become a god\\". Harlan Ellison has told a story of seeing Hubbard at a gathering of the Hydra Club in 1953 or 1954. Hubbard was complaining of not being able to make a living on what he was being paid as a science fiction writer. Ellison says that Lester del Rey told Hubbard that what he needed to do to get rich was start a religion. Church of Scientology Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, D.C. In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners began proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for teaching medicine without a license, which eventually led to that foundation's bankruptcy.Thomas Streissguth Charismatic Cult Leaders, p. 70, The Oliver Press Inc., 1996 George Malko Scientology: the now religion, p. 58, Delacorte Press, 1970 ASIN B0006CAHJ6 In December 1952, the Hubbard Dianetic Foundation filed for bankruptcy, and Hubbard lost control of the Dianetics trademark and copyrights to financier Don Purcell. Author Russell Miller argues that Scientology \\"was a development of undeniable expedience, since it ensured that he would be able to stay in business even if the courts eventually awarded control of Dianetics and its valuable copyrights to ... Purcell\\".Miller, 1987: 202–203 L. Ron Hubbard originally intended for Scientology to be considered a science, as stated in his writings. In May 1952, Scientology was organized to put this intended science into practice, and in the same year, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as Scientology, a religious philosophy.Christian D. Von Dehsen-Scott L. Harris Philosophers and Religious Leaders, p. 90, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999 Marco Frenschkowski quotes Hubbard in a letter written in 1953, to show that he never denied that his original approach was not a religious one: \\"Probably the greatest discovery of Scientology and its most forceful contribution to mankind has been the isolation, description and handling of the human spirit, accomplished in July 1951, in Phoenix, Arizona. I established, along scientific rather than religious or humanitarian lines that the thing which is the person, the personality, is separable from the body and the mind at will and without causing bodily death or derangement. (Hubbard 1983: 55).\\" In April 1953, Hubbard wrote a letter proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion.Miller, p. 213 As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in Dianetics.Kent, Stephen A. \\"The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology\\". Religious Studies and Theology 18:2, pp. 97–126. 1999. ISSN 1747-5414 His letter discussed the legal and financial benefits of religious status. Hubbard outlined plans for setting up a chain of \\"Spiritual Guidance Centers\\" charging customers $500 for twenty-four hours of auditing (\\"That is real money ... Charge enough and we'd be swamped.\\"). He wrote: In December 1953, Hubbard incorporated three churches – a \\"Church of American Science\\", a \\"Church of Scientology\\" and a \\"Church of Spiritual Engineering\\" – in Camden, New Jersey. On February 18, 1954, with Hubbard's blessing, some of his followers set up the first local Church of Scientology, the Church of Scientology of California, adopting the \\"aims, purposes, principles and creed of the Church of American Science, as founded by L. Ron Hubbard\\". The movement spread quickly through the United States and to other English-speaking countries such as Britain, Ireland, South Africa and Australia. The second local Church of Scientology to be set up, after the one in California, was in Auckland, New Zealand. In 1955, Hubbard established the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, D.C.. The group declared that the Founding Church, as written in the certificate of incorporation for the Founding Church of Scientology in the District of Columbia, was to \\"act as a parent church for the religious faith known as 'Scientology' and to act as a church for the religious worship of the faith\\". The Church experienced further challenges. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began an investigation concerning the claims the Church of Scientology made in connection with its E-meters. On January 4, 1963, FDA agents raided offices of the Church of Scientology, seizing hundreds of E-meters as illegal medical devices and tons of literature that they accused of making false medical claims. The original suit by the FDA to condemn the literature and E-meters did not succeed, but the Court ordered the Church to label every meter with a disclaimer that it is purely religious artifact, to post a $20,000 bond of compliance, and to pay the FDA's legal expenses. In the course of developing Scientology, Hubbard presented rapidly changing teachings that some have seen as often self- contradictory. According to Lindholm, for the inner cadre of Scientologists in that period, involvement depended not so much on belief in a particular doctrine but on unquestioning faith in Hubbard. In 1966, Hubbard purportedly stepped down as executive director of Scientology to devote himself to research and writing. The following year, he formed the ship-based Sea Organization or Sea Org which operated three ships: the Diana, the Athena, and the flagship the Apollo. One month after the establishment of the Sea Org, Hubbard announced that he had made a breakthrough discovery, the result of which were the \\"OT III\\" materials purporting to provide a method for overcoming factors inhibiting spiritual progress. These materials were first disseminated on the ships, and then propagated by Sea Org members reassigned to staff Advanced Organizations on land. Hubbard in hiding, death, and aftermath In 1972, facing criminal charges in France, Hubbard returned to the United States and began living in an apartment in Queens, New York. When faced with possible indictment in the United States, Hubbard went into hiding in April 1979. He hid first in an apartment in Hemet, California, where his only contact with the outside world was via ten trusted Messengers. He cut contact with everyone else, even his wife, whom he saw for the last time in August 1979.Atack, p. 258 In February 1980 he disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted Messengers, Pat and Anne Broeker.Atack, p. 259Miller, p. 364 In 1979, as a result of FBI raids during Operation Snow White, eleven senior people in the church's Guardian's Office were convicted of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property. In 1981, Scientology took the German government to court for the first time.Elisabeth Amveck Researching New Religious Movements, p. 261, Routledge, 2006 On January 24, 1986, L. Ron Hubbard died at his ranch in Creston, California. David Miscavige emerged as the new head of the organization. Splinter groups: Independent Scientology, Freezone, and Miscavige's RTC Hubbard's beliefs and practices, drawn from a diverse set of sources, influenced numerous offshoots, splinter-groups, and new movements. While Scientology generally refers to Miscavige-led Church of Scientology, other groups practice Scientology. These groups, collectively known as Independent Scientologists, consist of former members of the official Church of Scientology as well as entirely new members. In 1950, founding member Joseph Winter cut ties with Hubbard and set up a private Dianetics practice in New York. In 1965, a longtime Church member and \\"Doctor of Scientology\\" Jack Horner (born 1927), dissatisfied with the Church's \\"ethics\\" program, developed Dianology. Capt. Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the movement in the early 1980s. The church labels these groups \\"squirrels\\" (Scientology jargon) and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure. On January 1, 1982, Miscavige established the Religious Technology Center (RTC). On November 11, 1982, the Free Zone was established by top Scientologists in disagreement with RTC.William W. Zellner Extraordinary Groups, p. 295, Macmillan, 2007 The Free Zone Association was founded and registered under the laws of Germany, and espouses the doctrine that the official Church of Scientology led by David Miscavige has departed from Hubbard's original philosophy. The Advanced Ability Center was established by Hubbard's personal auditor David Mayo after February 1983 – a time when some of Scientology's upper and middle management split with Miscavige's organization.Nordhausen & Billerbeck (2008), pp. 469–470 More recently, high-profile defectors Mark Rathbun and Mike Rinder have championed the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church. Beliefs and practices According to Scientology, its beliefs and practices are based on rigorous research, and its doctrines are accorded a significance equivalent to scientific laws. Scientology cosmology is, however, at odds with modern science, with claims of memories going back \\"76 trillion years,\\" much longer than the age of the universe. Blind belief is held to be of lesser significance than the practical application of Scientologist methods. Adherents are encouraged to validate the practices through their personal experience. Hubbard put it this way: \\"For a Scientologist, the final test of any knowledge he has gained is, 'did the data and the use of it in life actually improve conditions or didn't it? He defined Scientology's aims as: \\"A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war; where the world can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology\\". He described Scientology as an \\"applied religious philosophy\\" because, according to him, it consists of a metaphysical doctrine, a theory of psychology, and teachings in morality. The core of Scientology teaching lies in the belief that \\"each human has a reactive mind that responds to life's traumas, clouding the analytic mind and keeping us from experiencing reality.\\" Scientologists undergo auditing to discover sources of this trauma, believing that re-experiencing it neutralizes it and reinforces the ascendancy of the analytic mind, with the final goal believed to be achieving a spiritual state that Scientology calls \\"clear\\".  Theological doctrine  Scientology does not preach or impose a particular idea of God on Scientologists. Rather, people are expected to discover the truth through their own observations as their awareness advances. > ... the Church of Scientology has no set dogma concerning God that it > imposes on its members. As with all its tenets, Scientology does not ask > individuals to accept anything on faith alone. Rather, as one's level of > spiritual awareness increases through participation in Scientology auditing > and training, one attains his own certainty of every dynamic. Accordingly, > only when the Seventh Dynamic (spiritual) is reached in its entirety will > one discover and come to a full understanding of the Eighth Dynamic > (infinity) and one's relationship to the Supreme Being. Many Scientologists avoid using the words \\"belief\\" or \\"faith\\" to describe how Hubbard's teachings impacts their lives. They perceive that Scientology is based on verifiable technologies, speaking to Hubbard's original scientific objectives for Dianetics, based on the quantifiability of auditing on the E-meter. Scientologists call Dianetics and Scientology as technologies because of their claim of their scientific precision and workability. Reactive mind, traumatic memories, and auditing A Scientologist introduces the E-meter to a potential student Scientology presents two major divisions of the mind. The reactive mind is thought to record all pain and emotional trauma, while the analytical mind is a rational mechanism that serves consciousness. The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical (conscious) mind; these are referred to as engrams. According to Scientology, engrams are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity. To avoid this fate is Scientology's basic goal. Some engrams are taught by Hubbard to happen by accident while others are inflicted by \\"thetans who have gone bad and want power\\", as described by the Los Angeles Times. These engrams are named Implants in the doctrine of Scientology. Hubbard said, \\"Implants result in all varieties of illness, apathy, degradation, neurosis and insanity and are the principal cause of these in man.\\" L. Ron Hubbard described the analytical mind in terms of a computer: \\"the analytical mind is not just a good computer, it is a perfect computer.\\" According to him it makes the best decisions based on available data. Errors are made based on erroneous data and is not the error of the analytical mind. Dianetic auditing is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the Clear state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind's engrams and acquiring certainty of his or her reality as a thetan. David V. Barrett, a sociologist of religion who has written widely about the subject, says that according to Scientology, the \\"first major goal is to go Clear.\\" Clearing was described to represent \\"the attainment of Man's dreams through the ages of attaining a new and higher state of existence and freedom from the endless cycle of birth, death, birth … Clear is the total erasure of the reactive mind from which stems all the anxieties and problems the individual has\\". Scientology asserts that people have hidden abilities which have not yet been fully realized.J. Gordon Melton The Encyclopedia of American Religion, p. 224, McGrath Publishing Co., 1978 It teaches that increased spiritual awareness and physical benefits are accomplished through counseling sessions referred to as auditing.Paul Finkelman Religion and American Law, p. 509, Taylor & Francis, 2000 Through auditing, people can solve their problems and free themselves of engrams. This restores them to their natural condition as thetans and enables them to be at cause in their daily lives, responding rationally and creatively to life events rather than reacting to them under the direction of stored engrams. Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of Preclear to Clear and Operating Thetan. Scientology's utopian aim is to \\"clear the planet\\", that is, clear all people in the world of their engrams. Auditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or auditor. It is similar to confession or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice as a pastor or priest of another religion might do. Instead, the auditor's task is to help a person discover and understand the universal principles of affinity, reality, and communication (ARC). Most auditing requires an E-meter, a device that measures minute changes in electrical resistance through the body when a person holds electrodes (metal \\"cans\\"), and a small current is passed through them. Scientology teaches that the E-meter helps to locate spiritual difficulties. Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it to help him or her eliminate the difficulty, and uses the E-meter to confirm that the \\"charge\\" has been dissipated. As the individual progresses up the \\"Bridge to Total Freedom\\", the focus of auditing moves from simple engrams to engrams of increasing complexity and other difficulties. At the more advanced OT levels, Scientologists act as their own auditors (\\"solo auditors\\"). Douglas E. Cowan writes that the e-meter \\"provides an external, material locus for the legitimation of [Scientology] practice\\". Scientologists depend on the \\"appearance of objectivity or empirical validity\\" of the e-meter rather than simply trusting an auditor's abstract interpretation of a participant's statements. He also states that without the e-meter, \\"Scientology could not have achieved whatever status it enjoys as a new religious movement.\\" He also argues that without it, the Church may not have survived the early years when Dianetics was just formed. Emotional Tone Scale and survival Scientology uses an emotional classification system called the tone scale. The tone scale is a tool used in auditing; Scientologists maintain that knowing a person's place on the scale makes it easier to predict his or her actions and assists in bettering his or her condition. Scientology emphasizes the importance of survival, which it subdivides into eight classifications that are referred to as \\"dynamics\\". An individual's desire to survive is considered to be the first dynamic, while the second dynamic relates to procreation and family. The remaining dynamics encompass wider fields of action, involving groups, mankind, all life, the physical universe, the spirit, and infinity, often associated with the Supreme Being. The optimum solution to any problem is believed to be the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics. Toxins and purification The Purification Rundown is a controversial \\"detoxification\\" program used by the Church of Scientology as an introductory service. It features high-dose dietary supplements and extended time in a sauna (up to five hours a day for five weeks). The Church of Scientology claims it is the only effective way to deal with the long-term effects of drug abuse or toxic exposure. Narconon is a \\"drug education and rehabilitation program\\" founded on Hubbard's beliefs about \\"toxins\\" and \\"purification\\". Narconon is offered in the United States, Canada and a number of European countries; its Purification Program also uses high-dose vitamins and extended sauna sessions, combined with auditing and study. Introspection Rundown The Introspection Rundown is a controversial Church of Scientology auditing process that is intended to handle a psychotic episode or complete mental breakdown. Introspection is defined for the purpose of this rundown as a condition where the person is \\"looking into one's own mind, feelings, reactions, etc.\\"Technical Bulletins X Bridge Publications, Inc. (1991) The Introspection Rundown came under public scrutiny after the death of Lisa McPherson in 1995. Rejection of psychology and psychiatry Scientologists on an anti-psychiatry demonstration Scientology is vehemently opposed to psychiatry and psychology. Psychiatry rejected Hubbard's theories in the early 1950s and in 1951, Hubbard's wife Sara consulted doctors who recommended he \\"be committed to a private sanatorium for psychiatric observation and treatment of a mental ailment known as paranoid schizophrenia\\".Miller, p. 184 Thereafter, Hubbard criticized psychiatry as a \\"barbaric and corrupt profession\\". Hubbard taught that psychiatrists were responsible for a great many wrongs in the world, saying that psychiatry has at various times offered itself as a tool of political suppression and \\"that psychiatry spawned the ideology which fired Hitler's mania, turned the Nazis into mass murderers, and created the Holocaust\\". Hubbard created the anti- psychiatry organization Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), which operates Psychiatry: An Industry of Death, an anti-psychiatry museum. From 1969, CCHR has campaigned in opposition to psychiatric treatments, electroconvulsive shock therapy, lobotomy, and drugs such as Ritalin and Prozac. According to the official church website, \\"the effects of medical and psychiatric drugs, whether painkillers, tranquilizers or 'antidepressants', are as disastrous\\" as illegal drugs. Body and thetan Scientology beliefs revolve around the immortal soul, the thetan.Carl G. Liungman Symbols, p. 297, Ionfox AB, 2004 Scientology teaches that the thetan is the true identity of a person – an intrinsically good, omniscient, non-material core capable of unlimited creativity. Hubbard taught that thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure. The universe has no independent reality but derives its apparent reality from the fact that thetans agree it exists. Thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation rather than their original state of spiritual purity. Eventually they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers. As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings. Thetans are reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called \\"assumption\\", which is analogous to reincarnation. Scientology posits a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one's present life, and with each rebirth, the effects of the MEST universe (MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time) on the thetan become stronger. Space opera and the Wall of Fire Panorama The Church of Scientology holds that at the higher levels of initiation (\\"OT levels\\"), mystical teachings are imparted that may be harmful to unprepared readers. These teachings are kept secret from members who have not reached these levels. The church says that the secrecy is warranted to keep its materials' use in context and to protect its members from being exposed to materials they are not yet prepared for. These are the OT levels, the levels above Clear, whose contents are guarded within Scientology. The OT level teachings include accounts of various cosmic catastrophes that befell the thetans. Hubbard described these early events collectively as \\"space opera\\". In the OT levels, Hubbard explains how to reverse the effects of past-life trauma patterns that supposedly extend millions of years into the past. Among these advanced teachings is the story of Xenu (sometimes Xemu), introduced as the tyrant ruler of the \\"Galactic Confederacy\\". According to this story, 75 million years ago Xenu brought billions of people to Earth in spacecraft resembling Douglas DC-8 airliners, stacked them around volcanoes and detonated hydrogen bombs in the volcanoes. The thetans then clustered together, stuck to the bodies of the living, and continue to do this today. Scientologists at advanced levels place considerable emphasis on isolating body thetans and neutralizing their ill effects. Another link: Carnegie-Mellon University Excerpts and descriptions of OT materials were published online by a former member in 1995 and then circulated in mainstream media. This occurred after the teachings were submitted as evidence in court cases involving Scientology, thus becoming a matter of public record. There are eight publicly known OT levels, OT I to VIII.Derek Davis New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America, pp. 45–47, Baylor University Press, 2004 The highest level, OT VIII, is disclosed only at sea on the Scientology cruise ship Freewinds. It has been rumored that additional OT levels, said to be based on material written by Hubbard long ago, will be released at some appropriate point in the future. A large Church of Spiritual Technology symbol carved into the ground at Scientology's Trementina Base is visible from the air.Coordinates of Trementina Base Washington Post reporter Richard Leiby wrote, \\"Former Scientologists familiar with Hubbard's teachings on reincarnation say the symbol marks a 'return point' so loyal staff members know where they can find the founder's works when they travel here in the future from other places in the universe.\\" Scientology cruise ship Freewinds Ethics, suppressives, and disconnection The Ethics system regulates member behavior, and Ethics officers are present in every Scientology organization. Ethics officers ensure \\"correct application of Scientology technology\\" and deal with \\"behavior adversely affecting a Scientology organization's performance\\", ranging from \\"Errors\\" and \\"Misdemeanors\\" to \\"Crimes\\" and \\"Suppressive Acts\\", as those terms defined by Scientology. Scientology asserts some people are truly malevolent, and Hubbard taught 20 percent of the population were suppressive persons, which includes some hopelessly antisocial personalities who are the truly dangerous individuals in humanity: \\"the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords\\". Scientology disconnection policy prohibits most contact with Suppressive Persons. The church denies that a disconnection policy exists, and quotes Hubbard's definition of disconnection as \\"a self-determined decision made by an individual that he is not going to be connected to another\\". A Scientologist who communicates with a suppressive person risks being declared a Potential Trouble Source. Defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons, and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors. Fair game The term Fair Game is used to describe policies and practices carried out against people the Church perceives as its enemies. Hubbard established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization. Individuals or groups who are \\"Fair Game\\" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible. Hubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a program of illegal infiltration of the IRS and other U.S. government agencies during the 1970s. They also conducted private investigations, character assassination and legal action against the Church's critics in the media. The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology, 212 Cal. App. 3d 872 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1989)Frank K. Flinn testimony in Church of Scientology of California, 1984, vol.23, pp.4032–4160Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California, Court of Appeal of the State of California, civ.no. B023193, July 18, 1989  Scientology ceremonies  In Scientology, ceremonies for events such as weddings, child naming, and funerals are observed. Friday services are held to commemorate the completion of a person's religious services during the prior week. Ordained Scientology ministers may perform such rites. However, these services and the clergy who perform them play only a minor role in Scientologists' religious lives.  The arts  Hubbard theorized in 1951 that the \\"aesthetic mind\\" is a phase of mental activity that \\"deals with the nebulous field of art and creation\\". In August 1965, Hubbard published the book Art that defines art as \\"a word which summarizes the quality of communication\\". He also claimed that art is \\"the least codified of human endeavors and the most misunderstood\\". The book is used as a textbook for art courses in Scientology.

Accessed November 8, 2007. The incomplete Super Power Building of the FLAG Scientology complex in Clearwater, Florida The internal structure of Scientology organizations is strongly bureaucratic with a focus on statistics- based management. Organizational operating budgets are performance-related and subject to frequent reviews. Membership statistics Scientology center in New York City A 2001 survey estimated that 55,000 people in the United States claimed to be Scientologists. Worldwide estimates of Scientology's core practicing membership ranges between 100,000 and 200,000, mostly in the U.S., Europe, South Africa and Australia. The 2008 American Religious Identification Survey found that the number of American Scientologists had dropped to 25,000. A 2008 Trinity College survey concluded there were only 25,000 American Scientologists. Scientology is also declining in the United Kingdom. In 2011, high-level defector Jeff Hawkins estimated there were 40,000 Scientologists worldwide. Although the Church of Scientology claims to be the fastest growing religious movement on Earth, the church's estimates of its membership numbers are reportedly significantly exaggerated. Sea Org The highest ranking people in the Scientology hierarchy are the members of the Sea Organization, or Sea Org. The organization includes some 5,000 of Scientology's most dedicated adherents, who work for low pay, and sign a billion-year contract. Rehabilitation Project Force The Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) is a controversial part of the Scientology \\"justice\\" system. When Sea Org members are found guilty of a violation, they are assigned to the RPF. The RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep. Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley state that scholars and observers have come to radically different conclusions about the RPF and whether it is \\"voluntary or coercive, therapeutic or punitive\\". Office of Special Affairs The Office of Special Affairs or OSA (formerly the Guardian's Office) is a department of the Church of Scientology which has been characterized as a non-state intelligence agency.Wakefield, Margery Understanding ScientologyCisar, Joe (translator) The Guardian Office (GO)Hamburg Regional Office of the German Constitutional Security Agency Der Geheimdienst der Scientology-Organisation – Grundlagen, Aufgaben, Strukturen, Methoden und Ziele – Zweite Auflage, Stand 06.05.1998\\" It has targeted critics of the Church for \\"dead agent\\" operations, which is mounting character assassination operations against perceived enemies.Scientologists pay for libel, Clare Dyer, The Guardian, June 9, 1999. The Church of Spiritual Technology ranch in Creston, California, where Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard spent his last days. A Scientology-related symbol is visible within a racetrack. A 1990 article in the Los Angeles Times reported that in the 1980s the church more commonly used private investigators, including former and current Los Angeles police officers, to give themselves a layer of protection in case embarrassing tactics were used and became public. Church of Spiritual Technology The Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) has been described as \\"most secret organization in all of Scientology\\". The organization owns the copyrights to all Scientology materials and the bulk of Hubbard's estate. CST licenses this intellectual property to the Religious Technology Center who then sub-licenses it to Church of Scientology International. The organization also operates the Scientology archiving project, which aims to preserve the works of Hubbard on stainless steel tablets, encased in titanium capsules in specially constructed vaults throughout the world. Shelly Miscavige, wife of leader David Miscavige, who hasn't been seen in public since 2007, is said to be held at a CST compound in Twin Peaks, California. Franchises and advanced organizations Many Scientologists' first contact with Scientology is through local informal groups and field auditors practicing Dianetics counseling. In addition to these, Scientology operates hundreds of Churches and Missions around the world. This is where Scientologists receive introductory training, and it is at this local level that most Scientologists participate. Churches and Missions are licensed franchises; they may offer services for a fee provided they contribute a proportion of their income and comply with the Religious Technology Center (RTC) and its standards. Operating Thetan levels are offered only at Scientology's Advanced Organizations (Los Angeles, Sydney, East Grinstead and Copenhagen). The Flag Service Organization in Clearwater, Florida offers OT levels VI and VII. The Scientology ship Freewinds offers OT VIII. Celebrity Centers In 1955, Hubbard created a list of 63 celebrities targeted for conversion to Scientology. In a church policy letter in 1973, L. Ron Hubbard wrote, \\"The purpose of [the] Celebrity Centre is, to forward the expansion and popularization of Scientology through the arts.\\" Scientology operates eight churches that are designated Celebrity Centres, designed to minister to celebrity Scientologists. The largest of these is in Hollywood, California, called Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International. The Celebrity Centre International was the first one that was opened in 1969 and its opening is celebrated the first week of August each year in an evening gala.Melton, J. Gordon, Ed. \\"Celebrity Centre International (First Week of August)\\". Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays, Festivals, Solemn Observances, and Spiritual Commemorations. Vol. 1.

Former silent-screen star Gloria Swanson and actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta have spoken publicly about their commitment to Scientology, as has actress and musician Juliette Lewis. Scientology tech in jails and prisons, schools, and management Church of Scientology of Tampa, Florida Several Scientology organizations promote the use of Scientology practices as a means to solve social problems. Scientology began to focus on these issues in the early 1970s, led by Hubbard. The church developed outreach programs to fight drug addiction, illiteracy, learning disabilities and criminal behavior. These have been presented to schools, businesses and communities as secular techniques based on Hubbard's writings. The Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE) acts as an umbrella organization for these efforts. Notable examples include: * Narconon is a Scientology organization promoting the theories of founder L. Ron Hubbard regarding substance abuse treatment and addiction. * Criminon, an offshoot of Narconon, introduces Scientology practices to criminal offenders. * Applied Scholastics, founded in 1972, teaches Scientology \\"study tech\\" to K-12 students. Delphi Schools operates numerous private schools throughout the United States, including the flagship academy The Delphian School in Yamhill County, Oregon. * The World Institute of Scientology Enterprises (WISE) applies Scientology practices to business management. The most prominent training supplier to make use of Hubbard's technology is Sterling Management Systems. * The Way to Happiness Foundation promotes a moral code written by Hubbard, to date translated into more than 40 languages. Volunteer ministers The Church of Scientology began its \\"Volunteer Ministers\\" program as a way to participate in community outreach projects. Volunteer Ministers sometimes travel to the scenes of major disasters in order to provide assistance with relief efforts. According to critics, these relief efforts consist of passing out copies of a pamphlet authored by Hubbard entitled The Way to Happiness, and engaging in a method said to calm panicked or injured individuals known in Scientology as a \\"touch assist\\". Accounts of the Volunteer Ministers' effectiveness have been mixed, and touch assists are not supported by scientific evidence. Other entities Other Scientology-related organizations include: * International Association of Scientologists (IAS) - Scientology membership organization. * The National Commission on Law Enforcement and Social Justice - Opposes what it describes as abusive practices by government and police agencies, especially Interpol. * Scientologists Taking Action Against Discrimination (STAND) - Organization which does public relations for Scientology and Scientologists. Assets According to leaked tax documents, the Church of Scientology International and Church of Spiritual Technology in the US had a combined $1.7 Billion in assets in 2012, in addition to annual revenues estimated at $200 million a year. This does not include assets and revenue of International Association of Scientologists. Controversies Office for the Protection of the Constitution on (from left to right) Islamic extremism, Scientology, and organized crime. \\"Several states published pamphlets about Scientology (and other religious groups) that detailed the Church's ideology and practices. States defended the practice by noting their responsibility to respond to citizens' requests for information about Scientology as well as other subjects. While many of the pamphlets were factual and relatively unbiased, some warned of alleged dangers posed by Scientology to the political order, to the free market economic system, and to the mental and financial well being of individuals. Beyond the Government's actions, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church have been public opponents of Scientology. Evangelical 'Commissioners for Religious and Ideological Issues' have been particularly active in this regard.\\" The Church of Scientology is one of the most controversial religious organizations. A first point of controversy was its challenge of the psychotherapeutic establishment. Another was a 1991 Time magazine article that attacked the church, which responded with a major lawsuit that was rejected by the court as baseless early in 1992. And a third is its religious status in the United States, formalized when the IRS granted the organization tax-exempt status in 1993. It has been in conflict with the governments and police forces of many countries (including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany). It has been one of the most litigious religious movements in history, filing countless lawsuits against governments, organizations and individuals. Reports and allegations have been made, by journalists, courts, and governmental bodies of several countries, that the Church of Scientology is an unscrupulous commercial enterprise that harasses its critics and brutally exploits its members. A considerable amount of investigation has been aimed at the church, by groups ranging from the media to governmental agencies. The controversies involving the church and its critics, some of them ongoing, include: * Criminal behavior by members of the Church, including the infiltration of the US Government. * Organized harassment of people perceived as enemies of the Church. * Scientology's disconnection policy, in which some members are required to shun friends or family members who are \\"antagonistic\\" to the Church. * The death of Scientologist Lisa McPherson while in the care of the church. (Robert Minton sponsored the multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Scientology for the death of McPherson. In May 2004, McPherson's estate and the Church of Scientology reached a confidential settlement.) * Attempts to legally force search engines to censor information critical of the Church. * Allegations the Church leader David Miscavige beats and demoralizes staff, and that physical violence by superiors towards staff working for them is a common occurrence in the church. Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis denied these claims and provided witnesses to rebut them. Scientology social programs such as drug and criminal rehabilitation have likewise drawn both support and criticism. Stephen A. Kent, a professor of sociology, has said that \\"Scientologists see themselves as possessors of doctrines and skills that can save the world, if not the galaxy.\\" As stated in Scientology doctrine: \\"The whole agonized future of this planet, every man, woman and child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology.\\"Hubbard, L.R. (1965): Keeping Scientology working (Series 1), page 7. The Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter, titled Keeping Scientology Working Series 1, was included in the attached documents submitted to the IRS in 1993. Available from Xenu.net: Kent has described Scientology's ethics system as \\"a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefited [the Church of Scientology] ... In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people's interests in things other than Scientology.\\"; Kent cites Hubbard, L. Ron (1976a). Modern Management Technology Defined. Copenhagen, New Era Publications Many former members have come forward to speak out about the Church and the negative effects its teachings have had on them, including celebrities such as Leah Remini. Remini spoke about her split from the Church, saying that she still has friends within the organization whom she is no longer able to speak with.Eggenberger, Nicole (September 10, 2013). \\"Leah Remini Tells Ellen DeGeneres She 'Lost Friends\\"'After Leaving Scientology\\". US Weekly. Criminal behavior Author Paulette Cooper was indicted for making bomb threats after she was framed by agents of the Church of Scientology. Much of the controversy surrounding Scientology stems from the criminal convictions of core members of the Scientology organization. In 1978, a number of Scientologists, including L. Ron Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard (who was second in command in the organization at the time), were convicted of perpetrating what was at the time the largest incident of domestic espionage in the history of the United States, called \\"Operation Snow White\\". This involved infiltrating, wiretapping, and stealing documents from the offices of Federal attorneys and the Internal Revenue Service. L. Ron Hubbard was convicted in absentia by French authorities of engaging in fraud and sentenced to four years in prison. The head of the French Church of Scientology was convicted at the same trial and given a suspended one-year prison sentence.Catholic Sentinel, March 17, 1978 An FBI raid on the Church's headquarters revealed documentation that detailed Scientology's criminal actions against various critics of the organization. In \\"Operation Freakout\\", agents of the church attempted to destroy Paulette Cooper, author of The Scandal of Scientology, an early book that had been critical of the movement. Original (18M) Among these documents was a plan to frame Gabe Cazares, the mayor of Clearwater, Florida, with a staged hit-and-run accident. Nine individuals related to the case were prosecuted on charges of theft, burglary, conspiracy, and other crimes. In 1988, Scientology president Heber Jentzsch and ten other members of the organization were arrested in Spain on various charges including illicit association, coercion, fraud, and labor law violations. In October 2009, the Church of Scientology was found guilty of organized fraud in France., Reuters, October 27, 2009 The sentence was confirmed by appeal court in February 2012., AFP, February 2, 2012 In 2012, Belgian prosecutors indicted Scientology as a criminal organization engaged in fraud and extortion. In March 2016, the Church of Scientology was acquitted of all charges, and demands to close its Belgian branch and European headquarters were dismissed. Organized harassment Scientology has historically engaged in hostile action toward its critics; executives within the organization have proclaimed that Scientology is \\"not a turn-the-other-cheek religion\\". Journalists, politicians, former Scientologists and various anti- cult groups have made accusations of wrongdoing against Scientology since the 1960s, and Scientology has targeted these critics – almost without exception – for retaliation, in the form of lawsuits and public counter-accusations of personal wrongdoing. Many of Scientology's critics have also reported they were subject to threats and harassment in their private lives. According to a 1990 Los Angeles Times article, Scientology had largely switched from using church members to using private investigators, including former and current Los Angeles police officers, as this gives the church a layer of protection in case investigators use tactics embarrassing to the church. In one case, the church described their tactics as \\"LAPD sanctioned\\", which was energetically disputed by Police Chief Daryl Gates. The officer involved in this particular case of surveillance and harassment was suspended for six months.On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes, Los Angeles Times, Joel Sappell, Robert W. Welkes, page A1, June 29, 1990. This story is also available on the Carnegie Mellon University library website as \\"Part 6: Attack the Attacker, On the Offensive . . . \\" Journalist John Sweeney reported that \\"While making our BBC Panorama film Scientology and Me I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a 'bigot' by star Scientologists, brain-washed—that is how it felt to me—in a mock up of a Nazi-style torture chamber and chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers\\". Violation of auditing confidentiality Scientology E-Meter During the auditing process, the auditor collects and records personal information from the client. While the Church of Scientology claims to protect the confidentiality of auditing records, the Church has a history of attacking and psychologically abusing former members using information culled from the records. For example, a December 16, 1969, a Guardian's Office order (G. O. 121669) by Mary Sue Hubbard explicitly authorized the use of auditing records for purposes of \\"internal security\\".Breckenridge, Memorandum of Intended Decision in Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong, Superior Court, Los Angeles County, case no. C420153. quoted in Former members report having participated in combing through information obtained in auditing sessions to see if it could be used for smear campaigns against critics. Disconnection The practice of shunning in Scientology is termed \\"disconnection\\". Members can disconnect from any person they already know, including existing family members. Many examples of this policy's application have been established in court.Judgement of Mr Justice Latey, Re: B & G (Minors) (Custody) Delivered in the High Court (Family Division), London, July 23, 1984 Failure to disconnect from a Suppressive Person is itself labeled a Suppressive act. Allegation of coerced abortions Protester against Scientology, holding a sign which reads: \\"What kind of church makes its staff have abortions\\" The Sea Org originally operated on vessels at sea where it was understood that it was not permitted to raise children on board the ships. Pregnant women in the Sea Org have stated that they had been pressured to undergo abortions. Sea Org members were reportedly shown secret writings by L. Ron Hubbard to convince them that having an abortion was not against Scientology practices. In 2003, The Times of India reported \\"Forced abortions, beatings, starvation are considered tools of discipline in this church\\". A former high-ranking source reports that \\"some 1,500 abortions\\" have been \\"carried out by women in the Sea Organization since the implementation of a rule in the late 80s that members could not remain in the organization if they decided to have children\\". The source noted that \\"And if members who have been in the Sea Organization for, say, 10 years do decide to have kids, they are dismissed with no more than $1,000\\" as a severance package. Many former members have claimed they were pressured to undergo abortion. A protester holds a sign which reads: \\"C[hurch] o[f] $[cientology] forces its female members to get abortions\\" (February 10, 2008) Longtime member Astra Woodcraft reportedly \\"left Scientology for good when the church tried to pressure her to have an abortion\\". Former Sea Org member Karen Pressley recounted that she was often asked by fellow Scientologists for loans so that they could get an abortion and remain in the Sea Org. Scientology employee Claire Headley has claimed she \\"was forced to have (two) abortions to keep her job and was subjected to violations of personal rights and liberties for the purpose of obtaining forced labor\\". Laura Ann DeCrescenzo reported she was \\"coerced to have an abortion\\" as a minor. In March 2009, Maureen Bolstad reported that women who worked at Scientology's headquarters were forced to have abortions, or faced being declared a \\"Suppressive Person\\" by the organization's management. In March 2010, former Scientologist Janette Lang stated that at age 20 she became pregnant by her boyfriend while in the organization, and her boyfriend's Scientology supervisors \\"coerced them into terminating the pregnancy\\". \\"We fought for a week, I was devastated, I felt abused, I was lost and eventually I gave in. It was my baby, my body and my choice, and all of that was taken away from me by Scientology,\\" said Lang. Australian Senator Nick Xenophon gave a speech to the Australian Parliament in November 2009, about statements he had received from former Scientologists. He said that he had been told members of the organization had coerced pregnant female employees to have abortions. \\"I am deeply concerned about this organisation and the devastating impact it can have on its followers,\\" said Senator Xenophon, and he requested that the Australian Senate begin an investigation into Scientology. According to the letters presented by Senator Xenophon, the organization was involved in \\"ordering\\" its members to have abortions. Former Scientologist Aaron Saxton sent a letter to Senator Xenophon stating he had participated in coercing pregnant women within the organization to have abortions. \\"Aaron says women who fell pregnant were taken to offices and bullied to have an abortion. If they refused, they faced demotion and hard labour. Aaron says one staff member used a coat hanger and self-aborted her child for fear of punishment,\\" said Senator Xenophon. Carmel Underwood, another former Scientologist, said she had been put under \\"extreme pressure\\" to have an abortion, and that she was placed into a \\"disappearing programme\\", after refusing. Underwood was the executive director of Scientology's branch in Sydney, Australia. Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis dismissed such claims as \\"utterly meritless\\". Mike Ferriss, the head of Scientology in New Zealand, told media that \\"There are no forced abortions in Scientology\\". Scientology spokesperson Virginia Stewart likewise rejected the claims and asserted \\"The Church of Scientology considers the family unit and children to be of the utmost importance and does not condone nor force anyone to undertake any medical procedure whatsoever.\\" Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women A number of women have sued the Church of Scientology, alleging a variety of complaints including human trafficking, rape, forced labor, and child abuse. Scientology, litigation, and the Internet In the 1990s, Miscavige's organization took action against increased criticism of Scientology on the Internet and online distribution of Scientology-related documents. Starting in 1991, Scientology filed fifty lawsuits against Scientology-critic Cult Awareness Network (CAN). Many of the suits were dismissed, but one resulted in $2 million in losses, bankrupting the network. At bankruptcy, CAN's name and logo were obtained by a Scientologist. A New Cult Awareness Network was set up with Scientology backing, which operates as an information and networking center for non-traditional religions, referring callers to academics and other experts. In a 1993 U.S. lawsuit brought by the Church of Scientology against Steven Fishman, a former member of the Church, Fishman made a court declaration which included several dozen pages of formerly secret esoterica detailing aspects of Scientologist cosmogony. As a result of the litigation, this material, normally strictly safeguarded and used only in Scientology's more advanced \\"OT levels\\", found its way onto the Internet. This resulted in a battle between the Church of Scientology and its online critics over the right to disclose this material, or safeguard its confidentiality. The Church of Scientology was forced to issue a press release acknowledging the existence of this cosmogony, rather than allow its critics \\"to distort and misuse this information for their own purposes\\". Even so, the material, notably the story of Xenu, has since been widely disseminated and used to caricature Scientology, despite the Church's vigorous program of copyright litigation. In January 1995, church lawyer Helena Kobrin attempted to shut down the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology by sending a control message instructing Usenet servers to delete the group.Wendy Grossman Net.wars, p. 77, NYU Press, 1997 In practice, this rmgroup message had little effect, since most Usenet servers are configured to disregard such messages when sent to groups that receive substantial traffic, and newgroup messages were quickly issued to recreate the group on those servers that did not do so. However, the issuance of the message led to a great deal of public criticism by free-speech advocates.Steven Vedro Digital Dharma, p. 190, Quest Books, 2007 Mike Godwin Cyber Rights, p. 219, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 2003 Among the criticisms raised, one suggestion is that Scientology's true motive is to suppress the free speech of its critics.Catharine Cookson Encyclopedia of Religious Freedom, p. 432, Taylor & Francis, 2003 Wendy Grossman Net.wars, p. 90, New York University Press, 1997 Anonymous' held protests outside Scientology centers in cities around the world in February 2008 as part of Project Chanology. Issues they protested ranged from alleged abuse of followers to the validity of its claims to qualify as a state- sponsored religion., Los Angeles Times, February 11, 2008. The Church also began filing lawsuits against those who posted copyrighted texts on the newsgroup and the World Wide Web, and lobbied for tighter restrictions on copyrights in general. The Church supported the controversial Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act as well as the even more controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Some of the DMCA's provisions (notably the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act) were heavily influenced by Church litigation against US Internet service providers over copyrighted Scientology materials that had been posted or uploaded through their servers. Beginning in the middle of 1996 and ensuing for several years, the newsgroup was attacked by anonymous parties using a tactic dubbed sporgery by some, in the form of hundreds of thousands of forged spam messages posted on the group. Some investigators said that some spam had been traced to church members.Christopher Lueg From Usenet to CoWebs, p. 37, Springer, 2003 Wendy Grossman Net.wars, pp. 74–76, NYU Press, 1997 Former Scientologist Tory Christman later asserted that the Office of Special Affairs had undertaken a concerted effort to destroy alt.religion.scientology through these means; the effort failed. On January 14, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Tom Cruise was leaked to the Internet and uploaded to YouTube. The Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube requesting the removal of the video. Subsequently, the group Anonymous voiced its criticism of Scientology and began attacking the Church. Calling the action by the Church of Scientology a form of Internet censorship, participants of Anonymous coordinated Project Chanology, consisting a series of denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites, prank calls, and black faxes to Scientology centers. On January 21, 2008, Anonymous announced its intentions via a video posted to YouTube entitled \\"Message to Scientology\\", and a press release declaring a \\"war\\" against the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center. In the press release, the group stated that the attacks against the Church of Scientology would continue in order to protect the freedom of speech, and end what they saw as the financial exploitation of church members. A protester criticizes Scientology On January 28, 2008, an Anonymous video appeared on YouTube calling for protests outside Church of Scientology centers on February 10, 2008. According to a letter Anonymous e-mailed to the press, about 7,000 people protested in more than 90 cities worldwide. Many protesters wore masks based on the character V from V for Vendetta (who was influenced by Guy Fawkes) or otherwise disguised their identities, in part to protect themselves from reprisals from the Church of Scientology. Many further protests have followed since then in cities around the world. The Arbitration Committee of the Wikipedia internet encyclopedia decided in May 2009 to restrict access to its site from Church of Scientology IP addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by Scientologists. A \\"host of anti-Scientologist editors\\" were topic- banned as well. The committee concluded that both sides had \\"gamed policy\\" and resorted to \\"battlefield tactics\\", with articles on living persons being the \\"worst casualties\\". Disputes over legal status thumb|upright|A Scientology Center on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California The legal status of Scientology or Scientology-related organizations differs between jurisdictions.Alan Aldridge Religion in the Contemporary World, p. 20, Polity, 2007 Scientology was legally recognized as a tax-exempt religion in South Africa, Australia,High Court of Australia Sweden, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain. Scientology was granted tax-exempt status in the United States in 1993. \\"Scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the United States.\\"Toomey, Shamus (June 26, 2005). TomKat' casts spotlight back on Scientology.\\", Chicago Sun-Times The organization is considered a cult in Chile and an \\"anticonstitutional sect\\" in Germany, and is considered a cult (French secte) by some French public authorities. The church argues that Scientology is a genuine religious movement that has been misrepresented, maligned, and persecuted.. \\"Being a religion is one of the most important issues of Scientology's current self-representation.\\" The Church of Scientology has pursued an extensive public relations campaign for the recognition of Scientology as a tax-exempt religion in the various countries in which it exists. Scientology has often encountered opposition due to its strong-arm tactics directed against critics and members wishing to leave the organization. A number of governments regard the Church as a religious organization entitled to tax-exempt status, while other governments variously classify it as a business, cult, pseudoreligion, or criminal organization. In 1957, the Church of Scientology of California was granted tax-exempt status by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and so, for a time, were other local churches. In 1958 however, the IRS started a review of the appropriateness of this status. In 1959, Hubbard moved to England, remaining there until the mid-1960s. In the mid-sixties, the Church of Scientology was banned in several Australian states, starting with Victoria in 1965. The ban was based on the Anderson Report, which found that the auditing process involved \\"command\\" hypnosis, in which the hypnotist assumes \\"positive authoritative control\\" over the patient. On this point the report stated, > It is the firm conclusion of this Board that most scientology and dianetic > techniques are those of authoritative hypnosis and as such are dangerous ... > the scientific evidence which the Board heard from several expert witnesses > of the highest repute ... leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is > only in name that there is any difference between authoritative hypnosis and > most of the techniques of scientology. Many scientology techniques are in > fact hypnotic techniques, and Hubbard has not changed their nature by > changing their names. The Australian Church was forced to operate under the name of the \\"Church of the New Faith\\" as a result, the name and practice of Scientology having become illegal in the relevant states. Several years of court proceedings aimed at overturning the ban followed. In 1973, state laws banning Scientology were overturned in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. In 1983 the High Court of Australia ruled in a unanimous decision that the Church of Scientology was \\"undoubtedly a religion and deserving of tax exemption\\". In 1967, the IRS removed Scientology's tax-exempt status, asserting that its activities were commercial and operated for the benefit of Hubbard, rather than for charitable or religious purposes. The decision resulted in a process of litigation that was settled in the Church's favor a quarter of a century later, the longest case of litigation in IRS history. Scientology as a religion Scientology is officially recognized as a religion in the United States. Recognition came in 1993,Phillip Lucas New Religious Movements in the 21st Century, p. 235, Routledge, 2004 when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stated that \\"[Scientology is] operated exclusively for religious and charitable purposes.\\"\\"Recognition was based upon voluminous information provided by the Church regarding its financial and other operations to the Internal Revenue Service.\\" IRS press release December 31, 1997 . Retrieved August 13, 2007. Scientology was again recognized as a religion by the U.S. courts when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in Headley v. Church of Scientology International in 2012. The New York Times noted in this connection that the Church of Scientology had funded a campaign which included a whistle-blower organization to publicly attack the IRS, as well as hiring of private investigators to look into the private lives of IRS officials. In 1991, Miscavige, the highest-ranking Scientology leader, arranged a meeting with Fred T. Goldberg Jr., the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service at the time. The meeting was an \\"opportunity for the church to offer to end its long dispute with the agency, including the dozens of suits brought against the IRS\\". The committee met several times with the Scientology legal team and \\"was persuaded that those involved in the Snow White crimes had been purged, that church money was devoted to tax-exempt purposes and that, with Mr. Hubbard's death, no one was getting rich from Scientology.\\" In August 1993, a settlement was reached; the church would receive its tax-exempt status and end its legal actions against the IRS and its personnel. The church was required only to resubmit new applications for exemption to the IRS Exempt Organizations (EO) division, which was told \\"not to consider any substantive matters\\" because those issues had been resolved by the committee. The secret agreement was announced on October 13, 1993, with the IRS refusing to disclose any of the terms or the reasoning behind the decision. Both the IRS and Scientology rejected any allegations that foul play or undue pressure had been used on IRS officials, insisting that the decision had been based on the merits of the case. IRS officials \\"insisted that Scientology's tactics had not affected the decision\\" and that \\"ultimately the decision was made on a legal basis\\". Miscavige claims that the IRS's examination of Scientology was the most exhaustive review of any non-profit organization in history. Elsewhere, Scientology is recognized as a religion in Australia,: \\"After doing a thorough analysis, the [High] Court [of Australia] stated unequivocally that Scientology met the criteria establishing itself as a religion, and therefore should be granted exempt status for tax purposes. The Court went on to state that a religion did not have to be theistic, and that a religion involved both belief and behavior ... This case is still the leading case in Australia defining religion, and is cited in other courts and countries as well.\\" Portugal,: \\"In November the government officially recognized Scientology as a religion.\\" Spain,: \\"Un tribunal administrativo de la Audiencia Nacional de Madrid, máxima instancia judicial española, aceptó un recurso interpuesto por ese movimiento fundado en 1954 por el autor de ciencia ficción Lafayette Ron Hubbard (1911–1986), para ser inscripto en el registro de los movimientos religiosos del país.\\" Slovenia, Sweden,: \\"on March 13, 2000, the Church of Scientology was registered as a religious community by the National Judicial Board for Public Lands and Funds following a new law, titled the Act on Religious Communities ..., which took on effect on January 1, 2000, with the separation of the Church of Sweden from the state. On June 10, 2000, the first legal Scientology wedding in Europe was celebrated in Stockholm.\\" Croatia, Hungary, 2008-01-09, Le Monde and Kyrgyzstan.: \\"In the past year the State Commission on Religious Affairs (SCRA) also registered the Church of Scientology\\" In New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department classified the Church of Scientology as a charitable organization and stated that its income would be tax exempt. It has gained judicial recognition in Italy, and Scientology officials have won the right to perform marriages in South Africa.Gallagher, Eugene V.; Ashcraft, W. Michael (2006). Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, , p. 185 Scientology is not recognized as a religion in Canada. In the UK, the Charity Commission for England and Wales ruled in 1999 that Scientology was not a religion and refused to register the Church as a charity, although a year later, it was recognized as a not-for-profit body in a separate proceeding by the UK Revenue and Customs and exempted from UK value added tax.Harry Wallop: , Daily Telegraph, August 11, 2006 In December 2013, the United Kingdom's highest court officially recognized Scientology as a religion. The ruling ended a five-year legal battle by Scientologist Louisa Hodkin, who sought the legal right to marry at the Church of Scientology chapel in central London. The opinion by five supreme court justices redefined religion in law, rendering the 1970 definition \\"out of date\\" in restricting religious worship to \\"reverence or veneration of God or of a Supreme Being\\". Scientology as a commercial enterprise Scientology desk near the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin Scientology has been accused of being \\"a business, often given to criminal acts, and sometimes masquerading as a religion\\". In conjunction with the Church of Scientology's request to be officially recognized as a religion in Germany, around 1996 the German state Baden-Württemberg conducted a thorough investigation of the group's activities within Germany.Zur Frage der Beobachtung der Scientology-Organisation durch die Verfassungsschutzbehörden (in German) (PDF format) The results of this investigation indicated that at the time of publication, Scientology's main sources of revenue (\\"Haupteinnahmequellen der SO\\") were from course offerings and sales of their various publications. Course offerings ranged from (German Marks) DM 182.50 to about DM 30,000the equivalent today of approximately $119 to US$19,560. Revenue from monthly, bi-monthly, and other membership offerings could not be estimated in the report, but was nevertheless placed in the millions. Defending its practices against accusations of profiteering, the Church has countered critics by drawing analogies to other religious groups who have established practices such as tithing, or require members to make donations for specific religious services. Since 1997 Germany has considered Scientology to be in conflict with the principles of the nation's constitution. It is seen as an anticonstitutional sect and a new version of political extremism and because there is \\"evidence for intentions against the free democratic basic order\\" it is observed by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. In 1997, an open letter to then-German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune, drew parallels between the \\"organized oppression\\" of Scientologists in Germany and the treatment of Jews in 1930s' Nazi Germany.Schmid, John (January 15, 1997). , Herald Tribune The letter was signed by Dustin Hoffman, Goldie Hawn and a number of other Hollywood celebrities and executives., Washington Post, February 1, 1997Bonfante, Jordan; van Voorst, Bruce (February 10, 1997). \\"\\", Time Commenting on the matter, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State said that Scientologists were discriminated against in Germany, but condemned the comparisons to the Nazis' treatment of Jews as extremely inappropriate, as did a United Nations Special Rapporteur.Staff (April 2, 1998). \\"\\", New York Times Based on the IRS exemptions, the U.S. State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists and began to note Scientologists' complaints of harassment in its annual human rights reports, as well as the annual International Religious Freedom Reports it has released from 1999 onwards. Germany will continue to monitor Scientology's activities in the country, despite continued objection from Scientology which cites such monitoring as abuse of freedom of religion. France and Belgium have not recognized Scientology as a religion, and Stephen A. Kent, writing in 2001, noted that recognition had not been obtained in Ireland, Luxembourg, Israel or Mexico either. Although the Belgian State Prosecution Service recommended that various individuals and organizations associated with Scientology should be prosecuted, the Belgian courts finally decided in March 2016 that Scientology is not a criminal organization. In Greece, Scientology is not recognized as a religion by the Greek government, and multiple applications for religious status have been denied, notably in 2000 and 2003. In the Netherlands, Scientology was granted tax exempt status in October 2013. The status was revoked in October 2015. The court ruled that because auditing fees and course costs were more expensive than most commercial education institutions, Scientology appeared to be aimed at making a profit. Scientology maintains strict control over the use of its symbols, icons, and names. It claims copyright and trademark over its \\"Scientology cross\\", and its lawyers have threatened lawsuits against individuals and organizations who have published the image in books and on Web sites. Because of this, it is very difficult for individual groups to attempt to publicly practice Scientology on their own, independent of the official Church of Scientology. Scientology has filed suit against a number of individuals who have attempted to set up their own auditing practices, using copyright and trademark law to shut these groups down.Plotkin-Wells & Wimmer E-Commerce Law & Business, Section 8.01[2], Aspen Publishers Online, 2003 The Church of Scientology and its many related organizations have amassed considerable real estate holdings worldwide, likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Scientology encourages existing members to \\"sell\\" Scientology to others by paying a commission to those who recruit new members. Scientology franchises, or missions, must pay the Church of Scientology roughly 10% of their gross income. On that basis, it is likened to a pyramid selling scheme. While introductory courses do not cost much, courses at the higher levels may cost several thousand dollars each. As a rule, the great majority of members proceeds up the bridge in a steady rate commensurate with their income. Most recently the Italian Supreme Court agreed with the American IRS that the church's financial system is analogous to the practices of other groups and not out of line with its religious purposes.Melton, J. Gordon (2000). The Church of Scientology. Salt Lake City: Signature Press. In November 2009, Australian Senator Nick Xenophon used a speech in Federal Parliament to allege that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organization. Based on letters from former followers of the religion, he said that there were \\"allegations of forced imprisonment, coerced abortions, and embezzlement of church funds, of physical violence and intimidation, blackmail and the widespread and deliberate abuse of information obtained by the organization\\". Scientology in religious studies Describing the available scholarship on Scientology, David G. Bromley and Douglas E. Cowan stated in 2006 that \\"most scholars have concluded that Scientology falls within the category of religion for the purposes of academic study, and a number have defended the Church in judicial and political proceedings on this basis.\\" Hugh B. Urban writes that \\"Scientology's efforts to get itself defined as a religion make it an ideal case study for thinking about how we understand and define religion.\\"Urban, Hugh B.: The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion Chapman, Mark. Review of Religious Research. 2013. vol. 55. Issue: 1, pp. 203–204 Toward the second decade of the 2000s, a new interest for Scientology emerged among scholars, bringing the subject from obscurity. According to the Encyclopedia of Religious Controversies in the United States, \\"even as Scientology raises questions about how and who gets to define religion, most scholars recognize it as a religion, one that emerges from and builds on American individualism and the spiritual marketplace that dominated 1950s America.\\" David G. Bromley comments that Scientology \\"could gain strength by adding to the new perspective on existence, the hope and human meaning that only a transcendent creed can give\\". Bromley and Cowan noted in 2008 that Scientology's attempts \\"to gain favor with new religion scholars\\" had often been problematic. According to Religious Studies professor Mary Farrell Benarowski, Scientology describes itself as drawing on science, religion, psychology and philosophy but \\"had been claimed by none of them and repudiated, for the most part, by all\\". Regis Dericquesbourg writes about the efficacy of Scientology in imparting knowledge: \\"Scientology indeed not only brings knowledge, it also brings personal introspection through auditing, and transmission in upper levels is not merely reading texts: what is transmitted is experienced through a solo or duo auditing experience.\\" He compared it to psychoanalysis. Frank K. Flinn, adjunct professor of religious studies at Washington University in St. Louis wrote, \\"it is abundantly clear that Scientology has both the typical forms of ceremonial and celebratory worship and its own unique form of spiritual life.\\" Flinn further states that religion requires \\"beliefs in something transcendental or ultimate, practices (rites and codes of behavior) that re-inforce those beliefs and, a community that is sustained by both the beliefs and practices\\", all of which are present within Scientology. Similarly, World Religions in America states that \\"Scientology contains the same elements of most other religions, including myths, scriptures, doctrines, worship, sacred practices and rituals, moral and ethical expectations, a community of believers, clergy, and ecclesiastic organizations.\\" While acknowledging that a number of his colleagues accept Scientology as a religion, sociologist Stephen A. Kent writes: \\"Rather than struggling over whether or not to label Scientology as a religion, I find it far more helpful to view it as a multifaceted transnational corporation, only one element of which is religious\\" [emphasis in the original]. Donna Batten in the Gale Encyclopedia of American Law writes, \\"A belief does not need to be stated in traditional terms to fall within First Amendment protection. For example, Scientology—a system of beliefs that a human being is essentially a free and immortal spirit who merely inhabits a body—does not propound the existence of a supreme being, but it qualifies as a religion under the broad definition propounded by the Supreme Court.\\" J. Gordon Melton asserts that while the debate over definitions of religion will continue, \\"scholars will probably continue in the future to adopt a broad definition, thus including Scientology in a wider religious field.\\" The material contained in the OT levels has been characterized as bad science fiction by critics, while others claim it bears structural similarities to gnostic thought and ancient Hindu beliefs of creation and cosmic struggle. Melton suggests that these elements of the OT levels may never have been intended as descriptions of historical events and that, like other religious mythology, they may have their truth in the realities of the body and mind which they symbolize. He adds that on whatever level Scientologists might have received this mythology, they seem to have found it useful in their spiritual quest. Scholar Luigi Berzano of the University of Turin listed five religious characteristics of Scientology: a set of doctrines leading to a spiritual goal, a community of believers, an authority figure (Hubbard), ritual practices, and \\"an ethical-moral view of life\\". Hubbard's motives During his lifetime, Hubbard was accused of using religion as a façade for Scientology to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims. The IRS cited a statement frequently attributed to Hubbard that the way to get rich was to found a religion. Though some claim the statement is unsubstantiated, many of Hubbard's science fiction colleagues, including Sam Merwin, Lloyd Arthur Eshbach and Sam Moscowitz, recall Hubbard raising the topic in conversation. Hubbard grew up in a climate that was very critical of organized religion, and frequently quoted anti-religious sentiments in his early lectures. The scholar Marco Frenschkowski (University of Mainz) has stated that it was not easy for Hubbard \\"to come to terms with the spiritual side of his own movement. Hubbard did not want to found a religion: he discovered that what he was talking about in fact was religion. This mainly happened when he had to deal with apparent memories from former lives. He had to defend himself about this to his friends.\\" Frenschkowski allows that there were practical concerns in the question of \\"how to present Scientology to the outside world\\", but dismisses the notion that the religious format was just an expedient pretense; Frenschkowski points to many passages in Hubbard's works that document his struggle with this question. Frenschkowski suggests that it was a biographical mistake to suggest that Hubbard only became interested in Scientology as a religion in 1954. He notes that Hubbard discussed religion and the concept of God even in the years leading up to the emergence of Scientology, and that he did not \\"rush into religion\\" but rather, \\"discovered it through the development of his work with pre-clears\\". Drawing parallels to similar struggles for identity in other religious movements such as Theosophy and Transcendental Meditation, Frenschkowski sees in Hubbard's lectures \\"the case of a man whose background was non-religious and who nevertheless discovers that his ideas somehow oscillate between 'science' (in a very popular sense), 'religion' and 'philosophy', and that these ideas somehow fascinate so many people that they start to form a separate movement\\". Hubbard experiments with traditional religious language in a short piece written in 1953 called \\"The Factors\\", \\"a basic expression of Scientologist cosmology and metaphysics\\", reprinted in current Scientology literature. Frenschkowski observes that the text is partly biblical in structure and that this development is a component of Scientology's metamorphosis into a religion, written at a point when the nature of the new movement was unclear. The Church of Scientology denounces the idea of Hubbard starting a religion for personal gain as an unfounded rumor.Platvoet & Molendijk The Pragmatics of Defining Religion, pp. 63–64, Brill, 1999 The Church also suggests that the origin of the rumor was a remark by George Orwell which had been misattributed to Hubbard. Robert Vaughn Young, who left the Church in 1989 after being its spokesman for 20 years, suggested that reports of Hubbard making such a statement could be explained as a misattribution, despite having encountered three of Hubbard's associates from his science fiction days who remembered Hubbard making statements of that sort in person. It was Young who by a stroke of luck came up with the \\"Orwell quote\\": \\"but I have always thought there might be a lot of cash in starting a new religion, and we'll talk it over some time\\". It appears in a letter by Eric Blair (known the world as George Orwell) to his friend, Jack Common, dated 16-February-38 (February 16, 1938), and was published in Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell, vol. 1.The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell (4 volumes), vol. 1, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1968 ASIN: B000GLJ10S In 2006, Rolling Stone's Janet Reitman also attributed the statement to Hubbard, as a remark to science fiction writer Lloyd Eshbach and recorded in Eshbach's autobiography.Janet Reitman Inside Scientology, Rolling Stone, February 23, 2006 Scientology as a UFO religion Scientology can be seen as a UFO religion in which the existence of extraterrestrial entities operating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are an element of belief. In this context, it is discussed in UFO Religions by Christopher Partridge, and The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions by James R. Lewis, while Susan Palmer draws several parallels with Raelianism.Palmer, Susan J. Aliens adored : Raël's UFO religion, Rutgers University Press, 2004, Gregory Reece, in his book UFO Religion: Inside flying saucer cults and culture, writes: > Scientology is unique within the UFO culture because of this secretiveness, > as well as because of the capitalist format under which they operate. > Scientology is also difficult to categorize. While it bears strong > similarities to the Ashtar Command or the Aetherius Society, its emphasis > upon the Xenu event as the central message of the group seems to place them > within the ancient astronaut tradition.

Alas, such secrets > are hard to keepReece, G.l., UFO Religion: Inside Flying Saucer Cults and > Culture, I.B. Tauris & Co Ltd, 2007, pp. 182–186. Regardless of such statements by critics, Hubbard wrote and lectured openly about the material he himself called \\"space opera\\". In 1952, Hubbard published a book (What to Audit / A History of Man) on space opera and other material that may be encountered when auditing preclears.Church of Scientology, \\"Complete List of Scientology and Dianetics Books and Materials of 1952\\". According to David G. Bromley, Scientology is \\"part therapy, part religion, part UFO group. It's a mix of things unlike any other religious group out there.\\" Scholar Andreas Grunschlo writes that as a ufogical religion, Scientology \\"conceives of earthly human beings primarily as extraterrestrial spirits ('Thetans') which have now to put on their 'bridge to freedom' again —a soul conception which is paralleled by the typical ufogical 'star seeds' or 'walk-ins' planted on this earthly 'garden' for spiritual growth\\". Influences The general orientation of Hubbard's philosophy owes much to Will Durant, author of the popular 1926 classic The Story of Philosophy; Dianetics is dedicated to Durant. Hubbard's view of a mechanically functioning mind in particular finds close parallels in Durant's work on Spinoza. According to Hubbard himself, Scientology is \\"the Western anglicized continuance of many early forms of wisdom\\". Ankerberg and Weldon mention the sources of Scientology to include \\"the Vedas, Buddhism, Judaism, Gnosticism, Taoism, early Greek civilization and the teachings of Jesus, Nietzsche and Freud\\". Hubbard asserted that Freudian thought was a \\"major precursor\\" to Scientology. W. Vaughn Mccall, Professor and Chairman of the Georgia Regents University writes, \\"Both Freudian theory and Hubbard assume that there are unconscious mental processes that may be shaped by early life experiences, and that these influence later behavior and thought.\\" Both schools of thought propose a \\"tripartite structure of the mind\\". Sigmund Freud's psychology, popularized in the 1930s and 1940s, was a key contributor to the Dianetics therapy model, and was acknowledged unreservedly as such by Hubbard in his early works. Hubbard never forgot, when he was 12 years old, meeting Cmdr. Joseph Cheesman Thompson, a U.S. Navy officer who had studied with FreudLewis & Petersen Controversial New Religions, p. 238, Oxford University Press, and when writing to the American Psychological Association in 1949, he stated that he was conducting research based on the \\"early work of Freud\\". In Dianetics, Hubbard cites Hegel as a negative influence — an object lesson in \\"confusing\\" writing.Hubbard, L Ron. 'Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'. Los Angeles, California: Bridge Publications, 2007: 3. According to Mary A. Mann, Scientology is considered nondenominational, accepting all people regardless of their religions background, ethnicity, or educational attainment. Another major influence was Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics. Hubbard was friends with fellow science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt, who explored the implications of Korzybski's non-Aristotelian logic in works such as The World of Null-A, and Hubbard's view of the reactive mind has clear and acknowledged parallels with Korzybski's thought; in fact, Korzybski's \\"anthropometer\\" may have been what inspired Hubbard's invention of the E-meter. Beyond that, Hubbard himself named a great many other influences in his own writing – in Scientology 8-8008, for example, these include philosophers from Anaxagoras and Aristotle to Herbert Spencer and Voltaire, physicists and mathematicians like Euclid and Isaac Newton, as well as founders of religions such as Buddha, Confucius, Jesus and Mohammed – but there is little evidence in Hubbard's writings that he studied these figures to any great depth. As noted, elements of the Eastern religions are evident in Scientology, in particular the concept of karma found in Hinduism and Jainism.Bryan Wilson (1995): ', The Institute for the Study of American Religion.James R. Lewis The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements, p. 429, Oxford University Press US, 2004 In addition to the links to Hindu texts, Scientology draws from Taoism and Buddhism.Kent, Stephen A. , Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol. 11, No. 1, 1996, page 21 According to the Encyclopedia of Community, Scientology \\"shows affinities with Buddhism and a remarkable similarity to first-century Gnosticism\\".Karen Christensen, David Levinson (2003): Encyclopedia of Community, SAGE, p. 1210: \\"Scientology shows affinities with Buddhism and a remarkable similarity to first-century Gnosticism.\\"John A. Saliba (1996): Signs of the Times, Médiaspaul, p. 51 In the 1940s, Hubbard was in contact with Jack Parsons, a rocket scientist and member of the Ordo Templi Orientis then led by Aleister Crowley, and there have been suggestions that this connection influenced some of the ideas and symbols of Scientology. Religious scholars Gerald Willms and J. Gordon Melton have stated that Crowley's teachings bear little if any resemblance to Scientology doctrine. J. Gordon Melton writes that Scientology has its roots in Esoteric thought. He cited the significance of understanding Scientology's appeal as aligned with Esoteric tradition. The Church is a \\"significant revision\\" and \\"meaningful revitalization\\" within the esoteric tradition. Melton states that Scientology can also be traced back to Gnosticism, Manicheanism, Freemasonry and Theosophy. According to James R. Lewis, Scientology is in the same lineage of supernatural religious movements such as New Thought. Scientology goes beyond this and refers to their religio- therapeutic practices as religious technology. Lewis wrote, \\"Scientology sees their psycho-spiritual technology as supplying the missing ingredient in existing technologies—namely, the therapeutic engineering of the human psyche.\\" Scientology and hypnosis Hubbard was said to be an accomplished hypnotist, and close acquaintances such as Forrest Ackerman (Hubbard's literary agent) and A. E. van Vogt (an early supporter of Dianetics) witnessed repeated demonstrations of his hypnotic skills. Scientology literature states that L. Ron Hubbard expertise in hypnosis led to the discovery of the Dianetic engram. However, Hubbard wrote that hypnosis is a \\"wild variable\\", and compared parlor hypnosis to an atom bomb. He also wrote: Etymology of the word Scientology and earlier usage The word Scientology, as coined by L. Ron Hubbard, is a derivation from the Latin word scientia (\\"knowledge\\", \\"skill\\"), which comes from the verb scīre (\\"to know\\"), with the suffix -ology, from the Greek λόγος lógos (\\"word\\" or \\"account [of]\\").Benjamin J. Hubbard/John T. Hatfield/James A. Santucci An Educator's Classroom Guide to America's Religious Beliefs and Practices, p. 89, Libraries Unlimited, 2007 Scientology is further defined as \\"the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes, and other life\\". The term scientology had been used in published works at least twice before Hubbard. In The New Word (1901) poet and lawyer Allen Upward first used scientology to mean blind, unthinking acceptance of scientific doctrine (compare scientism).The New Word original version available for download. In 1934, philosopher Anastasius Nordenholz published Scientology: Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge, which used the term to mean the science of science.Anastasius Nordenholz Scientology: Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge, Freie Zone e. V., 1995 It is unknown whether Hubbard was aware of either prior usage of the word.The New Word, Publisher: Forgotten Books (February 7, 2008), The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey W. Bromiley, page 556 ARC and KRC triangles The Scientology symbol is composed of the letter S, which stands for Scientology, and the ARC and KRC triangles, two important concepts in Scientology. The ARC and KRC triangles are concept maps which show a relationship between three concepts to form another concept. These two triangles are present in the Scientology symbol. The lower triangle, the ARC triangle, is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for. It encompasses Affinity (affection, love or liking), Reality (consensual reality) and Communication (the exchange of ideas). Scientology teaches that improving one of the three aspects of the triangle \\"increases the level\\" of the other two, but Communication is held to be the most important. The upper triangle is the KRC triangle, the letters KRC positing a similar relationship between Knowledge, Responsibility and Control. Among Scientologists, the letters ARC are used as an affectionate greeting in personal communication, for example at the end of a letter. Social problems are ascribed to breakdowns in ARC – in other words, a lack of agreement on reality, a failure to communicate effectively, or a failure to develop affinity. These can take the form of overts – harmful acts against another, either intentionally or by omission – which are usually followed by withholds – efforts to conceal the wrongdoing, which further increase the level of tension in the relationship. Bridge to Total Freedom Scientologists seek to attain spiritual development through study of Scientology materials and auditing. The subject (called Technology or Tech in Scientology jargon) is structured in a series of levels (or gradients) of gradually increasing complexity. The sequence of study (\\"training\\") and auditing (\\"processing\\") levels is termed the \\"Bridge to Total Freedom\\", or simply \\"the Bridge\\". Training concerns primarily the principles and techniques of auditing. Processing is personal development through participation in auditing sessions. The Church of Scientology teaches the principle of reciprocity, involving give-and-take in every human transaction. Accordingly, members are required to make donations for study courses and auditing as they move up the Bridge, the amounts increasing as higher levels are reached. Participation in higher-level courses on the Bridge may cost several thousand dollars, and Scientologists usually move up the Bridge at a rate governed by their income. According to David G. Bromley, religious studies professor, working toward being an \\"Operating Thetan\\" means moving up the Bridge to Total Freedom, \\"which at the highest level transcends material law\\". He further emphasizes this belief of Scientologists: \\"You occasionally come across people in Scientology who say they can change the material world with their mind.\\" Scientology in popular culture Xenu as depicted in South Park The 2005 South Park episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\" publicized the story of Xenu, based directly on the actual Scientology Operating Thetan III document, and accompanied by an onscreen caption reading \\"This is what Scientologists actually believe\\". After explaining these beliefs, the character representing the church's president ultimately reveals to Stan that the church is in reality a money-making scam. Paul Thomas Anderson's 2012 film The Master features a religious organization called \\"The Cause\\" that has many similarities to Scientology. Also, the character of Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, shares a physical resemblance to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. In April 2015, following the recent release of Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Saturday Night Live aired a music video featuring the \\"Church of Neurotology\\", a parody of Scientology's 1990 music video \\"We Stand Tall\\". In November 2016, cable network A&E; began airing Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, a documentary series. Remini, a TV actress and star, was a member of the Church of Scientology for over 30 years and a public proponent of Scientology for years before a public falling out in 2013. She is an executive producer of the series. The series follows Remini as she explores the history and workings of the Church, discusses her experiences and interviews ex-members willing to speak out about alleged abuses of the Church. The initial episode drew 2.1 million viewers.

It was founded in 1923 by the Swiss (Geneva) colonist George Naville (1877-1943). Paso Yobai was governed as part of the district of Independencia until 1993, when it was granted independence by the central government. The largest town in the district is also named Paso Yobai, and contains around 2,500 people. Paso Yobai is historically known for the high quality of its production of yerba mate (ilex paraguariensis). Is also known for the production of sugar-cane, cotton and soy. The Canadian company \\"Latin American Minerals, Inc.\\" bought \\"Paraguayan Mines\\" in 2007 and negotiated an agreement with the Paraguayan government to begin mining in the district. The company believes that Paso Yobai may contain one of the largest gold veins of the world. Although mining has brought increased prosperity to Paso Yobai, it has also brought environmental problems, the most serious being mercury contamination in the streams. The harpist, Enrique Samaniego was born in Paso Yobai.  Economy  Until recently the production and processing of yerba mate was the dominant economic activity in the district of Paso Yobai. At one time yerba mate cultivation covered 10,000 hectares of territory. Presently there are 8,000 hectares under cultivation, and gold mining has replaced yerba mate as the most lucrative economic activity. Still, yerba mate is extremely important to the local economy. Several factories in the district process yerba mate and produce brands such as Sudetia and Labrador. While the cultivation of yerba mate, sugar cane, soybeans and other crops is still of great importance to the district, the discovery of gold encouraged many people to abandon agriculture in order to devote themselves to small scale mining. The recent presence of the Canadian company is a source of both fear and expectation. Many think that it will create good paying work and but others worry about whether they will be able to continue their small scale mining activities as the company expands its presence in the zone.  Gold mining  Although rumors of gold had been floating for years in the area of Paso Yobai, only since the late 1990s have people actively begun mining. The gold rush began after an Ecuadorian met a young woman from Paso Yobai in Asunción. The two got married, and the Ecuadorian discovered gold in a stream on his father- in-law's property. From there began the Gold fever that changed the life of many families. Many locals call the small scale gold miners \\"garimpeiros\\". The steps needed to obtain the gold are varied and depend on the talent of the miner. Depending on their luck and the quality of the product, a miner might earn around 125,000 Guaranis per gram of gold powder. It generally takes between one and two days for a small scale miner to extract a gram of gold. But this gram is difficult to obtain. A garimpeiro can generally survive strictly of their mining activities if he can obtain 10 grams or more of gold a month. Miners use mercury to separate gold from sand and clay. Unfortunately, the mercury often enters and contaminates creeks. Arroyo Gasory, Paso Yobai's largest creek, is now highly contaminated with mercury and the fish are unsafe to eat.  Patronage Festival (Fiesta Patronal)  One of the most important celebrations in Paso Yobai is the Patronage Festival (Fiesta Patronal), celebrated every August 15 honoring its saint patron, the Virgin of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Asunción. The festivities start with the novena each afternoon, with every neighborhood organizing one day of it. Also, on the lawn of the Catholic Church there is a religious chorus competition. People come from throughout the district to participate in this celebration. On the morning of the 15th there is a procession with the image of the Virgin on the streets Paso Yobai, which are decorated with arcs of bamboo and paper strings. The procession proceeds to the church where the local parish priest begins the celebratory mass. After the Mass, the celebration continues with bullfights and music.

The most important districts are: Sudetia, Arroyo Morotí, Planchada, San Isidro, Nueva Guairá, Capii, Curuzú, Natividad, San Roque, Mangrullo, Torres Cué, Tayi, San Antonio, Nansen, 3 de Noviembre, San José, Santa María and San Francisco Berthal.  Native communities  There are several native communities in the district, containing people of the mby'a ethnicity. These communities include: * Rancho Kuña * Yryvu Kua * Naranjito * Santa Teresita * Nance * Ovenia * Isla Hu  Transportation  Many bus lines serve Paso Yobai. Empresa Ybytyruzu has three buses a day to and from Asunción (5 to 6 hours). Empresa Sudetia has six buses a day to and from Villarrica (2 to 2.5 hours). Empresa 8 de Noviembre has one bus a day to and from Caaguazu (1.5 hours). Because the roads are made of dirt, often motorized vehicles have difficulty after rainstorms. Since the discovery of gold, more and more people in the district are buying and riding motorcycles.  Population  According to the most recent data provided by the General Office of Statistics, Polls and Census, this is the demographic information for the Paso Yobai district: The total population is 25,067 inhabitants, 13.386 males and 11.682 females. * Population from to 14 years old: 45.2% * Population from 15 to 64 years old: 51.2% * Population from 65 years old: 3.6% * 92.04% of the population is settled in the rural zone.

Built in 1907, it was the home of composer and bandleader John Philip Sousa (1854-1932) from 1912 until his death. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966. and It is still a private residence and is not open to the public. Description and history The John Philip Sousa House is located on a bluff overlooking Manhasset Bay on the North Shore of Long Island in the Sands Point area of North Hempstead. It is a rambling 2-1/2 story frame structure with a brown stucco exterior and a red tile roof. Its main block has a gabled roof oriented north-south, with a two-story wing extending east off the northern end. Porches extend along the western facade of the main block (overlooking the bay) and the south side of the wing. Outbuildings on the property include a stable and carriage house, an L-shaped structure near Hicks Lane, which has an apartment on the upper level. Near the waterfront there is a small teahouse. The house was built in 1907 to a design by A. B. Trowbridge. It was purchased in 1915 by John Philip Sousa, and remained his home until his death in 1932. During Sousa's ownership, the property was known as \\"Wildbank\\". Sousa was instrumental in elevating wind ensembles and marching bands to a high level of prominence and popularity, both as a conductor of the United States Marine Band, and as the composer of hundreds of marches, many of which remain staples of the band literature.

Photinus pyralis is famous in biotechnology for its luciferase gene. This is sometimes employed as a marker gene; genetically modified organisms which contain it start to glow like the firefly when brought in contact with a luciferin-containing medium. Firefly luciferases differ slightly between taxa, resulting in differently colored light and other properties, and in most cases where \\"firefly luciferase\\" is used in some application or study, it is the specific luciferase of P. pyralis Systematics The delimitation and relationships of the many genera are often insufficiently resolved. For example, Lamprohiza and Phausis as presently delimited are apparently paraphyletic in respect to each other. The Phosphaenini, containing Phosphaenus and some other genera from the Holarctic, might indeed be a tribe distinct from the main North American lineage of Photinini, as was once proposed. Phausis may be even more distinct.Stanger-Hall et al. (2007) Among the Lampyrinae, the Phosphaenus group seems to occupy an even more basal position than the ancient and probably unrelated lineages assembled in the Cratomorphini (a possibly invalid group); most do not produce any light and rely on pheromone communication instead, though Lamprohiza produces a continuous glowing light. The Photinus group, though, contains flashing \\"lightning bugs\\" and some that have lost the ability to produce light signals, and is apparently much closer related to the advanced Lampyrini.

The NGB was initially projected to enter service around 2018 as a stealthy, subsonic, medium-range, medium payload bomber to supplement and possibly—to a limited degree—replace the U.S. Air Force's aging bomber fleet (B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer). The NGB program was superseded by the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) heavy bomber program. Development 2018 Bomber In June 2003, Jane's Defence Weekly reported upon ongoing study efforts within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and USAF Air Staff to prepare to start a new long-range strike system, which would not necessarily be an aircraft (other options being discussed included ultra-high-speed munitions), that could mature technologies in the 2012-15 timeframe in order to transfer into a developmental program. The sinking of ex-USS Schenectady as a test during Operation Resultant Fury in 2004 demonstrated that heavy bombers could successfully engage naval targets on their own. This led to the requirement for a new bomber that could survive against modern defenses... In 2004–06, the USAF Air Combat Command studied alternatives for a new bomber type aircraft to augment the current bomber fleet which now consists of largely 1970s era airframes, with a goal of having a fully operational aircraft on the ramp by 2018. Some speculation suggested that the next generation bomber might be hypersonic and unmanned. However, these were put to rest when US Air Force Major General Mark T. Matthews, head of ACC Plans and Programs stated that available technology indicates a manned subsonic bomber at a May 2007 Air Force Association sponsored event.Warwick, Graham. \\"USAF says next bomber will be subsonic and manned\\". Flight International, 3 May 2007. He later stated that a manned subsonic bomber provides the \\"best value\\" to meet the required range and payload performance by 2018.Warwick, Graham. \\"Speed bump: USAF sets modest goals for new bomber\\". Flight International, 12 June 2007. The 2018 bomber was expected to serve as a stop-gap until the more advanced \\"2037 Bomber\\" entered service. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), directed the Air Force to develop a new long-range precision strike capability by 2018.\\"Why the US Wants a New Bomber\\", The Diplomat, 6 May 2012.Ehrhard, Tom. \\"An Air Force Strategy for the Long Haul\\". Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, 17 September 2009. USAF officials identified the new bomber as having top-end low-observability characteristics with the ability to loiter for hours over the battlefield area and respond to threats as they appear. Major General David E Clary, ACC vice-commander, summed it up by saying the new bomber would \\"penetrate and persist\\". Deployment of cruise missiles was another issue for the new bomber. The B-52 is the only aircraft currently in the Air Force inventory allowed under strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty to be armed with nuclear cruise missiles. Major consideration was paid to operation readiness and flexibility. In 2006, the program expected that a prototype could be flying as early as 2009. In September 2007, several Air Force generals stressed that it was still their plan to field the bomber by 2018. In order to meet the tight schedule, the Air Force would initially pursue a basic model then improves its capabilities subsequently.\\"Senior Air Force Generals To Skeptics: We Can Field A New Bomber In 2018\\". Defense Daily, 26 September 2007. On 25 January 2008, Boeing and Lockheed Martin announced an agreement to embark on a joint effort to develop a new US Air Force strategic bomber, with plans for it to be in service by 2018.. This collaborative effort for a long-range strike program will include work in advanced sensors and future electronic warfare solutions, including advancements in network-enabled battle management, command and control, and virtual warfare simulation and experimentation.. Under their joint arrangement, Boeing, the No. 2 Pentagon supplier, would be the primary contractor with about a 60% share, and Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defense contractor, would have around a 40% share, according to sources familiar with the companies' plans.. Northrop Grumman, another major defense contractor, received $2 billion in funding in 2008 for \\"restricted programs\\" – also called black programs – for a demonstrator that could fly in 2010.. The Air Force was expected to announce late in 2009 its precise requirements for a new bomber that would be operating by 2018.. In May 2009, testimony before Congress, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates mentioned that the Pentagon is considering a pilotless aircraft for the next-generation bomber role.. Move to LRS-B In April 2009, Defense Secretary Gates announced a delay in the new generation bomber project that would push it past the 2018 date.. This was caused not only by budget considerations, but also by nuclear arms treaty considerations.. On 19 May 2009, Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz said that the USAF's focus in the 2010 budget was on \\"Long-range strike, not next-generation bomber\\" and will push for this in the QDR.

Breedlove said that the term \\"next-generation bomber\\" was dead and that the Air Force was working on a long-range strike \\"family\\" that would draw on the capabilities of systems like the F-35 and F-22 to help a more affordable and versatile bomber complete its missions. On 13 September 2010, U.S. Air Force Secretary Michael Donley said that long range strike would continue cautiously with proven technologies and that the plan to be submitted with the 2012 budget could call for either a missile or an aircraft. The bomber is to be nuclear-capable, but not certified for nuclear use until later.

The first Polish edition was published in 1993 and the first English edition was first published in 2007. The book has also been translated into several other languages. The collection contains seven short stories interspersed with a continuing frame story: Geralt of Rivia, after having been injured in battle, rests in a temple. During that time he has flashbacks to recent events in his life, with each flashback forming a short story. Plot \\"The Witcher\\" (Wiedźmin)  :\\"The Voice of Reason\\" (Głos rozsądku) Part I - In Ellander's Temple of Melitele, a wounded Geralt is awakened from his slumber by Iola, a mute servant. The two make love, and fall asleep together, with Geralt dreaming of his fight with the powerful monster who wounded him. The King of Temeria, Foltest, has offered a reward to anyone who can lift the curse on his daughter, Adda (the result of an incestuous union with his late sister, also named Adda), who was born as a striga, and now terrorizes the town every night. Foltest insists that his daughter not be harmed, but reluctantly grants Geralt permission to kill her if Geralt decides that Adda cannot be returned to human form. A more difficult question, to which Geralt can give no certain answer, is whether Adda, who has been a monster her whole life, can live as a \\"normal\\" human even if the curse is lifted. Geralt spends the night at the old palace, which houses the striga. Lord Ostrit, a magnate from Novigrad, arrives and tries to bribe Geralt into leaving without confronting the striga. Ostrit wants to use the striga as proof of Foltest's inability to rule, convincing Temeria's people to support Novigrad's usurpation of rule from Foltest. Geralt refuses and knocks out Ostrit to use him as bait for the striga. Geralt fights with the striga and soon overcomes her, despite the striga's resistance to silver, which normally easily defeats monsters. Unable to subdue the striga, Geralt seals himself into its crypt, forcing it to spend the night outside its lair and thus lifting the curse. In the morning, Geralt approaches the seemingly-restored Adda, only for the girl to lunge at him and savagely claw his neck. Geralt binds his wounds and faints, but regains consciousness in the temple, being told that Adda is being cared for by the King and Geralt has earned his reward. \\"A Grain of Truth\\" (Ziarno prawdy)  :\\"The Voice of Reason\\" Part II - In the morning, priestess Nenneke awakens Geralt and Iola, and insists Geralt take part in a trance with Iola, which would show them Geralt's future. Geralt refuses. While traveling through a forest, Geralt comes across the corpses of a man and a girl with strange wounds. Tracing the corpses' path, the Witcher arrives at a seemingly deserted mansion. Before entering the premises, he notices a woman in the forest line watching him, but she runs away once he notices her. Geralt approaches the house and its owner, a large bear-like beast named Nivellen, attempts to scare him away, without success. Nivellen allows Geralt to enter the house, which supernaturally obeys Nivellen's every command. Nivellen relates that, as the reluctant leader of his late father's gang of bandits, he raped a priestess of a temple, who cursed him to be a beast before killing herself. The priestess told him how to lift the curse, but he has forgotten her exact words, only that it had something to do with a kiss from a woman. Returning to the mansion, his family home, he invited the daughters of local villages to stay with him, rewarding their families from the mansion's treasury. None had any effect in lifting his curse, and eventually he gave up, settling for enjoying their company. Before departing, Geralt warns Nivellen that his newest relationship, named Vereena, may actually be a monster. Nivellen insists that he and Vereena are truly in love and is now hesitant to break his curse, unsure if she would still love him if he was just an \\"ordinary\\" human. Geralt notices his horse acting strangely, but dismisses it and leaves. Along the road, Geralt realizes why his horse acted strangely and returns to the mansion. He is greeted by Vereena, whom Geralt identifies as a bruxa, a vampire-like monster with telepathic abilities. She truly loves Nivellen, but she has also been sating her appetite for blood on his other female companions, including the girl and her father that Geralt found in the woods. A fight ensues. The bruxa overwhelms Geralt, but Nivellen joins the fray and impales the monster on a pole. The bruxa confesses her love for Nivellen telepathically just before Geralt finally kills her. The confession breaks Nivellen's curse and he returns to normal. Geralt confides that the old stories about a kiss from a maiden lifting a curse like Nivellen's are mostly myth, but contain \\"a grain of truth\\": there has to be true love for the cure to work. \\"The Lesser Evil\\" (Mniejsze zło) :\\"The Voice of Reason\\" Part III - Two knights of the Order of the White Rose, Count Falwick and Sir Tailles, arrive. They are ordered by the prince of Ellander to chase Geralt (\\"the Butcher of Blaviken\\") out of town. Geralt promises to leave in three days. Insulted, Tailles challenges Geralt to a duel, and the knights promise to return. On the eve of a market festival, Geralt rides into the town of Blaviken with a monster carcass in tow. He seeks out Caldemeyn, the town's alderman, to try to get a reward for killing the monster. Caldemeyn refuses, but one of his guards mentions that the town wizard might find value in it. They head to the wizard's tower, who is uninterested in the carcass but wants to meet Geralt nonetheless, alone. Geralt steps into the tower and discovers the wizard is Stregobor, a mage he has met previously. Stregobor explains why he is in hiding and why he wished to meet with Geralt: a young, supposedly cursed woman wants to assassinate him and Stregobor wants Geralt's protection. Geralt refuses in disbelief and leaves. Meanwhile, the described assassin, named Renfri, has entered Blaviken along with her band of mercenaries. Geralt meets her in a local tavern, and she explains to Geralt and Caldemeyn that she bears a letter from a king that she is under his protection, which Caldemeyn confirms. That night, when Geralt withdraws to his attic room at Caldemeyn's home, he finds Renfri. Renfri explains that Stregobor had previously tried to kill her for no reason other than a superstition, and encourages the witcher to kill Stregobor instead. Geralt, again, refuses, and pleads with Renfri to forgive Stregobor to prove the superstition wrong. Renfri refuses but implies she will leave town peacefully before spending the night with Geralt. In the morning, on the day of the market festival, Geralt realizes that Renfri lied, and won't be leaving town, but will in fact massacre the people of Blaviken to draw Stregobor out of his tower. Geralt races to the marketplace and finds Renfri's mercenaries. Although they show no immediate indication of causing harm in the market, Geralt attacks and swiftly kills each mercenary. When Renfri arrives, Geralt defeats her as well. After the fight, Stregobor approaches the Witcher, intent on performing an autopsy on Renfri's body to prove that the curse had physically affected her. Geralt refuses to let him touch her body. Stregobor leaves, and the townsfolk, believing Geralt had just murdered a group of innocent men during the festival, begin hurling rocks at the Witcher. Geralt protects himself with magic until Caldemeyn tells the villagers to stop, but demands Geralt leave Blaviken and never return. Geralt's actions have now earned him the nickname \\"the Butcher of Blaviken.\\" \\"A Question of Price\\" (Kwestia ceny) :\\"The Voice of Reason\\" Part IV - Geralt tells Iola his history as a Witcher. Geralt (under an alias) is at the castle of Cintra at the invitation of Queen Calanthe, attending the betrothal celebration for Crown Princess Pavetta. Suddenly an uninvited knight with his face covered enters, introduces himself as Urcheon of Erlenwald and claims Pavetta's hand in marriage, promised to him before Pavetta's birth, by her father, King Roegner, whose life Urcheon saved. Calanthe admits that he has a claim, but does not want to marry her daughter to a stranger. She orders him to remove his helmet, and to everyone's shock his face is that of a furry beast. Geralt asks Pavetta whether she will agree to marry Urcheon, and to the outrage of the other suitors, she says yes. The suitors attack Urcheon, but he is defended by Geralt and the King of Skellinge, Eist Tuirseach, who brought his nephew to the feast to court Pavetta but who himself loves Calanthe. The attack provokes Pavetta to reveal her latent magical powers, which threaten to destroy the castle until Geralt and Eist's druid councilor, Mousesack, manage to subdue her. When the princess approaches Urcheon, he transforms into a man named Duny. Pavetta and Duny admit that they have been seeing each other for over a year, and fallen in love. Calanthe agrees to their marriage, and, touched by Eist shielding her from the destruction of Pavetta's magical outburst, finally agrees to his proposal of marriage. Thanking Geralt for saving his life, Duny offers him whatever he asks. Geralt, invoking the same law which gave Duny his claim to Pavetta's hand, reveals that Pavetta is pregnant and asks that the child be raised as a Witcher. \\"The Edge of the World\\" (Kraniec świata) :\\"The Voice of Reason\\" Part V - Dandelion, a poet and Geralt's friend, soon arrives. They discuss how the Witcher profession is losing profitability in modern times. Geralt and Dandelion fail to find work in Upper Posada, Geralt dismissing the locals' tales of monsters as superstition rather than real work for a witcher. Moving on to Lower Posada, they are overtaken by a local carter, Nettly, who promises there is work for them. The village elder, Dhun, tells of a \\"deovel\\" whose mischief has become a problem, but under no circumstances should the creature be killed. In the countryside, Geralt and Dandelion confront the \\"deovel\\", which resembles a goat walking on two legs. Dandelion and the \\"devil\\" exchange a few words, which provokes the devil to hurl iron balls at the pair, driving them away. Back in the village, passages from an ancient tome identify the \\"devil\\" as a sylvan. During a second confrontation, Geralt and Dandelion are knocked out and taken to the mountain hideout of Aen Seidhe elves, with whom the sylvan, Torque, is taking refuge. The elves' leader, Filavandrel, orders them executed, but the legendary Queen of the Fields makes a spectacular entrance. While Filavandrel communicates with her (telepathically), Torque cuts Geralt and Dandelion free. Filavandrel releases them, declaring that he and Geralt will meet again in battle, and he hopes Geralt does not let him down when that happens. Geralt assures him that he'll do his best. The story ends with Geralt, Dandelion and Torque sitting around a campfire, wondering where to go next. \\"\\" (Ostatnie życzenie) :\\"The Voice of Reason\\" Part VI - Geralt talks to Nenneke about Yennefer, a frequent visitor to the temple, and asks to leave a portion of his payment for defeating the striga for her. Nenneke asks how Geralt first met Yennefer. Dandelion and Geralt are fishing, when the former hauls up an ancient, sealed amphora. Ignoring Geralt's warnings, Dandelion opens the vase, releasing what he believes is a genie. He begins to recite three wishes, but the \\"genie\\" attacks him instead. Geralt banishes the creature with an exorcism spell he learned from a local temple, and rushes Dandelion to the nearest city, Rinde, for medical aid. The guards say there is a strict rule against admitting visitors after nightfall, and Geralt will have to spend the night in the guardhouse, despite Dandelion's condition. However, three other detainees - elves Chireadan and his cousin, Errdil, and the half- elf knight Vratimir - inform him that the city authorities have imposed heavy duties for spellcasting, and the mages are boycotting Rinde in return. As a result, the one spellcaster in the city - the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg - is well-paid for her services, and is given sanctuary by the Novigradian merchant-ambassador, Beau Berrant. When dawn breaks, Geralt enters the city to find the sorceress. Gaining entry into Berrant's home, he finds Berrant and most of his staff inebriated, and so enters Yennefer's bedchamber alone. She agrees to help Dandelion, but aside, Chireadan tells Geralt in no uncertain terms that Yennefer, while beautiful, is not to be trusted. When Yennefer summons Geralt upstairs, Dandelion is healed and sleeping peacefully, and she demands payment. Before Geralt can react, he passes out and wakes up in a cell with Chireadan. The elf tells Geralt that Yennefer enchanted him into rampaging through the town, punishing anyone who had ever insulted Yennefer. When Geralt and Chireadan are brought before the town's mayor and head priest, the proceeding is interrupted by Dandelion, appearing through a magic portal and proclaiming Geralt's innocence. They are further interrupted by chaos outside: Yennefer has lured the genie to the town, and is trying to capture it and harness its powers. The genie is much stronger than expected, and she is losing her hold of it, threatening to destroy the town. Geralt tries to pull Yennefer to safety, but she refuses to stop her attempt to bind the genie. After a brief fight, Geralt realizes that the genie is bound to him, the person who last held the seal to its urn. It granted his first wish by obeying the \\"exorcism\\" (which literally translated as an instruction to \\"f**k off\\"), granted his second by killing one of the guards beating him in prison, and is now awaiting his third and last wish. Once he does this, the genie tears free of Yennefer's spell and disappears, leaving a destroyed inn behind. Under the rubble of the inn, Yennefer finds herself in Geralt's arms, close and intimate, and the two begin to make love, the beginning of a stormy relationship.  \\"The Voice of Reason\\" (Głos rozsądku)  Finally, Geralt and Dandelion leave the temple, but are stopped by Falwick and Tailles and a company of soldiers. They are accompanied by Dennis Cranmer, the dwarf captain of the prince's guard. The knights outline an unwinnable situation to Geralt, in which he must accept Tailles' earlier challenge but not harm Tailles, or else he'll be killed. Geralt accepts, but avoids punishment by parrying his sword so forcefully that Tailles's own blade bashes him in the face. Dennis accepts the loophole and permits Geralt to leave, sincerely hoping to meet Geralt again in the future. Falwick is outraged, but Geralt asks if the knight is willing to accept a challenge from Geralt, or find some similar loophole to avoid it. Falwick falls silent, and Geralt congratulates him for listening to \\"the voice of reason.\\" Before Geralt leaves, he accidentally touches Iola's hand, inducing the trance. Geralt, Iola, and Nenneke see a bloody and violent vision of Geralt's future. Geralt dismisses the vision, claiming to have seen it before, and says goodbye to Nenneke.

The Last Wish, lasting about 12 hours, was voiced by 52 actors, including Krzysztof Banaszyk as Geralt, Anna Dereszowska as Yennefer, Sławomir Pacek as Dandelion, and Krzysztof Gosztyła as narrator.  Influences  The Last Wish contains many references to classic fairy tales. For example, the 'Law of Surprise' mirrors a similar 'law' established in the fairy tale Rumpelstiltskin, as popularized by the Brothers Grimm in 1812. Similarly, the story 'A Grain of Truth' features a man who has been turned into a beast through witchcraft, who is eventually turned back into a man through finding 'true love' - as in the classic story Beauty and the Beast. Most notably, in the story ' A Lesser Evil', the character Shrike is introduced as a princess who was forced to flee her kingdom with the assistance of a huntsman, due to an evil stepmother. She later meets a band of seven dwarves and convinces them that highway robbery is more profitable than mining. This seems to be an allusion to the fairytale character Snow White. Reception and significance In 2011, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk gave U.S. President Barack Obama diplomatic presents, as is custom, on his visit to Poland. One of these was a signed copy of The Last Wish. The English edition was placed on the New York Times Bestseller in June 2015, coinciding with the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt video game.

According to the National Park Service, \\"This site provided the first clear evidence of an Archaic hunting and gathering culture in the Northeastern United States (c.3500 BC)\\". More properly known as the Lamoka Lake Site, after the lake of the same name located nearby, this archaeological site, occupied by Late Archaic hunter-gatherers approximately 4,500 years before present, is one of the most important Archaic Period sites in North America due to its seminal role in the identification and naming of a hunting and gathering culture subsequent to Paleo-Indian culture and preceding pottery-using Woodland cultures. As such, the Lamoka Lake site is often considered the type site of the Archaic Period of North American prehistory. The first professional excavations at the site were conducted between 1925 and 1928 by the Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences, now the Rochester Museum and Science Center. Additional excavations at the Lamoka Lake site were conducted by the New York State Museum in 1958 and 1962, by the Buffalo Museum of Science in the 1980s, by Utica College in the 1990s, and by Rutgers University in 2000. Part of the archaeological site is protected in the Waneta-Lamoka Wildlife Management Area. In 2006, the remaining portion of the site was purchased for preservation by The Archaeological Conservancy. Archaeological excavations at the Lamoka Lake site have recovered large numbers of projectile points - primarily Lamoka points; stone netsinkers, groundstone and polished stone tools - including beveled adzes, hammerstones, pestles, mullers, mortars, and metates; bone tools - including awls, knives, and fish hooks; lithic debitage; and animal bones - primarily white-tailed deer, tree squirrel, and passenger pigeon; and human burials. Numerous archaeological features, including pits, postmolds, hearths, firebeds and ash layers, have also been identified. The majority of artifacts and features date to the Late Archaic Period, although later Woodland Period artifacts have also been recovered from the site.

Employed as a bellman (or \\"bellboy\\") in the New Yorker Hotel in New York City, he was promoted by the hotel as the \\"smallest bellboy in the world\\".  Discovery  The famous \\"Call for Philip Morris\\" advertising campaign predates Johnny Roventini's role and began during World War I. A drawing of a bellboy carrying a tray with a box of cigarettes on it was the original mascot. The campaign had been successful and was used for 15 years with artistic variations as the only significant changes. In 1933, advertising executive Milton H. Biow, the principal of the Biow Agency in New York City, was managing the advertising account of Philip Morris cigarettes. Biow had an idea to bring new life (literally) to the mature \\"bellboy with tray of cigarettes\\" campaign. He had heard of the distinctive voice and appearance of Roventini. Biow and Philip Morris executive Alfred E. Lyons went to the hotel where Johnny worked. They sat in the lobby and observed him, noting both his diminutive size and distinctive voice. In those days, hotel lobbies were typically elaborately furnished and used as meeting places, so situations with persons seeking each other were not uncommon. Biow and Lyons had apparently been unnoticed by the 22-year-old bellboy, when, according to the legend, Biow approached him and paid Johnny a dollar to page a \\"Mr. Philip Morris\\" throughout the lobby. The small bellboy repeatedly cried out \\"Call for Philip Morris\\" in his distinctive high-pitched voice, several times, not knowing that there was no such person. He did not realize that he had been essentially performing an audition. \\"I went around the lobby yelling my head off,\\" Johnny recalled later, \\"but Philip Morris didn't answer my call.\\" Roventini initially thought that his call had been both legitimate and unsuccessful. He was soon to learn that he had been wrong on both counts. He was later quoted in Variety: \\"I had no idea that Philip Morris was a cigarette.\\"Johnny Roventini - Entertainment News, Obituary, Media - Variety Ticket for the Philip Morris Program radio show, 1945, presented by \\"Johnny\\". The page had, in fact, been a huge success, one that was to lead the young bellboy to a 40-year career. Biow and Lyons both visualized the performance of the small bellboy as ideal to bring life to their fictitious character. In April 1933, Roventini was hired to make a \\"Call for Phil-ip Mor-rees\\" on the different radio programs sponsored by the tobacco company. Roventini had been earning $15 a week at the hotel (about $ today) and received $100 (about $ today) for his very first radio commercial. He later recounted that he only accepted the new job after checking with his mother, with whom he lived much of his life. He was soon earning $50,000 annually,Little Johnny A Famous Pitchman a substantial wage for such work in those years (as it was about $ in today's money), according to his biography.  Career  It was obvious to his fans that Roventini enjoyed playing the smallness of his character, which Biow and others helped him capitalize upon. Philip Morris Tobacco Company provided a small chauffeur-driven American Austin convertible automobile to get Johnny to the live radio broadcasts on time. He became a friend to movie stars, sitting on popular actress Marlene Dietrich's lap in a publicity shot. During World War II, he patriotically tried joining the Coast Guard Auxiliary and, probably to no one's surprise, was rejected for being too short. He shared a dinner table with General and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower, clowned around with Red Skelton, sat ringside with fighter Jack Dempsey, and participated in numerous parades and other public events. There were at least ten other Johnnys, known as \\"Johnny Juniors\\", including Albert Alteiri. This made it possible for Johnny to appear simultaneously in various sections of the country. Roventini was heard on popular live radio programs and appeared in his short-jacketed bellboy outfit on some of the most-watched television shows of the 1950s and 1960s, including I Love Lucy, Candid Camera, The Red Skelton Show and The Jackie Gleason Show.  I Love Lucy  He is possibly best remembered of all his Philip Morris related-work for the I Love Lucy show. In 1951, in the early days of commercial broadcast television in the United States, the new comedy show ran into difficulties when it first sought sponsorship. This was due to the Cuban character played by Desi Arnaz. Advertisers were fearful of unknown public acceptance of the show featuring a marriage of mixed ethnicity in that era. After failing to win financial backing from CBS executives, Arnaz traveled to New York to hawk the show, and struck a deal with advertising mogul Milton Biow, who bought the show for his client, Philip Morris cigarettes. The tobacco company sponsored I Love Lucy exclusively from its premiere on October 15, 1951, through Christmas of 1954 (it then shifted to an \\"alternate sponsorship\\" with Procter & Gamble until June 1955). Although Philip Morris had a rich return for its investment and risk-taking in backing I Love Lucy, Arnaz also had the wisdom to retain ownership of the I Love Lucy shows, effectively inventing both the \\"rerun\\" and syndication procedures for the fledgling television industry. The show was enormously popular with the viewing public, and with Lucy and Desi, and sidekicks William Frawley and Vivian Vance (as neighbors Fred and Ethel Mertz), Johnny and Philip Morris gained into unprecedented national television prominence. Johnny's voice and face was often the first thing one heard and saw respectively on Monday evenings on the CBS television network as the I Love Lucy opened. Johnny also did a number of commercial spots with stars of the hit show, Lucille Ball and Arnaz, who were expected to promote products sponsoring their shows in that era, when embedding ads straight into programs and in having the stars of shows do ads for the sponsors was common practice.Dean's World - Call For Philip Morris In a particularly memorable episode, \\"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\\", the actress dresses up in the \\"Johnny the Bellhop\\" costume.Sitcoms Online - I Love Lucy Industry watchers reported that Lucy, Desi and Johnny had soon become fast friends while working together. As I Love Lucy was enjoying its enormous popularity, the U.S. was in an early period of the Cold War. The politics of communism and the possibilities that subversive pro-communism activities were active within the United States became known as a Red Scare. In September 1953, allegations surfaced from columnist Walter Winchell that Lucille Ball was being investigated by the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the U.S. Congress for alleged communist ties. Johnny traveled from his home in New York to be with her at Desilu studios in Los Angeles, a gesture of support from both Roventini and her show's sponsor, Philip Morris, which she never forgot. Although with much difficulty, Lucy was able to disprove the charges.Biography of Lucille Ball, famous TV clown  Later years  A Philip Morris representative once described Johnny Roventini as a \\"living trademark\\". In 1959, NBC Radio aired a special half-hour program to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his career, describing him (with an apparent double entendre) as \\"an advertising giant\\". In April 1970, Congress passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banning the advertising of cigarettes on radio and television starting on January 2, 1971.History of Tobacco Regulation* In the years after tobacco advertising was prohibited in broadcast communications regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Roventini made personal appearances for Philip Morris until he retired in 1974.Good-bye to Johnny Roventini  Death in 1998  In retirement, he enjoyed sailing. He never married and died in a hospital near White Plains, New York, in 1998, at the age of 88. The cause of death was listed as \\"natural causes\\".Johnny Roventini \\"Johnny's fame as an advertising legend was enhanced by an ever- present smile and outstretched hand that won him friends wherever he went,\\" Philip Morris eulogized.  Legacy  Johnny Roventini's original uniform (red usher's jacket, piped trousers, black pillbox hat and white gloves) was donated to the American Advertising Museum, which was located in Portland, Oregon, before closing in 2004. His catchphrase was the inspiration for Call Federal Credit Union, a credit union that initially served only Philip Morris employees.

Although bicycle law is a relatively new specialty within the law, first appearing in the late 1980s, its roots date back to the 1880s and 1890s, when cyclists were using the courts to assert a legal right to use the roads. In 1895, George B. Clementson, an American attorney, wrote The Road Rights and Liabilities of Wheelmen, the first book on bicycle law, in which he discussed the seminal cases of the 1880s and 1890s, which were financed by Albert Pope of Columbia Bicycles, and through which cyclists gained the right to the road.Mionske, Bob, Bicycling & the Law 345 (VeloPress 2007) By the mid-1980s, a substantial body of law pertaining to bicycles had developed, and a few attorneys had begun specializing in bicycle law. Today, attorneys specializing in bicycle law represent professional athletes, as well as average cyclists, on issues ranging from professional contracts, to traffic accidents, to traffic tickets. In addition, attorneys specializing in bicycle law may advise cyclists on other legal issues, such as bicycle theft, insurance, harassment of cyclists, defective products law, and non-professional contractual issues.  History  The development of the bicycle occurred over a period of some seventy years, during which time it enjoyed three separate booms in popularity. And yet, throughout that seventy- year period, cyclists had no legal right to use the roads or walkways. With the twin developments of the safety bicycle and the pneumatic tire, bicycles enjoyed a new boom of popularity, beginning in the 1880s, and culminating in the bicycle craze of the 1890s. Until the 1890s, the bicycle had been the plaything of wealthy young men. Now, for the first time, the bicycle came within reach of the middle class, and by the end of the decade, within the reach of the working class. The resulting tidal wave of popularity meant that roads which had hitherto been the province of horses and horse-drawn carriages were now increasingly crowded with cyclists; in some large cities, recreational cyclists numbered in the hundreds of thousands on the weekends.Mionske, Bob, Bicycling & the Law 3 (VeloPress 2007) This enormous surge in new cyclists inevitably led to chaotic conditions and conflict between cyclists, horses and horse-drawn carriages, and pedestrians. This conflict was exacerbated by the fact that few traffic laws were in place to regulate traffic. Furthermore, nobody really knew if existing laws even applied to cyclists. Unused to sharing the roads, carriage-drivers challenged the right of cyclists to even be on the road, sometimes with physical force, and sometimes with the force of law.Mionske, Bob, Bicycling & the Law 6-7 (VeloPress 2007) Municipalities passed restrictive ordinances, and eager to collect a new source of revenue from fines, law enforcement agencies set creative traps to ensnare unwary cyclists.Smith, Robert A., A Social History of the Bicycle 188 (American Heritage Press, 1972) Thus, the stage was set for a legal battle cyclists asserting their right to use the roads, and those who would ban them from the roads.  The right to the road  The New York State Legislature took the first step toward resolving the conflict, with the passage in 1887 of An Act in Relation to the Use of Bicycles and Tricycles. This statute established for the first time that bicycles are \\"carriages,\\" and that cyclists are \\"entitled to the same rights and subject to the same restrictions\\" as drivers of carriages.New York Law 1887, Chapter 704, An Act in Relation to the Use of Bicycles and Tricycles view in Google Books  The statutory right to the road  The Uniform Vehicle Code provides, essentially, that bicyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as operators of automobiles, except where the law specifies otherwise or where it can naturally have no applicability.2000 Edition of the Uniform Vehicle Code A basic statement of cyclists' rights and responsibilities has been adopted in the vehicle codes of most American states. Types of laws  Bicycle registration  Some laws require bicycles to be registered (e.g., before residing in a city for more than 30 days), and some require the display of identifying imprints or publicly visible license plates. The main purpose is usually to facilitate the quick identification and return of stolen property, since bicycle theft is one of the most common crimes in many areas. Some laws also require the reporting of new and used bicycle sales. Bicycle parking Many laws allow police to confiscate bicycles parked illegally. Other laws require bicycles to be confiscated and returned to their registered owners if they are \\"abandoned\\", which can mean parked for an extended period of time (like 7 days). Bicycle theft is so common in some areas that simply parking a bicycle but not locking with a theft-deterrent device such as a padlock can be considered abandonment. In most cases, it is legal for cyclists to ride on roads in the United States. However, only vehicles that meet certain specifications are required to bear a license plate. This can make it very difficult to report violations of state vehicle codes to police.  Traffic signs and signals  Many states require bicyclists to follow the same signs and signals as automobile operators, with some notable exceptions. These include laws allowing cyclists to follow the pedestrian (rather than automobile) signals at some intersections, as well as the \\"Idaho stop\\" and similar stop-as-yield laws allowing cyclists to pass through stop signs and red lights when it is safe to do so. Remaining on the edge of the roadway In every state there is a provision in the statutes which stipulates occupying a lane as nearly as practicable. Riding on the edge of a travel lane is a modern phenomenon based on the often misunderstood statute \\"As far to the right hand side of the boundary or curb as practicable\\". This is a throwback to the predominant mode of transportation at the time traffic laws were formulated, namely the horse and cart. The horse and cart would often take up an entire half of a width of road space if not more. Bicycles by their very nature can not take up more than half and all statutes mandating \\"As far to the right as practicable\\" leave the caveat of \\"Allowing reasonably free passage to the left\\". This modern day misunderstanding of a statute which was a product of its time, has led to many a cyclist being killed or critically injured. The basis of this misunderstood statute has also led to the production of bike lanes which do not take into account the safety of the cyclist. Many laws require bicyclists to remain as close to the edge of the roadway as practicable, in the normal direction of travel. Exceptions are common for preparing for a cross-traffic turn (left in the United States), going straight on the left side of a right-turn-only lane, avoiding hazards, and going the speed of other traffic. Another common exception is where there is no room for an automobile to safely pass. Some of these laws specify distances, such as from the curb, or using no more than 1/3 of the navigable lane. Bicycle paths Many municipalities have specially marked bicycle lanes on the roadway, or special bicycle-only paths. These are for bicyclists only, and no car may be operated on them (except to cross over them in making a turn). Other paths are marked as multi-use paths and set aside for pedestrians, bicyclists, and users of non-road-worthy devices such as skateboards and scooters. Some laws require bicyclists to use a bicycle path if one is available on the same roadway. Sidewalks and crosswalks The law on sidewalks and crosswalks is not always well-developed, since other vehicles are not allowed there. Some states and municipalities forbid bicycle riding on sidewalks unless otherwise marked. Others allow it unless otherwise marked. Some require that riders use only the sidewalk on the right or left side of the roadway (whichever is the normal direction of travel on the roadway). A few laws may prohibit riding in crosswalks. Many laws specify that right-of-way must be given to pedestrians, and that an audible signal must be given when overtaking a pedestrian on a sidewalk. Motor vehicles are often prohibited from crossing a sidewalk until right-of-way has been given to approaching pedestrians and bicyclists. Most bicycle safety manuals recommend stopping and walking at crosswalks when riding down a sidewalk. But few laws actually make that requirement. When it has come up in courts, many judges have decided that riding a bicycle across a crosswalk is covered under the specific laws for pedestrians rather than those concerning vehicles. Some municipalities have push buttons for pedestrians to receive a pedestrian crossing signal. When a bicyclist is using a crosswalk, it is advisable to follow the pedestrian laws. Some municipalities have push buttons or automatic sensors labeled for bicyclists only. In many cases, there is no specific law requiring the bicyclist to push the button when riding on the street, and in many cases the buttons are so awkwardly positioned that the bicyclist does not encounter them as a road sign, and does not encounter them when preparing for a left turn. The light may not change without an automobile waiting at the same light. Many bicyclists seek \\"no action\\" letters from those municipalities saying that they will not get a ticket if they treat such intersections safely as a 4-way stop, proceeding only when safe to proceed. The results are not yet clear. Freeways Bicyclists are often prohibited from using freeway ramps, and, sometimes, the freeways themselves (controlled entry, controlled exit roadways). The main exception is usually that if there is no alternative road then a bicyclist may use the freeway. This is usually between cities. Some places may have signs saying that bicycle riding ends and all bicyclists must exit at the next ramp. Many have signs on the entry ramps prohibiting bicycle riding. Some laws require bicyclists not only to remain as far to the edge of the freeway as possible, but to actually ride off the freeway, on the shoulder, if one is available. Some freeways have minimum speeds to use the normal lane, but it rarely affects bicyclists because they virtually always use the shoulder, except when crossing over entry and exit ramps. Cyclists are always advised to give right-of-way to motor vehicle operators in these situations, even stopping and waiting if necessary, for safety. Off-road cycling Bicyclists are prohibited from using certain areas, usually for reasons of conservation or to preserve trails for pedestrians only. Public transportation Many municipalities allow bicycles to be attached to or carried onto buses and trains. The guidelines and requirements for safely moving and stowing the bicycle are sometimes incorporated into the general law on using the public transportation. For example, in Tempe, AZ, USA, failing to follow the storage rules on the light rail can be considered being on the train without paying the proper fare. Prohibitions in certain areas Some laws prohibit bicycle riding in commercial areas, such as on the sidewalks in front of stores. In other places a sign erected by a government must be followed, such as with no-riding zones in a college campus. Private signs are common that prohibit riding in certain areas. Specific laws may prohibit riding on store-front sidewalks or where private or government prohibitive signs are posted. In the absence of such laws, trespassing laws, although vague in scope, are sometimes used to charge the bicyclist with criminal trespassing, that is, entering the property without permission, when a no trespassing sign is posted at the property line, with permission considered withheld at the first breaking of a posted rule.

This did not happen, and the sunken vessel was discovered in 1990. Its site is a National Historic Landmark and a state-protected underwater preserve. It is believed to be the oldest intact warship in North America, and is the only surviving ship of its type.The Lost Radeau Documentary Site The site is accessible to the diving public with advanced diving skills. Description and history The Land Tortoise was built in 1758, as part of a British effort to regain control of Lake George after the loss of Fort William Henry at the south end of the lake in 1757. She was built by provincial militia forces under the direction of Captain Samuel Cobb of Falmouth, now Portland, Maine. She was built in just over a month, launched, tested (\\"rowed well with 26 oars\\") and then two days later intentionally sunk by adding ballast with plans to re-float her in the spring of 1759. The location where she was sunk was too deep for recovery, and a new radeau, the Invincible, was built in 1759. The sunken vessel lies at a depth of about in the southern basin of Lake George, about north of Lake George Beach. It is about long, and has seven sides, varying in width between . It has no keel, and was fitted with seven cannon ports. She was discovered in 1990, and was researched by a team of amateur divers guided by a professional archaeologist for four years. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998. The official National Historic Landmark plaque is located at the intersection of Beach Rd. and Fort George Rd (at the south end of Lake George).

This has turned to be of enormous importance with the development of the language industry at global scale. For the protection of both parties, standards have been developed that seek to spell out their mutual duties. History Standards of quality and documentation were originally developed for manufacturing businesses. Codes for all types of services are now maintained by standardization organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization. Standards of this type include those of the ISO 9000 series. As interest in quality management has grown, specific quality standards have been developed for translation services. These have included the Italian UNI 10574, the German DIN 2345, the Austrian Önorm D 1200 and Önorm D 1201, and the Canadian CAN CGSB 131.10. In 2015, EN 15038 was replaced by ISO 17100:2015. EN 15038 The European EN 15038 translation-services standard went into effect on August 1, 2006,EN 15038: European Quality Standard for Translation Services, Language Weaver News, Volume 3, Issue 7, July 2007 replacing the previous standards of the 30 individual CEN member countries. It aims to unify the terminology used in the translation field, define basic requirements for language-service providers (human and technical resources, quality control, and project management) and create a framework for the interaction of customers and service providers in terms of their rights and obligations. It also defines certain services, in addition to translation, that may be offered by language-service providers. A strong focus is on administrative, documentation, review and revision processes, as well as on the functions of different specialists who guide the translation project over its duration. Appendices to the standard provide information and suggestions on how best to comply with the standard. CAN CGSB 131.10-2008 On May 12, 2009, the Language Industry Association of Canada, AILIA launched the latest standards certification program in the world. The certification is based on CAN/CGSB-131.10-2008, Translation Services, a national standard developed by the Canadian General Standards Board and approved by the Standards Council of Canada. It involved the participation of representatives from AILIA, professional associations, government, academia, purchasers of service, and other stakeholders. The Canadian Standard for Translation Services CAN CGSB 131.10 - 2008 establishes and defines the requirements for the provision of translation services by translation service providers. This National Standard of Canada is a modified adoption of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) standard EN 15038 Translation Services. This document was prepared with the intent to harmonize where possible with the provisions of EN 15038 Translation Services. Variances in wording and content with EN 15038 reflect the Canadian perspective. Conformity assessment and certification based on this standard are already in place. With the recent development of national and regional standards for translation services, many translation service providers, nationally and internationally, are now in the process of either considering or seeking certification of the services they provide in meeting the demands of the marketplace. The standard specifies the requirements for the provision of translation services by the translation service provider (TSP). There are three key points common to all standards: * Select your human resources with care. * Come to an agreement on your project specifications before translation begins. * Follow the specifications at every step of the project. The CGSB 131.10 discuss the following: * Scope * Definitions * Human Resources * Technical Resources * Quality Management System * Client-TSP Relationship * TSP Project Management Procedures * Translation Process * Notes * Appendixes: ** A. Project Recording ** B. Pre-Translation Processing ** C. Additional Services The standard does not apply to interpreting or terminology services. TSPs interested in getting certified can review the AILIA Certification Preparation Guide The AILIA Translation Committee takes care of the promotion of the Canadian Translation Standard and its certification. ASTM F2575-06 The American translation-services standard is the ASTM F2575-06 Standard Guide for Quality Assurance in Translation.New ASTM Translation Standard Published, Press Room, ATA - American Translators Association It provides a framework for customers and translation-service providers desirous of agreeing on the specific requirements of a translation project. It does not provide specific criteria for translation or project quality, as these requirements may be highly individual, but states parameters that should be considered before beginning a translation project. As the document's name suggests, it is a guideline, informing stakeholders about what basic quality requirements are in need of compliance, rather than a prescriptive set of detail instructions for the translator. Criticism: over-dependence on standards There is, however, a view within the translation industry that, while not doing any actual harm, an over-reliance on such standards can give a false sense of security. Blindly following translation standards does not on its own provide real assurance regarding translation quality. The argument is that the path to quality in translation is by focusing more on providing on-going training and feedback to translators.

The Hermosa Inn has been ranked #1 Hotel in the Southwest in 2017 and 2018 in the Conde Nast Traveler Readers' Choice Awards. History Lon's at the Hermosa Cowboy artist Alonzo \\"Lon\\" Megargee purchased of land in what is now considered Paradise Valley in 1935. He built his studio of adobe bricks in the middle of the site and kept adding to it, calling his home Los Arcos and later Casa Hermosa, meaning \\"beautiful house.\\" Megargee had no formal plans for the building. Influenced by architecture he had studied in Spain and Mexico, he used old wooden beams from an abandoned mine and poured a mixture of oil and ash from the roof to age the exterior walls. Due to the extended length of the stays of many of his guests, Megargee began running a guest ranch to supplement his artist's income. Local law enforcement suspected that Megargee used the ranch for illegal gambling, so he constructed a tunnel from the main building to the stables to provide an easy escape into the desert should the law make a surprise visit. The Hermosa Inn is allegedly haunted by the ghost of its original owner, Alonzo Megargee. Guests and hotel staff have reported seeing the lanky cowboy in the inn. He is also believed to be the culprit behind toilets flushing on their own, he’s also known to break glasses and bottles late at night. Staff have reported encountering the ghost of “Lon”, appearing as a shadow wearing a cowboy hat.http://www.hauntedrooms.com/the-hermosa-inn-paradise-valley-arizona Succeeding owners renamed the property Hermosa Inn, and added a pool, tennis courts, casitas, and villas. In 1987, a fire severely damaged the original building. The property was purchased by Fred and Jennifer Unger in 1992. Following restoration of the adobe walls, charred beams, and ironwork in the main building, the property re-opened in 1994, again as the Hermosa Inn, with a restaurant - \\"Lon's at the Hermosa\\", named for Lon Megargee - occupying the original building. In 1995 the Hermosa Inn was featured in Waiting to Exhale. Whitney Houston's character celebrates New Year's Eve in Lon's main dining room. In May 2015, the Ungers sold the resort to Allred Capital LLLP, a partnership led by Ron Allred and Mike Allred. While still retaining the historic charm of the original hacienda built by the cowboy artist as his home and studio, the Allreds have improved upon the overall guest experience for future generations by adding a new entryway, resort lobby, a renovation to the historic rancho casitas, an expansion to LON’s Last Drop and the addition of multiple casitas, bringing it to its current total of 43 accommodations.

History  On record as having mastered the largest waves ridden at The Wedge, a world- famous surf spot in Newport Beach, California,Brandt, Ryan (June 9, 2006). \\"The Lure of the Wedge, California's Freakish Wave\\", The New York Times. Terry Wade has become one of the world's most recognizable names in big wave bodysurfing. Wedge riders swim out to get eaten by the monstrous waves that power in from either hurricanes off the West Coast of Mexico or storm activity in the Southern Hemisphere. Between the years of 1973 and 1998, Wade consistently made headlines, as he would sit in the water for hours waiting for the largest waves of the day. He has been called the \\"Michael Jordan of big wave bodysurfing\\" by Details Magazine.Details Magazine, April 2003 His influences and mentors include: Greg Deets, Fred Simpson, and Ron Romanosky.  In the Media  Terry Wade has been featured in close to 25 surf articles spanning nearly every surf magazine published. He has also been featured in surf films such as Thump, Bud Brown's Goin Surfin', Wavemasters, Five Summer Stories, and the soon to be released documentary by Tom Lynch specifically about The Wedge. Finally, there are countless television news pieces that cover epic days at The Wedge where Wade's surfing has been caught on tape. Nearly ten years after his last significant day surfing The Wedge, Terry Wade, still gets requests for interviews by respectable magazines such as Outside and Details. In 2016, the Film \\"Dirty Old Wedge\\" was released, chronicling a history of The Wedge as a premiere bodysurfing spot in California. Terry was featured prominently in the film and was called the \\"superstar\\" of The Wedge Crew. He was held in high esteem by his peers such as Danny Kwock, Matt Larsen, JT Nicklsen, and others who Terry has openly admired as well.  Influence  Terry was influenced by Bud Browne, Fred Simpson, and other early Wedge pioneers. He also credits many of his peers, but primarily Greg Deets for his success as an early rider. As a young man, however, it was the community of The Wedge that he feels helped him grow. Terry was among those who fought the Newport Beach City Council for the right to keep The Wedge free from surf and body boards during certain times of the day during a specified time of the year. He and other members of The Crew feel very strongly about the preservation of the sport of bodysurfing and their safety, both of which are jeopardized by board surfers and boogie board surfers, primarily the inexperienced latter. Another frustration that Terry has vocalized is that against big name surfers who bring large crews of photographers in order to turn The Wedge into a photo opportunity. He has always expressed an open invitation to anyone to bodysurf The Wedge.Duane, Daniel (August 2004). \\"The Lip Comes Down\\", Outside magazine, part 2.Weikel, Dan (September 30, 2002). \\"Time Is Wiping Out Wedge Surf Purists\\", Los Angeles Times.  Personal life  Terry has been with his wife, Mellissa, since 1991. They were married in Maui, HI, in 1993. Like many of his Wedge peers, Terry Wade suffered the consequences of such a dangerous sport. His health problems have ranged from a broken back, a broken nose, ribs, a torn rotator cuff, melanoma and non- Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous, while the Saxon Army maintained a lesser degree of autonomy. The armies of the other German states were integrated into the Prussian Army with limited autonomy. The division was formed on October 1, 1890, in Landau as the 5th Division and swapped division numbers with the Nuremberg-based 3rd Royal Bavarian Division in 1901.Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück, 1993), Bd. 1, p. 665; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deutschen Heeres (1905), pp. 1246, 1252. In Bavarian sources, it was not generally referred to as a \\"Royal Bavarian\\" division, as this was considered self-evident, but outside Bavaria, this designation was used for it, and other Bavarian units, to distinguish them from similarly numbered Prussian units. The division was part of the III Royal Bavarian Army Corps. Combat chronicle During World War I, the division served on the Western Front. It fought initially in the Battle of the Frontiers. It then served in the area between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers until October 1915, seeing action on the Meuse heights by St. Mihiel and in the Bois-brulé, and then fought in the Second Battle of Champagne. After a brief period in reserve, the division went in the trenchlines in the Meuse-Moselle region until September 1916, and then fought briefly in the Battle of the Somme, where it suffered heavy losses. From October 1916 into 1918, the division occupied the trenchlines in Flanders and the Artois, and fought in the Battle of Arras and the Battle of Passchendaele. After a month in reserve, it went into the 1918 German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). It then remained on the defensive in the region until the end of the war, including fighting in the Second Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Third Battle of the Somme. Allied intelligence rated the division as first class, although not one of the best Bavarian divisions.5\\\\.

Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from their higher headquarters. The 5th Bavarian Division was renamed the 5th Bavarian Infantry Division.

Bayerisches 3. Pionier-Bataillon Late World War I organization Divisions underwent many changes during the war, with regiments moving from division to division, and some being destroyed and rebuilt. During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\"). The 5th Bavarian Infantry Division was triangularized in January 1917, sending the 9th Bavarian Infantry Brigade headquarters and the 14th Bavarian Infantry Regiment to the newly formed 16th Bavarian Infantry Division. An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, and the engineer contingent was increased. Divisional signals commanders were established to better control communications, a major problem in coordinating infantry and artillery operations during World War I.

Bonny Doon Vineyard is a winery in Santa Cruz, California, that focuses on terroir wines. Founded by Randall Grahm in 1983, it is perhaps best known for its quirky labels, eccentric mix of grapes, and humorously- named wines—like its flagship wine, \\"Le Cigare Volant\\". It was amongst the first Californian wineries to embrace Rhone varietals, and entered the national spotlight in 1989, after Grahm appeared on the cover of Wine Spectator as \\"The Rhone Ranger.\\" The winery achieved large-scale commercial success with brands like Big House Red and Cardinal Zin, before \\"doon-sizing\\" its portfolio in 2006 to refocus its efforts on terroir wines and biodynamic practice. Bonny Doon Vineyard continues to be known for its unique label artwork, sourcing designs from artists like Chuck House, Grady McFerrin, Ralph Steadman and Gary Taxali. It was among the first premium winemakers to adopt screw caps for its wines in 2001, and in 2008 pioneered the use of transparent ingredient labeling on all of its wines. History According to Randall Grahm, Bonny Doon Vineyard began as \\"a foolish attempt to replicate Burgundy in California,\\" but after difficulty creating the \\"Great American Pinot Noir,\\" he realized that Rhône wine varieties would be better suited to the Central Coast climate than Pinot Noir grapes. Grahm began experimenting with Rhone grapes and blended wines, and in 1986, Bonny Doon Vineyard released its inaugural vintage (1984) of Le Cigare Volant, an homage to Châteauneuf-du- Pape, a wine that would become the winery's flagship label. After the vines in its own vineyard were destroyed by Pierce's disease in 1994, Bonny Doon supported its wine production by purchasing grapes from other California vineyards, as well as vineyards in Oregon (including Bethel Heights Vineyard)Anthony Dias Blue \\"New Wines Hit Market In A Veritable Deluge\\" The Evening Independent May 15th, 1985 and Europe. The winery grew significantly in this period with its popular Cardinal Zin, Big House and Pacific Rim labels, reaching peak production in 2006, after selling more than 450,000 cases of wine. The winery has changed focus in recent years from \\"every day table wines to high-end, boutique vintages\\". In 2006 it sold off its Big House and Cardinal Zin labels, and in 2010 its Pacific Rim brand. Reflecting on the decision in an interview with The New York Times, Randall said “My wines were O.K., but was I really doing anything distinctive or special? The world doesn’t need these wines — I was writing and talking about terroir but I wasn’t doing what I was saying. I wanted to be congruent with myself.” As part of his shift in focus, he acquired a 280-acre property in San Juan Bautista in 2009, \\"Popelouchum,\\" which currently serves as Bonny Doon's estate vineyard. In addition to using the property to grow terroir wines, Grahm plans to use the property to hybridize vitis vinifera grapes that he hopes will be able to withstand extreme drought and \\"possibly outsmart climate change.\\" In 2008, as part of the winery's change in strategy, it sold its old tasting room in Bonny Doon, and relocated to Santa Cruz. It currently has its administrative offices and wine cellar in Santa Cruz, and tasting room on Hwy 1 in Davenport, CA. In 2018, the flagship Le Cigare Volant was reformulated for much earlier consumption (not aging) and priced significantly lower, notably dropping Mourvèdre and using much more Cinsault; the 2018 vintage was branded \\"Le Cigare Volant Cuvée Oumuamua\\". In 2020, Grahm sold the company to WarRoom Ventures, LLC, but remained as winemaker and a partner with WarRoom. This also reduced the lineup from about 15 wines to four, all Rhone varietals, and decreasing the price to $15 to $20 per bottle: the flagship Le Cigare Volant (a red Rhone blend), Le Cigare Blanc (a Vermentino-based white blend), Vin Gris de Cigare (a Rhone-style rosé), and Picpoul (a single-varietal Rhone white). Philosophy Popelouchum, the Estate Vineyard in San Juan Bautista. Grahm, a long-time promoter of \\"terroir\\", writes on Bonny Doon's website that he \\"lives for the possibility of one day creating a wine that is also a reflection of the place from whence it derives.\\" Reflecting on the abandonment of his larger brands and criticizing the negociant-model of winery production that is dominant in the industry, he told The New York Times in an April 2009 interview, \\"You have to put your money where your mouth is. Purchased grapes are less risky, but you’re never going to make a vin de terroir.\\" As part of Grahm's vision to \\"make a wine with the softest possible hand,\\" he has been a strong proponent of biodynamic viticulture since he began adopting its practice in 2003. \\"Wines\\" he argues, \\"must be translations of the vineyard's own vitality,\\" and by focusing on soil health—\\"the real cornerstone of vitality in wines\\"—he can \\"avoid excessive manipulation,\\" and make wines that \\"can be said to be “acoustic,” or “uninflected.”\\" References External links *Bonny Doon Vineyard homepage *Inc.

The targeted users of this wireless broadband network are broadly classified as \\"people on the move\\" – people who require wireless broadband access while away from their homes, schools and offices. These include students, tourists, business travellers and enterprise users such as insurance agents and real estate agents who use widely available and wireless-enabled devices such as notebook PCs and PDAs. Once connected, users will be able to access all Internet-based services e.g. online gaming, web surfing, instant messaging, VoIP and email. History The IDA issued a Call-for-Collaboration (CFC) early 2006 for interested operators to provide such coverage. Late 2006, IDA has accepted the proposals from iCELL Network, QMAX Communications and SingTel, to kick-start the nation's progressive deployment of a widely available wireless network by September 2007. Following the announcement on 10 October 2006 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, that Singapore will get to enjoy two years of free wireless broadband connections from January next year. IDA announced on 30 November 2006 that the three Wireless@SG operators have extended this free offering to three years. Users started to enjoy wireless connectivity from 1 December 2006, one month ahead of schedule at selected hotspots. On 31 May 2007, Network deployment for all Primary Catchment Areas in all Regions was completed with the Secondary Catchment Areas in all Regions was completed on 30 September 2007. The CFC on Wireless Broadband Market Development was scheduled to be completed on 31 December 2008. It has two main objectives of: *Accelerating the deployment of wireless broadband by providing coverage in locations where users out of their homes, schools and offices can conveniently access wireless broadband services using data-centric computing devices. *Catalysing the demand for wireless broadband services by increasing the number of wireless broadband users. On 16 June 2009, the government announced an extension of the programme until March 2013 and enhancement of speed up to 1Mbit/s. Access speeds were increased to 1 Mbit/s in 2008, and 2 Mbit/s in 2009.Singapore to double speed of free public Wi-Fi ZDNet In September 2009, M1 Limited acquired local connectivity provider, Qala Singapore, taking over QMax's Wireless@SG service.Singapore's M1 acquires Net player Qala ZDNet Funding from IDA has stopped since April 2013 for the \\"deployment and operations costs of Wireless@SG\\" hot spots. It was reported the main newspaper that the number of hotspots had dipped. Some malls will be left without the free WIFI hotspots. On 1 April 2013, StarHub and Y5Zone were added to the list of Wireless@SG operators, while iCELL was dropped as the company's proposal did not meet IDA's requirements for the next deployment phase of the programme and will remain support until 30 June 2013. On 11 April 2016, Parliament announced that the surfing speeds of Wireless@SG will be increased to 5 Mbit/s, up from 2Mbit/s. The number of hotspots will also double to 20,000. Operators Current *Singtel *M1 *StarHub *MyRepublic Previous *QMAX *iCELL *Y5Zone Coverage To access Wireless@SG, users need to be located within the respective Wireless@SG coverage areas. The list of hotspots include shopping centres, libraries, museums, public swimming pools, cafes, restaurants, fast food joints and other public venues. The latest coverage areas can be found at Google Earth and at the IDA portal. Accessing the network To connect to the Wireless@SG wireless broadband network, a user just needs a WiFi-enabled device (such as a laptop, mobile phone, or tablet), and a mobile number. With this registered account, the user is able to roam within any of Wireless@SG's coverage areas, regardless of the operators' network. Available login methods include: SIM-based authentication (EAP-SIM), Seamless and Secure Access (PEAP with EAP-MSCHAPv2), and HTTP-based login (Captive portal). Users are encouraged by the IDA to install and activate a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other encryption mechanism, Personal firewall; and Anti-virus software with the latest signature files. The IDA also encourages users to avoid ad hoc wireless networking to safeguard their security.

Research  Jackson specialises in the study of human-plant coevolution and anthropological genetics. For example, genetic changes in human evolution due to cultural migrations. Another example is the influence of phytochemicals on human metabolic effects. At the Cobb Research Lab, Jackson conducts studies on African American biological history with access to the largest collection of African American skeletal and dental remains in the world. In 2008, Jackson published a paper using the method of ethnogenetic layering (EL) for analysis of health disparities across microethic groups (MEG). The current use of racial models for analysis of variation in disease may fail to capture medically relevant information. EL relies on computational approaches by using GIS-facilitated maps to produce geographical regional profiles which are used to better understand disease risk.

It was later ported to the Sega Saturn. It is the second entry in the Mahou Daisakusen series, but the first to be a shooter/racing hybrid.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. The game consists of a vertically scrolling field where the player races against seven contestants while shooting enemies and avoiding enemy bullets. Tapping the fire button fires the player's weapons; holding it down gives the player a speed boost. In addition to these speed boosts, overall speed will increase or decrease depending on screen position (the higher up the player craft is onscreen, the faster it travels). Overall speed decreases every time a life is lost or the next stage is reached. The player is also given a limited amount of bombs which destroy most on-screen enemies and slow down the opponent racers. There are four power-ups in Kingdom Grandprix. All have a cumulative effect on overall power except the bomb which simply increases the number of times it has been used. The game has a total of twelve stages in a branching path configuration. In most cases, there is a choice of two stages for each level. There is only one choice for the first level, and there are three choices for the sixth level. Beating the first loop of the game in one credit and finishing first overall unlocks the second loop, where all the stages not selected in the first loop are played.  Synopsis   Plot  For decades the kingdom has been ravaged by war. Too many innocents have suffered and legions of good men have lost their lives in battle. The king had an idea to stop the war; he would hold a big race that would encompass every part of the kingdom. Everyone from each part of the kingdom was invited to participate. The wars ceased and the people began looking forward to this competition every year.  Characters   Development  Kingdom Grand Prix was developed by Raizing. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ).  Release  Kingdom Grand Prix was first released in arcades by Eighting across Japan and Europe on September 1994. During its initial launch, the game did not received a CD music album release until April 24, 2013, which was published by Wave Master. The game was later released for the Sega Saturn by GAGA Communications on June 14, 1996. The Saturn version includes a shooting- only mode, where the racing aspect is removed and the player is left to play the game at their own pace.  Reception  Kingdom Grand Prix was well received. Three reviewers from the Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine rated it a 5.33 out of 10. The four reviewers of Famitsu gave the Saturn version a score of 60 out of 100. François Garnier French magazine Consoles + gave it a review score of ninety percent. Olivier Prézeau of French magazine Joypad gave it a three out of five score. GameSetWatchs Todd Ciolek gave the game an overall mixed outlook, stating that \\"it's a true curiosity, even if its one unique idea doesn’t quite work. And it’s still one to try, as both a solid twitch- game and a glimpse of one shooter developer’s attempt at something different, if not necessarily better.\\" Hardcore Gaming 101s Kurt Kalata gave it a mostly positive retrospective outlook.

Museo del Prado. Cristóbal García Salmerón (c.1603, Cuenca – c.1666, Madrid,?) was a Spanish painter of the Baroque period. Life and works There is very little biographical data available. It is generally assumed that he was a student of Pedro Orrente, either in Cuenca or Toledo, but no documentary evidence supports it. Most likely it was Toledo, as his work also shows the influence of Luis Tristán and Juan Bautista Maíno. His first signed work, \\"San Julián, obispo de Cuenca\\", created for Málaga Cathedral in 1673, owes some obvious debt to Orrente as well as Vicente Carducho. In Cuenca Cathedral there is a signed work on the altar, depicting Saint John the Baptist. In 1642, when King Philip IV passed through Cuenca, he painted a bullfight that had been held for the occasion. That work received great praise from the art historian Antonio Palomino, when he saw it at the Royal Alcázar of Madrid. In 1648, he received a commission to create a series of portraits of apostles and prophets for the nave of Cuenca Cathedral. These later formed the background for engravings of the cathedral by Hans Vredeman de Vries. He is also credited with a series of half-body apostles carrying signs with verses from the Creeds, of which many copies were made. Some are now in the Museo del Prado. At an unknown date, he moved to Madrid, which is attested by the presence of several works in his style; notably at the Convento del Carmen Calzado.

Biography Grayson was born in 1967 in Palmerston North, New Zealand. She trained in film and media studies at Victoria University of Wellington. In the early 1990s she moved to New York for a period, before moving to Sydney, and later to Melbourne. She trained at the RMIT School of Art, and held an exhibition in the School's gallery in 2009. No conclusions drawn – self portrait (2008) In 2008, Grayson was working in a studio in Melbourne. In September that year, it was announced that she had won that year's Dobell Prize for Drawing, displayed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, in a competition that had 586 entries. The competition was judged by a former Queensland Art Gallery curator, Anne Kirker. Grayson's work, in pencil, charcoal and watercolour, was titled No conclusions drawn – self portrait. It portrays the artist standing in her studio. Grayson observed that the work reflected her \\"state of uncertainty\\" about her artistic output at that time, during which she regularly destroyed her drawings in \\"fits of frustration\\". The Sydney Morning Herald arts writer Louise Schwartzkoff described the portrait as \\"sombre\\", where the subject \\"stares grimly into the distance\\". When asked what she would do with the AUS$20,000 money from the Dobell Prize, she responded that she \\"wouldn't mind getting my ute fixed\\". Robert Nelson, writing for The Age, considered Grayson's drawing to be influenced by Alberto Giacometti, and \\"is curious and inquiring, as if always searching for the place, ratios and weight of her motif\\".

It was not a university in the modern sense, but a loosely organized scholastic community that endured for many centuries during the medieval period. History Timbuktu quickly grew in importance by the start of the 12th century, with a thriving economy based on trading salt, gold, spices, slaves and dyes. As the wealth of the city grew, it also became a center of learning, attracting scholars and manuscripts. It acquired a reputation for learning and scholarship across the Muslim world. According to African scholar Shamil Jeppie in The Meanings of Timbuktu: > ...Timbuktu is a repository of history, a living archive which anybody with > a concern for African history should be acquainted with. Timbuktu may be > hard to get to but it played an essential role as a centre of scholarship > under the Songhay state until the invasion from the rulers of Marrakesh in > 1591, and even thereafter it was revived.Shamil Jeppie & Souleymane Bachir > Diagne (eds). The Meanings of Timbuktu. HSRC Pess: Cape Town, 2008 After Timbuktu was occupied because of the 1591 Battle of Tondibi, the university went into decline. In 1593, Ahmad I al-Mansur cited \\"disloyalty\\" as the reason for arresting, and subsequently killing or exiling, many of Timbuktu's scholars, including Ahmad Baba al Massufi. The university The University of Timbuktu was unlike the modern university in that there was no central organization or formal course of study. Instead, there were several independent schools, each having its own principal instructor. Students chose their teachers, and instruction took place in mosque courtyards or private residences. The primary focus was on study of the Quran and Islamic subjects, but academic subjects were also taught, such as \\"medicine and surgery, anatomy, botany, evolution, physiology and zoology, astronomy, anthropology, cartography, geodesy, geology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy, language and linguistics, geography, history, as well as art.\\" Teachers associated with the Sankore mosque and the mosque itself were especially respected for learning. It boasted up to 25,000 students out of a total city population of 100,000. Noted scholars associated with the institution include: * Mohammed Bagayogo (1523-1593), associated with the Sankore masajid * Ahmad Baba al Massufi (1556-1627), a student of Mohammed Bagayogo and the author of more than 40 books; deported to Morocco in 1594 The mosques The ‘University of Timbuktu’ was associated with three mosques and made Timbuktu an important centre for when it came to the propagation of Islamic culture. The Djingareyber Mosque was initially built when Sultan Kankan Moussa had returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca, but was reconstructed between 1570 and 1583 by Imam Al Aqib, who was the Qadi of Timbuktu. He added the southern portion of the mosque as well as the wall which surrounds the cemetery which is situated to the west of it. The Djingareyber Mosque minaret is among the most noticeable landmarks of the Timbuktu landscape with its dominating structure. The next mosque, the Sankore Mosque, followed a similar trend to the Djingareyber Mosque in the sense that it was restored by the Imam Al Aqib in the 14th century between 1578 and 1582. The sanctuary was knocked down and rebuilt to be in accordance with the dimensions of the Kaaba of Mecca. The third and final mosque, the Sidi Yahia Mosque, located to the south of the aforementioned Sankore Mosque, was erected at around 1400 by the marabout Sheikh El Moktar Hamalla. It was built with the expectation of a holy man who would emerge some forty years later as Cherif Sidi Yahia, who would then be chosen as the Imam. Much like the other two mosques, Sidi Yahia was also restored by Imam Al Aqib from 1577-1588. These mosques of Timbuktu have played a key role in the expansion of Islam in the African continent at this fairly early stage. The three mosques of Timbuktu have lived through the golden age of when Timbuktu was an intellectual and spiritual centre of the Askia dynasty. In addition to that, these three Mosques are also witnesses to the commercial role that Timbuktu played in the southern trans-Saharan trading route. These mosques are also prime examples of earthen architecture and of traditional maintenance techniques, something which continues to persist to the present day. Notable scholars Ahmad Baba Abu 'l-'Abbas Ahmad Baba bin Ahmad bin Ahmad bin 'Umar bin Muhammad Aqit al-Sinhaji, al-Timbukti was born at Araouane on 21 Dhu 'l-Hijja 963/26 October 1556. He was raised in Timbuktu where he began studying under his father Ahmad, his uncle Abu Bakr and Ahmad b. Mohammad, who was a more distant relative of his. However, his principal teacher was Muhammad b. Mahmud b. Abu Bakr al-Wangari, a well known and respected scholar at the time. He studied the main disciplines pertaining to Islamic learning of his time under Wangari, including 'arabiyya, bayan, usul, mantiq and tafsir, with his speciality being on Maliki fiqh. Little is known about Timbukti’s scholarly work in Timbuktu prior to his deportation to Morocco in 1594 with many of the other members of the Aqit family he belonged to, a family at the time known for producing scholars, since they were accused of undermining the rule and authority of the Moroccan invaders. He arrived in Marrakesh on 1 Ramadan 1002/21 May 1594, where he was either jailed or at the very least put under house arrest. This was for two years until he was released on 21 Ramadan 1004/19 May 1596. However, the Sultan had decided to keep him in Morocco. He taught at the Jami' al-Shurafa' in Marrakesh during his time in Morocco, and attracted many students and even scholars to come hear him. Although not much is known about the chronology of his works, he most definitely wrote the Nail al-ibtihaj, his major work, as well as its abridgement, Kifayat al-muhtaj, whilst he was still in Morocco. Timbukti, after being released by the Sultan Moulay Zaidan, had finally arrived back in Timbuktu on 10 Dhu 'l-Qa'da 1016/26 February 1608. The Nail al-ibtihaj bi- tatriz al-Dibaj was his greatest contribution to scholarship and was a biographical dictionary of Maliki jurisprudents, containing within it a voluminous amount of information on North African scholars and is the primary source of information for when it comes to the life and works produced by medieval West African Muslim scholars. He died on 6 Sha'ban 1036/22 April 1627. Manuscripts The Timbuktu manuscripts were produced in the Arabic script and were primarily written in the Arabic language but other local languages such as Fulfulde, Songhai, Soninke and Bambara were also featured. In regards to the physical appearance of these manuscripts, they were mainly found in a collection of loose leaves placed within a loose cover or even just tightened with a ribbon. Due to the lack of a sewing structure or any link between the text blocks and covers, knowing whether any bookbinding structures existed or not is a difficult task for many codicologists. What further complicates this is that covers wrapping numerous leaves may have been moved from one text block to another. A manuscript could consist of a variety of texts and documents and can be made of a varying number of leaves ranging from just a few to a few hundred. Today, the Timbuktu manuscripts are primarily preserved in private families which are where they have traditionally been kept and in the Ahmed Baba Institute, a state run entity. However, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) captured northern Mali and destroyed many of the manuscripts in an attempt to implement their jihad against any idea or practice which did not conform to their own vision of a pure Islamic society. However, AQIM had only destroyed a portion of the manuscripts as most of them were taken outside of the city to the capital, Bamako, in an initiative led by Abdel Kader Haidara, the son of a respected Malian scholar, Mohammed ‘Mamma’ Haidara, who in addition to being a scholar was also the owner of a family library which had a considerable amount of manuscripts. Haidara did this with the help of the NGO SAVAMA-DCI (Sauvegarde et Valorisation des Manuscripts pour la Défense de la Culture Islamique), which Haidara is the Executive President of. Haidara worked alongside members of the local community in an effort to remove the manuscripts from areas which were susceptible to AQIM activity.

Sexual harassment allegations and ouster On August 4, 2017, HuffPost reported that several years before and on separate occasions, Bolling allegedly sent unsolicited lewd text messages and lewd photos to three female colleagues at Fox News or Fox Business Network. He is also accused of making \\"wildly inappropriate\\" comments to female employees. After the article was published, Caroline Heldman, a former Fox News guest, alleged that Bolling made numerous unwanted sexual advances towards her. Bolling denied the allegations against him. The day after the article was published, Bolling was suspended from Fox News pending an investigation, which the network commissioned the law firm Paul, Weiss to conduct. A few days after the article was published, Bolling filed a summons and \\"notice of an intent to file a defamation lawsuit\\" in New York state court for $50 million against freelance writer Yashar Ali, who wrote the story for HuffPo. Bolling's summons did not specify the statements he contended were defamatory, and he did not bring an actual complaint against Ali. Ali and HuffPo stood by the accuracy of the article; Ali's lawyer, in a letter to Bolling's lawyer, wrote that any lawsuit would be frivolous because Bolling is a public figure, because \\"Mr. Ali conducted a thorough investigation and verified his information with 14 independent sources,\\" and because \\"truth is always a defense to defamation.\\" On September 8, 2017, Bolling was ousted from Fox News.

Bolling began hosting America This Week, which is produced by Sinclair Broadcast Group and carried by their stations as a Sunday morning talk show, in 2019. In 2020, Bolling conducted an interview for America This Week with Judy Mikovits, a discredited researcher featured in the video Plandemic. The video promotes baseless conspiracy theories regarding the coronavirus pandemic, including false suggestion that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's chief infectious disease scientist, \\"manufactured\\" COVID-19. In the segment, Bolling also interviewed Mikovits's lawyer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist Larry Klayman. During the interviews, Bolling made no meaningful attempt to challenge Mikovits or Klayman on their claims. After the plans to air the segment on local Sinclair stations across the U.S. generated an outcry, Sinclair postponed the segment to \\"rework\\" it before dropping the segment entirely two days later.

One of Vanguard's greatest successes was 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs (1933), an exposé about dangerous consumer products written by Arthur Kallet, who three years later would found the Consumers Union and Consumer Reports magazine. It was followed by a sequel nearly as successful called 'Counterfeit', in which the author called for the end of production for profit, and identified himself as a Communist. Among many novels of social realism, Vanguard published more than 30 books by James T. Farrell. Those comprising his Studs Lonigan trilogy (collected in a single volume in 1935) and Donald Henderson Clarke's Female (1933) were the subject of bitter court fights on obscenity charges.\\"Book Found Obscene\\"; The New York Times, August 25, 1933. \\"Berg Conviction Upheld\\"; The New York Times, November 20, 1935 \\"Vanguard was singled out in the censorship controversies,\\" wrote media historian John Tebbel, \\"not only because it published Our Fair City, edited by Robert Allen, a collection of essays demonstrating that civic corruption had not changed since the days of Lincoln Steffens, but because it had issued Calder Willingham's End as a Man, an indictment of military school life, and James Farrell's Studs Lonigan trilogy. Vanguard was also under investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee on the ground that in the twenties and thirties it had published some books by Communist and left-wing writers. HUAC later apologized for the investigation.\\"Tebbel, John, Between Covers: The Rise and Transformation of Book Publishing in America. New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987, p. 454 It was discovered it had purged its membership of communists in the late 1940s, including founder Arthur Kallet. The Vanguard Press earned a reputation for publishing promising new fiction, poetry, literature for children and young adults, and non-fiction. Vanguard published the first two books of Dr. Seuss and Saul Bellow, and the first books of Nelson Algren, Calder Willingham and Marshall McLuhan. It published Auntie Mame (1955), a comic novel rejected by a dozen publishers before it became a runaway bestseller.\\"James Henle, 81, Former Head of the Vanguard Press, Is Dead\\"; The New York Times, January 11, 1973 Vanguard published Pierre Boulle's The Bridge over the River Kwai (1954) and Planet of the Apes (1963). It published Joyce Carol Oates' first book, and 20 more — including her novel, Them, winner of the National Book Award in 1970. Evelyn Shrifte, an editor who had joined the Vanguard Press in the early 1930s, became its president in 1952. She was one of the first women to head a book publishing company.Woo, Elaine, \\"Obituaries: Evelyn Shrifte, Longtime Head of Vanguard Press\\"; Los Angeles Times, September 8, 1999 Sale to Random House Evelyn Shrifte had been president of the Vanguard Press for 36 years when, in October 1988, the company was sold to Random House. She told The New York Times that the sale of the 62-year-old independent publishing house was prompted by the poor health of some of Vanguard's investors. The valuable 500-title backlist of the Vanguard Press was merged into that of Random House, although for 10 years they were to be identified on the title page as Vanguard Press books. \\"Random House will take good care of our books and authors,\\" Shrifte said. \\"But it's as if all my children were being sent to a foster home. I'm trying not to cry while I break the news to our authors.\\" The archives of the Vanguard Press from its conceptual origins in 1925 through approximately 1985, including over 129,000 documents, was donated by Random House to Columbia University in New York City in 1989. Evelyn Shrifte's papers are in the collection of Syracuse University.Evelyn Shrifte Collection Relating to Vanguard Press, Syracuse University Library Vanguard Publishing An unrelated imprint, Vanguard Productions, was founded by J.

John Paul College is a secondary school in Rotorua, New Zealand. It caters for year 7 to 13 boys and girls and offers a Catholic education to its students. It was opened in 1987 and combined two existing schools, Edmund Rice College (for boys) and MacKillop College (for girls).Graeme Donaldson, To All Parts of the Kingdom: Christian Brothers In New Zealand 1876–2001, Christian Brothers New Zealand Province, Christchurch, 2001. The school was founded to serve the Catholic families of Rotorua. John Paul College was named for Pope John Paul II. Roll John Paul College has a diverse, multicultural roll. In 2010, its ethnic composition was: NZ European/Pākehā 66%; Māori 14%; Asian 11%; Pacific 4%; Korean 3%; Indian 2%; Filipino 2% and Other 9% The college supports a wide range of cultural and sporting activities and students have gained many successes at regional and national levels. Academically, the school offers for senior years the National Certificate of Educational Achievement assessment system (NCEA). As of 2011, it has a maximum school roll of 1,100 students, not counting international students. College John Paul College considers itself to be a Lasallian School whose mission is to form a Community where teachers and students can live their faith and become the persons that God wants them to be. \\"We believe that the love of Christ binds us together as children of God, peoples of all races and conditions, rich or poor, bright or otherwise, for all are made in God's Image and are members of His family. On this faith rests the mutual love and respect that is fostered between teacher and student in our Schools. We believe as lay colleagues to the De La Salle Brothers we give testimony to the Providence and Presence of God as we educate the young in the tradition of Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, giving attention to all and especially to pupils whose development is hindered by economics, personal and other problems.\\"Bridget (Anderson) Hodder, p. 60 (sourced from; \\"2002, History of the College\\"): \\"John Baptist De La Salle (1651–1719): In 1998, at the invitation of the Bishop, the association of the College with the De La Salle Brothers began with the establishment of a Brother's community. This association was formalised in 1999 with a request from the Board of trustees that John Paul College become a Lasallian Associated School. This association in no way lessens the contribution of the Christian Brothers or the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, but strengthens and consolidates the spirits given to the College by these two Congregations for all to come to know the mind and heart of Jesus\\". The college sees itself as \\"a top performing state-integrated Catholic school\\" and as \\"the largest co-educational Catholic School in New Zealand\\". As \\"a Lasallian school in the Catholic tradition\\" it is \\"linked to other faiths through its network of similar schools and universities around the world.\\" It promotes excellence in the academic, sporting and cultural spheres and has comprehensive systems of pastoral care and support to \\"ensure that each individual student can flourish to his or her fullest potential.\\" Most of the school's classrooms have been rebuilt \\"over the last seven years.\\" A gymnasium and performing arts centre have been recently built. WiFi is accessible in the classrooms to enable students to use their digital devices for learning. There is also a dedicated music suite with practice rooms and recording studio. The school has a large grass sports field and nine astro-turf courts for tennis, netball and hockey. There are many sporting facilities available in Rotorua for students' use. On 12 February 2015, the Bishop Denis Browne, Emeritus Bishop of Hamilton, opened the eponymous \\"Denis Browne Centre\\" which is a state of the art technology building accommodating Woodwork, Metalwork, Art, Photography and Graphics. Houses The John Paul College Houses, colours and eponymsJohn Paul College houses are: * Kanea -yellow – Kanea was the daughter of Mita Taupopoki, the distinguished leaders of Tuhourangi. Like her father, who was an astute man, Kanea was blessed with outstanding qualities of mind. All her life she practised the virtues of her Catholic faith. She was a role model for the young women of Te Arawa in the exemplary manner in which she lived her life. She was a descendant of Hinemoa and Tutanekai. * La Salle – purple – Saint John Baptist de La Salle (1651–1719) was a prominent Catholic saint in France who made it his life's work to help improve the education of children. He founded an order known as the Brothers of the Christian Schools (now known as the De La Salle Brothers). He is the Patron Saint of Teachers and his feast day is 7 April. \\"In 1998, at the invitation of the Bishop, the association of the College with the De La Salle Brothers began with the establishment of a Brother's community.\\" * McKenna – blue – Father Daniel McKenna was a Mill Hill Missionary born in the city of Limerick, Ireland on 6 December 1911. Educated in Ireland he moved to New Zealand after becoming a Priest on 9 July 1939. He was Parish priest of Saint Michael's from December 1951 until the creation of St Mary's Parish in 1954, when he became its first parish priest. He remained priest of this Parish for the next 30 years. He was instrumental in the creation of the Catholic primary schools and in establishing both McKillop College and Edmund Rice College. He died on 14 January 1983 * MacKillop – green – Mother Mary Helen MacKillop (15 January 18428 August 1909) also known as Saint Mary of the Cross, an Australian nun, who, together with Father Julian Tenison Woods, founded the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart who founded Catholic education in Rotorua and who staffed MacKillop College. * Rice – red – Edmund Ignatius Rice was the founder of the Christian Brothers in 1802. The order arrived in New Zealand in 1876 and they provided staff for Edmund Rice College for the 25 years of its existence and for John Paul College in its early years. Principals * Mr Jack Griffith 1986 – 1988 (Foundation Principal)Bridget (Anderson) Harrod, p. 61. * Mr Steve Robb 1989 – 1995 * Mr Bede Roughton 1996 – 2002 * Mr Patrick Walsh 2003 – (Current Principal) Antecedents Sisters of St Joseph In 1902, Mother Mary MacKillop (St Mary of the Cross), the founder of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, went to Rotorua during the last of her four visits to New Zealand. Her doctors had suggested that she might find in the mineral waters some relief from the rheumatic condition that was progressively limiting her activities and causing her considerable distress. In the course of her treatment, on 11 May 1902, she suffered a severe stroke and she seemed near death. As soon as she was recovered sufficiently to be moved, Bishop Lenihan, the fifth Catholic Bishop of Auckland, arranged for her to be transported by rail to Auckland where she convalesced at the Remuera convent for the best part of a year.Sister Anne Marie Power R.S.J., Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart: New Zealand Story 1883–1997, Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, revised edition, Auckland 1997, pp 141–45.] \\"It was evidently during her stay in Rotorua that Mother Mary MacKillop saw the great need for a Catholic school there, and set the arrangements in motion.\\" Father Kreijmborg, Mill Hill missionary priest, in 1902, built a school near the lake in St Michael's Parish and prepared a convent for the sisters who arrived the following year. By 1922 the School was proving inadequate for the number of children seeking admission. The decision was made to build a new school in Ranolf Street; St Joseph's School opened in 1924. The school included a secondary department. \\"[I]n 1954 the staffing levels at St Joseph's, Rotorua, had reached chronic levels. Class sizes were 57, 75, 78, 80 and 100. The educational impact was severe and struggling staff were advised by the Diocesan Director of Schools on how to 'ensure at least some people progress until staffing can be improved'.\\"Dominic O'Sullivan and Cynthia Piper (eds), Turanga nagatahi: Standing Together: The Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, 1840–2005, Dunmore Press for the Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, 2005, p. 96 This led to the secondary section being closed in 1957, with the only available options for Rotorua Catholic families being at that time Rotorua Boys' High School, Rotorua Girls' High School or a boarding school outside Rotorua.Donaldson, p. 15. There was a strong demand for Catholic secondary education in Rotorua in the late 1950s. Population growth had been high in the Bay of Plenty area, starting in 1950. This growth was contributed to by Forestry, farming and tourism developments. The population of Rotorua was under 10,000 in 1945 but reached 20,000 by 1963. Edmund Rice College In 1959, the seventh Catholic Bishop of Auckland, Archbishop Liston, made a request to the Christian Brothers (already established in the diocese at St Peter's College, Auckland) to establish a secondary school for boys in Rotorua.(The diocese of Hamilton, in which Rotorua is located, was not established until 1981.) In 1962 the Christian Brothers decided to go ahead with the Rotorua foundation. The site for the college already existed. In 1946, Catholic land-owner Patrick Keaney had bequeathed 4 acres 27 perches to the Parish of St Mary. In 1958 a further 10 acres 2 roods were purchased. The building of the school commenced in 1962.Bridget (Anderson) Harrod (ed.), 100 Years Catholic Education in Rotorua 1903–2003, St Mary's Catholic Primary School, Rotorua, 2004, p. 39. Edmund Rice College was officially opened in July 1963. On the first day, the college had a roll of 115 boys, of whom 25% were Maori.Bridget (Anderson) Harrod, p. 40. \\"Edmund Rice College school bell rang for the first time in 1963 to the sounds of a construction site. Hammers punctuated English lessons and Maths was conducted as the building multiplies in size around the 115 founding students. It was a rugged start to Rotorua's first Catholic boys' college. The boys were pioneers. The facilities in the early days were very basic. The ovals were just farm fields, the buildings were not complete. Nonetheless, in its opening year the school field[s] sports teams, sent a contingent to Tauranga to meet the Queen and staged a musical. Parents took time off to develop the playing fields and roads. The opening year, 1963, was 201 years after the birth of the school's namesake and founder of the Christian Brothers, Edmund Ignatius Rice. Edmund Rice College was fully staffed by Christian Brothers when it opened but gradually lay teachers were employed as fewer Brothers became available. The college became a State- integrated school in 1983, as a Form 3–7 Secondary College with an attached intermediate School.\\" MacKillop College MacKillop College (named after Mary MacKillop (St Mary of the Cross)) for girls was opened by the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart on 14 February 1966, on a site adjoining Edmund Rice College, with a foundation roll of 146 girls in Forms I, II and III. The day began with an assembly at which Father D McKenna, parish priest of St Mary's, Rotorua, blessed the five rooms ready for immediate use and he blessed a crucifix for each room. Work had started building the college in 1965. The buildings were finally completed in 1975.Bridget (Anderson) Hodder, p. 46. MacKillop College was officially opened by Archbishop Liston on 8 May 1966.Bridget (Anderson) Hodder, p. 49. Difficulties in providing a wide range of subjects at senior level resulted in sharing classes with Edmund Rice College. This was convenient also because the two colleges were situated so closely to each other. In general, the girls went to Edmund Rice College for the science subjects while the boys took languages and biology at MacKillop College.Donaldson, p. 16 \\"Integration brought an interesting situation. MacKillop was structured as a 'Form 1–7' school, while Edmund Rice was deemed to be a 'secondary school with an attached intermediate'. This meant teachers working [in] the Form 1 and 2 classes in each school were on different pay scales and the schools were staffed according to two different formulae. And this for schools which were about 200 metres apart!\\" Amalgamation The cost of upgrading the schools when they were integrated and the need to ensure that facilities were not duplicated led Bishop Gaines, the first Catholic Bishop of Hamilton, to decide to amalgamate the schools. The Education Department estimated the cost of upgrading Edmund Rice and MacKillop Colleges to meet integration requirements at $1.2 million.Dominic O'Sullivan and Cynthia Piper. (eds), pp. 105–06. \\"The decision was surprisingly controversial, and the consultation process could have been done better. There was a feeling among some that the decision to amalgamate had been taken, and that any consultation was simply 'going through the motions'.\\" \\"Bishop Gaines drove the change and it was his financial genius which pulled off the sale, and later the purchase back of [the] McKillop [College site], for a very healthy profit to the school. The funds from the initial sale enabled John Paul College to build and refurbish, to meet the needs of the growing numbers of students.\\" The amalgamation was completed in May 1987 and Edmund Rice College and MacKillop College closed. Edmund Rice College was in its 25th year. The Christian Brothers Community was reduced to three, was relocated in rented accommodation nearby, and the Brothers former home became the administration centre of John Paul College. In May 1987, John Paul College opened its doors to 687 students. For a time the new school operated in both places, but the former Edmund Rice College was chosen for the new site because it had more potential for development.Bridget (Anderson) Hodder, p. 57 At the end of 1989 the Christian Brothers Community was withdrawn from Rotorua. The MacKillop buildings have produced rental income for the college. Legacy Sister Anne Marie Power R.S.J. has said that Mary MacKillop (St Mary of the Cross) \\"would have a smile of approval for this important educational venture which is doing so much for the Catholic youth of Rotorua – a place very dear to her heart for the care that was afforded her there in a time of failing health, and especially because it was she herself who initiated the founding of the first Catholic school in Rotorua.\\"Sister Anne Marie Power R.S.J., Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart: New Zealand Story 1883–1997, Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, revised edition, Auckland 1997, p. 148.

While the first Christmas tree farm may have appeared as early as 1901, Christmas tree production in the United States was largely limited to what could be harvested from natural forests until the 1950s. Among the important Christmas tree producing areas in the U.S. are Wisconsin, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and the Pacific Northwest. In 2002 Christmas tree production in the United States totaled 20.8 million trees and the U.S. was one of the world's leading producers of natural Christmas trees. That same year, Pennsylvania was the top producer in the United States.

Other changes were taking place as well, in the late 1940s and early 1950s farmers began to shear trees in response to customer demand for denser trees. During the 1960s the market for Christmas trees in the United States began to change. The number of part-time growers declined, while some part-time growers ceased operations others expanded their operations and became full-time Christmas tree farmers. Expansion occurred in all major U.S. Christmas tree growing regions, Michigan, the Pacific Northwest and North Carolina. The number of plantings increased during the late 1970s and continued to do so into the 1980s. From 1977 to 1979 total U.S. production reached about 29 million Christmas trees annually. One species, Scots Pine was planted in numbers which far exceeded demand for the product. As the number of individual farmers increased, better marketing strategies and promotion programs were developed. Helicopters became a fixture on large farms during the early 1980s as growers used them to move trees from the field to the shipping yard. Between 1988 and 1994 U.S. the number of Christmas trees harvested in the U.S. was about 34–36 million per year.Pollack, Susan, et al., \\"Christmas Trees: An Economic Assessment of the Feasibility of Providing Multiple-Peril Crop Insurance \\", USDA Economic Research Service, February 13, 1995.

Marincello was a failed development project in Marin County, California that would have put a planned community atop the Marin Headlands, overlooking the Golden Gate. Its upheaval set the precedent for Marin County's rigid anti-development stance and push for open space. History Pre-Marincello years The land making up the Marin Headlands was purchased by the US military in 1851, shortly after California became a state, for the installation of coastal defense guns. Other than building Forts Barry, Baker, and Cronkhite, and planting trees and vegetation to camouflage the forts from attack, the Marin Headlands was left in its native form. Its unique topography helped serve its purpose for the Army. Bay Nature: Wild Legacy of the Marin Headlands By the 1950s, the military installations were becoming obsolete and the government started to look into future plans for the land. Environmentalists urged the military to give the land to the Department of Parks and Recreation to preserve its native and open quality. They also lobbied to make the forts a historic area and part of a Marin Headlands State Park. Sale of the land By the 1960s, the rise of the suburb was in full effect in the United States, and it looked like the pristine land atop the Marin Headlands (only minutes away from San Francisco) would prove no different. A developer from Bridgeport, Connecticut named Thomas Frouge came across the area and immediately had grand visions for the land, writing “It is probably the most beautiful location in the United States for a new community.\\" With help from Gulf Oil, he purchased the of land and made immediate plans for his new planned community to be called \\"Marincello.\\" Marincello was originally conceived to house up to 30,000 people in 50 apartment towers, as well as hundreds of homes and townhouses. There would also be a mall and a grand hotel at the highest point of the headlands. FogBay: 256 - Marincello, Marin County A 3D model and proposed drawings were quickly created to start a sales pitch for the houses and apartments in this new city. These demonstrated how this native land was to be built upon in an unprecedented scale for Marin County. However, Frouge promised that Marincello would be a carefully planned city and would not fall siege to the mistakes of other bloated suburbs around the country. He also noted how the houses and apartments would be built with an \\"open-space\\" architecture in mind and would effortlessly blend into the unique landscape. Many preservationists and Marin County leaders did not see it this way. Already worried about the diminishing quality of life and the growing amount of development in the county, Marincello was looked at as the last straw that would lead to endless amounts of development around the area. A small group of activists called the Golden Gate Headlands Committee challenged the pending approval of the project. They submitted a 6,000-name petition to the Board of Supervisors. It was met with a blind eye. A second submission of a petition was invalidated, as the county threw out 300 of the signatures and moved on. http://www.thegerharts.com/matt/ma2.pdf Local newspapers supported the grand project, writing articles promoting the new city. They believed that Frouge's development would draw attention away from other open spaces in Marin that other developers were eyeing to build upon, including the untouched Marin seashore area. In a 1965 article, the Pacific Sun wrote that Thomas Frouge's city \\"will be a showcase, which will point the way to preservation of the clear and open areas essential and unique in Marin.” The green light In November 1965 the County of Marin officially approved Frouge's plan and Marincello got the green light for development. Large gates were immediately built at the base of Tennessee Valley that boldly marked the entrance for the to-be-built city. Bulldozers carved a large boulevard up the mountain that was to be one of Marincello's main streets in and out of the community. These were all signs that the building of the metropolis was now well on its way, and no one could stop it now. Legal debate Even before Marin Supervisors approved the Marincello plan in November 1965, legal red tape started to slowly encompass the project. In June 1965, Frouge was sued for misappropriation and false representation of a proposed street entrance to Marincello that trespassed upon private property of existing homeowners. This entrance was off Wolfback Ridge Road (from the Spencer Avenue exit), and was very important to the value of the city since it allowed easy access to Highway 101 and the Golden Gate Bridge from Marincello. Obviously, this small residential street that served fewer than ten houses would be deluged with commuter traffic. A preliminary injunction was issued in favor of the homeowners. Glass v. Gulf Oil Corp. (1970) 12 CA3d 412 By 1966, the budget for Marincello started to balloon from its original 20 year/$250 million pricetag. The executives of Gulf Oil started to doubt Thomas Frouge and the Gulf Oil Land Development Division, which was funding the project. Infighting within the company ensued, as well as a legal fallout between Frouge and Gulf Oil. In 1967, construction on the site came to a standstill. This allowed Douglas Ferguson, Bob Praetzel, and Marty Rosen (three lawyers who were already actively following the development and enraged by the legal shortcuts taken by Frouge and his associates to accelerate the construction) to step in and file the most threatening lawsuit to face Marincello. All About Marin: Environment's elders honored at book event Representing the City of Sausalito, they filed a lawsuit against Marin County, Frouge, and Gulf Oil, stating that Marincello was improperly zoned back in 1964 and allowed the public only six days to review the zoning instead the legal ten days. This would normally be an insignificant technicality for such a huge project. However, the lawsuit led to discovery of many additional inaccuracies in the Zoning Outlines (including a hastily laid-out plan for an industrial zone within the community) that the County of Marin had approved in 1965. City of Sausalito v. County of Marin (1970) 12 CA3d 550 By 1970, Frouge and Gulf Oil made amends and were finally about to get their overdue project back on track. However, that same year they were dealt a crushing blow. The court ruled that the entire project was improperly zoned and they would have to throw out their plans and submit brand new ones from scratch. Finally, the day after the court's ruling, the Board of Supervisors of Marin announced that they would no longer support the project. Trust for Public Land Founding Member and President, 1972-1997: the Ethics and Practice of Land Conservation Marincello dies In the late 1960s, the government was conducting a study about creating a national park surrounding the Golden Gate. It was originally conceived to include Alcatraz and the Presidio. Soon, it was realized that the Marin Headlands was a crucial area to complete this national park. Huey Johnson, western director of The Nature Conservancy, met with the Gulf Oil Corporation about selling this valuable land to the park service in early 1970. After Gulf Oil lost their lawsuit, this finally became an attractive option. In 1972, the land was sold to the Nature Conservancy for $6.5 million and then transferred to the newly formed Golden Gate National Recreation Area.View a KPIX-TV news report from 12/3/1972 about the purchase of Marincello: https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/208798. The Marincello project was finished, before any buildings could even be put up. In 1976, the Marincello gates at the base of Tennessee Valley, the only remaining architectural evidence of the development, were torn down and removed. Marincello today Although the Marin Headlands currently sits among thousands of acres of virtually untouched and protected open land, some remnants of the 1960s development project still exist. The main boulevard that was built upon the Northwest portion of the area still remains as a dirt road. It is now a popular hiking, biking, and horse-back riding trail, properly named \\"Marincello Trail.\\" The trail connects to other trails at the top of the Headlands that would have been roads and streets for the planned community. Golden Gate National Recreational Area - Maps (U.S. National Park Service) The former main boulevard now stands as the \\"Marincello Trail.\\" Off Southbound Highway 101, there is an exit for Rodeo Ave that leads nowhere. It consists of a short highway off-ramp that leads to another dirt road—currently gated to restrict automobile traffic. If Marincello had been built, this dirt road would have been upgraded to a main boulevard to carry traffic in and out of Marincello. Instead, it also became a trail, accessible by foot only, that intersects with the Marincello Trail at the top of the hill. Today, the Headlands make up part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which at 16 million visitors a year, is one of the country's most popular National Park Service areas. April 2005 Save The Bay In 1972, three of the people responsible for blocking the development, Huey Johnson, Douglas Ferguson, and Martin Rosen, founded The Trust for Public Land, an organization dedicated to the creation of parks and protected lands across the United States.

The song was a popular parlour ballad, particularly in the United Kingdom and British territories worldwide, and was boosted by the recording by Frank Sinatra which was released on the Come Fly with Me album in 1958. However, after some resistance from the Kipling estate over the omission of several verses, this version of the song remained embargoed in the British Commonwealth until it appeared on the digitally-remastered release of the album many years later.

In 1639, he negotiated the purchase of a strip of land south of the Dutch factory at Pulicat from the Raja of Chandragiri, where the town of Madras was built. He served as the second Agent of Madras from 1643 to 1644. Along with Andrew Cogan, he is regarded as the founder of Madras.  Early life  Francis Day was born to William Day of Bray and his wife Helen Wentworth, the daughter of a member of the House of Commons. He is believed to be the grandson of William Day, who was appointed Bishop of Winchester in 1595. Francis completed his education from Eton College and joined the services of the East India Company in 1632.  Purchase of Madras  Plan of Fort St George and the city of Madras in 1726. In 1637, Francis Day, then a member of the Masulipatnam Council and Chief of the Armagon Factory, undertook a voyage of exploration down the Coromandel Coast, as far as Pondicherry. At that time, the Coromandel Coast was ruled by the Raja of Chandragiri through a local chief or Nayak, Damarla Venkatappa Nayak, who ruled the coast from Pulicat up to Santhome. He had his seat at Wandiwash and his brother, Ayyappa Nayak resided at Poonamallee. It is widely presumed that Ayyappa Nayak was the one who wooed the English to choose the area comprising the modern-day Georgetown for settlement. Day and his superior, Andrew Cogan, investigated the proposed site and examined trading possibilities. The results were favorable and Day secured a grant offering the village of Madraspatnam to the English for a period of two years. The Grant was dated August 1639, and after obtaining the approval of the Factory at Masulipatnam and the Presidency of Bantam (in Java), the settlement of Madraspatnam was begun. Day also had other reasons to choose Madras for a factory: the availability of cotton, and at a much cheaper rate, as acknowledged by the prosperous Portuguese settlement of Sao Tôme, the nearness of the Portuguese, upon whom could be counted as neutral spectators if not active supporters in times of war, particularly influenced the English in their choice, the land allocated under the grant to the English in 1639, was a piece of land lying between the river Cooum, almost at the point at which it enters the sea and another river known as Egmore river,http://www.chennai.tn.nic.in/chndistprof.htm#hist from Official website, Chennai district profile, history. also a factor of safety important in those turbulent times. Day was, however, sorely criticised by captains of men-of- war, for his choice of the location of the fort, due to immense difficulties in anchoring ships in Madras Roads. This meant that at various important junctures in the Carnatic Wars, the powerful English fleet was rendered useless, having to weigh anchor and move out to sea at low tide. Merchantmen too found the same flaw, though for different reasons - they would have to wait until high tide to bring goods and passengers ashore or risk wetting them in the majula boats used as ferries between the fort and Madras Roads. The chief difficulty, as usual with the English in those days, was lack of money. At last, in February 1640, Day and Cogan accompanied by a few factors and writers, a garrison of about 25 European soldiers and a few other European artificers, besides a Hindu powder-maker by name Naga Battan, proceeded to Madras and started the English factory. They reached Madraspatnam on 20 February; and this date is important because it marks the first actual settlement of the English at the place. Construction of Fort St George Day and Cogan were jointly responsible for the construction of Fort St George. The building of the Factory House was taken up on 1 March 1640. Some portion of the structure was presumably completed by St. George's Day (23 April) of that year and the name Fort St. George was consequently given to the Fort.Muthiah, S. (March, 2004) \\"First city of modern India\\", Seminar 535, p 14. The bastions were first built and erection of the curtain walls connecting them proceeded more slowly as funds permitted. The whole Fort took fourteen years to construct and was finished only in 1653. It measured about 100 yards by north to south and by 80 yards east to west. On its northern and southern sides buildings and streets sprang up and constituted what came to be known later as the White Town. Indian merchants and artificers were attracted to the settlement and encouraged to build houses therein under a promise of exemptions from import taxes for a period of thirty years. It is said that within the first year of the life of the settlement, there arose some seventy to eighty substantial houses to the north and south of the Fort while in the village of Madraspatnam nearly four hundred families of weavers had come to settle permanently.

Born in Rodenberg, Hesse (now in Lower Saxony), Köster was active in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) starting in the early 1880s. He moved to Groß Ottersleben, near Magdeburg, where he participated in the socialist movement, which was illegal at the time because of the Anti- Socialist Laws, and was a leader in the trade union of the town. For these activities he was sentenced to prison multiple times, most notably in 1886 for three months for libel, and in 1887 for eighteen months for the dissemination of illegal literature. After the sunset of the Anti-Socialist Laws in 1890, he was part of the left-wing opposition known as Die Jungen in the SPD, as the delegate of Wanzleben at the party convention. In the same year, he became editor of the Magdeburger Volkstimme. His articles for this newspaper led to several convictions, which he avoided by fleeing to Switzerland. In Zurich, he joined the Association of Independent Socialists founded by members of Die Jungen, who were expelled from the SPD. He was active in various unions and in the Swiss anarchist movement throughout the 1890s. Police reports call him the \\"leader of the Zurich anarchists\\". He returned to Groß Ottersleben in January 1910, after he could no longer be punished for his crimes because of the statute of limitations. Pressured by friends of his, Köster re-joined the SPD and Gustav Landauer and he tried to convince rural workers to join the anarchist movement. Soon, he led a farm workers' strike. In June 1910, he was going to be expelled from the SPD along with several other anarchists, but he left the party first. In 1911, he moved to Berlin, where he started working for the weekly newspaper Die Tribüne. In the same year he became the chief editor of Der Pionier, the theoretical organ of the syndicalist Free Association of German Trade Unions (FVdG), but in 1912, after having spent three months in various prisons, he quit this role and moved to Dresden. He then became a leader in the syndicalist construction workers' union in Dresden and travelled Germany as a lecturer. In 1920, he became a member of the Business Commission of the FVdG-follow-up organization, the Free Workers' Union of Germany (FAUD). He also contributed to Der Syndikalist, the organ of the FAUD, and Die Schöpfung.

The manga was serialized in Kodansha's manga magazine, Monthly Shōnen Sirius. The manga is licensed in North America by Del Rey Manga. Since early 2008, the series has been on hiatus in Japan, apparently due to the creator's illness. The manga features a squadron of fighters (called VIUS)who are immune to \\"D-virus\\" and the Dracule which is a group of creatures who spread the \\"D-virus\\". The series has continued under the name Dragon Eye RT (龍眼RT) in Japanese and has released about 4 volumes. Dragon Eye was ranked equal fourth with Black Sun, Silver Moon and Zombie-Loan on an About.com's reader poll for the best shōnen manga of 2007. It was also nominated as one of Young Adult Library Services Association's 2008 Great Graphic Novels. Plot Forty years ago a terrible virus spread throughout the world, and people and animals alike were infected and transformed into horrible monsters that eat the flesh and drink the blood of the uninfected. These creatures were henceforth known as \\"Dracules\\" (after the famous vampire) and what created them the \\"D-virus\\". Even worse, because the virus affects the sufferer immediately, a cure has never been developed; the only way to \\"save\\" its victims is to kill them. Luckily, there are those who were born with an immunity to the D-virus - they are the VIUS, a Dracule elimination force based in the city of who safeguard humanity from extinction. Characters Squadron Zero is known for being \\"dangerous, difficult and its captain detested\\". It is a squadron branch of Troop Mizora of the Enforcement Corps. ; :The leader of Squad Zero, Issa is light-hearted and appears to be very lazy. However, when it comes down to battle, he is very competent. He wields the broadsword Diamond Sacred Steel though he possesses amazing melee skills that appears Dracule-like. Issa, unknown to many of the VIUS, possesses a \\"Dragon Eye\\" in his forehead and is forced to wear fetters, spell tablets, which limit his power, otherwise the power runs amok. He is even able to sense the number and strength of Dracules. He has been with the VIUS for a number of years despite his youthful appearance and no one seems to remember when he joined. However, due to his personality and unusual behavior many people in the VIUS despise Issa, including some of Issa's ex-squad members, one admitting that they lost trust in Issa because they didn't think he was human. Issa is looking for his older sister, Ciara, who was taken hostage by the Dracules who forced him to fight for them before he joined the VIUS. During Issa's time with the Dracules, he was known as \\"Leda\\" which is the title given to particularly ferocious Dracules; it means \\"Ogre Child\\". Issa is first seen in the VIUS entrance examination, as an undercover examiner playing what appears to be a PSP. After Issa escaped he ran into the man who saved Leila and traveled with him for a while. The man became a dracule due to his eye which he gave to Issa along with his weapon saying if he wanted to stay human he'd used his sword. Issa took up residency in Mikuni. ; :Leila is a D-virus orphan. Her parents were killed by Dracules when she was young but was saved by a man with a \\"Dragon Eye\\"-which is her reason for entering VIUS. She originally wished to have a \\"Dragon Eye\\" for herself to become the most powerful warrior in the world to exact revenge on the creatures that took her family, but due to Issa's revealing of his \\"Dragon Eye\\" she sees how much it costs to have one and swears to use her power to protect everyone's smiling faces. Issa promises to one day let her have his \\"Dragon Eye\\" if she still requires the power. She wields a single katana and practices the act of Sacred Blade, Shimon School. She was her years top scorer and is personally selected by Issa to join the new squad Zero. Leila is the first recruit at VIUS assigned to the new Squad Zero. She may be developing feelings for Issa because she was crying after he returned from the cave and she was one of the only people who trusted him. Another reason that she may be developing feelings for him is because when she found out he was in the tournament she said to him \\"If I had known we could have prepared together. Leila looked disappointed when she asked him did he have a crush on Aoi. She also believes Issa's \\"Dragon Eye\\" to be the same one as the man who saved her. ; :Sōsei is a former member of Squad Five that has recently temporarily transferred to Squad Zero. He believes that Issa killed his twin sister six years ago and transferred for this reason to learn more about the truth. He wields twin blades in her memory. After confronting Issa, and learning the truth of his sister's death, he planned to resign; but instead was permanently transferred into Squad Zero by Issa. This is his second year in VIUS. He was his years top scorer. Squadron One is a squadron branch of Troop Mizora of the Enforcement Corps. ; :Squad One captain who lost his left arm to his infected partner. An Ex-member of the old Zero Squad who still has a fairly decent relationship with Issa. Is often seen apologizing/covering for Issa, along with beating him. He is said to be the strongest person in Mikuni but is not on active duty. It is mentioned in the first chapter that this may be due to a blunder that he made on his first mission. Squadron Two is a squadron branch of Troop Mizora of the Enforcement Corps. ; :A volunteer helper on loan for Squad Zero. He once went on a mission with Issa where they ended up hovering on the brink of death in a snow storm. He is specialized with ammo and grapples but uses rigged shells he invented himself that he fires from his hand-held cannon. He is known for his own inventions that prove to be somewhat obscure. Kajiyama admits to Leila that he was kicked out of the house by his father and forced to go earn a living, and does not plan to stay in VIUS. Apparently he has many brothers and sisters. Squadron Three is a squadron branch of Troop Chihiro of the Enforcement Corps. ; ; :Volunteer helper on loan for Squad Zero. He wields a waistband whip containing spell power. ; :A former Squad Zero member. She has a bright, cheerful personality as well as a great body that is muscular and yet still shapely. Not one to rely on weapons, she engages in direct physical attacks, specializing in underhanded moves like the one she used to trap Issa in volume 7. Even so, she was defeated by Issa, though she only fought him to try to convince Issa to lose the competition as it is a trap intended for him. Squadron Five is a squadron branch of Troop Chihiro of the Enforcement Corps. ; Squadron Six is a squadron branch of Troop Kazan of the Enforcement Corps. ; :Captain of Squad Six which is used for undercover missions. She is called Mikuni VIUS's most beautiful warrior. She seems to get along well with Issa which is rare compared to the other captains. She is Hibiki's foster mother. ; :Hibiki has the appearance of a calm, cool, collected young man, but he has really completed several hundred missions. He was inducted into VIUS when he was 10 years old and was immediately placed in Sakuraba's Squad One, later transferring to Squad Six. He volunteers with the short-handed Squad Zero and is mission sub-commander, taking the position as commander when Captain Issa is separated from the group. He reveals that he thinks someone is a superior leader due to his instincts and not sticking with the manual when in combat. With his hands alone Hibiki can destroy a medium-sized Dracule and deal heavy blows. He can wield two giant blades simultaneously which he calls his 'Branched Fangs\\" which he carries on his back in two-sword style. He appears to become battle hungry once he meets strong \\"prey\\" among Dracules and becomes a tad wild. Hibiki gets really angry and fierce when his own blood is drawn. Squadron Seven is a squadron branch of the Enforcement Corps. ; :Volunteer helper on loan for Squad Zero. An expert at unarmed combat, but can cast certain spells as well for a brief period of time. His short staff can serve to enhance his spell power. Squadron Eight is a squadron branch of the Enforcement Corps. ; ; :A member of old Squad Zero. She is a spellcaster who knows the reason why the old Squad Zero was disbanded. She can stop and even inflict damage on an opponent without touching them. Squadron Ten is a squadron branch of the Enforcement Corps. ; ; :A member of the Intelligence Corps, he has little battle experience. He idolizes Issa, mostly because his first mission was with him. He was one of the members on the mission to kill Sosei's sister, and withdrew from the front lines because he could not handle it. Dracule are group of creatures that are the main target of VIUS. Their intellect, battle capabilities and overall threat to people depend on their level. Level five dracules are the lowest ranks of all dracules and they possess low intellect, making them incapable of speaking. Level one dracules have human-like intellect and are capable of speech. ; :A Level-2 Dracule that was smuggled into Mikuni as a black market good. He is a massive bird that is capable of human speech. Under his feathers is the rare, indestructible \\"Diamond Skin\\". Issa once made a deal with him long ago to fight with him another day. When he met Issa in Mikuni, they flew far out of the city and fought. Issa revealed the \\"Dragon Eye\\" and dove through Kaligera, removing his heart. ; :Daraku are a mysterious group who are inciting the dracules to attack humans. They have mysterious powers and know about the Dragon Eye.They have declared VIUS the dracules enemy. Manga Dragon Eye is written and illustrated by Kairi Fujiyama.

A talented spinto soprano, she was widely acclaimed for her portrayal of the title role in Giuseppe Verdi's Aida; a role she performed in many of the world's top opera houses. She was notably the first black artist to perform the role of Aida at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1958. While she performed a broad repertoire, she was particularly admired for her interpretations of 20th-century music, including the works of Richard Strauss, Benjamin Britten and Paul Hindemith. Davy was part of the first generation of African-American singers to achieve wide success and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world. She first drew notice in 1952 when she won the Marian Anderson Award, and then as Bess on an international tour of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess from 1954–1956. Concert and opera engagements with major orchestras and opera houses in the United States and Europe soon following. In 1959 she married Swiss stockbroker Herman Penningsfield; at which point she left New York to reside in Geneva, Switzerland. After this point her singing career was mainly based in Europe, with only occasional appearances in the United States. After 1973, Davy's career shifted from opera towards concert work; although she occasionally still performed stage roles. From 1984–1997 she taught on the voice faculty at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University while still maintaining her home in Geneva. She died in Geneva at the age of 81. Early life and education Born in Brooklyn, New York, Davy was the daughter of immigrants from the island of Saint Vincent in the Windward Islands. Her father was a token clerk in the New York City subway system. She graduated from The High School of Music & Art in New York City in 1951 before entering the Juilliard School where she earned a degree in vocal performance in 1953. At Juilliard she was a pupil of Belle Julie Soudant, who also taught opera singers Frances Bible and Andrew Frierson. After completing her degree she remained at Juilliard for one more year to pursue post-graduate studies in opera. In April 1954 she appeared as Countess Madeleine in the U.S. premiere run of Richard Strauss' Capriccio with the Juilliard Opera. She later studied singing in Milan with Victor de Sabata. Several competition wins drew attention to Davy while she was still a student at Juilliard. In 1952 she was awarded the Marian Anderson Award. In 1953 she won the Music Education League's vocal competition which led to her professional singing debut performing in concert at Town Hall on June 12, 1953 and earned her a contract to perform in concerts with The Little Orchestra Society under conductor Thomas Scherman. With that orchestra she performed Benjamin Britten's Les Illuminations on March 30, 1954. Music critic Ross Parmenter stated in his review that \\"[Davy is] a singer of unusual technical skill... she has a voice of wide range that is soft, clear, fresh, and warm. She interprets with imagination and intensity and she handles French as if it were her native tongue.\\" Early career: 1954–1961 Gloria Davy as Aida in 1958 Davy made her professional stage debut on Broadway as one of the Female Saints in the April 1952 revival of Virgil Thomson's Four Saints in Three Acts at the Broadway Theatre. She returned to Broadway the following October to portray Susie in My Darlin' Aida at the Winter Garden Theatre with Elaine Malbin in the title role. In May 1954 she replaced Leontyne Price as Bess in a North American tour of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess which was organized by impresarios Robert Breen and his wife Wilva Davis. After completing its North American tour in Montreal, Davy went with the production to Europe for performances in Venice, Paris, London, and other cities in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The company also made a stop at the Cairo Opera House in Egypt. She remained with the international tour through 1956, making further appearances in the Middle East, Africa, Russia, and Latin America. Davy met composer and conductor Victor de Sabata when the Porgy and Bess tour reached La Scala in Milan in 1955. Impressed with the young singer, he offered her the title role in Giuseppe Verdi's Aida for a return engagement at that house. Unfortunately, political upheaval in Italy led to the cancelation of her scheduled performance at the opera house, and her first appearance as Aida ended up being at the Opéra de Nice in 1957. Later that year she performed that role in concert with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium in New York with Barry Morell as Radamès and Elena Nikolaidi as Amneris. Aida was also her calling card at the Teatro Comunale in Bologna and the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb in 1968. Davy's performance at Lewisohn Stadium drew the attention of several notable music organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, and she was soon working actively with a variety of music groups in New York. In October 1957 she performed the title role in the New York premiere of Donizetti's Anna Bolena for the American Opera Society (AOS) with Giulietta Simionato as Giovanna Seymour for performances at both Town Hall and Carnegie Hall. In December 1958 she sang with the AOS again as Elcia in Rossini's Mosè in Egitto with Jennie Tourel as Amenofi and Boris Christoff, in his New York debut, singing the title role. In January 1959 she returned to Carnegie Hall to sing the title role in Gluck's Iphigénie en Tauride with Martial Singher as Orestes, Louis Quilico as Thoas and The Little Orchestra Society (LOS). She appeared with the LOS again on October 10, 1960 for the United States premiere of Strauss' Daphne in a concert version at Town Hall in which she sang the title heroine. On February 12, 1958 Davy made her debut at the Met as Aida with Kurt Baum as Radamès, Leonard Warren as Amonasro, Irene Dalis as Amneris and Fausto Cleva conducting. She was notably the first black artist to appear as Aida at the opera house, and the 4th black artist to appear on the Met stage after Marian Anderson, Robert McFerrin, and Mattiwilda Dobbs. She appeared in 15 performances at the Metropolitan Opera House over four seasons, including performances of Pamina in Mozart’s The Magic Flute and Nedda in Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci. In July 1961 she toured with the Met to Israel where she performed the role of Fiordiligi in Così fan tutte with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in Tel Aviv. Her last appearance at the Met was as Leonora in Il trovatore with Giulio Gari as Manrico in November 1961. In October 1960 Davy appeared in concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra as the soloist in Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 under conductor Eugene Ormandy at the United Nations General Assembly Hall which was broadcast internationally. The following month she made her debut with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company under the baton of Giuseppe Bamboschek at the Academy of Music.Free Library of Philadelphia: Folder: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1916–1934 miscellaneous Later life and career: 1961–2012 After Davy left the Met in 1961, her career was no longer centered in New York but in Europe; a decision she made after marrying Swiss stockbroker Herman Penningsfield in 1959 and making a home with him in Geneva. She began transitioning towards a major European career in 1959 when she performed Aida at both the Vienna State Opera under Herbert von Karajan and at the Royal Opera, London. That same year she performed the role of Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. She sang Aida again at the Teatro Regio in Parma in 1960, and was Aida to Jon Vickers' Radamès at the 1961 Berliner Festspiele under the direction of Wieland Wagner. From 1961–1968 Davy was a resident artist at the Berlin State Opera where she sang leading roles in operas by Verdi and Puccini among other composers. During this time she also appeared as a guest artist with other opera houses in Europe. In 1961 and 1962 she sang Pamina at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels. She returned there in 1969 to sing the Old Prioress in Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites; a role she performed that same year from a wheelchair at the Grand Théâtre de Genève. She made several appearances at La Scala in Milan during the late 1950s and 1960s, portraying both Donna Anna and Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, Jenny in Kurt Weill's Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, Nedda, and the title role in Madama Butterfly among others. In 1970 she performed the role of Dido at the Teatro Regio in Parma. She remained busy with major opera houses in Europe through 1972, appearing at opera houses in Aachen, Hamburg, Strasbourg, and Mannheim among other cities. From 1973 on her singing career was more focused on concert repertoire, although she still made a few opera appearances afterwards. While maintaining her home in Geneva, Davy taught on the voice faculty of the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University from 1984 to 1997. She died on November 28, 2012, in Geneva, Switzerland at the age of 81. Discography *Christoph Willibald Gluck – Armide: Umberto Cattini, Orchestra Angelicum di Milano, Coro Polifonico di Torino.

Sodalities are often based on common age or gender, with all-male sodalities more common than all-female. One aspect of a sodality is that of a group \\"representing a certain level of achievement in the society, much like the stages of an undergraduate's progress through college [university]\\" . In the anthropological literature, the Mafia in Sicily has been described as a sodality . Other examples include Maasai war camps, and Crow and Cheyenne military associations, groups that were not much unlike today's Veterans of Foreign Wars or American Legion.\\"Law and Order in Band and Village Societies\\" The term was first used with this meaning by Elman Service (no doubt drawing on the sodality vs. modality distinction used in some Christian churches), as part of his band-tribe-chiefdom-state model for the progression of political integration. It defined an organization that occurred across bands, and therefore was a part of a tribe, rather than a band, which was composed of only kin.\\"Morton Fried's Social Evolution\\" Arjun Appadurai uses the concept of sodalities to describe what he views as the collective, cultural dimension and function of the imagination given the globalization of electronic mass media and transnational migration. For Appadurai, sodalities, much like what he terms \\"localities\\" or \\"neighborhoods\\", are cultural groups or spaces that mediate globalized cultural flows and, importantly, create possibilities for \\"translocal social action that would otherwise be hard to imagine\\" (p.8).

Sánchez intended to enter the Jorge Tadeo Lozano University, however most of his journalistic experience was shaped by his empirical approach (See Peter Jennings for other examples of empiric journalists). Sánchez major influence comes from his professional mentor, Colombian journalist Yamid Amat whom he worked in Caracol Radio. Mr. Sánchez worked with Colombian radio station Caracol Estéreo (predecessor of W Radio) hosting its morning news show Viva FM from 1991 to 1996. In 1996 he moved his show to La FM, a station owned by RCN Radio. In 2003 he came back to Caracol Radio's W Radio, which is currently owned by the Spanish group PRISA.

La W is a Colombian influential morning radio show, broadcast since 2003 on weekdays on W Radio and syndicated to stations in Panama, United States, and Spain. It is presented by Julio Sánchez Cristo. The programme features different topics, mostly current events, national and international news. The show has journalists on the world's major cities and continually reports about events that take place at the time the show is being broadcast; those events can be cultural in nature or events that because of their importance make news. Julio Sánchez Cristo has two sidekick hosts, Alberto Casas Santamaría, whom he has worked in radio for a long time, a former minister and diplomat, and a well known media personality in Colombia, and Félix de Bedout, a well recognized journalist with an extensive career in various media, most notably being host on the TV newscast NTC Noticias. The show is conformed by a staff of journalists reporting from different cities in Europe, Latin America and the US. The show also features jazz and pop. Sánchez Cristo is popular among his audience, spending a good part of the show allowing listeners to talk live by phone from different cities in Colombia, Latin America or from the US. However, he has been strongly criticized for cutting people short at the middle of their talk. Some people criticize Mr. Sánchez for being too superficial and elitist. La W is the successor of Viva FM, itself a programme created also by Sánchez Cristo for the then adult contemporary station Caracol Estéreo (forerunner of W Radio) in 1991.

Tecton (also translated from the Greek as Tekton) has been traditionally translated into English as \\"carpenter\\", but is a rather general word (from the same root as \\"technical\\" and \\"technology\\", derived from Greek) that at the time could cover makers of objects in various materials, and builders, from tent makers to stonemasons. In this case, the name Tecton came from architecton, the Greek word for architecture. The group was one of the leaders in bringing continental modernism to Britain. History The group's first commission was the 1932-1934 gorilla house in the London Zoo in Regent's Park. After the successful completion of the gorilla house, the group designed a penguin pool for the zoo, which contained a unique double helix- shaped walkway without intermediate supports for the penguins and a large swimming area. The group's successes at the London Zoo resulted in their designing two other zoos: Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire and Dudley Zoo in West Midlands. The group then designed the Highpoint I tower, an apartment complex in Highgate. The complex set a new standard for luxury in city life, even though it was originally intended for working-class residents. The group later designed the Highpoint II tower on an adjacent piece of land, which was even more luxurious than its predecessor. After completing Highpoint I, Tecton received a commission for the Finsbury Health Centre. This was the first public commission granted to a modernist architecture group. The building was created with the intention of improving public health through its construction, by creating a positive atmosphere and encouraging patrons to enjoy the outdoors through murals. The Borough of Finsbury was impressed with the Health Centre and commissioned Tecton to work on several housing projects in the borough. After Tecton Skinner, Bailey and Lubetkin continued to work together on projects including the Dorset Estate and Sivill House.

Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous, while the Saxon Army maintained a lesser degree of autonomy. The armies of the other German states were integrated into the Prussian Army with limited autonomy. The division was formed on April 1, 1900, and was headquartered in Regensburg.Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815-1939. (Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück, 1993), Bd. 1, p. 666; Claus von Bredow, bearb., Historische Rang- und Stammliste des deutschen Heeres (1905), p. 1255. In Bavarian sources, it was not generally referred to as a \\"Royal Bavarian\\" division, as this was considered self-evident, but outside Bavaria, this designation was used for it, and other Bavarian units, to distinguish them from similarly numbered Prussian units. The division was part of the III Royal Bavarian Army Corps. Combat chronicle During World War I, the division served on the Western Front. It fought initially in the Battle of the Frontiers. It then served in the area between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers until July 1916, seeing action on the Meuse heights, by St. Mihiel, and in the Bois-brulé. In July and August 1916, the division fought in the Battle of Verdun, and afterwards went into combat in the Argonne Forest. At the end of September 1916, it fought in the Battle of the Somme. The division suffered heavy losses in both of these battles. From October 1916 into 1918, the division occupied the trenchlines in Flanders and the Artois, and fought in the Battle of Arras and the Battle of Passchendaele. It then fought in the 1918 German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). After a period in the trenches in Flanders and near Verdun, the division fought in the Second Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Third Battle of the Somme. It continued resisting various Allied offensives until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as one of the very best German divisions.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919, (1920), pp. 134-137.

Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from their higher headquarters. The 6th Bavarian Division was renamed the 6th Bavarian Infantry Division.

Pionier-Bataillon Late World War I organization Divisions underwent many changes during the war, with regiments moving from division to division, and some being destroyed and rebuilt. During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \\"square division\\"). The 6th Bavarian Infantry Division was triangularized in January 1917, dissolving the 12th Bavarian Infantry Brigade headquarters and sending the 11th Bavarian Infantry Regiment to the newly formed 16th Bavarian Infantry Division. An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, and the engineer contingent was increased. Divisional signals commanders were established to better control communications, a major problem in coordinating infantry and artillery operations during World War I.

There is no consensus among linguists on the relation between Oghur and Common Turkic, and several questions remain unsolved: *Are they parallel branches of Proto-Turkic (3000-500 BC) and, if so, which branch is more archaic? *Does Oghur represent Archaic Turkic before phonetic changes in 100-400 AD and was it a separate language? Features The Oghur languages are also known as \\"-r Turkic\\" because the final consonant in certain words is r, not z as in Common Turkic. - - - . Hence the name Oghur corresponds Oghuz in Common Turkic. Other correspondences are Com. š : Oghur l (tâš : tâl, 'stone'); s > š; *č > ś; k/q > ğ; y > j, ś; d, δ > δ > z (10th cent.) > r (13th cent.)\\"; ğd > z > r (14th cent.); a > ı (after 9th cent.). Distinguished specialist in the history of Central Asia the late Denis Sinor believed that the differences noted above suggest that the Oghur-speaking tribes could not have originated in territories inhabited by speakers of Mongolic languages, given that Mongolian dialects feature the -z suffix. Equally eminent historian Professor Golden, however, has noted that there are many loanwords in Mongolic from Oghur, such as Mong. ikere, Oghur. *ikir, Hung. iker, Comm. ikiz (twins). and holds the contradictory view that the Oghur inhabited the borderlands of Mongolia prior to the 5th century. The Oghur tribes are often connected with the Hungarians whose ethnonym is usually derived from Onogurs (> (H)ungars). The Hungarians are of mixed Ugrian / Turkic heritage, with strong Oghur-Bulgar and Khazar influences. Hungarian has many borrowings from Turkic and Oghur languages: Hung. tenger, Oghur. *tengir, Comm. tengiz (sea), Hung. gyűrű, Oghur. jürük, Comm. yüzük (ring), and terms of equestrian culture ló (horse), nyereg (saddle), fék (bridle), ostor (whip). A number of Hungarian loanwords were borrowed before the 9th century, shown by sz- (< Oğ. ś-) rather than Comm. gy- (< Oğ. ǰ-): example Hung. szél, Oghur. *śäl, Chuv. śil, Comm. yel (wind), Hung. szűcs (tailor), Hung. szőlő (grapes).

The US accused him of providing material support to terrorism via a website that he set up in the UK in 1996 to publish stories about the conflicts in Bosnia and Chechnya, but which in 2000–2001 allowed two articles to be posted on the site offering support to the then Taliban government in Afghanistan. The US accepted that the website was operated from the UK but claimed jurisdiction because one of the servers hosting the website was located in the US. He fought a public eight-year legal battle, from prison, to be tried in Britain but the British Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was \\"insufficient evidence to prosecute\\" him. In 2009, the High Court in London awarded Ahmad £60,000 compensation after the London Metropolitan Police admitted that its officers had subjected him to \\"serious gratuitous prolonged unjustified violence\\" and \\"religious abuse\\" during his arrest which led to 73 injuries. It was revealed that the officers, who abused Ahmad were also accused of dozens of other assaults on black and Asian men but the four officers were acquitted by a jury in June 2011. In October 2015, a London High Court of Justice judge ruled that PC Mark Jones, one of the officers acquitted in the Ahmad case, assaulted and racially abused two Arab teenage boys in another case. In 2011, celebrities and senior British lawyers backed a public campaign which led to 140,000 British citizens signing a UK Government e-petition calling for him to be tried in the UK. His case was subsequently debated twice in the British Parliament. Ahmad was finally extradited to the US in October 2012, having become the longest-serving British prisoner to be detained without trial in the UK. He spent the next two years in solitary confinement at a US Supermax prison. In December 2013, after his first year in solitary confinement and after being in prison for over nine years without trial, Ahmad pleaded guilty to two of the charges against him as part of a plea bargain that would allow him to return home within the year. He pleaded guilty to \\"conspiracy and providing material support to terrorism.\\" In July 2014, US federal Judge Janet Hall sentenced Ahmad to an unexpectedly lenient sentence of 12-and-a-half years in prison, meaning that with credit for time served he only had another 12 months to serve. Judge Hall concluded that Ahmad was never interested in terrorism, stating, \\"There was never any aid given by these defendants to effectuate a plot. By plot, I mean a terrorist plot ... Neither of these two defendants were interested in what is commonly known as terrorism ...\\" Hall stated that Ahmad \\"never supported or believed in or associated with Al-Qaida or Osama bin Laden.\\" Judge Hall described Ahmad as a \\"good person\\" who she believed posed no threat to the public and stated she had weighed the seriousness of his crime with his good character after reading thousands of letters of support and hearing from British prison officials who described him as an exemplary inmate. Judge Hall said \\"It appears to me that he [Babar] is a generous, thoughtful person who is funny and honest. He is well liked and humane and empathetic... This is a good person who does not and will not act in the future to harm other people.\\" Ahmad was released in July 2015 and returned to the UK where Metropolitan Police officers welcomed him at London Heathrow Airport then offered to drive him home to his family. Upon his release he stated, \\"Eleven years of solitary confinement and isolation in ten different prisons has been an experience too profound to sum up in a few words here and now... In October 2012, I was blindfolded, shackled and forcibly stripped naked when I was extradited to the US.\\" He added that \\"US and UK government officials\\" had treated him with respect after his release. In March 2016, he told The Observer in his first press interview since his release that he was \\"wrong and naive\\" to advocate support for the Taliban government back in 2001. Early life and education Babar Ahmad was born and brought up in Tooting, London. His parents emigrated to Britain from Pakistan in 1963. His father worked as a Foreign Office civil servant for 30 years and his mother is a retired science teacher. Ahmad was educated at Emanuel School, where he won academic prizes and obtained outstanding results at both GCSE and A-Level. He then went to university and obtained a master's degree in Engineering from the University of London in 1996. Before imprisonment Ahmad fought on and off in the Bosnian War from 1992 until 1995. Before his imprisonment in August 2004, Ahmad was working in the IT department at Imperial College, University of London.http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/311.pdf At the time of his arrest, he lived in Tooting. On 18 March 2009, the London Metropolitan Police agreed to pay Ahmad £60,000 in damages after admitting he was subjected to \\"violent assault and religious abuse\\" during the raid. US prosecution of Ahmad and extradition battle Babar Ahmad was arrested in London on 5 August 2004 on charges of providing material support to terrorism. An affidavit filed with the US court detailed that Ahmad established Azzam.com, a website established in 1996 that later solicited support for Chechen insurgents and the Taliban regime in 2000/01. It further stated that items recovered from a house used by Ahmad included a floppy disk containing a detailed description of the movements of the US Fifth Fleet battlegroup. Ahmad was later indicted by a grand jury of US citizens in October 2004. Another man, Syed Talha Ahsan, was indicted in 2006 of involvement with Ahmad and with the battlegroup information in the document. In 2008, a US former navy seaman, Abu Jihad, was indicted and convicted of disclosing the classified information on the battlegroup but he was cleared of terrorism charges. However, when sentencing Ahmad on 16 July 2014, federal district Judge Janet Hall ruled that \\"nothing was done with the information\\" found in Ahmad's possession so, \\"And that is that the Battle Group Document, besides showing that the Navy enlisted man was a traitor to his country, it also shows that Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Ahsan had absolutely no interest in operational terrorist actions that would harm the United States.\\" US extradition documents stated that \\"at all times material to the indictment\\" Babar Ahmad was resident in London. The Crown Prosecution Service declared in July 2004 and December 2006, as did the UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith in September 2006, that there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" to charge Ahmad with any criminal offence under UK law. Having been refused bail, Ahmad was detained in prison until his extradition on 5 October 2012. On 17 May 2005, Senior District Judge Timothy Workman approved his extradition at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, stating: \\"This is a troubling and difficult case. The defendant is a British citizen who is alleged to have committed offences which, if the evidence were available, could have been prosecuted in this country\\". In September 2005, Sadiq Khan, Member of Parliament for Tooting, presented a petition of 18,000 signatures to the Home Secretary Charles Clarke asking for Babar Ahmad to be tried in the UK, instead of being extradited. On 16 November 2005, Clarke approved his extradition to the United States. On 28 November 2005, the UK Parliamentary Home Affairs Select Committee raised serious concerns about the one-sided UK-US extradition arrangements and, in particular, the case of Babar Ahmad. In a House of Commons emergency debate on 12 July 2006 about UK-US extradition, several MPs from all parties raised concerns at the case of Babar Ahmad. His name has also been mentioned repeatedly in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords in relation to UK-US extradition. Thousands have attended demonstrations in support of him. On 30 November 2006, Ahmad lost his appeal at the High Court. On 4 June 2007, the House of Lords refused to grant him leave to appeal to them. On 10 June 2007, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (France) ordered the UK Government to freeze Babar Ahmad's extradition until they had fully determined his final appeal. In 2009, the High Court in London awarded Ahmad £60,000 compensation after the London Metropolitan Police admitted that its officers had subjected him to \\"serious gratuitous prolonged unjustified violence\\" and \\"religious abuse\\" during his arrest which led to 73 injuries. It was revealed that the officers, who abused Ahmad were also accused of dozens of other assaults on black and Asian men. The revelation lead the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to order an independent review of the case. In 2010, the review led the Crown Prosecution Service to announce that four serving police officers would face criminal charges for assaulting Ahmad. The four officers were acquitted by a jury in June 2011. In October 2015, a London High Court of Justice judge ruled that PC Mark Jones, one of the officers acquitted in the Ahmad case, assaulted and racially abused two Arab teenage boys in another case. On 8 July 2010, the European Court of Human Rights of the Council of Europe, at Strasbourg, imposed a temporary stay on the extradition of Ahmad et al. to the United States to face terrorism charges, until the Court was satisfied that he would not be liable or subject inhumane treatment. The Court based its judgement on the European Convention on Human Rights, which is incorporated as the Human Rights Act 1998 in English and British law. In past cases, the ECtHR had ruled to prevent the United Kingdom and the British Government from deporting, extraditing or repatriating terrorism suspects to other countries, where they would be subject or liable to, or where there was a likelihood that they would be subject or liable to, torture, or to degrading or inhumane treatment. In Babar Ahmad and Others v The United Kingdom the legal representatives of the litigants, argued that extradition to a country, where they might be imprisoned for life, with no possibility of release on parole, and where the penal regime is in comparison excessively harsh, amounted also to degrading or inhumane treatment, and that the extradition therefore ought to be refused. On 22 June 2011, the Houses of Parliament Joint Committee on Human Rights urged the UK government to change the law so that Ahmad's perpetual threat of extradition is ended without further delay. In November 2011, celebrities and senior British lawyers backed a public campaign which led to 140,000 British citizens signing a UK Government e-petition calling for him to be tried in the UK. His case was subsequently debated twice in the British Parliament. On 10 April 2012, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (France) ruled that Ahmad could be extradited to the United States. On 24 April 2012, the BBC reported the testimony of a British man convicted of plotting to blow up an aircraft, from the trial of Adis Medunjanin in New York City. Saajid Badat alleged that he was radicalised by Babar Ahmad but when sentencing Ahmad in July 2012, Judge Janet Hall ruled, \\"As to whether he [Mr Ahmad] radicalized anyone, I don't understand that. I think that the only person radicalized in this case is the cooperating witness. It's pretty clear to me that Mr. Ahmad is not responsible for radicalizing him. He may have played a role in getting the cooperating witness to go to Afghanistan to get training, but even the cooperating witness acknowledges that, unlike what Mr. Ahmad wanted him to do, which was to return to England to complete his education, he turned away from that and was, in fact, radicalized by Khaled Sheikh Mohammed and Osama bin Laden whom he met in Afghanistan.\\" Ahmad was extradited from the UK to the United States on 5 October 2012. The removal process took place on the evening, when Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan were taken from HM Prison Long Lartin, to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, which is used by the US Air Force, from where he was placed into the physical custody of the awaiting United States officials. Three other terror suspects in unrelated cases were also extradited at the same time. Ahmad later stated that he was \\"blindfolded, shackled and forcibly stripped naked\\" during his extradition. He landed in Connecticut on the morning of 6 October. After spending two years in solitary confinement at a US Supermax prison he pleaded guilty to \\"conspiracy and providing material to support to terrorism\\". In 2014, US federal Judge Janet Hall sentenced Ahmad to an unexpectedly lenient sentence and concluded that Ahmad was never interested in terrorism, stating, \\"There was never any aid given by these defendants to effectuate a plot. By plot, I mean a terrorist plot ... Neither of these two defendants were interested in what is commonly known as terrorism ...\\" She described Ahmad as a \\"good person\\" who she believed posed no threat to the public and stated she had weighed the seriousness of his crime with his good character after reading thousands of letters of support and hearing from British prison officials who described him as an exemplary inmate. Judge Hall said \\"It appears to me that he [Babar] is a generous, thoughtful person who is funny and honest. He is well liked and humane and empathetic... This is a good person who does not and will not act in the future to harm other people.\\" In July 2015, Ahmad was released from prison in the US and returned to the UK. Upon his release he stated, \\"Eleven years of solitary confinement and isolation in ten different prisons has been an experience too profound to sum up in a few words here and now... In October 2012, I was blindfolded, shackled and forcibly stripped naked when I was extradited to the US.\\" He added that \\"US and UK government officials\\" had treated him with respect after his release. Police abuse case Babar Ahmad was first arrested at his Tooting home on 2 December 2003 by UK anti-terrorist police of 1 Unit 1 Area Territorial Support Group based at the high security Paddington Green Police Station. By the time he arrived in the custody suite of the police station, he had sustained at least 73 injuries, all later documented by both police and independent doctors, as well as in photographic and video evidence. He filed a formal complaint that was supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). He complained that officers had beaten him with fists and knees, stamped on his bare feet with boots, rubbed metal handcuffs on his forearm bones, sexually abused him, mocked the Islamic faith by placing him into the Muslim prayer position and taunting, \\"Where is your God now?\\", and applied life-threatening neck holds to him until he felt he was about to die. Officers denied the claims, saying Ahmad had battled like a \\"caged tiger\\" during his arrest, adding his injuries were either self-inflicted or caused by a legal tackle that took him to the ground when he was first detained. On 10 September 2004, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" to prosecute any of the police officers involved in the attack. However, on 17 January 2005 the IPCC declared that PC Roderick James-Bowen (born 1971) would face internal police disciplinary procedures over the alleged assault. On 13 April 2005, PC James-Bowen was cleared at a Police Misconduct Tribunal held at Woolwich Crown Court. Metropolitan Police Commander Andre Baker, the President of the Tribunal, stated that PC James-Bowen should be \\"commended, not castigated... for his great bravery\\" in arresting Ahmad. On 18 March 2009, Babar Ahmad was awarded £60,000 compensation at the High Court in London after the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson admitted that he had been the victim of a \\"serious, gratuitous and prolonged attack\\". On 26 March 2009, Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced an inquiry into the Babar Ahmad case with external judicial oversight by retired judge Sir Geoffrey Grigson, to report back to the Metropolitan Police Authority.MPA full Authority discussion of Babar Ahmad case – Metropolitan Police Authority, March 2009 \\\\- On 3 November 2009, following his acquittal in a separate racial abuse trial, 42-year-old PC Mark Jones of 1 Area TSG was named as being involved with the attack on Babar Ahmad.\\"PC cleared of race attack was involved in assault on Muslim\\", Steve Bird, The Times, 4 November 2009 The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, announced that he was taking the case \\"very seriously\\" while considering whether to prosecute PC Jones and the other officers involved in the alleged assault on Babar Ahmad.\\"Cops should face criminal charges following Tooting man's assault, family say\\", Paul Cahalan, Wandsworth Guardian, 13 November 2009 In August 2010, it was announced that Police Constables Nigel Cowley, John Donohue, Roderick James-Bowen and Mark Jones would be prosecuted for their part in the alleged assault on Babar Ahmad. The trial began on Tuesday, 3 May 2011, at Southwark Crown Court, London. On 3 June 2011, they were found not guilty. In October 2015, a London High Court of Justice judge ruled that PC Mark Jones, one of the officers acquitted in the Babar Ahmad case, assaulted and racially abused two Arab teenage boys in another case. Monitoring of MP visit to Ahmad On 3 February 2008, the Sunday Times newspaper reported that UK anti-terrorist police had covertly bugged prison visits between Babar Ahmad and his local MP, Sadiq Khan, Member of Parliament for Tooting. The bugged conversations took place at Woodhill Prison in May 2005 and June 2006. This information was reportedly leaked to the press by the police intelligence officer who conducted the covert surveillance of the visits, in alleged contravention of the Wilson Doctrine that banned Government surveillance of politicians in 1966. Following widespread international media coverage of the revelation, the previous Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw MP, announced in Parliament the day after the article was published that he had asked a retired High Court judge, Sir Christopher Rose, to conduct an official inquiry into the affair. The Rose Inquiry reported back to the House of Commons later in February 2008, stating that the police had done nothing wrong, causing some commentators to dismiss the report as a whitewash.Report on Two Visits by Sadiq Khan MP to Babar Ahmad at HM Prison Woodhill, Report of Investigation by the Rt Hon Sir Christopher Rose, Chief Surveillance Commissioner, February 2008 References Sources *\\"UK terror suspect Babar Ahmad returns home from US\\", 19 July 2015 *\\"The Ordeal of Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan\\", 19 July 2014 *\\"Jihad, justice and the American way: is this a model for fair terrorism trials?\\", 17 July 2014 *\\"Official Court Sentencing Transcript of United States vs Babar Ahmad, US District Court, District of Connecticut 3:04CR301(JCH), 16 July 2014 *\\"Babar Ahmad sentenced to 12.5 years for supporting Islamic terrorists\\", 16 July 2014 *\\"Hansard transcript of House of Commons debate on extradition\\", 5 December 2011 *\\"Hansard transcript of House of Commons Westminster Hall debate on extradition\\", 24 November 2011 *\\"High Court order of Metropolitan Police admitting abuse and offering compensation, 18 March 2009 External links *\\"Freebabarahmad.com\\" *\\"Bbabarahmad.com\\" Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Imperial College London Category:British people imprisoned abroad Category:English Muslims Category:English people of Pakistani descent Category:European Court of Human Rights cases involving the United Kingdom Category:People extradited from the United Kingdom to the United States Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government ","title":"Babar Ahmad"},{"id":"13120713","text":"Adrian Shepherd, (7 April 1939 – 24 July 2013) was a British 'cellist and conductor, and director of the modern-instrument ensemble Cantilena.Biography Shepherd was born in 1939 in the county of Essex, England, and studied the cello with William Pleeth at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, For 20 years he was principal cello with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and professor of cello at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.

A specimen banknote is printed generally in very limited quantities for distribution to central banks to aid in the recognition of banknotes from a country other than their own. In some cases, specimen banknotes are printed in less limited quantities distributed to commercial banks, or even to commercial enterprises and the public at large in order to familiarize users about new designs. In addition, specimen banknotes are sold in some countries to collectors (often in special commemorative folders or albums). They have also been distributed by banknote printers (such as the American Bank Note Company) as examples of their craftsmanship. Occasionally, specimen banknotes are distributed as gifts to dignitaries or to employees of central banks, often in special presentation albums. To avoid use of specimen banknotes as legal tender notes, the banknotes are deformed, typically by being overprinted and/or punched (perfin) with an inscription such as \\"SPECIMEN\\", \\"SPECIMEN NO VALUE\\", \\"CANCELLED\\" or the equivalent in one or more other languages. In most cases, specimen notes have readily- identifiable serial numbers such as \\"99999999999\\" or \\"00000000000\\" or \\"1234567890\\". Many specimens have an additional \\"control number\\" that is used by a central bank to track who received a particular specimen. Specimen banknotes vary in scarcity; in the case of the United States and many other countries, specimen banknotes remain the property of the central bank and when shared with another entity, are supposed to be kept secure and returned on demand. Such specimen banknotes may make it to collector markets without authorization. In other cases, specimen banknotes are very widely distributed, and since they have no circulating value, may be worth less than circulating notes.

Very often an essay has no serial numbers. * A proof banknote is printed as a way of checking to see whether or not the design is suitable for putting into full production as a currency issue, as well as part of the process of testing various stages of the printing process of a banknote that has. Proof banknotes may be partial proofs of the obverse or reverse only (\\"uniface proofs\\"), or of only pieces of the design, such as the portrait.

Catalog of Test Notes * A practice note is generally similar in size, shape and color to circulating banknotes and are used for training bank tellers, cashiers and staff at currency exchanges. They are generally unofficial and crudely printed, but are occasionally issued by central banks or printers when a new form of paper money is introduced (for example when the Euro notes replaced national currency in many European countries). Practice notes have also been created officially by the central banks when a new form of currency has been introduced, for example when Australia and New Zealand introduced decimal currency, replacing the Pound and pence with Dollars and cents. * Educational notes or School Currency was issued by some trade schools specifically to train students to be clerks or cashiers. * Play money may resemble real banknotes or be entirely fictitious and would typically be used by children for play, or as promotions or political or commercial advertising, often with additional messages overprinted or printed on one side. * Hell banknotes resemble real banknotes or are fictitious, but are burned or buried, typically within Asian communities. * Replica banknotes are copies, often easily identifiable, of historical or scarce banknotes.

In contrast with other cryocoolers (e.g. Stirling cryocooler and GM-refrigerators), this cryocooler can be made without moving parts in the low temperature part of the device, making the cooler suitable for a wide variety of applications.  Uses  Pulse tube cryocoolers are used in industrial applications such as semiconductor fabrication and in military applications such as for the cooling of infrared sensors. Pulse tubes are also being developed for cooling of astronomical detectors where liquid cryogens are typically used, such as the Atacama Cosmology TelescopeAbout ACT (official site) or the Qubic experimentQUBIC Bolometric interferometry: the concept (official site) (an interferometer for cosmology studies). PTRs are used as precoolers of dilution refrigerators. Pulse tubes are particularly useful in space-based telescopes such as the James Webb Space TelescopeThe James Webb Space Telescope Cryocooler (JWST/NASA) where it is not possible to replenish the cryogens as they are depleted. It has also been suggested that pulse tubes could be used to liquefy oxygen on Mars.  Principle of operation  Figure 1: Schematic drawing of a Stirling-type single-orifice PTR. From left to right: a compressor, a heat exchanger (X1), a regenerator, a heat exchanger (X2), a tube (often called \\"the pulse tube\\"), a heat exchanger (X3), a flow resistance (orifice), and a buffer volume. The cooling is generated at the low temperature TL. Room temperature is TH. Figure 1 represents the Stirling-type single-orifice Pulse-Tube Refrigerator (PTR), which is filled with a gas, typically helium at a pressure varying from 10 to 30 bar. From left to right the components are: * a compressor, with a piston moving back and forth at room temperature TH * a heat exchanger X1 where heat is released to the surroundings at room temperature * a regenerator consisting of a porous medium with a large specific heat (which can be stainless steel wire mesh, copper wire mesh, phosphor bronze wire mesh or lead balls or lead shot or rare earth materials to produce very low temperature) in which the gas flows back and forth * a heat exchanger X2, cooled by the gas, where the useful cooling power \\\\dot{Q}_L is delivered at the low temperature TL, taken from the object to be cooled * a tube in which the gas is pushed and pulled * a heat exchanger X3 at room temperature where heat is released to the surroundings * a flow resistance (often called orifice) * a buffer volume (a large closed volume at practically constant pressure) Figure 2: Left: (near X2): a gas element enters the tube with temperature TL and leaves it with a lower temperature. Right: (near X3): a gas element enters the tube with temperature TH and leaves it with a higher temperature. The part in between X1 and X3 is thermally insulated from the surroundings, usually by vacuum. The pressure varies gradually and the velocities of the gas are low. So the name \\"pulse\\" tube cooler is misleading, since there are no pulses in the system. The piston moves periodically from left to right and back. As a result, the gas also moves from left to right and back while the pressure within the system increases and decreases. If the gas from the compressor space moves to the right it enters the regenerator with temperature TH and leaves the regenerator at the cold end with temperature TL, hence heat is transferred into the regenerator material. On its return the heat stored within the regenerator is transferred back into the gas. In the tube the gas is thermally isolated (adiabatic), so the temperature of the gas in the tube varies with the pressure. At the cold end of the tube, the gas enters the tube via X2 when the pressure is high with temperature TL and return when the pressure is low with a temperature below TL, hence taking up heat from X2 : this gives the desired cooling effect at X2. To understand why the low-pressure gas returns at a lower temperature, look at figure 1 and consider gas molecules close to X3 (at the hot end) which move in and out of the tube through the orifice. Molecules flow into the tube when the pressure in the tube is low (it is sucked into the tube via X3 coming from the orifice and the buffer). At the moment of entering the tube it has the temperature TH. Later in the cycle the same mass of gas is pushed out from the tube again when the pressure inside the tube is high. As a consequence its temperature will be higher than TH. In the heat exchanger X3, it releases heat and cools down to the ambient temperature TH. Figure 3: Coaxial pulse tube with a displacer Figure 3 shows a Coaxial Pulse Tube which is a more useful configuration in which the regenerator surrounds the central pule tube. This is compact and places the cold head at an end so it is easy to integrate with whatever is to be cooled. The displacer can be passively driven, and this recovers work that would otherwise be dissipated in the orifice.  Performance  The performance of the cooler is determined mainly by the quality of the regenerator. It has to satisfy conflicting requirements: it must have a low flow resistance (so it must be short with wide channels), but the heat exchange should also be good (so it must be long with narrow channels). The material must have a large heat capacity. At temperatures above 50 K practically all materials are suitable. Bronze or stainless steel is often used. For temperatures between 10 and 50 K lead is most suitable. Below 10 K one uses magnetic materials which are specially developed for this application. The so-called Coefficient Of Performance \\\\xi (COP) of coolers is defined as the ratio between the cooling power \\\\dot{Q}_L and the compressor power P. In formula: \\\\xi = \\\\dot{Q}_L/P. For a perfectly reversible cooler, \\\\xi is given by Carnot's theorem : However, a pulse-tube refrigerator is not perfectly reversible due to the presence of the orifice, which has flow resistance. Instead, the COP of an ideal PTR is given by which is lower than that of ideal coolers.  Comparison with other coolers  In most coolers gas is compressed and expanded periodically. Well-known coolers such as the Stirling engine coolers and the popular Gifford-McMahon coolers have a displacer that ensures that the cooling (due to expansion) takes place in a different region of the machine than the heating (due to compression). Due to its clever design the PTR does not have such a displacer. This means that the construction of a PTR is simpler, cheaper, and more reliable. Furthermore, there are no mechanical vibrations and no electro-magnetic interferences. The basic operation of cryocoolers and related thermal machines is described by De Waele  History  Figure 4: The temperature of PTRs over the years. The temperature of 1.2 K is reached in a collaboration between the groups of Giessen and Eindhoven. They used a superfluid vortex cooler as an additional cooling stage to the PTR. Joseph Waldo, in the 1960s, invented the so-called Basic Pulse Tube Refrigerator. The modern PTR was invented by Mikulin by introducing orifice in Basic pulse tube in 1984. He reached a temperature of 105 K. Soon after that, PTRs became better due to the invention of new variations. This is shown in figure 4, where the lowest temperature for PTRs is plotted as a function of time. At the moment, the lowest temperature is below the boiling point of helium (4.2 K). Originally this was considered to be impossible. For some time it looked as if it would be impossible to cool below the lambda point of 4He (2.17 K), but the Low-Temperature group of the Eindhoven University of Technology managed to cool to a temperature of 1.73 K by replacing the usual 4He as refrigerant by its rare isotope 3He. Later this record was broken by the Giessen Group that managed to get even below 1.3 K. In a collaboration between the groups from Giessen and Eindhoven a temperature of 1.2 K was reached by combining a PTR with a superfluid vortex cooler.  Types of pulse-tube refrigerators  For getting the cooling, the source of the pressure variations is unimportant. PTRs for temperatures below 20 K usually operate at frequencies of 1 to 2 Hz and with pressure variations from 10 to 25 bar. The swept volume of the compressor would be very high (up to one liter and more). Therefore, the compressor is uncoupled from the cooler. A system of valves (usually a rotating valve) alternatingly connects the high- pressure and the low-pressure side of the compressor to the hot end of the regenerator. As the high-temperature part of this type of PTR is the same as of GM-coolers this type of PTR is called a GM-type PTR. The gas flows through the valves are accompanied by losses which are absent in the Stirling-type PTR. PTRs can be classified according to their shape. If the regenerator and the tube are in line (as in fig. 1) we talk about a linear PTR. The disadvantage of the linear PTR is that the cold spot is in the middle of the cooler. For many applications it is preferable that the cooling is produced at the end of the cooler. By bending the PTR we get a U-shaped cooler. Both hot ends can be mounted on the flange of the vacuum chamber at room temperature. This is the most common shape of PTRs. For some applications it is preferable to have a cylindrical geometry. In that case the PTR can be constructed in a coaxial way so that the regenerator becomes a ring-shaped space surrounding the tube. The lowest temperature, reached with single-stage PTRs, is just above 10 K. However, one PTR can be used to precool the other. The hot end of the second tube is connected to room temperature and not to the cold end of the first stage. In this clever way it is avoided that the heat, released at the hot end of the second tube, is a load on the first stage. In applications the first stage also operates as a temperature-anchoring platform for e.g. shield cooling of superconducting-magnet cryostats. Matsubara and Gao were the first to cool below 4K with a three-stage PTR. With two-stage PTRs temperatures of 2.1 K, so just above the λ-point of helium, have been obtained. With a three-stage PTR 1.73 K has been reached using 3He as the working fluid.  Prospects  The coefficient of performance of PTRs at room temperature is low, so it is not likely that they will play a role in domestic cooling. However, below about 80 K the coefficient of performance is comparable with other coolers (compare equations () and ()) and in the low- temperature region the advantages get the upper hand. For the 70K- and the 4K temperature regions PTRs are commercially available. They are applied in infrared detection systems, for reduction of thermal noise in devices based on (high-Tc) superconductivity such as SQUIDs, and filters for telecommunication. PTRs are also suitable for cooling MRI-systems and energy-related systems using superconducting magnets. In so-called dry magnets, coolers are used so that no cryoliquid is needed at all or for the recondensation of the evaporated helium. Also the combination of cryocoolers with 3He-4He dilution refrigerators for the temperature region down to 2 mK is attractive since in this way the whole temperature range from room temperature to 2 mK is easier to access.

Made from a mixture of lignite coal dust and a gluing agent that kept the dust particles together, they were a welcome alternative to firewood and natural coal partly because they came in a consistent, stackable size and shape. There are 5 standard sizes for yeontan, and the 2nd standard is widely used in households. The 2nd standard briquette is cylindrical in shape, weighs 3.5 kg, and is about 20 cm in height and 15 cm in diameter. The standard yeontan has 22 holes drilled into its top to facilitate steady, efficient burning, and a household typically used one to three briquettes per day in the winter. A new yeontan would sometimes be placed atop the current one when it was halfway burned, to continuously maintain the fire. The same fire used for cooking also served to heat the house, through a Korean radiant underfloor heating system called ondol. History Introduced to Korea from Japan in the 1920s, yeontan rose in popularity following the Korean War. By 1988, 78% of Korean households used yeontan, but this fell to 33% by 1993 as people switched to oil and gas boilers, and was estimated to be used by just 2% of households by 2001. The boilers reduced the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, which was a major cause of death in coal-heated houses. In recent years amid South Korea's suicide epidemic, yeontan has seen use as a method of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.

There is uncertainty regarding the exact year of Vieussens birth, with some sources placing it as late as 1641. He studied medicine at the University of Montpellier where he earned his degree in 1670. He later became head physician at Hôtel Dieu Saint-Eloi in Montpellier. Vieussens is remembered for his pioneer work in the field of cardiology, and his anatomical studies of the brain and spinal cord. He regarded English anatomist Thomas Willis (1621–1675) as a major influence towards his career. Vieussens is credited as being the first physician to give accurate descriptions of the left ventricle and several blood vessels of the heart. He was also the first to give a comprehensive description of mitral stenosis, as well as other types of heart disease and circulatory disorders. He provided an early description of the brain's centrum semiovale, which is sometimes referred to as \\"Vieussens' centrum\\". This structure is also known as \\"Vicq d'Azyr's centrum\\", named after Félix Vicq-d'Azyr (1746–1794), who provided a later, more detailed description. Several other anatomical structures are named after Vieussens, however they have largely been replaced by clinical nomenclature. These include \\"Vieussens' valve\\" (superior medullary velum), \\"Vieussens' ventricle\\" (cavity of septum pellucidum), \\"Vieussens' ansa\\" (subclavian loop), \\"Vieussens' ganglia\\" (celiac ganglia), \\"Vieussens' isthmus\\" (limbus of fossa ovalis) and \\"Vieussens' veins\\" (innominate cardiac veins). He also provided an early description of the tiny openings in the veins of the right atrium of the heart that are known as \\"Vieussens' foramina\\", or foramina venarum minimarum, and sometimes \\"Thebesian foramina\\" after Adam Christian Thebesius (1686–1732).another important finding named after him in the field of cardiology is the vieussens collateral, that is an arterial relation between the proximal part of the right coronary artery(RCA) to left anterior diagonal artery(LAD), providing some blood flow for the myocardium distal to the coronary lesion in the LAD. This collateral blood supply reduces ischemia and protects that part of myocardium from complete necrosis. Among his written works are Neurographia universalis, an early work on neuroanatomy that is known for its excellent copperplate illustrations, and Novum vasorum corporis humani systema, an important treatise on the anatomy and diseases of the heart. During his lifetime, Vieussens was known for his controversial views on human physiology, which speculatively went beyond what the scientific evidence would have sanctioned at that time.

It is centred around the city of Osoyoos and is the only semi-arid shrubland in Canada. Part of this ecosystem is referred to as the Nk'mip Desert by the Osoyoos Indian Band, though it is identical to the shrublands elsewhere in the region.  Ecology  According to the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC), this region lies within the northern reach of the Columbia Plateau ecoregion (10.1.2). It is defined by a cold semi-arid climate and an ecosystem of mixed shrublands and grasslands largely devoid of trees. Heading north, ecoregion gradually transitions into the Thompson-Okanogan Plateau ecoregion (10.1.1) around the shores of Skaha Lake. Using ecoregions defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), this region lies within the northern reach of the Palouse grasslands ecoregion, which is defined almost identically to that of the CEC's Columbia Plateau ecoregion in terms of climate and defining vegetation. Flora The Okanagan shrub-steppe is defined by the presence of an antelope-brush ecosystem containing several species of flora and fauna found nowhere else in Canada. The South Okanagan shrub-steppe ecosystem is a habitat for 30% of the Red-listed and 46% of the Blue-listed vertebrates in British Columbia, with several listed as threatened or endangered. More than 24 invertebrates exist only in the Okanagan Desert, with an additional 80 species occurring nowhere else in Canada.Dyer, Orville. 2002.

The asterisks, or \\"stars\\" following the serial number indicate this is a replacement note for one that was misprinted. A replacement banknote, commonly referred to as a star note, is a banknote that is printed to replace a faulty one and is used as a control mechanism for governments or monetary authorities to know the exact number of banknotes being printed. Also, since no two serial numbers can be the same,https://www.moneyfactory.gov/resources/serialnumbers.html the bill is simply reprinted with a symbol in the serial number, identifying it as a replacement for an error note. Replacement bills have different symbols to mark the error around the world, although the most popular examples are \\"star notes\\". Description As quality control finds defective notes in the printing process after the serial number has been overprinted, they are taken out with their serial number written down and replaced with another banknote printed specifically for this purpose, so that the number of banknotes being printed stays the same in each production batch. This saves time and money compared to re-printing exactly the same serial number that was used before. It is rare that the replacement banknote has the same serial number as the original faulty one. A replacement note will have its own serial-numbering system that separates it from the normal numbering system. Examples of marker by countries * The United States and the Philippines use, and Australia used until 1972, the \\"★\\" in the serial number to mark a replacement banknote. These are known as \\"star notes\\". * Argentina uses \\"R\\" in the serial number to mark replacement banknotes. * The Bahamas, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Guatemala use \\"Z\\" in the serial number to mark replacement banknotes. Malaysian replacement banknotes of RM100, RM20 and RM10  * Scotland, Hong Kong and Mongolia use \\"ZZ\\" in the serial number to mark replacement banknotes. * Singapore uses \\"Z/0\\" in the serial number to mark replacement banknotes. * Indonesia uses \\"X\\" in the serial number to mark replacement banknotes. * Iraq uses prefix \\"Letter/99\\" in the serial number to mark replacement banknotes. * Zambia uses \\"X3\\" in the serial number to mark replacement polymer banknotes. * Thailand uses \\"5 OS\\" in the serial number to mark replacement polymer banknotes. * Serbia uses \\"ZA\\" in the serial number to mark replacement banknotes. * Nigeria uses \\"DZ\\" in the serial number to mark replacement banknotes. Different countries may also have their own numbering or marking schemes. There is no guaranteed way to know the rarity of replacement banknotes as they are only introduced to replace defective ones. Some banknote collectors go after these rather unusual banknotes as their specialty. Both paper and polymer replacement notes exist as this control mechanism. Star note A star note is also a bank note that has an asterisk (*), or star, after the serial number. Many early issues carried the star in front of the serial number. These have been used by various countries around the world including Australia and the United States. In the US, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing inspects currency for printing errors prior to releasing notes into general circulation. When notes are discovered that have been printed incorrectly (such as having the serial numbers upside down, etc.) the misprinted \\"error notes\\" are replaced with star notes because no two bills within a certain series can be produced with the same serial number. They are used to maintain a correct count of notes in a serial number run. By their nature, star notes are more scarce than notes with standard serial numbers and as such are widely collected by numismatists. Some of the highest prices paid for modern (post-1928) U.S. banknotes have been for star notes. A star note was also substituted for the last note in a block rather than printing a note with a serial number consisting of eight zeros. This practice is no longer in use, as the highest range of serial numbers is now reserved for uncut sheets sold to collectors, so regular notes intended for circulation do not reach the final serial number in the block.

Valencina is an interesting tourist destination, as it is a charming Andalusian town just 6 km from the sights and tourist attractions of Seville. Valencina de la Concepcion dates back to 2500BC when archaeological remains have demonstrated it as having been a major copper-smelting town. According to the 2005 census (INE), the town has a population of 7431 inhabitants. On the second Sunday of October there is a public holiday in Valencina de la Concepción, called \\"Romería de Torrijos\\", which has been declared a festival of national tourist interest since 1998. In 1923 the decision was taken to establish a pilgrimage to the sanctuary of Torrijos on the second Sunday of October, carrying in procession the image of the patroness. The Virgin is accompanied by numerous pilgrims in decorated carriages or on horseback. When the Virgin arrives at the Torrijos Hacienda, mass is celebrated in the central courtyard, for later introduce the image of the Virgin in the interior of the chapel. Back to the town and after a day outdoors, the \\"romeros\\" start to party, along with all the visitors. Is the most important pilgrimage of all the Aljarafe.

Dolmen in Valencina de la Concepción. Also, Valencina de la Concepción has a big Chalcolithic deposit, one of the biggest of Spain. In Valencina there are two very famous dolmens, the dolmen of Matarrubilla and the Dolmen de la Pastora. A dolmen is a megalithic tomb with several upright stones supporting a flat table or capstone. Many date back to pre 3000BC. Originally the dolmens were covered with earth to form a barrow, but time has eroded everything leaving just the stones intact. There are several restaurants and hotels in the town.

The debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki concerns the ethical, legal, and military controversies surrounding the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August 1945 at the close of World War II (1939–45). The Soviet Union declared war on Japan an hour before 9 August and invaded Manchuria at one minute past midnight; Japan surrendered on 15 August. On 26 July 1945, United States President Harry S. Truman, United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Chairman of the Chinese Nationalist Government Chiang Kai-shek issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. This ultimatum stated if Japan did not surrender, it would face \\"prompt and utter destruction\\".\\"Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender issued at Potsdam Germany\\", 26 July 1945. Retrieved on 15 January 2012. Some debaters focus on the presidential decision-making process, and others on whether or not the bombings were the proximate cause of Japanese surrender. Over the course of time, different arguments have gained and lost support as new evidence has become available and as new studies have been completed. A primary and continuing focus has been on the role of the bombings in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s justification for them based upon the premise that the bombings precipitated the surrender. This remains the subject of both scholarly and popular debate. In 2005, in an overview of historiography about the matter, J. Samuel Walker wrote, \\"the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue\\". Walker stated, \\"The fundamental issue that has divided scholars over a period of nearly four decades is whether the use of the bomb was necessary to achieve victory in the war in the Pacific on terms satisfactory to the United States.\\". Supporters of the bombings generally assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties on both sides in the planned invasion of Japan: Kyūshū was to be invaded in November 1945 and Honshū four months later. It was thought Japan would not surrender unless there was an overwhelming demonstration of destructive capability. Those who oppose the bombings argue it was militarily unnecessary,The Collins Encyclopedia of Military History, Dupuy & Dupuy, BCA 1994, p. 1308 inherently immoral, a war crime, or a form of state terrorism.. Critics believe a naval blockade and conventional bombings would have forced Japan to surrender unconditionally.Kramer, Ronald C; Kauzlarich, David (2011), Rothe, Dawn; Mullins, Christopher W, eds., \\"Nuclear weapons, international law, and the normalization of state crime\\", State crime: Current perspectives, pp. 94–121, . Some critics believe Japan was more motivated to surrender by the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria and other Japanese-held areas. Support Prevention of many U.S. military casualties ground battle for Japan. Two landings were planned: (1) Olympic – the invasion of the southern island, Kyūshū, (2) Coronet – the invasion of the main island, Honshū. Operation Coronet was planned to take Tokyo with a landing of 25 divisions, compared to D-Day's 12 divisions. Those who argue in favor of the decision to drop the atomic bombs on enemy targets believe massive casualties on both sides would have occurred in Operation Downfall, the planned Allied invasion of Japan.Ending the Pacific War: Harry Truman and the Decision To Drop the Bomb April 2009 http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/1404.200904.frank.trumanbomb.html The bulk of the force invading Japan would be American although the British Commonwealth would contribute three divisions of troops (one each from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia).Allan Brooke: War Diaries 1939–1945. June 28. The U.S. anticipated losing many combatants in Downfall, although the number of expected fatalities and wounded is subject to some debate. U.S. President Harry S. Truman stated in 1953 he had been advised U.S. casualties could range from 250,000 to one million combatants.President Truman to James L. Cate, January 12, 1953. http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/small/mb18g.htm Assistant Secretary of the Navy Ralph Bard, a member of the Interim Committee on atomic matters, stated that while meeting with Truman in the summer of 1945 they discussed the bomb's use in the context of massive combatant and non- combatant casualties from invasion, with Bard raising the possibility of a million Allied combatants being killed. As Bard opposed using the bomb without warning Japan first, he cannot be accused of exaggerating casualty expectations to justify the bomb's use, and his account is evidence that Truman was aware of, and government officials discussed, the possibility of one million casualties.. A quarter of a million casualties is roughly the level the Joint War Plans Committee estimated, in its paper (JWPC 369/1) prepared for Truman's 18 June meeting. A review of documents from the Truman Library shows Truman's initial draft response to the query describes Marshall only as saying \\"one quarter of a million would be the minimum\\". The \\"as much as a million\\" phrase was added to the final draft by Truman's staff, so as not to appear to contradict an earlier statement given in a published article by Stimson (former Secretary of War).The Final Months of the War With Japan.

Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses resulting from a very effective sea blockade and the Allied firebombing campaign. Generals George C. Marshall and Douglas MacArthur signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.. In addition, a large number of Japanese combatant and non-combatant casualties were expected as a result of such actions. Contemporary estimates of Japanese deaths from an invasion of the Home Islands range from several hundreds of thousands to as high as ten million. General MacArthur's staff provided an estimated range of American deaths depending on the duration of the invasion, and also estimated a 22:1 ratio of Japanese to American deaths. From this, a low figure of somewhat more than 200,000 Japanese deaths can be calculated for a short invasion of two weeks, and almost three million Japanese deaths if the fighting lasted four months. A widely cited estimate of five to ten million Japanese deaths came from a study by William Shockley and Quincy Wright; the upper figure was used by Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy, who characterized it as conservative.. Some 400,000 additional Japanese deaths might have occurred in the expected Soviet invasion of Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's main islands,. although the Soviets lacked the naval capability to invade the Japanese home islands, let alone to take Hokkaido. An Air Force Association webpage states that \\"Millions of women, old men, and boys and girls had been trained to resist by such means as attacking with bamboo spears and strapping explosives to their bodies and throwing themselves under advancing tanks.\\" The AFA noted that \\"[t]he Japanese cabinet had approved a measure extending the draft to include men from ages fifteen to sixty and women from seventeen to forty-five (an additional 28 million people)\\". The great loss of life during the battle of Iwo Jima and other Pacific islands gave U.S. leaders an idea of the casualties that would happen with a mainland invasion. Of the 22,060 Japanese combatants entrenched on Iwo Jima, 21,844 died either from fighting or by ritual suicide. Only 216 Japanese POWs were held at the hand of the Americans during the battle. According to the official Navy Department Library website, \\"The 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead\\" with 19,217 wounded., talks about how many historians have overestimated the number Japanese defenders, with 20,000 and even 25,000 listed. Burrell puts the range between 18,061 and 18,591, with exactly 216 of these taken prisoner. The rest were KIA or MIA. To put this into context, the 82-day Battle of Okinawa lasted from early April until mid-June 1945 and U.S. casualties (out of five Army and two Marine divisions) were above 62,000, of which more than 12,000 were killed or missing.. The U.S. military had nearly 500,000 Purple Heart medals manufactured in anticipation of potential casualties from the planned invasion of Japan. To date, all American military casualties of the 60 years following the end of World War II, including the Korean and Vietnam Wars, have not exceeded that number. In 2003, there were still 120,000 of these Purple Heart medals in stock.Giangreco, Dennis M. & Moore, Kathryn, \\"Are New Purple Hearts Being Manufactured to Meet the Demand?\\"; History News Network (December 1, 2003), Retrieved December 4, 2006 Because of the number available, combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan were able to keep Purple Hearts on hand for immediate award to wounded soldiers on the field. Speedy end of war saved lives Supporters of the bombings argue waiting for the Japanese to surrender would also have cost lives. \\"For China alone, depending upon what number one chooses for overall Chinese casualties, in each of the ninety-seven months between July 1937 and August 1945, somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 persons perished, the vast majority of them noncombatants. For the other Asian states alone, the average probably ranged in the tens of thousands per month, but the actual numbers were almost certainly greater in 1945, notably due to the mass death in a famine in Vietnam. Westerners.'\\". This justification of \\"saving lives\\" was never used by Truman in the weeks following the strikes, and there was no need to: the American public viewed the nuclear attacks positively. It did surface years afterwards in his memoirs: during the interim, of course, questions had been raised about the necessity and morality of his decision to atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. See : \\"Even when secret wartime documents were declassified, historians did not focus on the striking inconsistencies between these documents and those parts of the principal decision-makers' memoirs that dealt with estimates of lives saved.\\" Miles, a veteran government official and former senior fellow of the Wilson Center, described the notion that Hiroshima saved 500,000 American military and numerous other deaths simply as a \\"myth\\". The end of the war limited the expansion of the Japanese controlled Vietnamese famine of 1945, stopping it at 1–2 million deaths and also liberated millions of Allied prisoners of war and civilian laborers working in harsh conditions under a forced mobilization. In the Dutch East Indies, there was a \\"forced mobilization of some 4 million—although some estimates are as high as 10 million—romusha (manual labourers) ... About 270,000 romusha were sent to the Outer Islands and Japanese-held territories in Southeast Asia, where they joined other Asians in performing wartime construction projects. At the end of the war, only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\\"Library of Congress, 1992, \\"Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45\\" Access date: 9 February 2007. Supporters also point to an order given by the Japanese War Ministry on August 1, 1944, ordering the execution of Allied POWs, \\"when an uprising of large numbers cannot be suppressed without the use of firearms\\" or when the POW camp was in the combat zone, in fear that \\"escapees from the camp may turn into a hostile fighting force\\".http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Document_No._2701, The only existing original copy of this general order was found by Jack Edwards after the war, in the ruins of the Kinkaseki prisoner of war camp in Formosa. (Edwards p. 260) The Operation Meetinghouse firebombing raid on Tokyo alone killed 100,000 civilians on the night of March 9–10, 1945, causing more civilian death and destruction than either of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Freeman Dyson.

Japan Focus, 10 March 2005 .Rhodes, Richard. \\"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\\". p. 599. Simon & Schuster Paperbacks (1984) . A total of 350,000 civilians died in the incendiary raids on 67 Japanese cities. Because the United States Army Air Forces wanted to use its fission bombs on previously undamaged cities in order to have accurate data on nuclear-caused damage, Kokura, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Niigata were preserved from conventional bombing raids. Otherwise, they would all have been firebombed.. Intensive conventional bombing would have continued or increased prior to an invasion. The submarine blockade and the United States Army Air Forces's mining operation, Operation Starvation, had effectively cut off Japan's imports. A complementary operation against Japan's railways was about to begin, isolating the cities of southern Honshū from the food grown elsewhere in the Home Islands. \\"Immediately after the defeat, some estimated that 10 million people were likely to starve to death\\", noted historian Daikichi Irokawa.; citing Irokawa, The Age of Hirohito: In Search of Modern Japan (1995), p. 37. Meanwhile, fighting continued in the Philippines, New Guinea and Borneo, and offensives were scheduled for September in southern China and Malaya. The Soviet invasion of Manchuria had, in the week before the surrender, caused over 80,000 deaths. In September 1945, nuclear physicist Karl Taylor Compton, who himself took part in the Manhattan Project, visited MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo, and following his visit wrote a defensive article, in which he summarized his conclusions as follows: Philippine justice Delfin Jaranilla, member of the Tokyo tribunal, wrote in his judgment: Lee Kuan Yew, the Former Prime Minister of Singapore concurred: Lee witnessed his home city being invaded by the Japanese and was nearly executed in the Sook Ching Massacre. Part of total war This Tokyo residential section was virtually destroyed following the Operation Meetinghouse fire-bombing of Tokyo on the night of 9/10 March 1945, which was the single deadliest air raid in human history; with a greater loss of life than the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima or Nagasaki as single events or a greater civilian death toll and area of fire damage than both nuclear bombings combined. Chinese civilians massacred during Japan's campaign of total war in Xuzhou Supporters of the bombings have argued the Japanese government had promulgated a National Mobilization Law and waged total war, ordering many civilians (including women, children, and old people) to work in factories and other infrastructure attached to the war effort and to fight against any invading force. Unlike the United States and Nazi Germany, over 90% of the Japanese war production was done in unmarked workshops and cottage industries which were widely dispersed within residential areas in cities and thus making them more extensively difficult to find and attack. In addition, the dropping of high explosives with precision bombing was unable to penetrate Japan's dispersed industry, making it entirely impossible to destroy them without causing widespread damage to surrounding areas.John Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945, Random House, 1970, p. 671.Stephen L. McFarland, A Concise History of the U.S. Air Force, Air Force History and Museums Program, October 20, 1997, p. 38. General Curtis LeMay stated why he ordered the systematic carpet bombing of Japanese cities: For six months prior to the combat use of nuclear weapons, the United States Army Air Forces under LeMay's command undertook a major strategic bombing campaign against Japanese cities through the use of incendiary bombs, destroying 67 cities and killing an estimated 350,000 civilians. The Operation Meetinghouse raid on Tokyo on the night of 9/10 March 1945 stands as the deadliest air raid in human history, killing 100,000 civilians and destroying of the city that night. The attack caused more civilian deaths and damage to urbanized land than any other single air attack, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. Colonel Harry F. Cunningham, an intelligence officer of the Fifth Air Force, noted that in addition to civilians producing weapons of war in cities, the Japanese government created a large civilian militia organization in order to train millions of civilians to be armed and to resist the American invaders. In his official intelligence review on July 21, 1945, he declared that: Supporters of the bombings have emphasized the strategic significance of the targets. Hiroshima was used as headquarters of the Second General Army and Fifth Division, which commanded the defense of southern Japan with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. The city was also a communication center, an assembly area for combatants, a storage point, and had major industrial factories and workshops as well, and its air defenses consisted of five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns.Hiroshima: Hubertus Hoffmann meets the only U.S. Officer on both A-Missions and one of his Victims , Dr. Hubertus Hoffmann Nagasaki was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, warships, military equipment, and other war material. The city's air defenses consisted of four batteries of 7 cm (2.8 in) anti-aircraft guns and two searchlight batteries. An estimated 110,000 people were killed in the atomic bombings, including 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers in Hiroshima and 23,145–28,113 Japanese factory workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants in Nagasaki.Nagasaki 1945: the first full-length eyewitness account of the atomic bomb attack on Nagasaki, 1985, pp. 134–37, Tatsuichirō Akizuki and Gordon HoneycombeThe Impact of the A-bomb, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 1945–85, pp. 56–78, Iwanami Shoten On 30 June 2007, Japan's defense minister Fumio Kyūma said the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan by the United States during World War II was an inevitable way to end the war. Kyūma said: \\"I now have come to accept in my mind that in order to end the war, it could not be helped (shikata ga nai) that an atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and that countless numbers of people suffered great tragedy.\\" Kyūma, who is from Nagasaki, said the bombing caused great suffering in the city, but he does not resent the U.S. because it prevented the Soviet Union from entering the war with Japan. Kyūma's comments were similar to those made by Emperor Hirohito when, in his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, he was asked what he thought of the bombing of Hiroshima, and answered: \\"It's very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn't be helped (shikata ga nai) because that happened in wartime.\\"; . In early July 1945, on his way to Potsdam, Truman had re-examined the decision to use the bomb. In the end, he made the decision to drop the atomic bombs on strategic cities. His stated intention in ordering the bombings was to save American lives, to bring about a quick resolution of the war by inflicting destruction, and instilling fear of further destruction, sufficient to cause Japan to surrender.. In his speech to the Japanese people presenting his reasons for surrender on August 15, the Emperor referred specifically to the atomic bombs, stating if they continued to fight it would not only result in \\"an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization\\". Commenting on the use of the atomic bomb, then-U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson stated, \\"The atomic bomb was more than a weapon of terrible destruction; it was a psychological weapon.\\"\\"Least Abhorrent Choice\\", Time magazine, 3 February 1947 In 1959, Mitsuo Fuchida, the pilot who led the first wave in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, met with General Paul Tibbets, who piloted the Enola Gay that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and told him that: Japan's leaders refused to surrender Some historians see ancient Japanese warrior traditions as a major factor in the resistance in the Japanese military to the idea of surrender. According to one Air Force account, Japanese militarism was aggravated by the Great Depression, and had resulted in countless assassinations of reformers attempting to check military power, among them Takahashi Korekiyo, Saitō Makoto, and Inukai Tsuyoshi. This created an environment in which opposition to war was a much riskier endeavor. According to historian Richard B. Frank, The United States Department of Energy's history of the Manhattan Project lends some credence to these claims, saying that military leaders in Japan While some members of the civilian leadership did use covert diplomatic channels to attempt peace negotiation, they could not negotiate surrender or even a cease-fire. Japan could legally enter into a peace agreement only with the unanimous support of the Japanese cabinet, and in the summer of 1945, the Japanese Supreme War Council, consisting of representatives of the Army, the Navy, and the civilian government, could not reach a consensus on how to proceed. A political stalemate developed between the military and civilian leaders of Japan, the military increasingly determined to fight despite all costs and odds and the civilian leadership seeking a way to negotiate an end to the war. Further complicating the decision was the fact no cabinet could exist without the representative of the Imperial Japanese Army. This meant the Army or Navy could veto any decision by having its Minister resign, thus making them the most powerful posts on the SWC. In early August 1945, the cabinet was equally split between those who advocated an end to the war on one condition, the preservation of the kokutai, and those who insisted on three other conditions:. # Leave disarmament and demobilization to Imperial General Headquarters # No occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa # Delegation to the Japanese government of the punishment of war criminals The \\"hawks\\" consisted of General Korechika Anami, General Yoshijirō Umezu, and Admiral Soemu Toyoda and were led by Anami. The \\"doves\\" consisted of Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki, Naval Minister Mitsumasa Yonai, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Tōgō and were led by Togo. Under special permission of Hirohito, the president of the Privy council, Hiranuma Kiichirō, was also a member of the imperial conference. For him, the preservation of the kokutai implied not only the Imperial institution but also the Emperor's reign.. Japan had an example of unconditional surrender in the German Instrument of Surrender. On 26 July, Truman and other Allied leaders—except the Soviet Union—issued the Potsdam Declaration outlining terms of surrender for Japan. The declaration stated, \\"The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.\\" It was not accepted, though there is debate on Japan's intentions.. The Emperor, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position.. In the PBS documentary \\"Victory in the Pacific\\" (2005), broadcast in the American Experience series, historian Donald Miller argues, in the days after the declaration, the Emperor seemed more concerned with moving the Imperial Regalia of Japan to a secure location than with \\"the destruction of his country\\". This comment is based on declarations made by the Emperor to Kōichi Kido on 25 and 31 July 1945, when he ordered the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan to protect \\"at all cost\\" the Imperial Regalia.Kido Koichi nikki, Tokyo, Daigaku Shuppankai, 1966, pp. 1120–21 It has sometimes been argued Japan would have surrendered if simply guaranteed the Emperor would be allowed to continue as formal head of state. However, Japanese diplomatic messages regarding a possible Soviet mediation—intercepted through Magic, and made available to Allied leaders—have been interpreted by some historians to mean, \\"the dominant militarists insisted on preservation of the old militaristic order in Japan, the one in which they ruled.\\" On 18 and 20 July 1945, Ambassador Sato cabled to Foreign Minister Togo, strongly advocating that Japan accept an unconditional surrender provided that the U.S. preserved the imperial house (keeping the emperor). On 21 July, in response, Togo rejected the advice, saying that Japan would not accept an unconditional surrender under any circumstance. Togo then said that, \\"Although it is apparent that there will be more casualties on both sides in case the war is prolonged, we will stand as united against the enemy if the enemy forcibly demands our unconditional surrender.\\"; ; ; . They also faced potential death sentences in trials for Japanese war crimes if they surrendered. This was also what occurred in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and other tribunals. History professor Robert James Maddox wrote: Maddox also wrote, \\"Even after both bombs had fallen and Russia entered the war, Japanese militants insisted on such lenient peace terms that moderates knew there was no sense even transmitting them to the United States. Hirohito had to intervene personally on two occasions during the next few days to induce hardliners to abandon their conditions.\\" \\"That they would have conceded defeat months earlier, before such calamities struck, is far-fetched to say the least.\\". Even after the triple shock of the Soviet intervention and two atomic bombs, the Japanese cabinet was still deadlocked, incapable of deciding upon a course of action due to the power of the Army and Navy factions in cabinet, and of their unwillingness to even consider surrender. Following the personal intervention of the emperor to break the deadlock in favour of surrender, there were no less than three separate coup attempts by senior Japanese officers to try to prevent the surrender and take the Emperor into 'protective custody'. Once these coup attempts had failed, senior leaders of the air force and Navy ordered bombing and kamikaze raids on the U.S. fleet (in which some Japanese generals personally participated) to try to derail any possibility of peace. It is clear from these accounts that while many in the civilian government knew the war could not be won, the power of the military in the Japanese government kept surrender from even being considered as a real option prior to the two atomic bombs.. Another argument is that it was the Soviet declaration of war in the days between the bombings that caused the surrender. After the war, Admiral Soemu Toyoda said, \\"I believe the Russian participation in the war against Japan rather than the atom bombs did more to hasten the surrender.\\". Prime Minister Suzuki also declared that the entry of the USSR into the war made \\"the continuance of the war impossible\\".Edward Bunting, World War II Day by Day (Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2001) p. 652 Upon hearing news of the event from Foreign Minister Togo, Suzuki immediately said, \\"Let us end the war\\", and agreed to finally convene an emergency meeting of the Supreme Council with that aim. The official British history, The War Against Japan, also writes the Soviet declaration of war \\"brought home to all members of the Supreme Council the realization that the last hope of a negotiated peace had gone and there was no alternative but to accept the Allied terms sooner or later\\". The \\"one condition\\" faction, led by Togo, seized on the bombing as decisive justification of surrender. Kōichi Kido, one of Emperor Hirohito's closest advisers, stated, \\"We of the peace party were assisted by the atomic bomb in our endeavor to end the war.\\" Hisatsune Sakomizu, the chief Cabinet secretary in 1945, called the bombing \\"a golden opportunity given by heaven for Japan to end the war\\". Japanese nuclear weapon program During the war, and 1945 in particular, due to state secrecy, very little was known outside Japan about the slow progress of the Japanese nuclear weapon program. The US knew that Japan had requested materials from their German allies, and of unprocessed uranium oxide was dispatched to Japan in April 1945 aboard the submarine U-234, which however surrendered to US forces in the Atlantic following Germany's surrender. The uranium oxide was reportedly labeled as \\"U-235\\", which may have been a mislabeling of the submarine's name; its exact characteristics remain unknown. Some sources believe that it was not weapons- grade material and was intended for use as a catalyst in the production of synthetic methanol to be used for aviation fuel... If post-war analysis had found that Japanese nuclear weapons development was near completion, this discovery might have served in a revisionist sense to justify the atomic attack on Japan. However, it is known that the poorly coordinated Japanese project was considerably behind the US developments in 1945,Dees, pp. 20–21 and also behind the unsuccessful German nuclear energy project of WWII. A review in 1986 of the fringe hypothesis that Japan had already created a nuclear weapon, by Department of Energy employee Roger M. Anders, appeared in the journal Military Affairs: Other Truman felt that the effects of Japan witnessing a failed test would be too great of a risk to arrange such a demonstration. It emerged after the war that, had Japan not surrendered in August 1945, it was planning to attack the United States with biological weapons in September. Opposition Militarily unnecessary Assistant Secretary Bard was convinced that a standard bombardment and naval blockade would be enough to force Japan into surrendering. Even more, he had seen signs for weeks that the Japanese were actually already looking for a way out of the war. His idea was for the United States to tell the Japanese about the bomb, the impending Soviet entry into the war, and the fair treatment that citizens and the Emperor would receive at the coming Big Three conference. Before the bombing occurred, Bard pleaded with Truman to neither drop the bombs (at least not without warning the population first) nor to invade the entire country, proposing to stop the bloodshed. The 1946 United States Strategic Bombing Survey in Japan, whose members included Paul Nitze, concluded the atomic bombs had been unnecessary to win the war. They said: This conclusion assumed conventional fire bombing would have continued, with ever-increasing numbers of B-29s, and a greater level of destruction to Japan's cities and population.Richard Frank: Review of Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, Racing the Enemy (2006). Frank states: I do think, however, that buried in the mass of USSBS work was evidence not cited in the summary report that there was yet another scenario that might have produced surrender without the atomic bombs or Soviet entry. And I believe there is a reason why, if the author or authors of that opinion had this evidence in mind, they chose not to refer to it explicitly. The additional evidence submerged within the USSBS reports concerns the new August 11 strategic bombing directive. This reoriented the B-29 campaign away from urban incendiary attacks in favor of a massive attack on Japan's railroad system. This new bombing campaign coupled with Japan's extremely dire food situation does raise a legitimate question as to whether Japan might have surrendered without the atomic bombs or Soviet entry. One of Nitze's most influential sources was Prince Fumimaro Konoe, who responded to a question asking whether Japan would have surrendered if the atomic bombs had not been dropped by saying resistance would have continued through November or December 1945.. Historians such as Bernstein, Hasegawa, and Newman have criticized Nitze for drawing a conclusion they say went far beyond what the available evidence warranted, in order to promote the reputation of the Air Force at the expense of the Army and Navy.: \\"Paul Nitze recalled in his memoirs that he believed in July 1945 that Japan would surrender [in a matter of months] 'even without the atomic bomb.' ... It was natural for Nitze to begin his analysis with a hypothesis concerning the effects of the atomic bombs on ending the war with Japan. Yet Nitze remained committed to that notion even when the evidence—the interrogations of Japanese officials—did not reasonably support his conclusions. And Nitze's bold statement that his conclusions on why Japan surrendered were based on 'all the facts', after a mere three months of evidence gathering, stretches the limits of believability.\\" Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoir The White House Years: Other U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army Douglas MacArthur,Manchester, William. American Caesar: Douglas MacArthur 1880–1964, Dell, p. 512Norman Cousins writes, \\"When I asked General MacArthur about the decision to drop the bomb, I was surprised to learn he had not even been consulted. What, I asked, would his advice have been? He replied that he saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor.\\" See . Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the President), Brigadier General Carter Clarke (the military intelligence officer who prepared intercepted Japanese cables for U.S. officials), Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet), Fleet Admiral William Halsey Jr. (Commander of the US Third Fleet), and even the man in charge of all strategic air operations against the Japanese home islands, then-Major General Curtis LeMay: Stephen Peter Rosen of Harvard believes that a submarine blockade would have been sufficient to force Japan to surrender. Historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa wrote the atomic bombings themselves were not the principal reason for Japan's capitulation.. Instead, he contends, it was the Soviet entry in the war on 8 August, allowed by the Potsdam Declaration signed by the other Allies. The fact the Soviet Union did not sign this declaration gave Japan reason to believe the Soviets could be kept out of the war.. As late as 25 July, the day before the declaration was issued, Japan had asked for a diplomatic envoy led by Konoe to come to Moscow hoping to mediate peace in the Pacific.. Konoe was supposed to bring a letter from the Emperor stating: Hasegawa's view is, when the Soviet Union declared war on 8 August, it crushed all hope in Japan's leading circles that the Soviets could be kept out of the war and also that reinforcements from Asia to the Japanese islands would be possible for the expected invasion.. Hasegawa wrote: Ward Wilson wrote that \\"after Nagasaki was bombed only four major cities remained which could readily have been hit with atomic weapons\\", and that the Japanese Supreme Council did not bother to convene after the atomic bombings because they were barely more destructive than previous bombings. He wrote that instead, the Soviet declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria and South Sakhalin removed Japan's last diplomatic and military options for negotiating a conditional surrender, and this is what prompted Japan's surrender. He wrote that attributing Japan's surrender to a \\"miracle weapon\\", instead of the start of the Soviet invasion, saved face for Japan and enhanced the United States' world standing. Bombings as war crimes A number of notable individuals and organizations have criticized the bombings, many of them characterizing them as war crimes, crimes against humanity, and/or state terrorism. Early critics of the bombings were Albert Einstein, Eugene Wigner and Leó Szilárd, who had together spurred the first bomb research in 1939 with a jointly written letter to President Roosevelt. Szilárd, who had gone on to play a major role in the Manhattan Project, argued: The cenotaph at the Hiroshima Peace Park is inscribed with the sentence: \\"Let all the souls here rest in peace; this mistake shall not be repeated.\\" Although the sentence may seem ambiguous, it has been clarified that its intended agent is all of humanity, and the mistake referred to is war in general. A number of scientists who worked on the bomb were against its use. Led by Dr. James Franck, seven scientists submitted a report to the Interim Committee (which advised the President) in May 1945, saying: Mark Selden writes, \\"Perhaps the most trenchant contemporary critique of the American moral position on the bomb and the scales of justice in the war was voiced by the Indian jurist Radhabinod Pal, a dissenting voice at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, who balked at accepting the uniqueness of Japanese war crimes. Recalling Kaiser Wilhelm II's account of his duty to bring World War I to a swift end—\\"everything must be put to fire and sword; men, women and children and old men must be slaughtered and not a tree or house be left standing.\\" Pal observed: Selden mentions another critique of the nuclear bombing, which he says the U.S. government effectively suppressed for twenty-five years, as worth mention. On 11 August 1945, the Japanese government filed an official protest over the atomic bombing to the U.S. State Department through the Swiss Legation in Tokyo, observing: Selden concludes, despite the war crimes committed by the Empire of Japan, nevertheless, \\"the Japanese protest correctly pointed to U.S. violations of internationally accepted principles of war with respect to the wholesale destruction of populations\\". In 1963, the bombings were the subject of a judicial review in Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State.Shimoda et al. v. The State , Tokyo District Court, 7 December 1963 On the 22nd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the District Court of Tokyo declined to rule on the legality of nuclear weapons in general, but found, \\"the attacks upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused such severe and indiscriminate suffering that they did violate the most basic legal principles governing the conduct of war.\\" reprinted in In the opinion of the court, the act of dropping an atomic bomb on cities was at the time governed by international law found in the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare of 1907 and the Hague Draft Rules of Air Warfare of 1922–1923. and was therefore illegal.Falk, op. cit., p. 308. In the documentary The Fog of War, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara recalls General Curtis LeMay, who relayed the Presidential order to drop nuclear bombs on Japan, said: As the first combat use of nuclear weapons, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki represent to some the crossing of a crucial barrier. Peter Kuznick, director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University, wrote of President Truman: \\"He knew he was beginning the process of annihilation of the species.\\" Kuznick said the atomic bombing of Japan \\"was not just a war crime; it was a crime against humanity.\\" Takashi Hiraoka, mayor of Hiroshima, upholding nuclear disarmament, said in a hearing to The Hague International Court of Justice (ICJ): \\"It is clear that the use of nuclear weapons, which cause indiscriminate mass murder that leaves [effects on] survivors for decades, is a violation of international law\\".November 1995 Public Sitting, in the Case of Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflicts at La Hague International Court of JusticeSee also 1995 Peace Conference , by Takashi Hiraoka, Mayor of Hiroshima Iccho Itoh, the mayor of Nagasaki, declared in the same hearing: Although bombings do not meet the definition of genocide, some consider the definition too strict, and argue the bombings do constitute genocide.. Reviewed by .. For example, University of Chicago historian Bruce Cumings states there is a consensus among historians to Martin Sherwin's statement, \\"[T]he Nagasaki bomb was gratuitous at best and genocidal at worst\\".; . The scholar R. J. Rummel instead extends the definition of genocide to what he calls democide, and includes the major part of deaths from the atom bombings in these. His definition of democide includes not only genocide, but also an excessive killing of civilians in war, to the extent this is against the agreed rules for warfare; he argues the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes, and thus democide. Rummel quotes among others an official protest from the US government in 1938 to Japan, for its bombing of Chinese cities: \\"The bombing of non-combatant populations violated international and humanitarian laws.\\" He also considers excess deaths of civilians in conflagrations caused by conventional means, such as in Tokyo, as acts of democide. In 1967, Noam Chomsky described the atomic bombings as \\"among the most unspeakable crimes in history\\". Chomsky pointed to the complicity of the American people in the bombings, referring to the bitter experiences they had undergone prior to the event as the cause for their acceptance of its legitimacy.; : \\"And, quite properly, he turns the question back to us: To what extent are the British or American people responsible for the vicious terror bombings of civilians, perfected as a technique of warfare by the Western democracies and reaching their culmination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, surely among the most unspeakable crimes in history. To an undergraduate in 1945–46—to anyone whose political and moral consciousness had been formed by the horrors of the 1930s, by the war in Ethiopia, the Russian purge, the 'China Incident', the Spanish Civil War, the Nazi atrocities, the Western reaction to these events and, in part, complicity in them—these questions had particular significance and poignancy. In 2007, a group of intellectuals in Hiroshima established an unofficial body called International Peoples' Tribunal on the Dropping of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On 16 July 2007, it delivered its verdict, stating: About the legality and the morality of the action, the unofficial tribunal found: State terrorism Historical accounts indicate the decision to use the atomic bombs was made in order to provoke a surrender of Japan by use of an awe-inspiring power. These observations have caused Michael Walzer to state the incident was an act of \\"war terrorism: the effort to kill civilians in such large numbers that their government is forced to surrender. Hiroshima seems to me the classic case.\\" This type of claim eventually prompted historian Robert P. Newman, a supporter of the bombings, to say \\"there can be justified terror, as there can be just wars\\".. Certain scholars and historians have characterized the atomic bombings of Japan as a form of \\"state terrorism\\". This interpretation is based on a definition of terrorism as \\"the targeting of innocents to achieve a political goal\\". As Frances V. Harbour points out, the meeting of the Target Committee in Los Alamos on 10 and 11 May 1945 suggested targeting the large population centers of Kyoto or Hiroshima for a \\"psychological effect\\" and to make \\"the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized\\".. As such, Professor Harbour suggests the goal was to create terror for political ends both in and beyond Japan. However, Burleigh Taylor Wilkins believes it stretches the meaning of \\"terrorism\\" to include wartime acts.. Historian Howard Zinn wrote that the bombings were terrorism. Zinn cites the sociologist Kai Erikson who said that the bombings could not be called \\"combat\\" because they targeted civilians. Just War theorist Michael Walzer said that while taking the lives of civilians can be justified under conditions of 'supreme emergency', the war situation at that time did not constitute such an emergency. Tony Coady, Frances V. Harbour, and Jamal Nassar also view the targeting of civilians during the bombings as a form of terrorism. Nassar classifies the atomic bombings as terrorism in the same vein as the firebombing of Tokyo, the firebombing of Dresden, and the Holocaust.. Richard A. Falk, professor Emeritus of International Law and Practice at Princeton University has written in detail about Hiroshima and Nagasaki as instances of state terrorism. He said that \\"the explicit function of the attacks was to terrorize the population through mass slaughter and to confront its leaders with the prospect of national annihilation\\".. Author Steven Poole said that the \\"people killed by terrorism\\" are not the targets of the intended terror effect. He said that the atomic bombings were \\"designed as an awful demonstration\\" aimed at Stalin and the government of Japan.2006 Poole, Steven 'Unspeak', Little Brown, London. Alexander Werth, historian and BBC Eastern Front war correspondent, suggests that the nuclear bombing of Japan mainly served to demonstrate the new weapon in the most shocking way, virtually at the Soviet Union's doorstep, in order to prepare the political post-war field.Russia At War, 1941–1945. London: Barrie & Rockliff, 1964. Fundamentally immoral The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano expressed regret in August 1945 that the bomb's inventors did not destroy the weapon for the benefit of humanity. Rev. Cuthbert Thicknesse, the Dean of St Albans, prohibited using St Albans Abbey for a thanksgiving service for the war's end, calling the use of atomic weapons \\"an act of wholesale, indiscriminate massacre\\". In 1946, a report by the Federal Council of Churches entitled Atomic Warfare and the Christian Faith, includes the following passage: The bombers' chaplain, Father George Benedict Zabelka, would later renounce the bombings after visiting Nagasaki with two fellow chaplains. Continuation of previous behavior American historian Gabriel Kolko said certain discussion regarding the moral dimension of the attacks is wrong- headed, given the fundamental moral decision had already been made: Nagasaki bombing unnecessary The second atomic bombing, on Nagasaki, came only three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, when the devastation at Hiroshima had yet to be fully comprehended by the Japanese. References Okamoto, Mitsou. \\"War Memories or History: The Enola Gay Debate and the Peace Prayer Memorial\\". Peace Studies Association Conference, Tufts University, 10 March 1994. The lack of time between the bombings has led some historians to state that the second bombing was \\"certainly unnecessary\\",. \\"gratuitous at best and genocidal at worst\\",. and not jus in bello. In response to the claim that the atomic bombing of Nagasaki was unnecessary, Maddox wrote: Jerome Hagen indicates that War Minister Anami's revised briefing was partly based on interrogating captured American pilot Marcus McDilda. Under torture, McDilda reported that the Americans had 100 atomic bombs, and that Tokyo and Kyoto would be the next atomic bomb targets. Both were lies; McDilda was not involved or briefed on the Manhattan Project and simply told the Japanese what he thought they wanted to hear.Jerome T. Hagen. War in the Pacific: America at War, Volume I. Hawaii Pacific University, . Chapter, \\"The Lie of Marcus McDilda\\", 159–62 One day before the bombing of Nagasaki, the Emperor notified Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō of his desire to \\"insure a prompt ending of hostilities\\". Tōgō wrote in his memoir that the Emperor \\"warned [him] that since we could no longer continue the struggle, now that a weapon of this devastating power was used against us, we should not let slip the opportunity [to end the war] by engaging in attempts to gain more favorable conditions\\".Tōgō, Shigenori: The Cause of Japan, page 315. Simon & Schuster, 1956. The Emperor then requested Tōgō to communicate his wishes to the Prime Minister. Dehumanization Historian James J. Weingartner sees a connection between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings.. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. \\"[T]he widespread image of the Japanese as sub- human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands.\\". On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: \\"The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true\\".. International law At the time of the atomic bombings, there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft. Many critics of the atomic bombings point to the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 as setting rules in place regarding the attack of civilian populations. The Hague Conventions contained no specific air warfare provisions but it prohibited the targeting of undefended civilians by naval artillery, field artillery, or siege engines, all of which were classified as \\"bombardment\\". However, the Conventions allowed the targeting of military establishments in cities, including military depots, industrial plants, and workshops which could be used for war. This set of rules was not followed during World War I which saw bombs dropped indiscriminately on cities by Zeppelins and multi- engine bombers. Afterward, another series of meetings were held at The Hague in 1922–23, but no binding agreement was reached regarding air warfare. During the 1930s and 1940s, the aerial bombing of cities was resumed, notably by the German Condor Legion against the cities of Guernica and Durango in Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. This led to an escalation of various cities bombed, including Chongqing, Warsaw, Rotterdam, London, Coventry, Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo. All of the major belligerents in World War II dropped bombs on civilians in cities.. Modern debate over the applicability of the Hague Conventions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki revolves around whether the Conventions can be assumed to cover modes of warfare that were at the time unknown; whether rules for artillery bombardment can be applied to rules for aerial bombing. As well, the debate hinges on to what degree the Hague Conventions was being followed by the warring countries. If the Hague Conventions is admitted as applicable, the critical question becomes whether the bombed cities met the definition of \\"undefended\\". Some observers consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki undefended, some say that both cities were legitimate military targets, and others say that Hiroshima could be considered a legitimate military target while Nagasaki was comparatively undefended. Hiroshima has been argued as not a legitimate target because the major industrial plants were just outside the target area.. It has also been argued as a legitimate target because Hiroshima was the headquarters of the regional Second General Army and Fifth Division with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. Both cities were protected by anti-aircraft guns, which is an argument against the definition of \\"undefended\\". The Hague Conventions prohibited poison weapons. The radioactivity of the atomic bombings has been described as poisonous, especially in the form of nuclear fallout which kills more slowly.Newman 2011, p. 88 However, this view was rejected by the International Court of Justice in 1996, which stated that the primary and exclusive use of (air burst) nuclear weapons is not to poison or asphyxiate and thus is not prohibited by the Geneva Protocol. The Hague Conventions also prohibited the employment of \\"arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering\\". The Japanese government cited this prohibition on 10 August 1945 after submitting a letter of protest to the United States denouncing the use of atomic bombs. However, the prohibition only applied to weapons as lances with a barbed head, irregularly shaped bullets, projectiles filled with glass, the use of any substance on bullets that would tend unnecessarily to inflame a wound inflicted by them, along with grooving bullet tips or the creation of soft point bullets by filing off the ends of the hard coating on full metal jacketed bullets. It however did not apply to the use of explosives contained in artillery projectiles, mines, aerial torpedoes, or hand grenades.Indian Study Group of International Affairs. \\"The Indian Year Book of International Affairs, Volume 7\\". 1958 In 1962 and in 1963, the Japanese government retracted its previous statement by saying that there was no international law prohibiting the use of atomic bombs. The Hague Conventions stated that religious buildings, art and science centers, charities, hospitals, and historic monuments were to be spared as far as possible in a bombardment, unless they were being used for military purposes. Critics of the atomic bombings point to many of these kinds of structures which were destroyed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, the Hague Conventions also stated that for the destruction of the enemy's property to be justified, it must be \\"imperatively demanded by the necessities of war\\". Because of the inaccuracy of heavy bombers in World War II, it was not practical to target military assets in cities without damage to civilian targets. Even after the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, no international treaty banning or condemning nuclear warfare has ever been ratified. The closest example is a resolution by the UN General Assembly which stated that nuclear warfare was not in keeping with the UN charter, passed in 1953 with a vote of 25 to 20, and 26 abstentions. Impact on surrender Varying opinions exist on the question of what role the bombings played in Japan's surrender, and some regard the bombings as the deciding factor,: \\"[Hiroshima and Nagaski] brought about the Japanese surrender.\\" but others see the bombs as a minor factor, and yet others assess their importance as unknowable.\\"The Japanese leaders themselves do not know the answer to that question [whether Japan would have surrendered absent the atomic bombings], and if they cannot answer it, neither can I.\\" The mainstream position in the United States from 1945 to the 1960s regarded the bombings as the decisive factor in ending the war, which has been termed by commentators as the \\"traditionalist\\" view or pejoratively as the \\"patriotic orthodoxy.\\". Some, on the other hand, see the Soviet invasion of Manchuria as primary or decisive. ... In the US, Robert Pape and Tsuyoshi Hasegawa have particularly advanced this view, which some have found convincing, but others have criticized it.; . Robert Pape also argues: In Japanese writing about the surrender, many accounts consider the Soviet entry into the war as the primary reason or as having equal importance with the atomic bombs,Review of Racing the Enemy by Gar Alperovitz in H-Diplo Roundtable Volume VII, No. 2, 2006, p. 2, footnote 1, citing research by Ayako Doi and Kimi Yoshida (bottom of page 7). and others, such as the work of Sadao Asada, give primacy to the atomic bombings, particularly their impact on the emperor.Tsuyoshi Hasegawa vs. Sadao Asada: Debating Hiroshima, in the History News Network The primacy of the Soviet entry as a reason for surrender is a longstanding view by some Japanese historians, and it has appeared in some Japanese junior high school textbooks. The argument about the Soviet role in Japan's surrender has a connection with the argument about the Soviet role in America's decision to drop the bomb. Both arguments emphasize the importance of the Soviet Union. The former suggests that Japan surrendered to the US out of fear of the Soviet Union, and the latter emphasizes that the US dropped the bombs to intimidate the Soviet Union. Soviet accounts of the ending of the war emphasised the role of the Soviet Union. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia summarised events thus: > In August 1945 American military air forces dropped atomic bombs on the > cities of Hiroshima (6 August) and of Nagasaki (9 August). These bombings > were not caused by military necessity, and served primarily political aims. > They inflicted enormous damage on the peaceable population. Fulfilling the > obligations entered into by agreement with its allies and aiming for a very > speedy ending of the second world war, the Soviet government on 8 August > 1945 declared that from 9 August 1945 the USSR would be in a state of war > against [Japan], and associated itself with the 1945 Potsdam declaration... > of the governments of the USA, Great Britain and China of 26 July 1945, > which demanded the unconditional capitulation of [Japan] and foreshadowed > the bases of its subsequent demilitarization and democratization. The attack > by Soviet forces, smashing the Kwantung Army and liberating Manchuria, > Northern Korea, Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, led to the rapid > conclusion of the war in the Far East. On 2 September 1945 [Japan] signed > the act of unconditional capitulation. Japan had declared its surrender three days before the August 18 Soviet invasion of the Kuril Islands, which received comparatively little military opposition because of the earlier declaration to surrender. The Soviet Navy was regarded by certain people as chronically lacking the naval capability to invade the home islands of Japan, despite having received numerous ships under loan from the US. Still others have argued that war-weary Japan would likely have surrendered regardless because of a collapse of the economy; the lack of army, food, and industrial materials; threat of internal revolution; and the talk of surrender since earlier in the year. However, others find it unlikely and argue that Japan could likely have put up a spirited resistance. The Japanese historian Sadao Asada argues that the ultimate decision to surrender was a personal decision by the emperor, who was influenced by the atomic bombings. Atomic diplomacy A further argument, discussed under the rubric of \\"atomic diplomacy\\" and advanced in a 1965 book of that name by Gar Alperovitz, is that the bombings had as primary purpose to intimidate the Soviet Union and were the opening shots of the Cold War.. Alperovitz's thesis met with disagreement from across the spectrum, but subsequent research confirmed key parts of it. See . Along those lines, some argue that the United States raced the Soviet Union and hoped to drop the bombs and receive surrender from Japan before a Soviet entry into the Pacific War. However, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom came to an agreement at the Yalta Conference on when the Soviet Union should join the war against Japan and on how the territory of Japan was to be divided at the end of the war. Others argue that such considerations played little or no role, the United States being instead concerned with the surrender of Japan, and in fact, the United States desired and appreciated the Soviet entry into the Pacific War, as it hastened the surrender of Japan.. In his memoirs, Truman wrote: \\"There were many reasons for my going to Potsdam, but the most urgent, to my mind, was to get from Stalin a personal reaffirmation of Russia's entry into the war against Japan, a matter which our military chiefs were most anxious to clinch. This I was able to get from Stalin in the very first days of the conference.\\"Memoirs by Harry S. Truman, Volume One: Year of Decisions, p. 411 Campbell Craig and Fredrik Logevall argue the two bombs were dropped for different reasons:  US public opinion on the bombings  The Pew Research Center conducted a 2015 survey showing that 56% of Americans supported the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and 34% opposed. The study highlighted the impact of the respondents' generations, showing that support for the bombings was 70% among Americans 65 and older but only 47% for those between 18 and 29. Political leanings also impacted responses, according to the survey; support was measured at 74% for Republicans and 52% for Democrats. American approval of the bombings has decreased steadily since 1945, when a Gallup poll showed 85% support while only 10% disapproved. Forty- five years later, in 1990, Gallup conducted another poll and found 53% support and 41% opposition. Another Gallup poll in 2005 echoed the findings of the 2015 Pew Research Center study by finding 57% support with 38% opposition. While the poll data from the Pew Research Center and Gallup show a stark drop in support for the bombings over the last half-century, Stanford political scientists have conducted research supporting their hypothesis that American public support for the use of nuclear force would be just as high today as in 1945 if a similar yet contemporary scenario presented itself. In a 2017 study conducted by political scientists Scott D. Sagan and Benjamin A. Valentino, respondents were asked if they would support a conventional strike with use of atomic force in a hypothetical situation that kills 100,000 Iranian civilians versus an invasion that would kill 20,000 American soldiers. The results showed that 67% of Americans supported the use of the atomic bomb in such a situation. However, a 2010 Pew survey showed that 64% of Americans approved of Barack Obama’s declaration that the US would abstain from the use of nuclear weapons against nations that did not have them, showing that many Americans may have a somewhat conflicting view on the use of atomic force.

Title  The cathedral bears the title 'Menbere Tsebaot', or 'Pure Altar'. The church compound is the burial place for those who fought against the Italian Occupation, or those who accompanied the Emperor into exile from 1936 to 1941. The Emperor Haile Selassie and his consort the Empress Menen Asfaw are buried in the north transept of the cathedral. Other members of the Imperial Family are buried in the crypt below the church. The High Altar of the cathedral is dedicated to 'Agaiste Alem Kidist Selassie' (Sovereigns of the World the Holy Trinity). The other two altars in the Holy of Holies on either side of the High Altar are dedicated to St. John the Baptist and to 'Kidane Meheret' (Our Lady Covenant of Mercy). In the south transept of the cathedral is a recently added chapel of St. Michael, which houses the Tabot or Ark of St. Michael the Archangel, which was returned to Ethiopia in February 2002 after being discovered in Edinburgh.

In our part of the world if a man is rich he will marry more than once. My mother died because of my father's pressure in her to have a son. I was the second child. The doctors told my mother it would be dangerous to have a third but my mother told us she had to make my father Sheikh Ahmet Salman happy, to continue his line by having a son. The doctors said it would be fatal to get pregnant but she didn't listen. Only a boy would make Sheikh Ahmet Salman happy. So my mother got pregnant for a third time and bore another girl. Two years later my mother died. Ever since my childhood I have had it in my mind that not only a man can carry on the family of Sheikh Ahmet Salman, but a woman can too. That's why I was the first girl in my family to go to school. I went into politics and business. I knew that if I could make it i would be an inspiration to other women. By opening a brick factory in the area i showed that a woman could work in the dust and the mud. Now the number of women working in the area is increasing.

Its Latin masthead is Pro Vita, Pro Ecclesia Dei et Pro Hibernia 'for life, for the Church of God and for Ireland'. It is called after the Dutch Carmelite priest-journalist Blessed Titus Brandsma, who lived in Ireland for a period in the 1930s and was subsequently martyred by the Nazis. Overview The magazine was founded in the wake of the X Case and the resignation of Bishop Casey of Galway in 1992 and it has maintained a consistent pro-life position since then, regarding euthanasia and embryo experimentation as much as abortion. The legend 'Ecclesia Dei' is a reference to the 1988 document of Pope John Paul II, Ecclesia Dei Adflicta which deals with the Tridentine Mass, but this is not a unanimous position within the editorial board. Board members of the Latin Mass Society of Ireland have contributed pieces over the years. At the same time, the Review tries to cultivate a broad presentation of Catholic culture and has correspondents in North America, continental Europe and the Antipodes. It sometimes publishes articles by non-Catholics (generally Evangelical Protestants and eastern Orthodox, but sometimes Jews, Muslims and conservative secularists have contributed) on matters of common concern. The Brandsma Review has published many articles criticising the state of catechesis in Irish Catholic schools and the existence of unorthodox liturgical practices and doctrinal statements within sections of Irish Catholicism. It has also been critical of the tendency of some traditionalists to adopt extreme-right views. The March–April 2008 issue (vol. 17 no.2) p. 2 has an editorial \\"Beware of French Letter Liberals - And Jew Baiters!\\" which describes \\"our sniff test for articles submitted for publication. The left nostril is for pro-contraceptionists... the right nostril, for Jew baiters. Both are incompatible with real Catholicism, and so both are a no-no.\\" It has also published articles questioning the alleged Marian apparitions at Medugorje. The founder editor of The Brandsma Review is Nick Lowry, a retired news editor from Radio Telefís Éireann who contributes signed editorials and a regular column \\"Straws for the Camel's Back\\" commenting on current events within Irish Catholicism. Lowry retired in February 2012 and was replaced by Peadar Laighleis, who was also President of the Latin Mass Society of Ireland. The original model used was that of the Ballintrillick Review, which was in circulation in Ireland in the 1980s, until its editor Doris Manley died of cancer; the Ballintrillick Review was outspokenly pro-life but was somewhat more communitarian on economic matters and had no particular interest in the Tridentine Mass. Many of the original Brandsma Review subscribers had subscribed to the more strident Faith and Family which earned notoriety at the time by being banned from the Catholic book store Veritas.

It is the first part of the Blackwell series and follows Rosangela Blackwell, a young freelance writer living a solitary life in New York City. She experiences headaches throughout the day and it culminates in a ghost named Joey Mallone making an appearance in her apartment. It is revealed that Rosa is a medium like her aunt and that her job is to help ghosts that are stuck in the real world move on. Gameplay The Blackwell Legacy is a point-and-click adventure, where the player can interact with objects and characters of interest by clicking on them. A left click interacts with objects and people, and directs Rosa where to go, while right clicking allows examination of items. There is an inventory that houses all of your items, whatever oddities you collect during your adventure. Rosa carries along a notepad, where she writes down any important names or keywords. While trying to figure out connections between certain people or objects, two terms can be combined. That often gives the players a clue as to what to do next. The game is designed in the way that fully voice acted dialogue and characterization play a big part in the narrative. Plot Rosangela 'Rosa' Blackwell, an introverted book review columnist for the Village Eye newspaper, finds her way back home blocked by a teenager acting as doorman (given the original doorman is at a labor strike) after returning from scattering the ashes of her late aunt, Lauren Blackwell, at Queensboro Bridge. This forces Rosa to meet her elder next-door neighbor Nishanti Sharma, to ask her to confirm to the doorman Rosa actually lives in the building. Moments later, she's contacted by Dr. Quentin, from the Bellevue Hospital, whom arranges a meeting with her, informing of her aunt's previous mental disorder condition, as well as Rosa's grandmother Patricia, warning Rosa could have the same effects hereditarily. Rosa also reads the Blackwell family letters previously in hospital possession, depicting both women's gradual breakdowns and isolationist behaviors at the same time they interact with a non-existing person both call \\"Joey\\". Afterwards, she's assigned by the Village Eye to act as a reporter in the suicide of a New York University student, JoAnn Sherman, as all other reporters are covering the labor strike. Despite barely getting information on the suicide case, Rosa manages to write and send her news, but her ever- increasing headache, originally believed to be stress-induced, intensifies to the point she nearly passes out, until a ghostly figure of a business suit wearing man appears before her, making her pass out. Awakening and seeing the ghost again, Rosa attempts denying it, fearing for her sanity, but the ghost, whom Rosa identifies as \\"Joey\\", manages to convince her he is real, and she is not insane. The ghost presents himself as Joey Mallone, the Blackwell family's spirit guide, and explains that Rosa is a medium, meaning she can communicate with other ghosts, and thus must help them pass on to the afterlife by making them become self-aware and on terms with their deaths. When Rosa tries asking Joey to go away, he explains he's irremediably attached to her, and thus cannot go very far from her. Joey also explains the apparent rejection of both Patricia and Lauren in their medium roles, explaining their mental breakdown. Joey asks Rosa to take him to Washington Square Park, where Rosa first met Nishanti and also had her first headache, where they discover a ghost by the dog park, matching the exact appearance of one of JoAnn's friends, haunting the place. As Joey is unable to convince the ghost on her condition, Rosa starts an investigation on JoAnn and her friends, one whom also suicided herself and another whom is admitted in Bellevue. Rosa discovers JoAnn and her friends have attempted playing with an ouija board, accidentally summoning a restless ghost called the \\"Deacon\\", which led JoAnn and her friend, Alli Montego, to take their own lives. Rosa takes Nishanti's pet Boston Terrier Moti to the dog park to convince Alli's ghost, whom once aspired to be a veterinary, on her condition, allowing her to pass on. As a final request, Alli asks Rosa to keep an eye on the remaining girl involved, Susan Lee. Breaking into the Bellevue Hospital to watch over her, Rosa and Joey intercept the \\"Deacon\\", revealed to be the ghost of a priest whom fell from grace and into alcoholism after his wife passed away, and constantly harassed both JoAnn, Allie and Susan when he was released, begging to be saved from his condemnation in Hell. Joey and Rosa forcingly convince the Deacon to give in and allow himself to resign to his fate, until Rosa and the Deacon come face to face with a demon, blocking the way to the afterlife unless the Deacon accepts the punishment for his sins. Through hints the demon ends up giving, Rosa realizes the Deacon's flask is the source of all sins and thus destroys it, redeeming the Deacon's soul and finally granting him passage to eternal rest. With the case finally closed, Rosa and Joey return to rest, with Joey revealing to Rosa that Lauren rejected her role to take care of Rosa after her parents died in a car crash. Intended in honoring both her aunt and grandmother she barely knew, Rosa embraces her medium duty. Development The game runs under the Adventure Game Studio engine. Due to technical issues, it has remained a Windows-only title at the beginning, even though the runtime itself has been ported to Linux and Mac OS X already. Ian Schlaepfer was a designer of the characters art, while Chris Femo and Tom Scary did the backgrounds., which include some of the New York cityscapes, like the Bellevue Hospital, the Queensboro Bridge, and more. The project originally began as Bestowers of Eternity, and was released as free-to-play in 2003. Subsequently, it was decided for the project to be extended and redone into a proper commercial product, which ultimately became The Blackwell Legacy. Reception Upon its release, The Blackwell Legacy was met with \\"generally favourable\\" reviews from critics for the Microsoft Windows, with an aggregate score of 80% on Metacritic. It was nominated for 4 AGS Awards in 2006 and won the award for Best Character Art.

It is the sequel to The Blackwell Legacy, and the second entry in the Blackwell series. Plot The second game is a prequel to Legacy and follows the investigations of Rosa's aunt Lauren Blackwell and Joey back in the 70s. They investigate two ghosts – a murdered saxophone player and a murdered woman haunting a construction site of her old apartment building. While investigating the two seemingly unrelated incidents, Lauren discovers that both ghosts have been murdered by the same elderly, homeless woman that calls herself The Countess. She claims that she is a medium like Lauren and is also helping the people move on. But she is in fact mad and is killing them. The duo tries to catch her, but she escapes. Puzzled by The Countess' claims about being a medium, despite the obvious lack of a spirit guide following her, they discover that she is using New Yorker journalist Joseph Mitchell as a spirit guide substitute and kills whoever he writes about. Mitchell eventually made the connection himself, and stopped writing all together out of fear of getting anyone else killed. Lauren then convinces Mitchell to write about her to lure The Countess out of hiding. The plan works and she arrives at Lauren's place to kill her, where she is overpowered and Lauren is forced to kill her.

It is a method of degassing. According to Henry's law, the concentration of each gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas (in the gaseous state) in contact with the liquid. Sparging introduces a gas that has little or no partial pressure of the gas(es) to be removed, and increases the area of the gas-liquid interface, which encourages some of the dissolved gas(es) to diffuse into the sparging gas before the sparging gas escapes from the liquid. Many sparging processes, such as solvent removal, use air as the sparging gas. To remove oxygen, or for sensitive solutions or reactive molten metals, a chemically inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, or helium is used. Liquid chromatography Solvents used in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are often sparged with helium. Engineering In biochemical engineering, sparging can remove low-boiling liquids from a solution. The low-boiling components evaporate more rapidly, so the gas bubbles remove more of them from the bulk solution containing higher-boiling components. It is an alternative to distillation, and it does not require heat. Environmental chemistry In environmental chemistry, air sparging is an in situ remediation technique that removes volatile pollutants from contaminated groundwater and soil. Metallurgy In metallurgy, gas flushing removes dissolved gases from the molten metal prior to the material being processed. For example, before casting aluminium alloys, argon bubbles are injected into liquid aluminium using a rotary degasser. The argon bubbles rise to the surface, bringing with them some of the dissolved hydrogen. The degassing step reduces the occurrence of hydrogen gas porosity. In the steel making process, this method is used very commonly for duplex steel and some high reactivity metals.

According to the 2005 census (INE), the city has a population of 3898 inhabitants. Historic events in Gilena In 1931, Gilena had over four thousand inhabitants and almost all of them worked in the agriculture. The work conditions were very hard; therefore the life standards were very difficult. The workers did not earn much money; they were unemployed most of the days. The poverty and even the famine were present in most of the Gilena families. On 12 April 1931 the local elections were celebrated in Spain. It was the first time for nearly sixty years that a free election had been allowed in Spain. The republican parties and left-wing parties won the elections in the cities. The Alfonso XIII’s, monarchy and Primo de Rivera’s dictatorship –before- were both a failure. Spanish people wanted a change in the government which could sort out their problems. On 14 April the Second Spanish Republic was announced; most Spaniards thought that their life would improve. The historians have always said that the change was required in the cities; the rural areas did not have freedom to choose their representatives because the “caciques” (or local political bosses) controlled the whole system. For example, in Gilena there was not any election; the law of 1907 allowed that the election was not needed if the number the vacancies were equal to the number of candidates. But the news told us that in Gilena, before the election, the socialists already were well organized; however, the system did not allow them to take part in the aforementioned election. On the other hand, on 14 April all of them went out to the streets to demonstrate their support to the Republic. During the Republic, in Spain, there were a lot of parties, however in Gilena there were only two: PSOE, the left-wing party, and IR, the centre party. Actually, this party, IR, was led by a landowner, a farmer “cacique”. The workers could choose either of them, but if you chose the Socialist Party, you did not work. The two parties had union headquarters in the same street. This location caused many tensions. On 9 October a committee, composed by public authorities, went to Seville to ask the civil governor for help. The same day, the socialist workers summoned a general strike to push in the meeting. In the dawn, the pickets went out to the fields to verify that anybody was working. The most complicated situation was given in the farmhouse called “Marqués”, the most important finca in the whole area, only 3 kilometres away from Gilena; its lands are included between Gilena and Aguadulce. Some pickets tried to convince the workers that they gave up their works, but they did not stop and they began to insult each other. The pickets returned to the union headquarters to ask for help. Meanwhile, from the farmhouse Marqués, they called the Aguadulce civil guards. When a hundred of workers returned, they found the civil guards aimed their guns at them. They were registered and led back to Gilena, to the civil guard's barracks. In the search, they did not find firearms. On the contrary, sticks, stones and other objects were found. The civil guard corporal, who did not know Gilena, led the prisoners' row to the town centre, which was a mistake. Along the way, others civil guards, who were patrolling the streets, joined up to a total of 10. When they came to the village, many people were gathering. The tension was growing. When the prisoners' chains passed in front of the socialist headquarters, the shouts grew. Then, several workers surrounded the corporal, took his gun off and put it into their headquarters. At that moment, when the other civil guards saw the corporal fallen on the floor, they began to shoot. Everybody run and hid everywhere. Many people hid away in the union headquarters; inside, some of them climbed up the courtyards wall to the next houses. Some hours later, the reinforcements of civil guards came from Osuna and Estepa. The corporal Pablo Garcia Albano and five workers died, one of them in the hospital in Seville. Many people were injured, sixty were arrested and many people remained inside their houses. The politics and military authorities visited the village; the journalists wrote about the events in their newspapers. For most of the papers, the victim was the corporal. Years later, the judgment was celebrated. The murderer was not identified and only three workers were found guilty by insults to the authorities. The legend told that a worker stuck a needle in the corporal’s stomach, but the reality was that his head was shattered and the gun, stolen by the workers, was not ever shot.

Often, by deserting, a parent attempts to increase breeding opportunities by seeking out another mate. This form of mating strategy behavior is exhibited in insects, birds and mammals. Typically, males are more likely to desert, but both males and females have been observed to practice mate desertion. Evolutionary theory Conflict driving mate desertion Mate desertion involves the decision by an already-mated individual to either continue providing parental care or to desert. In making this decision, a parent must balance investment in terms of current and future reproductive success, choosing the optimal strategy, or one that provides the greatest net benefit towards lifetime reproductive success. Current success is measured by the number of surviving offspring, whereas future success is measured by the potential to successfully produce offspring in future seasons. These trade-offs between costs and benefits are further reflected in the two major conflicts driving mate desertion: 1) parent-offspring conflict over the level of parental investment that a parent should provide and 2) sexual conflict between mates over who should provide care and how much care should be provided. According to evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers, parental investment is defined as “any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success) at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring.” This investment includes investing in gametes and feeding and protecting young, which is also known as brooding. Often, the amount of parental investment necessary to maximize fitness differs between parent and offspring, thereby creating parent-offspring conflict. While increasing parental investment increases the current offspring's likelihood to survive and reproduce, this investment comes at the expense of the parent's ability to invest in future offspring. Therefore, when uniparental care is equally effective as biparental care, natural selection will favor mate desertion, allowing the deserter to either remate or conserve resources for future reproduction. However, the decision of which mate deserts first and when creates varying reproductive outcomes for both males and females, leading to sexual conflict over parental investment. This occurs because the deserted organism pays all costs of parental care while the deserter not only shares the benefits of the reproductive success of the current offspring, but also gains benefits from additional mating opportunities. Theoretically, both males and females would be expected to evolve adaptations in response to this sexual conflict, which would ultimately lead to sexually antagonistic coevolution between male and female traits. Elaborate nest of a penduline tit In penduline tits (Remiz pendulinus), uniparental care is dominant, and either sex is capable of desertion during the egg laying period. Typically, females care 50–70% of the time, males care 5–20% of the time, and both parents desert 30–40% of the time, condemning the offspring to death. In this system, males build elaborate nests and usually desert once these nests have been filled with the females' eggs. As a result, in response, females have adopted two counter-adaptive behaviors that function to deceive the male regarding the clutch's progress. Females conceal their eggs by burying them and aggressively attack males who approach the nest during the egg laying period. Studies have shown a high correlation between length of time a male stays before deserting and number of days a female keeps her eggs buried. This relationship suggests that egg burial has evolved as an adaptive female behavior that attempts to control information males use to decide whether or not they should desert. Response to desertion After one partner deserts, the remaining partner has three options. First, it may attempt to raise the young on its own. This usually occurs when the investment required by one parent to successfully raise the current offspring to maturity is less than that needed to produce new offspring. As a result, the remaining partner is forced into a situation Trivers' coined as “cruel bind.” Here, the deserter effectively forces its partner to stay, gaining the benefit of the deserted parent's continued investment at the cost of additional mating opportunities for the deserted parent. Second, if the cost of raising offspring alone is high and the cost of remating is low, the deserted individual may choose to desert the offspring as well and attempt to breed again. In some cases, the second deserter may even take part in filial cannibalism, reaping its lost investment by eating its own offspring as nourishment. For example, in scissortail sergeant fish (Abudefduf sexfasciatus), male parental care is dominant, and males undergo brood cycling in which they alternate between mating and parental phases. When broods are artificially reduced early in the breeding phase, male scissor-tail sergeants are more likely to cannibalise eggs and return to the mating phase, primarily because reduced broods indicate decreased current reproductive success. Lastly, a deserted individual may also attempt to trick another mate into helping provide care for its young, circumventing its cruel bind. For instance, a female who cuckolds a male, deceiving him into raising another male's offspring, benefits by reducing the amount of care she must provide and by conserving resources for future reproduction. In response, the evolution of counter-adaptations that allow males to guard against female deception would be expected, as it is evolutionarily maladaptive for an organism to invest in unrelated offspring. Patterns of mate desertion Explanations Two explanations have been proposed as evidence for why mate desertion by males is more commonly observed in nature. First, costs in lost mating opportunities are higher in males than in females. Because males have greater variance in reproductive success, their lifetime reproductive success depends more on number of mating opportunities, and thus they often benefit more from desertion. Second, mode of fertilization often influences degree of parental care, which in turn influences which sex will desert. Generally speaking, male parental care is predicted by external fertilization, and female parental care is predicted by internal fertilization. This pattern of parental care is best explained by the “Association Hypothesis,\\" which argues that association with embryos predisposes a sex for parental care. For example, in species where mate desertion by males is prominent, females reproduce through internal fertilization and are thus responsible for carrying the eggs. While this intimate connection allows the female to offer better care for her offspring, the male's comparative separation makes him much less likely to be able to adequately care for his young. Furthermore, inherent to internal fertilization is the fact that it is impossible for females to desert because they are the sex bearing offspring. Under this theory, females are often not in a position to leave their young, while males can leave and have much less to offer by sticking around. Conversely, in organisms that practice external fertilization—including certain species of fish—males are often the primary caretakers for young. Factors influencing mate desertion Natural selection tends to favor desertion when costs are low and benefits are high. Benefits include increased mating opportunities in the same breeding season and reduced energetic costs associated with parental care, whereas costs include decreased mating opportunities and reduced future reproductive success. Both the timing and probability of mate desertion have been shown to be influenced by a variety of factors. For instance, desertion by either sex is favored when remating opportunities are high, food for young is abundant, predation is low, current offspring are older, require little parental investment and are smaller than average size, and the deserter's contribution to parental care is low. Another factor that has been shown to influence probability of mate desertion is a biased operational sex ratio, which is defined as the ratio of sexually active males to sexually active females. In convict cichlid fish, males are more likely to desert when there is a female- biased sex ratio, as males have a higher chance of remating and increasing reproductive success. Furthermore, probability of male desertion in this particular species is also increased where there is low predation (high predation leads to biparental care for offspring survival), mature offspring, and smaller than average offspring size. In another population of cichlids (Aequidens coeruleopunctatus), brood reduction leading to earlier male mate desertion has also been observed, and here, by deserting, not only does the male save energy, but he also increases his chance of breeding and thus his reproductive success as well. Cooper's hawk Similarly, in Cooper's hawks, female desertion of offspring has been found to be closely related to both the likelihood of offspring survival and future reproductive success. Females in weak physical condition are more likely to abandon offspring to complete migration, increasing breeding chances and opportunities for the following year. In Whiskered terns, the majority of deserters are female and is related to provisioning rate: females providing more food were less likely to desert. In mammals, aardwolves have been shown to practice male mate desertion in response to female promiscuity. Lastly, ambisexual mate desertion, in which both sexes desert at nearly equal frequencies, has been observed in snail kites. Mate desertion by either sex depends on food supply, in that snail kites are more likely to desert when snails are abundant and rate of nesting success is high. Thus, mating strategies exhibited by snail kites are somewhat plastic, depending on varying environmental conditions. Game theory Lazarus's model of mate desertion Case 1. Because V2 > V1+(M or F), neither parent gains any reproductive advantage by deserting their mate. For both parents, reproductive fitness equals V2. V represents reproductive success (see text for more details). Case 2. At t1, the male benefits from deserting the brood because V1+M > V2. At this point, the female's fitness equals V1. At t2, the female benefits from deserting the brood because V0+F > V1. At this point, the male's fitness equals V0+M, and the female's fitness equals V0+F. V represents reproductive success (see text for more details). Case 3. At t1, the male benefits from deserting the brood because V1+M > V2. At this point, the female's fitness equals V1. After this, the female cannot improve her fitness past V1 by deserting, so she chooses to stay and provide care. V represents reproductive success (see text for more details). Game theory helps explain when parents are more or less likely to desert their offspring by taking into account the costs and benefits associated with these decisions. John Lazarus developed a well-known game theory model for mate desertion, in which different outcomes are predicted using a payoff matrix. In this particular model, the benefits of desertion depend both on the ability of the deserter to gain additional mating opportunities and on the deserted partner's strategy. Lazarus's model of mate desertion defines conditions that lead to three possible cases: 1) both parents stay, 2) both parents desert, or 3) one parent stays and one parent deserts. If both parents stay with the offspring, then neither gains the benefits from deserting their mate. If both parents desert, each individual will do so at a time offering them maximal benefit based on when the other parent leaves. If only one parent deserts, then the deserter will leave at a time when benefits are high and costs are low. Variables are used to describe the different fitness levels achieved by each parent. * V0: reproductive success obtained when no parents care for the young. * V1: reproductive success obtained when only one parent cares for the young (for the purpose of simplicity, model assumes that V1 is the same for both male-only and female-only care) * V2: reproductive success obtained when both parents care for the young * M: male's benefit from deserting * F: female's benefit from deserting In case one, both parents choose to stay. For either the male or the female, the total payoff for the deserter (V1+M or V1+F) is less than the reproductive success obtained when both parents provide care (V2). Therefore, neither benefits from deserting. Case two arises when both parents desert. Normally, the payoff for desertion is higher for one sex than the other. This model assumes that males benefit more from desertion than do females (M>F), though this is not the case for all species. When the payoff a male receives by deserting (V1+M) exceeds the reproductive success of providing care (V2) for the young, he should desert. At this point, the male's reproductive success is V1+M, and the female's reproductive success is V1. Eventually the payoff for a female deserting (V0+F) will exceed the benefits of caring alone (V1). At this point, she is also expected to desert, leaving the brood with no parental care. Lastly, case three occurs when one parent deserts, and the other stays. In this model, because of the assumption that M>F, the male will desert first when the payoff of deserting (V1+M) is greater than the benefits of investing in offspring (V2). At this point, the male's reproductive success is V1 \\\\+ M, and the female's reproductive success is V1. However, in contrast to case two, the female will never benefit by deserting because the payoff (V0+F) never exceeds the benefits obtained by caring alone (V1). Consequently, in situations where the female's benefits of deserting are low, she will remain to raise her brood, maximizing her reproductive success.

Local caves were used as tombs during the Copper Age, and later on people from the Tartessos and Iberian cultures settled in the region.  Roman era  The area was eventually conquered and colonized by Romans. It has been speculated that Lora de Estepa might have been the Roman town of \\"Lauro\\" that is mentioned by Florus in his Epitome of Roman history, Book 2. If this identification is correct, Lora de Estepa was the site of an important battle of Caesar's Civil War in 45 BC, during which Caesarian forces cornered and killed Gnaeus Pompeius the Younger, son of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. Equating Lauro with Lora de Estepa is, however, still speculative and strongly disputed among historians. In any case, the Roman town at Lora de Estepa was known as \\"Olaurum\\" by the 1st century, and served as regional hub for communication and trade. In course of the late antiquity (4th-7th century) Olaurum was largely abandoned, as its population was ruralized and moved to numerous minor hamlets at the nearby villae.  Medieval history  After the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, the local settlement came to be known as \\"Al-auriat\\". Little is known of the town's history under Muslim rule, though the whole region was only sparsely inhabited during this time. The town was conquered by the Christians in 1250 and given to the Order of Santiago, but remained a contested war zone until the Christian conquest of Antequera in 1410. Afterwards, the region's population increased again, and by the 16th century the local town was known as \\"Lorilla\\" or \\"Lora Menor\\".

It is also a contributing property to the Hudson River Historic District, itself a National Historic Landmark. It is a Federal-style house, with expansion designed by architect Alexander Jackson Davis. It reflects the tastes of a younger, post- Revolutionary generation of wealthy landowners in the Livingston family who were beginning to be influenced by French trends in home design, moving beyond the strictly English models exemplified by Clermont Manor a short distance up the Hudson River. It is the only Hudson Valley estate house from this era that survives intact, and Davis's only surviving neoclassical country house. Andrew Jackson Downing praised the landscapes of the estate, work he had informally consulted on that was not completed in its final form until almost the mid-20th century. The southern of the estate, which he called the Wilderness and is today known as the South Woods, is the oldest oak forest in the Hudson Valley. It has grown to , and includes many outbuildings. A network of trails and paths connects them and offers both quiet wooded tracts and views of the river and Catskill Mountains. The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Ten years later, the Livingston descendants sold it to Historic Hudson Valley, a regional historic preservation group. The district was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990, and Montgomery Place received that designation itself in 1992. In January 2016, Bard College purchased the estate from Historic Hudson Valley. Montgomery Place is located on Annandale Road near Barrytown, just off NY 9G. Montgomery Place grounds are open from dawn to dusk year-round. Mansion tours are available seasonally. Property The estate is bounded on the east by Annandale Road, on the north by the Saw Kill and the west by the river. A tree-lined driveway from the road leads west to a visitor center and parking lot next to an orchard. From there it is short walk through a grove of trees to an open lawn in front of the main house, atop a bluff overlooking the river and the Catskill Escarpment across it in the distance. Five of the 22 buildings, structures and sites identified on the estate have been listed as contributing resources to its historic character. These are the main house, three other Davis-designed buildings and the surviving landscaping. Main house The house itself is a two-and- half-story five-by-four-bay building sided in stucco over rubble stone, with two frame wings on the north and south. The latter was originally sanded to give it a stonier appearance. A veranda is on the west (rear) elevation. The metallic hipped roof is pierced by two pairs of brick chimneys on the sides. All facades are heavily decorated. Swags are on all four chimneys, and balustrades rim most of the roof lines. A central pier on the east above the main entrance is topped with an urn, flanked by wreathed balustrades, a cornice and frieze with triglyphs and metope-ornamented medallions. The double-doored main entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped with a fanlight and ornate keystone. It is sheltered by a semicircular portico supported by fluted Corinthian columns. A similar portico adorns the rear, with its balustrade also topped by urns. On the wings flat pilasters support a frieze, with columns on the semi octagonal south wing creating an arcade. The main entrance leads into a rectangular hall with doors leading to the two parlors on either side. It is partly divided by a segmental arch supported by two tapered wooden columns. The library is to the north, with a stair hallway on the south. Much of the decorative woodwork is original. The Coach House Outbuildings Five outbuildings, most of them built around a garden, are in the nearest cluster, south and southwest of the main house. These include the shingle-sided Lodge and its board-and-batten shed, the clapboard-sided Court, a wrought iron greenhouse, and the coach house. This last building is the only outbuilding visible from the main house. It is a flushboard-sided one-and-a-half-story frame house with cross-gabled roof topped by a polygonal cupola. Pilasters mark the corners as well as the flanks of the main building. The interior contains much of the original woodwork. To the east, close to the road, is the barn complex. It consists of an 1861 barn along with frame structures like the farm office and storage sheds, along with an octagonal stone reservoir building. The board-and-batten farmhouse features a cross- gabled roof and a triple Palladian-style window on the rear. A group of cottages is located just downhill from the farmhouse. Most are simple frame structures, but one, the Swiss Cottage, was designed by Davis. It features a low-sloping truncated-gabled roof with vergeboard on the roofline and balconies on the rear. The Thompson House also has a dentilled and bracketed cornice. There are some other isolated outbuildings elsewhere, mostly modern, such as the visitors' center. A cement power station is at the creek mouth, with dams. Some small 20th century cottages are scattered in the orchards. Some buildings described by past visitors to the estate, such as the conservatory, are no longer extant. Landscapes The Lower Falls, Montgomery Place The north and south sections of the property, known as the North and South Woods, remain heavily wooded. The South Woods, approximately in size, is the oldest oak forest in the Hudson Valley. The North Woods slopes down to the ravine the Saw Kill flows through. Winding paths and trails lead through both wooded tracts. In the North Woods they lead to a waterfall; in the South Woods to the river's edge. On the east are the property's orchards, leased and operated by Montgomery Place Orchards. On the farm, over 60 different varieties of apple and pear trees are planted and harvested as well as berries, vegetables, grapes and peaches. Annandale Atomic hard cider is also now produced on the farm from early American and English varietal apples. The produce is sold at the Montgomery Place Orchards market. Black locust trees line the unpaved allée and surround the lawn of the main house. The lawn on the west of the house slopes down to a reflecting pond at the edge of the wooded shore. History Archaeological investigations on the property have revealed evidence of Native American use as a seasonal hunting ground at least 5,000 years ago. These investigations have continued and the area's historic designation reflects its potential in this area as well.Historic Hudson Valley brochure available at visitor's center. Orchards planted by Janet Livingston Montgomery After European settlement in the 18th century, the Saw Kill was used for various mills. Janet Livingston Montgomery purchased from Abraham Van Benthuysen in the late 1770s, shortly after the death of her husband, General Richard Montgomery, at the Battle of Quebec. The couple had been living in nearby Rhinebeck at the time, where they were building their Grasmere estate, and she moved into that after the Revolutionary War. She had plans for a Federal style mansion on the riverfront property drawn up and hired a local builder. Naming the house Chateau de Montgomery after her late husband, she moved in after it was completed in 1805. With tree samples her friends sent her from many places near and distant, she established a working farm on the property, employing many slaves and freemen. She lived there until her death in 1828, when the property was bequeathed to her brother. Edward Livingston had summered there with his wife Louise while he was living in Louisiana, where he had moved after a scandal cost him his jobs as U.S. Attorney for New York and mayor of the city. He had returned to New York and was serving in the House when his sister died. Subsequently, he was chosen a Senator and later became the 11th Secretary of State, then as ambassador to France before leaving public service in 1835. They renamed the estate Montgomery Place. HABS photo of Montgomery Place north profile, showing arcaded pavilion added by Davis in 1840s He died the next year, leaving the house to his wife Louise. In 1844 she hired Alexander Jackson Davis to convert the stately mansion into a more ornate villa, in keeping with the era's emerging Romantic sensibilities. The two wings and exterior decoration were added at this time. A colonnade on the front entry, the only ornament on the original house, was moved to the interior, one of the only changes to Janet Livingston's original plan. With the informal help of Andrew Jackson Downing, a friend of Louise's and mentor to Davis, she began developing the landscapes. Her daughter Cora Barton worked with the architect on designing a garden and conservatory. Davis also drew up plans for outbuildings on the estate. In 1860, upon Louise's death, Cora and her husband hired Davis again to actually build some of the earlier outbuildings. These were the Coach House, Swiss Cottage and farmhouse. They also extended the landscaping. These were part of their overall intent to make the house and its \\"pleasure grounds\\" more separate and distinct from the farming operations, which they also began to reduce in scope. From Cora's relatives it eventually passed to another Livingston descendant, John Ross Delafield, in 1921. He added modern heating and plumbing to the main house. He and his wife, Violetta White Delafield, made the last major additions to the property by extending the landscaping and adding small gardens to it in the years before World War II. Historic Hudson Valley visitors' center After his death in 1964, his son John White Delafield and his wife moved in. They established two corporations to own and operate the property. In 1975 it was listed on the Register. Eleven years later it was sold for $3 million to Sleepy Hollow Restorations, which later renamed itself Historic Hudson Valley. After a five-year and $3 million restoration, the house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992. Bard College purchased the property in 2016. Aesthetics Janet Livingston's original home reflected the tastes of its era. She and her family derived most of their wealth and prestige from agriculture, leasing lands to tenant farmers. Accordingly, their own homes often sat on high ground where they could view their holdings, which in the Livingston family's case included, at that time, portions of the Catskills across the river. The rectilinear forms of the Federal and Greek Revival styles established their authority and dominance of the land. In the second quarter of the 19th century this began to change. Andrew Jackson Downing of nearby Newburgh championed villa and cottage-style houses in the styles that later came to be known as Carpenter Gothic and Picturesque. These were smaller structures, generally frame, that were topped by steeply pitched, often cross- gabled, roofs with decorated cornices that were intended to harmonize with surrounding natural features, giving the impression of a comfortable place to live. His pattern books sold widely and were used for many houses all over the growing nation. Janet's descendants called on Downing's friend Alexander Jackson Davis to expand and renovate the house into a more classically inspired villa over a period of 20 years. He used curved forms in the balustrades and wings to offset the strong vertical lines of the existing building. The arcaded pavilion makes the veranda common on many mid-19th century houses into a wing of its own. Textures were added to the surface in the abundant decorations, many using floral motifs. All these features link the house more firmly to its surrounding landscape. Davis scholar Jane Davies calls it his finest country house. The farmhouse, too, shows Davis's variations on a popular Downing pattern, \\"Bracketed Cottage with Veranda\\", from the posthumously published The Architecture of Country Houses. Davis updated it to the Italianate style more popular at that time, adding the Palladian-style window. Downing's influence can also be seen in Davis's Swiss Cottage. This pattern, widely republished but rarely built, was varied by Davis, who is not known to have built any other such cottages. He added more entrances since it was expected to have multiple tenants, but four of them are disguised as windows. The essential features of Downing's pattern, such as its floor plan, the low, broad roof; construction into a hillside exposing the basement on one side and multiple galleries and balconies offering views of a nearby stream, remain. The landscapes were inspired by contemporary European trends. The Bartons had followed Edward Livingston to France when he served there and saw many of Europe's celebrated gardens. Cora Barton had a full set of copies of Joseph Paxton's The Magazine of Botany sent to her when she moved in. Downing, a friend, visited in 1847 and wrote favorably about the resulting landscapes for his own magazine, The Horticulturist. He praised \\"the deep and mysterious wood\\" with \\"dark, intricate and mazy walks\\" in the \\"Wilderness\\" in the north of the property near the Saw Kill. He called it \\"the most complete estate in America\\".

The stadium is just west of Gene Hooks Field at Wake Forest Baseball Park, home of the Wake Forest baseball team. It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Wake Forest University Demon Deacons. The stadium opened in 1968 and holds 31,500 people. It is the smallest football stadium, by capacity, in both the ACC and in all Power 5 conferences. Previously known as Groves Stadium, in September 2007, Wake Forest University and BB&T;, which was headquartered in Winston-Salem, announced a 10-year deal to officially rename the stadium BB&T; Field starting with the first 2007 home game against Nebraska. The deal was part of a larger development process to secure funds for stadium renovations and upgrades. On July 8, 2020, the name of the stadium was changed to Truist Field at Wake Forest following a merger between BB&T; and SunTrust. History The former stadium name of Groves Field goes back to the original stadium at the original location of Wake Forest (Wake Forest, North Carolina). The old stadium was financed by Henry Groves, and when the school announced the move to Winston-Salem, he and his brother, Earl, decided to make a further contribution to the school to keep their name on any new stadium. After moving to Winston-Salem, many games were played in Bowman Gray Stadium while the project to build a new stadium met with many setbacks. It was not until 1966 that the final fundraising was done, and the stadium opened in September 1968, with the Deacons losing to old rival NC State. The former Groves Stadium became the home football field for Wake Forest High School and is today known as Trentini Stadium. The stadium is part of a larger complex east of the main campus at the corner of Deacon Boulevard and University Parkway, which includes Gene Hooks Field at Wake Forest Baseball Park and Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The current stadium consists of two bowed grandstands on either side of the field. The southeast end zone is known as \\"Deacon Hill,\\" and is used for berm seating during games. The Bridger Field House, originally built in 1968 with the stadium, was demolished in early 1996 and rebuilt during the 1996 football season. It opened midway through the 1997 football season. The structure is located behind the northwest end zone. Virginia Tech at Groves Stadium in 2006 Renovations In 2006, the Wake Forest Athletics Department announced plans to further the renovations on Truist Field (then Groves Stadium) with the construction of Deacon Tower which will house a new press box. Deacon Tower opened prior to the 2008 season. The press box is the centerpiece of the third of six levels of renovations set to take place at Truist Field. The old press box, built in 1968, was successfully imploded & demolished on the morning of January 14, 2007 as numerous Demon Deacon fans watched on. Previous renovations included the bricking of the facade of the grandstand in 2005 and the implementation of FieldTurf in 2006. In 2011, a new scoreboard was added, replacing the spot of the previous, smaller scoreboard at the top of Deacon Hill.

Garzón had previously banned the two other Basque youth organizations that preceded Segi: Jarrai and Haika.(Spanish) El Mundo(Spanish) ABC Spanish and other European courts have banned a number of ETA-related organizations such as newspapers – Egin (1998), Egunkaria (2003); youth organisations – Jarrai (1999), Haika (2001), Segi (2002); prisoner associations – Askatasuna (2002) and Gestoras Pro-Amnistia (2003) and political parties such as Herri Batasuna (1997) and its successor Batasuna (2003).Open DemocracyThe New York TimesSustatu All those decisions have been based on the proved direct coordination of such organisations with ETA (i.e. the organisations have been declared \\"members of a terrorist group\\" and of \\"cooperation with terrorist groups\\" by helping in the recruitment of new members and supporting ETA's finances). According to An Phoblacht the case descended into a farce when another judge in the Spanish National Court considered that Garzón’s arguments \\"were not valid\\" and released all the detainees.An Phoblacht However another report suggests that the Supreme Court ruled they were a terrorist organization, but had not been placed on the country's terrorist list before the court's January 19 ruling.The Independent Support from abroad Ógra Shinn Féin (the youth wing of political party Sinn Féin), which maintains fraternal relations with Segi,Youth Parties Guide , has called for the \\"immediate release of our comrades in Euskal Herria\\". It has begun an online petition to demand the reversal of the decision to declare Segi to be an illegal and terrorist organization. The petition claims that the Spanish Government has \\"decided to brand a completely legitimate political group as terrorists in an attempt to subvert the ever present Basque national liberation struggle\\". It is also campaigning for the release of the National Executive of Segi, who were arrested on a protest and were sentenced to 6 years imprisonment. Ógra Shinn Féin has passed a motion in support of Segi at a recent congress, declaring their support.

This can include people of non-Hispanic European, African American, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander or Hispanic (of any race) backgrounds. Americans are a significant demographic group in Mexico. Over 75% of immigrants to Mexico are estimated to come from the United States, and Mexico hosts the largest number of US emigrants. Many members of the American Mexican community have dual nationality, and among them are entrepreneurs, businessmen, sports professionals, entertainers, artists, religious ministers, academics, and students. The largest community of Americans outside their country lives in Jalisco and hovers around 30,000 citizens. They live mainly in Chapala, Ajijic, Barra de Navidad, Zapopan, Guadalajara, Tequila, and Puerto Vallarta. History American settlers The first settlers in Mexico from the United States were traders, including settlements in the northern territories of Alta California, Santa Fe de Nuevo México and Mexican Texas. The first empresarial grant in Texas had been made under Spanish control to Stephen F. Austin, whose settlers, known as the Old Three Hundred, settled along the Brazos River in 1822. The grant was later ratified by the Mexican government. Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority from the United States. In 1824, Mexico enacted the General Colonization Law, which enabled all heads of household, regardless of race or immigrant status, to claim land in Mexico. Due to a large number of unassimilated American settlers and imported slaves, President Anastasio Bustamante outlawed further immigration of United States citizens to Texas through the Law of April 6, 1830, nonetheless immigration continued illegally. Mexico once recognized citizens born in the territory lost in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo to protect their property, farms, and ranches. However, they had to adopt a new nationality and very few descendants had ever decided to regain their Mexican nationality. American exiles The Seminole leader John Horse, aka Juan Caballo Facing the threat of enslavement, in 1850 the Black Seminole leader John Horse and about 180 Black Seminoles staged a mass escape to northern Mexico, where slavery had been abolished more than twenty years earlier. There is a band of the Kickapoo tribe present in northern Mexico as result of 19th- century migration. There is also a Cherokee Nation of Mexico that claims to be the descendants of 19th-century Cherokee migrants. However, they are not officially recognized by the Federal government. A few of the routes of the Underground Railroad led to Mexico. An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 slaves escaped to Mexico. In 1865 a substantial number of former Confederates fled to Mexico from the defeated Confederate States of America.Todd W. Wahlstrom, The Southern Exodus to Mexico: Migration Across the Borderlands After the American Civil War (U of Nebraska Press, 2015).Rachel St. John, \\"The Unpredictable America of William Gwin: Expansion, Secession, and the Unstable Borders of Nineteenth-Century North America.\\" The Journal of the Civil War Era 6.1 (2016): 56-84. onlineGeorge D.

However, many of the ex-Confederates left the country once Emperor Maximilian I was overthrown. One known Mexican of U.S. ancestry is former president Vicente Fox, whose great-grandfather, reportedly of German American ancestry, left Cincinnati for Mexico in the 1860s after the U.S. Civil War. Businessmen During the Porfiriato, foreign businessmen were welcomed into the country in order to help with Mexico's modernization through enterprises such as railroad construction and mineral exploitation. American capitalists included the likes of Edward L. Doheny and William Cornell Greene. Also notable among these early entrepreneurs were the Californian immigrants Walter and Frank Sanborn, who opened Mexico's first soda fountain. Their business would go on to become the Grupo Sanborns. Founded in 1888, the American School Foundation in Mexico City was created to cater to American immigrants. Artists and leftists For decades, Mexico has also drawn numerous artists, including Pablo O'Higgins, William Spratling and Waldeen Falkenstein. During the Cold War, Mexico was a country of refuge for political leftists, and received various American exiles, especially from the film industry. Notable among these individuals was Elizabeth Catlett, prominent African-American artist who was declared an \\"undesirable alien\\" by the U.S. government as a result of suspected Communist affiliations. Recent immigrants Recent migrants can be categorized into three broad categories: retired expatriates (which tend to congregate in American colonies like Ajijic or San Miguel de Allende), professionals working in Mexico (tending to reside in large cities like Monterrey or Mexico City) and the American children of Mexican nationals (which can be found throughout the country). Most commonly, these American-born minors follow their parents once they are deported to Mexico. Nonetheless, it is also common for adult children to return to their parents home country of their own will. From 2014 to 2016, 23,613 Americans received permanent residency, with a total of 72,140 Americans receiving temporary or permanent residency permits. About 600,000 US-born children live in Mexico. According to 2015 data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), more than 280,000 children born in the US and now living in Mexico, do not have sufficient documentation to prove their Mexican identity. Culture The Borregos Salvajes of Monterrey Tech celebrate their championship in the 2012 season. Mexico is one of the few countries outside the U.S. where American football is perennially popular. American Mexicans retain customs such as Thanksgiving Day and the Independence Day of the United States celebrated on July 4.Retiring Americans, Go south, old man by The Economist American football arrived to Mexico in 1927, by direct influence of the United States. It started to be played in Mexico City among young students from universities, and sport clubs showing a great interest for this foreign sport of considerable popularity among American students. Throughout the years, the sport became popular at an amateur level among universities of Mexico. The sport has remained popular as a result of easier access to televised MLB and NFL games and the desire of American Mexicans to partake in American pastimes. Recent migrants, especially those in the retired community, remain closely attached to and promote the values of the U.S. through organizations such as Democrats and Republicans Abroad, the American Legion, and the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution. Also common among this group is the lobbying of local governments on a range of issues such as development, security, sanitation and historical preservation. This may be problematic if they are not naturalized citizens, since the Mexican Constitution prohibits the involvement of foreigners in the country's politics. Language Most Mexicans of American descent speak American English and Mexican Spanish, either of which can be that person's first language. However, not all in the community are proficient in both languages. Among migrants it is not uncommon to find people lacking proficiency in Spanish even after years of living in the country. This can be attributed to the relative isolation of American enclaves and the willingness of Mexicans whom they interact with to adjust to English requirements. Religion Most Mexicans of American descent are Christians, either Catholic, Protestant or Mormon (including both Latter-day Saints and various breakaway sects). The Mormon meeting house in the Colonia Díaz. According to the 2010 census, 314,932 individuals reported belonging to the Latter-day Saints Church. However the majority of Latter-day Saints in Mexico are ethnic Mexicans. Many Mexican Mormons of American descent reside in the Mormon colonies in Mexico, where some American Mormons settled in the late 19th century. Some of these American Mexicans or their descendants have returned to the United States since, including church leader Marion G. Romney, politician George W. Romney, and chemist Henry Eyring. More recent prominent Mexican Mormons of American descent include Carl B. Pratt, the current president of the LDS Church's Missionary Training Center in Mexico City and a former General Authority of the church. The current president of the LDS Church's Mexico Area, Daniel L.

According to Mexico 2010 Census, there are 738,103 Americans living in the Mexican Republic, while the US Embassy in Mexico City has at times given an estimate closer to 1 million (the disparity is due to non-permanent residents, notably the \\"snowbirds\\"). Mostly, people who come from the USA are students, retirees, religious workers (missionaries, pastors, etc.), Mexican- Americans, and spouses of Mexican citizens. A few are professors who come employed by Mexican companies to teach English, other English teachers, and corporate employees and executives. While significant numbers live in Mexico year round, it is probable that a majority of these residents do not stay the whole year. Retirees may live half a year in the U.S. to keep retiree benefits. Those called \\"snowbirds\\" come in fall and leave in spring. The American community in Mexico is found throughout the country, but there are significant concentrations of U.S. citizens in all the north of Mexico, especially in Tijuana, Mexicali, Los Cabos, San Carlos, Mazatlán, Saltillo, Monterrey, Ciudad Juárez, Matamoros, Reynosa, Ensenada and Nuevo Laredo. Also in the central parts of the country such as San Miguel de Allende, Ajijic, Chapala, Mexico City, Guadalajara and Cuernavaca, and along the Pacific coast, most especially in the greater Puerto Vallarta area. In the past few years, a growing American community has developed in Mérida, Yucatán. Alaska has a presence as students and entrepreneurs. Without forgetting the annual presence that they have in tourism, when in seasons of the year, Alaska is hit by cold fronts and icy seasons, for this reason thousands of Alaskans take refuge in Mexican territory from 1 to 3 months of stay only, some as tourists and others as residents. The Arizonians have approximately 20,500 members based in Sonora, Baja California, Chihuahua, Mexico City, Jalisco, Coahuila, Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Nuevo León, Zacatecas, Coahuila, Guanajuato, Michoacán, State of Mexico, among others. This community arrived in Mexico in the middle of the 20th century and today they are the largest community of Americans living in Mexican territory without taking into account the link that has existed since colonial periods. Californians have approximately 110,500 members based in Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, Mexico City, Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Chihuahua, State of Mexico, Nuevo León, Zacatecas, Coahuila, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Puebla, Querétaro, Nayarit, Yucatán, Guerrero, Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Chiapas among others. This community arrived in Mexico in the mid-20th century and today they are the largest community of Americans living in Mexican territory without taking into account the link that has existed since colonial periods. The New Mexicans have approximately 50,000 members based in Chihuahua, Sonora, Coahuila, San Luis Potosí, Zacatecas, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, State of Mexico, Mexico City, among others. This community arrived in Mexico at the beginning of the 20th century and today they are one of the most outstanding communities of Americans living in Mexican territory without taking into account the link that has existed since historical periods. There is a New Yorker presence as students and entrepreneurs. Without forgetting the annual presence that they have in tourism, when in seasons of the year, New York is hit by cold fronts and icy seasons, therefore thousands of New Yorkers take refuge in Mexican territory from 1 to 3 months of stay only, as tourists and residents. Texans have approximately 88,000 members in Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Mexico City, Jalisco, State of Mexico, San Luis Potosí, Zacatecas, Coahuila, Guanajuato, Michoacán, among others. This community came to Mexico at the beginning of the 20th century and today it is one of the largest communities of Americans living in Mexican territory without taking into account the link that has existed since historical periods.

After temporary closure in 2013, it was bought by photographer Tomasz Niewiadomski and subsequently relaunched in December 2016 as a quarterly magazine. Przekrój's matchless literary style and lively visual charm were created due to the collaboration with the avant-garde of Polish intellectuals, writers, poets, artists and cartoonists. Przekrój was the birthplace of writers such as Wisława Szymborska, Stanisław Lem and Czesław Miłosz. History Przekrój was created by the writer and graphic artist Marian Eile-Kwaśniewski (1910–1984) from Warsaw who, until 1969, was also the first and only editor-in-chief of the magazine. The magazine focused on current social, political and cultural events, both Polish and international. In the 1970s Przekrój reached a record circulation, with 700,000 copies per issue, by far the most popular magazine in the country. As of 2011, it had a modest circulation of 73,000 copies. The list of editors in chief in chronological order includes Marian Eile (1945–1969), Mieczysław Kieta (1969–1973), Mieczysław Czuma (1973–2000), Maciej Piotr Prus (2000–2001), Józef Lubiński (2001), Jacek Rakowiecki (2001–2002), Roman Kurkiewicz (2002), Piotr Najsztub (2002–2006), Mariusz Ziomecki (2006–2007), Jacek Kowalczyk (2007–2010), Katarzyna Janowska (2010–2011), Artur Rumianek (2011), Donat Szyller (2011), Roman Kurkiewicz (2012), Zuzanna Ziomecka, Marcin Prokop (2012-2013) and Tomasz Niewiadomski (from 2016). Following its closure in 2013, Przekrój was out of print until December 2016, when it was relaunched as a quarterly, with an editorial style deeply inspired by the early editions of the magazine from the 1950s and 1960s. Among the former contributors to Przekrój were such figures of the Polish literary and art scene as Maria Dąbrowska, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, Jan Brzechwa, Bohdan Butenko, Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński, Kazimierz Wyka, Daniel Mróz, Jerzy Waldorff, Sławomir Mrożek, Ludwik Jerzy Kern and Jan Błoński.

The shrine houses a stone statue of Kume no Heinai, a samurai from the early Edo period (17th century). According to the Asakusa tourism bureau, there are few facts about the life of Kume no Heinai, but he is said to have died in 1683. Oral tradition holds that Heinai excelled in Kenjutsu, the martial art of swordsmanship, killing many people over the years. In the latter half of his life, he is said to have lived in the Sensō-ji temple in Asakusa where he devoted himself to Zen-Buddhism and held religious services in honor of the people he killed. Shortly before his death he ordered his followers to carve his likeness on a stone and bury it near the Niōmon – the entrance to the Buddhist temple and a busy district in the city. His wish was to have his statue be stepped on by as many people as possible in order to expiate the crimes he committed in life. The statue was eventually retrieved and is now stored inside the shrine itself. It is because of this that the shrine initially carried the name , which means \\"to tread on\\", but over time the meaning was lost and the shrine's name came to be spelled 文付け, which means \\"love letter\\". Both words are pronounced Fumitsuke and the shrine is now worshipped by the general public as a deity of marriage and match-making. Kume no Heinai-dō was destroyed in March 1945 during World War II.

According to the 2016 census (INE), the city has a population of 9480 inhabitants. It is located in the Aljarafe, the comarca downstream of the Guadalquivir and west of Seville. It borders Albaida to the west, Gerena to the north, Salteras to the east, and Sanlúcar la Mayor and Villanueva del Ariscal to the south. After the establishment of the House of Olivares, it grew in size and influence, becoming an important urban center in the Aljarafe. History Olivares is located in the region of Tartessos, one of the oldest documented cultures in Europe. Several Bronze and Iron Age tells are found in the area, such as the Cerro de las Cabezas, which is thought to correspond to the ancient city of Laelia mentioned by Pliny and Ptolemy. These settlements lay on the Guadiamar (the Roman Menoba), which may have been navigable during ancient times according to Pliny. Thus, cities such as Laelia and Lastigi probably acted as port cities or trade posts. During Roman times, the region was connected to the main aqueduct that brought water from Tejada to Itálica. The village of Olivares was founded as a small alquería on the Repudio, a brook that carries rainwater to the Guadalquivir. This village was known as Estercolinas or Estercolines, perhaps from an older Latin name, Turculina. This was later known as villa de olivares (town of olive fields), whence its name. Olive trees have been grown in this area for centuries and represent one of the main sources of income in the area, apart from other crops, mainly cereals. Over time, Olivares grew in size, becoming bigger than the nearby town of Albaida. The nearby town of Heliche became depopulated in the early 19th century and was dismantled in 1843. Its inhabitants moved to Olivares, while the building materials of its church (Iglesia de San Benito) were used to build the cemetery in Olivares (Cementerio de San Benito). The city is known for the House of Olivares, founded by Pedro Pérez de Guzmán in 1535. At the time, its population was approximately 240, of which 67 paid taxes.Mesa Jarén. p. 51. In 1625, Gaspar de Guzmán became the first Count-Duke of Olivares, i.e. Count of Olivares and Duke of Sanlúcar. The noble family later merged with the House of Alba, which inherited all of its lands, before selling part of these in the first half of the 19th century. The Duchess of Alba still owns La Pizana, a cortijo between Olivares and Gerena. By 1751, Olivares had over 1,600 inhabitants, which grew to 1,950 by 1801 and reached 2,943 by 1888.Mesa Jarén. p. 53. The city had only 12 streets and one square in 1781, a small number compared to the 150 streets it had in the 21st century.Mesa Jarén. p. 55. In 1998, a chemical spill from the nearby Mina de los Frailes, in Aznalcóllar, caused an environmental disaster in the Guadiamar river. This led to the creation of a wildlife corridor that runs from Gerena to Aznalcázar, the Corredor Verde del Guadiamar. Cortijos The lands around Olivares are divided into a series of fincas and cortijos which originally constituted a large dehesa with encinas (Quercus ilex). These have been mostly transformed into lands of agricultural use, primarily olive fields, as well as wheat, cotton and corn fields. According to Pascual Madoz, \\"over 6,000 of the 7,000 aranzadas [ca. 3,000 ha] of Olivares were owned by the Dukedom, now joined to the House of Berwick & Alba. These lands were mostly sold in the 19th century due to the delicate financial situation of the House of Alba and the high tax burden.Mesa Jarén. p. 500. The following cortijos, documented in the 19th century, but many much older, exist today: *La Coriana, north of Olivares and west of Heliche; in 1801, its caserío was dismantled by the House of Alba and the land distributed among nearby villagers; known for its fountain, it lends its name to the nearby Arroyo de la Coriana *Montijos, near Heliche; mainly planted with olive trees *La Bartola, between La Coriana and Salteras; one of the many lands of the House of Alba *Bonal, next to the Guadiamar, south of San Antonio; also owned by the House of Alba *Soberbina (or Sobarbina), south of the confluence of the Agrio and Guadiamar; one of the oldest and largest cortijos in the area *San Antonio, next to the Guadiamar; one of the largest, established in modern times, it lends its name to the Torre de San Antonio (the medieval Torre del Alpechín) *Conti, north of San Antonio and next to La Pizana; the Olivares–Gerena road runs through its caserío *La Alegría (formerly divided into the Casa de Vacas or Dehesa de las Vacas, Cerro de las Esparragueras and Cabo del Río), between the Agrio and Guadiamar; formerly a dehesa owned by Concha y Sierra, now agricultural land The following cortijos, while not whithin the término municipal of Olivares, are historically connected to the others: *Cambullón, a historical alquería west of La Coriana; it belongs to Albaida *Dehesa de Crispín (or Crespín), on the confluence of the Guadiamar and the Agrio, the latter of which used to be known as Arroyo Crispinejo (or Crespinejo); it belongs to Sanlúcar la Mayor *Carcahueso (or Carcabosillo), northwest of La Alegría; formerly a dehesa owned by Concha y Sierra, now agricultural land; it belongs to Sanlúcar la Mayor *Las Dueñas, west of Carcahueso, towards Aznalcóllar; it contains the remains of the Tejada aqueduct, as do Carcahueso, La Alegría, San Antonio and La Pizana; it belongs to Sanlúcar la Mayor *La Pizana (or La Pisana), north of Conti and next to Gerena; it contains the country house of the Duchess of Alba; it belongs to Gerena *Mirandilla (or Mirandillas), north of Carcahueso and La Pizana; still a dehesa with bulls owned by the Marquis of Albaserrada; it belongs to Gerena Gallery References External links *Olivares - Sistema de Información Multiterritorial de Andalucía Category:Municipalities of the Province of Seville ","title":"Olivares, Spain"},{"id":"13121851","text":"Cubanito, also known by the former name Cubanito 20.02, is a Cuban reggaeton/cubaton band. The band is credited, along with the band Máxima Alerta, with popularizing cubaton, though Cubanito is influenced more by Jamaican music, whereas Máxima Alerta is influenced more by traditional Cuban music.van Boeckel, Rik (September 19, 2006). \\"Reggaeton a lo Cubano: From Cuba to the Rest of the World\\". 'LA'Ritmo.com: Latin American Rhythm Magazine. Retrieved March 21, 2018.  History  Cubanito 20.02, formed in 2002, as their name suggests, and released their first album, Soy Cubanito, in 2003. The origins of the group are in hip hop. In the mid-1990s, the three members, Haniel Gonzalez Martinez, Javier Duran Webb, and José Angel Sastre Perez, were listening to rap sounds coming from the U.S. They shortened their names to Flipper, El Doctor, and White, and they got themselves some bandanas, baseball caps and extra-baggy jeans. Their first group was called Primera Base and they scored a direct hit with their performance at the Havana Rap Festival in 1995. The formation of Cubanito 20.02, formed by ex-members of Primera Base, was one of the first major significations of the switch from hip hop to reggaeton in Havana. Despite the lyrics from the first album's title track (\\"I'm a rapper first and foremost, whether you like it or not...\\"), their first big radio hit in Havana, \\"Matame\\", features a reggaeton sound. The switch from “underground” hip hop with Primera Base to the sensual beats of reggaeton with Cubanito 20.02 was controversial because reggae was seen by many \\"pure\\" hip hop artists as having a \\"retarding effect\\" while \\"eroding traditional genres\\". The hip hop group Los Aldeanos released a parody of \\"Matame\\" as a criticism of the burgeoning popularity of reggaeton over hip hop. With the new reggaeton sounds influenced by Jamaican ragga, Cubanito 20.02 became more financially successful by appealing to the youth culture. Through Cuban communist government funding, Cubanito 20.02 was able to produce multiple hit albums and even go on tour in some European countries. On the other hand, government regulations can be seen in their lyrics, which do not contain the typical reggaeton blatant sexuality and emphasis on the female body and intercourse nor does the music evoke a certain politically, socially, and culturally liberating or freeing quality that is more prevalent with reggaeton from Cuba that is not sponsored by the government. For example, their song \\"Pideme\\" contains the lyrics \\"soy sincero cuando digo que te quiero\\" (I am sincere when I tell you that I love you) and \\"eres la flor en mi jardin\\" (You are the flower in my garden). Cubanito 20.02 do not claim to tackle issues of race or violence, but rather they attempt to evoke love, happiness, and dance to their listeners. \\"We wanted to do something New-York-style, something danceable, but also something Cuban,\\" recalls Flipper. \\"We are a group from the barrio, from the streets. We were all friends, and we still are. We used to rap together when we were taking the bus.\\" Their second album, Tócame, was released in 2006. After a tour in Europe, MC Flipper decided to settle down in Europe while El Doctor and MC White went back to Cuba where they continued their collaboration. After several months working in-between Havana and Boston with producer Mark G (Mark Gonçalves), CUBANITO releases a new album entitled My World.

The earliest converts began to \\"gather in\\" at that location in 1782 and built their first meetinghouse in 1785. The early Shaker Ministry, including Joseph Meacham and Lucy Wright, the architects of Shakers' gender-balanced government, lived there.Stephen J. Stein, The Shaker Experience in America: A History of the United Society of Believers (New Haven: Yale, 1992). Isaac N. Youngs, the society's scribe, chronicled the life of this Shaker village for almost half a century. Youngs also designed the schoolhouse built there in 1839.Glendyne R. Wergland, One Shaker Life: Isaac Newton Youngs, 1793-1865 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2006). Holy Mount, where Shaker services were held, has a spur ridge which has been called Mount Lebanon. In addition to the Shakers' central Ministry, notable residents at Mount Lebanon's North Family included Elder Frederick W. Evans, known for his public preaching, and his partner, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, who was succeeded by Anna White, M. Catherine Allen artists Sarah Bates, and Polly Anne Reed. The North Family was also known for publishing a book of poetry, Mount Lebanon Cedar Boughs: original poems by the North family of Shakers, Anna White, ed. (Buffalo: Peter Paul Company, 1895), with a number of poems by Cecilia Devere and Martha Anderson. Membership In 1787, the Church Family (the First Order plus the Second Order) housed 57 male and 48 female Shakers, for a total of 105. In 1789, the Church Family's two orders housed 117 male and 116 female Shakers, for a total of 233. Numbers fluctuated according to the state of the economy and the vigor of Shaker missionaries; hard times increased membership, but rarely did the numbers reach that high again. The total dropped to 130 in 1806, then gradually rose to 240 in 1843 (111 males and 129 females) in the Church Family. From that point, membership eroded further. In 1879, the Church Family housed only 54 male and 88 female Shakers, for a total of 142.The Church Family scribes Isaac N. Youngs and his successor John M. Brown compiled membership numbers and vital records until 1879, in New Lebanon Names and Ages, Winterthur Museum Library, Andrews Shaker Collection ms. 1078. The closing of smaller communities and consolidation into the larger villages postponed dissolution for several decades. In the 1940s, due to aging members and declining membership, the Shakers sold the site to Darrow School. Throughout the subsequent years, the site has been managed by several different owners. Darrow owns what remains of the Church and Center Families, while Shaker Museum Mount Lebanon manages preservation and operates tours of the North Family; the rest of the buildings of remaining Families are privately owned. Buildings Mount Lebanon's main building became a National Historic Landmark in 1965. and Although the first of the Shaker settlements in the U.S. was in the Watervliet Shaker Historic District, Mount Lebanon became the leading Shaker society, and was the first to have a building used exclusively for religious purposes. Benson Lossing documented that meetinghouse and a few other buildings when he visited the Shakers in 1856.Benson J. Lossing, \\"The Shakers,\\" Harper’s New Monthly Magazine 15, no. 86 (July 1857).

(Infantry Training) Centre, Hounslow. History The camp was built on of farmland belonging to Millers Farm. The site was acquired in 1939; on 2 January 1940 construction began on hutted accommodation for 7 field officers, 28 junior officers, 35 WOs and Sergeants, and 1,056 other ranks. This included provision for around 150 women of the ATS. The building work was undertaken by G. E. Wallis & Sons. In addition to accommodation, the site included regimental offices and stores, training rooms, workshops, a Regimental Institute, Officers' Mess, Church Room, Gymnasium and all sorts of ancillary facilities. Several of the former farm buildings were adapted for use as Motor Transport sheds. During the Second World War, the camp was initially occupied by the 2nd Battalion the Welsh Guards (from 1939), which functioned as a 'holding battalion' (for newly-trained recruits awaiting deployment) until 1941, whereupon the 3rd Battalion was established at Beavers Lane to take its place. In the spring of 1942, the camp became home to the 70th Battalion the Middlesex Regiment, who had been stationed in the Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow (a few hundred yards up on the other side of Beaver Lane); they remained there until August 1943. After the war it became an Infantry Training Centre with accommodation for circa 1,500 staff. The sheds and workshops were later occupied by 70 MT Company, the Royal Army Service Corps. In the 1950s the Army built new married soldiers' accommodation for the camp (Beavers Terrace and Cavalry Terrace). Beavers Lane Camp was the home of 10 Signals Regiment from 1964 until 1983 (when it moved to HQ UK Land Forces at Wilton). The 'White Helmets' (Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team) was also based at Beavers Lane for this period. Following the Royal Signals' departure, their buildings were taken over for a time by the Special Investigations Branch of the Military Police. In addition, the site included extensive workshops and offices for the Royal Corps of Transport and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers; the RCT (successors to the RASC) left Beavers Lane for Regent's Park Barracks in 1989–90. That same year saw the departure of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, who had a bomb disposal unit based at Beavers Lane through the 1970s and '80s; it relocated to RAF Northolt. During the 1990s the camp remained in MOD ownership, but earmarked for disposal. Over half the original buildings had already been demolished, in the late 1960s and early '70s. A third of the site was cleared and put up for sale in 1994 (British Airways acquired it and built industrial units). The remaining remained in a derelict state until the year 2000, when the remaining buildings were finally demolished, the ground decontaminated and the site subsequently sold. It is now an industrial estate.

Written and directed by executive producer and showrunner Greg Daniels, the episode first aired on NBC in the United States on September 27, 2007. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) believes the office is cursed after he accidentally hits Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with his car. After being taken to the hospital, Meredith is found to have rabies. In an attempt to make amends with Meredith, Michael sponsors a fun run for rabies. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) are dating, while Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) is mad at Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) for killing her cat Sprinkles. The episode received mixed reviews from the varying critics, while most praised the episode for Jim and Pam's relationship. However, critics had differing opinions when it came to how Michael behaved throughout the episode. Plot Over the summer, Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) moved in with Michael Scott (Steve Carell), Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) started his new job at Corporate and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) broke up with Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones), who left Dunder Mifflin Scranton. Jim and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) claim that they see each other socially but only as friends. The documentary crew catches Pam picking up Jim in her car. They kiss and drive away. When faced with the footage of them kissing, Jim and Pam admit to the documentary crew that they are secretly dating. As he arrives at work, Michael accidentally hits Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with his car, sending her to the hospital for a fractured pelvis. Forced to join a group visit to Meredith in the hospital, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) leaves Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) with complicated instructions on the care of her ailing cat Sprinkles. During the hospital visit, Michael fails to obtain forgiveness from Meredith. When Angela returns to the office, Dwight informs her that her cat is dead. Dwight explains to Angela that he killed her cat because it was suffering, and that this is normal on the farm. Angela is furious, because being euthanized prevents Sprinkles from being in \\"cat heaven\\". The combination of Meredith's accident, Sprinkles' death, and a virus on Pam's computer (which is cleaned by the company's tech support employee, Sadiq, portrayed by Omi Vaidya) convinces Michael that the office is cursed. He insists that he is not superstitious, but rather \\"a little-stitious\\". Dwight discovers that Meredith has had a precautionary rabies shot due to several animal bites. Michael immediately takes credit for saving Meredith's life by sending her to the hospital and declares the curse over. But, still feeling guilty about hurting Meredith, Michael organizes a charity five-kilometer (3.1 miles) fun run to raise awareness of the dangers of rabies. Over half of the money raised is spent on the check presentation ceremony. Whilst Michael is getting changed for the race, Pam sees him naked. Few take the race seriously (Creed, Oscar and Stanley sneak off to a bar while Jim and Pam visit a garage sale) and while Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) finishes first and Michael becomes ill, having \\"carbo-loaded\\" (he ate fettucini alfredo before the race) and abstained from water. In the hospital for dehydration, Michael is visited by Meredith. In recognition of his efforts, she forgives him, and they share a lollipop. Production \\"Fun Run\\" was the eighth episode of the series written by Greg Daniels and ninth episode directed by him. The episode was the second of the series in which Daniels was both the writer and director. Daniels also wrote and directed the first season episode \\"Basketball\\". After initially reading the script, Kate Flannery asked producer Kent Zbornak if Meredith was going to live, to which he replied \\"This isn't All My Children.\\" Flannery was nervous about doing her own stunt, so Zbornak did it first to show her that she would be fine. Flannery recalls \\"[I] kind of got competitive with him, and I thought, 'I can do that. I can do that better than he can.'\\" At first, Flannery would flinch before hitting the glass, until director Greg Daniels was able to get her to not think about it. Flannery's arms were bruised, due to having to film the scene multiple times. During the hospital scenes, Flannery and Steve Carell improvised a few times. Reception Pam and Jim finally getting together went over well with most critics. Zap2It's Rick Porter thought \\"the show handled the PB&J; (Pam Beesly and Jim) stuff as well as it always has, underplaying the romance as much as the NBC marketing folks overplay it.\\" Although Christine Fenno from Entertainment Weekly was happy about Pam and Jim finally dating, she was critical of them being secret about it, reasoning \\"I mean, nobody's cheating. Can't the Pam and Jim plotline have a bigger obstacle than self-imposed, weakly enforced secrecy?\\" TV Guides Jack Rodgers was glad \\"the writers aren't jerking us around anymore, and the pair are finally busted when Jim hops a ride home with Pam after work.\\" Reviews for Michael in this episode were a little bit more mixed. Rick Porter said that \\"there was a little too much Bad Michael in the hour for my taste.\\" Travis Fickett, of IGN, disagreed, saying that \\"the best stuff in the episode comes from Steve Carell. There's his reaction to hitting Meredith, how he breaks it to the office, and his fear that the office is cursed.\\" Will Leitch, a writer for New York, said that Michael hitting Meredith with his car was \\"one of the most shocking moments in the show’s history\\" and \\"nothing that came afterwards could quite top what happened in the first 25 seconds.\\" References  External links  *\\"Fun Run\\" at NBC.com  Category:The Office (American season 4) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes Category:The Office (American TV series) episodes in multiple parts ","title":"Fun Run"},{"id":"13121894","text":"Adin Mulaosmanović (born 1 January 1977) is a Bosnian professional football manager and former player who is currently working as an assistant manager at Bosnian Premier League club Željezničar.

Education and Work  After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in history and political science from Gonzaga University, he earned a Master of Public Administration from the University of Washington. He went on to work for the Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney and the Seattle School District. In 2009, McDermott completed Harvard University's John F.

State Legislature  McDermott served in the state House from 2001 to 2007. A Democrat, he was re-elected by wide margins in 2002, 2004, and 2006, winning over 80 percent in 2006. Following the resignation of Sen. Erik Poulsen on September 5, 2007, McDermott expressed an interest in being appointed to the 34th district seat in the Washington State Senate. On October 13 2007, the precinct committee officers (PCOs) of the 34th district recommended McDermott for appointment with 54 of the 65 PCOs voting for him. Two days later, King County Council unanimously appointed him to the seat. He ran unopposed for the remaining two years of Poulsen's Senate term in 2008 but was not a candidate for re-election in 2010.  County Council  Instead of seeking re-election to the state senate, in 2010 he ran for King County Council, seeking the 8th district seat that Dow Constantine had vacated when elected King County Executive. The seat had temporarily been filled by former Seattle city councilwoman Jan Drago, who had pledged prior to her appointment that she would not run for the position in 2010. McDermott won the seat handily and was sworn-in on November 24, 2010. He is the first openly gay member of King County Council, representing the 8th district.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1967 and a New York City designated landmark in 1970. Today, it still serves as a Quaker Meeting, with meetings for worship taking place every Sunday. History  Colonial times  The Old Quaker Meeting House was built in 1694 as a small frame structure on land acquired in 1692 by John Bowne and John Rodman in Flushing, New York. The first recorded meeting held there was on November 24, 1694. This original structure is now the easterly third of the current structure, which was expanded 1716-1719.\\" October 11, 1975. According to one source, the original structure was renovated in 1704 and then demolished in 1716.“Old Edifice is Landmark in Flushing.” Long Island Press. April 22, 1933.

The Flushing meeting house was the second meeting house to be built on Long Island, the first one being built in Oyster Bay in 1672, which no longer stands.Wilford, Sarah. “Peace Reigns in Simple Quaker Church.” Long Island Press. July 13, 1935. Vertical files, Queens Borough Public Library. The Quakers, coming from the Netherlands, settled in the area in 1657 and meetings were held in people's homes until the Meeting House was built. Henry Townsend offered his home for meetings, but was fined for harboring “pestilents,” which was how the Quakers were regarded. The Quakers continued to meet in secret in the woods until John Bowne offered his home for meetings. Bowne was banished to Holland for refusing to pay the fine, but returned two years later to combat the persecution that the Quakers faced. The group drafted the Flushing Remonstrance and in Holland, Bowne pleaded before the Dutch West India Company to honor the cause of religious freedom, and a letter was written in 1663 to Governor Stuyvesant to end the persecution of Quakers.Religious Society of Friends. “Help us preserve a 17th Century Landmark.” Flushing Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. 1976.

Typically business meetings would be conducted by each group independently, then the partition would be raised for the religious meeting. Occupation by the Royal Army During the American Revolutionary War, the Meeting House was seized by the Royal Army and in 1776, converted to a barracks, prison, and hospital for soldiers. After the war, in 1783, the Quakers returned the building to its original use. Renovations and repairs In 1976, repairs were recommended to the building that totaled an estimated $70,000.Orin, Deborah. “Quaker Meeting House in Bad Shape.” Long Island Press. October 31, 1976.

A volunteer archeological crew from New York University and the New York State Division for Historic Preservation was formed to survey the site for stabilization work funded by the Society of Friends and a grant from the National Park Service.Mayer, Susan N. \\"Report on Test Excavations at the Quaker Meeting House, Flushing, Queens County.\\" Suffolk County Archeological Association Newsletter. vol. 12, no. 2 (1986). July 23, 2006. Vertical files, Queens Borough Public Library. > The crew conducted tests to determine the nature of the surface below the Meeting House floor. Since no evidence of significant cultural or archaeological artifacts were found, it was determined that excavation for the stabilization work could continue. In 2005, the city allocated $600,000 to complete required repairs to the roof, gutters chimney, window frames, and porch deck, but as of 2006, no repairs were started because the amount of paperwork required.Vandam, Jeff. \\"Finding the Funds for a 17th-Century Fixer-Upper\\" New York Times. July 23, 2006. New architectural designs need to be approved by the Landmark Preservation Committee before any work can be done. Although the building requires repairs, it is still open for meetings and Sunday School. Graveyard In 2012, the Religious Society of Friends said that their graveyard, which contains hundreds of unmarked graves, was dug into by a construction company working on an adjacent lot.Maslin Nir, Sarah. \\"Quakers Say Contractors Desecrated a Historic Queens Graveyard\\" New York Times. April 2, 2012. The company erected a fence on disputed property and caused an outcry from the Quaker community about graves that may have been disturbed. After the Landmark Preservation Commission threatened a $5,000 fine, the company retreated, although maintained the claim that they did not disturb the grave site. Because of custom at the time, some graves do not display identifying headstones. Rosemary Vietor, vice president of the Bowne House Historical Society said the contested area may have contained the remains of John Bowne and his successive wives. Although an archeological survey, completed in 2010 at the recommendation of the Landmarks Preservation Committee, approved the adjacent lot for construction, the Quaker community still feels that the issue is unresolved. Descendants of the Bowne family have been called upon to help raise awareness of the issue. Landmark statuses The Friends Meeting House in Flushing was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1967. The Meeting House was also designated a New York City Landmark in 1970;Landmarks Preservation Commission. “Friends Meeting House.” August 18, 1970. Vertical files, Queens Borough Public Library. in its report, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission reported among their findings that the Friends Meeting house “has a special character, special historical and aesthetic interest and value as part of the development, heritage and cultural characteristics of New York City.” Further, the Commission noted that it is the oldest place of worship still standing in the city and is an example of medieval architecture.

According to the 2006 census (INE), the city has a population of 22,129 inhabitants. Geography Alcalá la Real is situated from the provincial capital, Jaén, and from Granada, on the slopes of La Mota, a hill in the Sierra Sur. It has an area of 261.36 km². The town is dominated by a large Moorish fortress around which, some centuries ago, the settlement evolved. Alcalá la Real is connected to the Guadalquivir valley via the Guadajoz tributary. Aerial view of the La Mota fortress. History Remains from the Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age show the human presence in the area in Prehistoric times. It has been hypothesized that this was one of the last places inhabited by Neanderthal Man. Despite the presence of remains from the Iberians, dating to the late Bronze Age, the first traces of urban structures (perhaps identifiable with the ancient Sucaelo) date to the Roman times. Archaeological findings include a marble statue of Hercules, now in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain at Madrid. After the Muslim conquest in 713, the town was renamed Qal'at (قلعة), an Arabic term meaning \\"fortified city\\". In the following centuries, Umayyad caliph Al-Hakam II (971–976) had a series of watchtowers built to defend the city from the Viking/Norman incursions; today 12 of the 15 original towers remain. Around the year 1000 the main of these tower, the Mota, became a true fortress, one of the mainstays of the Al-Andalus defence against the Christian Reconquista. In the 12th century it was the fief of the Banu Said family, and became known as Qal'at Banu Said, or Alcalá de Benzaide in Christian sources. After the dissolution of the caliphate and its fragmentation in a series of taifa small kingdoms, Qa'lat was a stronghold of the Kingdom of Granada. From here numerous raids were launched against Jaén and other frontier areas of the Kingdom of Castile. The city was finally captured on 15 August 1341 by Alfonso XI of Castile, who conceded it the title of \\"Real\\" (Royal), which after that was part of its name. Alcalá remained under the jurisdiction of Jorquera until 1364, when king Peter I gave it the privilege of a Government Council, under the royal crown and the state of Villena. It was elevated to the rank of city in 1432 by king John II. After a flourishing period, the conquest of Granada in 1492 stripped Alcalá of its strategical importance. The population started to move from the upper hill to the now safer slopes, thus gradually creating the current settlement. The city remained under the marquisses of Villena until the early 16th century, when the centralism introduced by the Catholic Monarchs started to reduce the power of the barons, although the marquisate remained in existence until the 19th century. The depopulation of the La Mota hill ended after the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic troops who occupied the fortress from 1810 and 1812. On retreat the Napoleonic forces set fire to the upper city, resulting in partial destruction of the Abbey Church. During the Spanish Civil War, Alcalá was taken by the Nationalists, who held it until the end of the conflict. This did not save the city from considerable destruction, due to its vicinity to the hostilities.

All three tracks were generally recorded live at BBC Studio 5, Maida Vale, London. The EP was produced by Mark Radcliffe, engineered by Mike Robinson, engineered by Owen Davies and remixed by Nick Cook at Townhouse 3. Details The first two songs, \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" and \\"Monkey On My Back\\", deal directly with David McComb’s drug abuse and are infused with bitterness and desperation. The song which gave its name to the EP tells the tale of a loner who has some unrequited love issues with a rich girl who’s just finished school. He pleads with her to ride with him on a baking hot summer's night and she goes along. Driven mad by the intolerable heat and by her rejection he murders her. This song was originally two songs - \\"Field of Glass\\" and \\"Pleasure Slide\\". McComb later said, \\"When we got to London I think we sort of felt we had to make a kind of statement. We recorded the Field of Glass EP just when we got there, which is still I guess the most aggressive and violent record that we had done.

The first vestiges of civilization date from the Lower Paleolithic, where on the banks of the Guadalimar River lived human beings in small hordes and subsisted on the natural resources offered by the land. No human skeletal remains have been found, but a rich lithic industry has been found, some of whose tools are on display at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid and the Jaén Museum, listed as one of the oldest in Andalusia.11 From the Roman stage there is evidence of the Mocho Bridge over the Guadalimar River, which is almost 2000 years old; it is said that Santa Teresa de Jesús left after founding the Convent of Carmelitas de Beas, the first foundation in what is now Andalusia, when he left for Seville.
