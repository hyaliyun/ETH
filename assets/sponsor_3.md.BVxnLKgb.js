Her consort was the famous poet and writer, styled the father of Malayalam literature, Sri Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran. Early life Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore Lakshmi Bayi was born in 1848 as the daughter of Bharani Nal Amma Thampuran of Mavelikara. Her mother's family was a branch of the Kolathunad royal family which was directly related to the Travancore Royal Family. The family had settled in Travancore towards the end of the 18th century when Tipu Sultan invaded their territories in Malabar. While some members of the Kolathunad family returned, three sisters stayed back in Travancore and established the royal houses of Mavelikara, Ennakkad and Prayikkara. In 1857 the then Rani of Travancore, HH Pooradam Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, the niece of Maharajah Uthram Thirunal died soon after giving birth to a son, the later Maharajah Moolam Thirunal. The royal family followed the Marumakkathayam system of matrilineal succession and the death of the Rani threatened the perpetuation of the dynasty. Thus, as in the previous five such incidents, it was decided to adopt from the Kolathunad family. Since members of the family were resident within Travancore the choice was made from amongst them. The Maharajah decided to adopt the two eldest daughters of Bharani Thirunal Amma Thampuran of Mavelikara namely Lakshmi Bayi (b. 1848) and her younger sister Parvathi Bayi (b. 1850). Adoption and Marriage In November 1857 the adoption was sanctioned by the Paramount power and the two girls were adopted into the royal family and installed as the Senior and Junior Ranis of Attingal, the traditional position held by females of the Travancore family. Lakshmi Bayi now became HH Rani Bharani Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi. In 1859 three suitable boys from chosen families were presented to her, including the famous artist Raja Ravi Varma. The Rani picked the brother of the Rajah of Parappanad, whose family had also settled in Travancore at Changanassery, namely Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran. Raja Ravi Varma later went on to marry her youngest sister Bhageerathi Amma Thampuran of Mavelikara. The marriage of the Rani and Kerala Varma was very happy in all respects, except that they were childless. In 1860 Uthram Thirunal died and his nephew, the Rani's adoptive uncle, Maharajah Ayilyam Thirunal succeeded to the musnud. Both Ayilyam Thirunal and his brother Visakham Thirunal were initially close to Kerala Varma. However sometime into the 1870s there occurred a palace conspiracy, involving Visakham Thirunal, Kerala Varma and the Dewan T. Madhava Rao and the three got alienated from the Maharajah. Matters took a turn for the worse when, with the sanction of the Paramount Power, who were apprised of facts, Kerala Varma was arrested by the Maharajah in 1875 and imprisoned at Alapuzha in north Travancore. After two years he was placed under house arrest at his family home in Haripad. Separation The Rani's entreaties to the Maharajah to forgive her husband were met with no sympathy. When she asked for his release it was refused and so she proposed to go with him. But the Maharajah refused to permit this and constrained her in her palace. At the same time from all quarters she was pressurized to leave Kerala Varma and accept a new consort. The Rani, however, completely refused in absolute terms to even listen to any such suggestion. In order to compel her to give up her marriage, her allowances were cut off by the Maharajah. The Rani however refused to budge and somehow managed her basic expenses with loans taken from influential people of Trivandrum. The support of the crown prince (the future Visakham Thirunal) was also a relief for her. In 1880, Maharajah Ayilyam Thirunal died and was succeeded by Visakham Thirunal. He immediately ordered the release of Kerala Varma. Thus, after a period of five years, the Rani was reunited with her husband. In gratitude to the Maharajah, Kerala Varma wrote the Visakhavijaya. He also authored the famous masterpiece Mayura Sandesam (the peacock messenger), the theme of which is the separation between his wife and himself. When the Rani's strong will and refusal to abandon her husband, amidst all pressures and tribulations, reached the ears of Queen Victoria, she admitted her in 1881 into the Order of the Crown of India. Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran was later in 1895 decorated with the Order of the Star of India. The remaining years of the Rani's life with her husband were happy, marred only by their childlessness and the deaths of her nephews. Her sister, the Junior Rani Parvathi Bayi, had four sons and one daughter. The daughter died within months of her birth and two of the four sons were also dead by 1895. The Junior Rani also died in 1893, and once again the royal family faced the problem of a succession crisis due to the absence of female members to continue the line after Rani Lakshmi Bayi. Heirs The Rani now looked upon her nieces, the children of her youngest sister by the artist Raja Ravi Varma to bring forth girls who could be adopted into the ruling line. For this purpose she went on a pilgrimage of Sethusamudram in 1894 accompanied by her nieces. In 1895 her elder niece, Ayilyam Nal Mahaprabha Thampuran gave birth to a daughter Sethu Lakshmi Bayi and the next year her younger niece, Thiruvadira Nal Kochukunji Thampuran gave birth to Sethu Parvathi Bayi. In 1900 the Rani officially petitioned her adoptive brother, Maharajah Moolam Thirunal, who ascended the musnud after the death of Visakham Thirunal in 1885 and accordingly the two girls were adopted and installed as Junior Rani and first princess of Attingal respectively. The Rani was very attached to the children. The elder one would in 1924 become Regent of Travancore while the son of the younger one would be the last Maharajah of Travancore, Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma. Description by a traveller Painting of The Maharani by Raja Ravi Varma Painting of Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran Pierre Loti during his visit to Travancore in the year 1900 described the \\"Maharanee\\" thus: Death In October 1900 the late Junior Rani's youngest son, Prince Aswathy Thirunal Marthanda Varma died causing much pain to the Rani. On 6 June 1901 the heir apparent and only surviving son of the late Junior Rani, Elayarajah Chathayam Thirunal Rama Varma died as well. The Rani was by then too ill to even grieve, as her husband noted in his diary. She died on 15 June 1901, barely a week after her nephew's death.

He performed with Stan Getz and Jacques Brel, among others. The famous line \\"\\" (\\"Heat up, Marcel\\") in Brel's song \\"V√©soul\\" refers to Azzola, who played the accordion during the recording. Biography Marcel Azzola was born in Paris in 1927 to Italian parents: his father, Giuseppe (a builder, 1896‚Äì1978) and his mother, Angelina (1901‚Äì2002) both came from Bergamo. Marcel had two elder and two younger sisters. His parents had moved to France in 1922. His father had conducted a mandoline orchestra in Italy, and Marcel, like two of his sisters, learned to play the violin. He abandoned the instrument after a year. In 1936, he began playing accordion, after he became familiar with the accordion orchestra of Pantin. Six months later, he started lessons with Paul Saive, who had been the music teacher of Jo Privat. Soon after, Azzola started taking lessons from Attilio Bonhommi instead. He accompanied Bonhommi during jazz concerts, first as a percussionist, and later as an accordionist. At 11 years old and having just finished his primary education, Azzola became a professional accordionist. At first he played with the Aveugles de Pantin, but soon he switched to the \\"Orchestre de l'Amicale Accord√©oniste de l'Humanit√©\\", a politically leftist orchestra. In 1939 he won first prize in the junior category at the Concours de Suresnes. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Azzolas moved with Bonhommi to Draillant in the French Alps. Only his father Giuseppe remained in Pantin. After a year the family returned to Paris, and Azzola started taking lessons with M√©dard Ferrero. At the same time, he worked as an in-house accordionist in many bars in Paris. In 1943, he left Ferrero and studied under Jacques Mendel, until Mendel, who was Jewish, fled Paris in an unsuccessful attempt to hide from the Nazis. Azzola also became friends with Geo Daly, then still an accordionist but later primarily a vibraphone player. Daly introduced him to contemporary American jazz; most of Azzola's education up that point had centered on classical music and French musette and chanson. After the liberation in 1944, Azzola continued to work in multiple bars and for organisations including the American headquarters of the Red Cross in France. He taught himself to play the bandoneon. In 1946, he travelled through Germany for six months to play for American soldiers. In the 1950s, he recorded his first songs for Barclay Records and started collaborating with some of the greatest names of the French chanson, including Jacques Brel, Barbara, Yves Montand, Boris Vian, Edith Piaf, Gilbert B√©caud and Juliette Gr√©co. He also played with European jazz musicians St√©phane Grappelli and Toots Thielemans. He played on some soundtracks and his music can be heard in multiple Jacques Tati movies including Mon Oncle. He taught music at the Ecole de Musique d'Orsay for more than 20 years. He was made a Commander (the highest rank) in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Personal life Azzola married Jacqueline, who died young. They had one daughter. Marcel died in January 2019 in Villennes-sur-Seine, where he lived with musician Lina Bossati.

The airfield's control tower was closed on 14 January 1946 for a brief period, but was reopened on 23 July 1946. The airfield's primarily unit was the MATS 6th Weather Squadron (Regional), with overall command of the base being that of the 24th Composite Wing, headquartered at Ramey AFB (now Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen), Puerto Rico. The facility was renamed Beane Air Force Base in 1948. It was closed on 28 May 1949, as a result of budgetary cutbacks, with right of re-entry retained by the United States. Agreements for the base's disposition were subsequently reached with the United Kingdom and, later, the Saint Lucia government upon that state's independence. The former USAF base was then refurbished and converted into Hewanorra International Airport. There remains a disused northeast/southwest runway, north of the main east-west runway, that was part of the military airfield. It is in poor condition. In 1966, St. Jude's Hospital was founded in the abandoned medical facility of the base by a nun from Kansas, Mary Irma Hilger of the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother. The hospital served the 70,000 residents of the southern end of the island until destroyed by fire in 2009.

The valley is quite flattened over and pumicey after repeated eruption of the nearby volcano Hekla as well as other volcanoes in the vicinity like the Vatna√∂ldur volcanic system which produced Iceland's biggest known lavafield √ûj√≥rs√° Lava (√ûj√≥rs√°rhraun) in prehistoric times or the Gr√≠msnes volcanic system with the crater Keri√∞. Landmarks in √ûj√≥rs√°rdal include √ûj√≥√∞veldisb√¶rinn St√∂ng, Gj√°in, H√°ifoss, and Vegghamrar. Geography and Nature √ûj√≥rs√°rdalur valley is divided into two valley floors: Rau√∞ukamba in the eastern part; and Berg√≥lfssta√∞a√° (towards the river Sand√°) in the west. On the inside of both valleys is the mountain Fossalda, and east of the river Foss√° is Stangarfell. The next mountain towards the southwest is Skeljafell; after that, S√°mssta√∞am√∫li, and finally B√∫rfell (√ûj√≥rs√°rdal). The valleys join at the south end. West of Foss√∂ldu are the mountains Fl√≥amannafj√∂ll, then D√≠mon, Selh√∂f√∞i, Skri√∞ufell and √Ås√≥lfssta√∞afjall. Under Hagafjall are the capes Bringa and Gauksh√∂f√∞i. Vegetation In the corner of the valley besides √Ås√≥lfsst√∂√∞um and Skri√∞ufelli is a large forest. This area of √ûj√≥rs√°rdals is lush with vegetation, as are B√∫rfell's woods. Yet Landgr√¶√∞sla R√≠kisins (the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland) has continued to conduct extensive soil reclamation on the grounds covered by pumice with among other things lupins and grass species. Western Foss√°r has pumice as well that is cultivated, mostly within the enclosure of highland pasture called Gn√∫pverjaafr√©ttur, but there are different grass species, including a lot of sea lyme grass. Landsvirkjun (Iceland's national electricity company) has cultivated the area around B√∫rfellsvirkjun and √ûj√≥√∞veldisb√¶rinn, and one can find there, among other things, a golf course. In Gj√°in and at Kj√≥afl√∂t there is a lot of vegetation, and it is especially scenic in Gj√°in, since the Rau√∞√° river winds through the cliff the ravine. There is a lot of angelica around the spring, as well as many species of moss and grass. Places of interest The farm of √ûj√≥√∞veldisb√¶rinn St√∂ng which was covered by the ashes of mount Hekla's 1104 eruption has been excavated in 1939. It was rebuilt at about 10 km to the south of its former place near Burfellsvirkjun hydroelectric power station as the farm museum √ûj√≥√∞veldisb√¶rinn St√∂ng so that now one can see how fireplaces and other house fixtures looked during the Saga Age (ca 930-1030). A footbridge goes across the river Rau√∞√° right at the bottom of the original place of St√∂ng. From St√∂ng it is popular to walk on foot to Gj√°in. √ûj√≥rs√°rdals's hot spring is west of the waterfall, east near Rau√∞uk√∂mbum. There is a hot spring bath, and an abundance of hot- and cold water that is freely flowing into the hot spring. Inside the valley is H√°ifoss, one of the highest waterfalls of Iceland. Skei√∞a- og Gn√∫pverjahreppur has provided a viewing platform west of Stangarfelli which is situated on the way from H√≥lask√≥gur. Near the farm museum is Hj√°lparfoss, which is a split waterfall in a dell that joins together in B√∫rfell. Vegghamrar are rocky cliffs midway between Hallslaut and Rau√∞ukamba. Under them lies the ancient Sprengisandslei√∞, and the mountain men Gn√∫pverja ride through here on the way to the mountains.

The organization actively promoted leftist political views built around class struggle and nationalism. Sport in late 19th century Germany was centered on the development of gymnastics and was highly politicized with strong nationalist overtones. A clear class divide developed and often workers were not accepted within the ranks of established sports clubs. In response, separate worker's clubs emerged and in 1893 the Workers' Gymnastics Federation (ATB or Arbeiter Turnerbund) was formed in Gera. In June 1919, following World War I, the federation was renamed Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund to reflect the rise of sports other than gymnastics including athletics, handball, and especially football. In the late 1920s the federation had a membership of 770,000 and fielded over 8,000 football teams throughout Germany. Between 1920-32, the ATSB staged its own national football championship separate from that of the DFB (Deutscher Fu√üball Bund, en:German Football Association). It also held German Workers' Gymnastics and Sports Festival and hosted or took part in international events including the Workers' Olympiad. By 1930, the federation had a membership of 1.2 million, however, it splintered when the communist-oriented Kampfgemeinschaft f√ºr Rote Sporteinheit (KG, en:Fighting Community for Red Sport, commonly Rotsport) was formed. Despite its popularity, the ATSB never managed to break the dominance of bourgeois clubs within the working class. After the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, all sports associations with left-leaning or faith-based affiliations were disbanded. The memberships of these clubs were dispersed or forced into mergers with sides more ideologically palatable to the regime and the clubs' assets were expropriated. The KG was broken up in February 1933, followed by the ATSB in May.

The destination is often the North Pole, the home of Santa Claus' workshop. Employees and locals often including firemen, police officers, and local church groups generally donate their own time and labor to decorate either a gate area or a dedicated terminal area. Employees often don costumes including magicians and Santa's helpers known as elves to entertain the children. Various gifts and take-away bags often accompany the Christmas and holiday seasons' theme. Often, local companies and charitable organizations are sponsors. Host airlines donate venues (gate areas), aircraft, fuel, and fellow sponsors. The cost is virtually always free. Fantasy flights differ from angel flights in that fantasy flights *are not to reach a practical or far away destination, *generally have no compelling practical need (i.e. specialized medical treatment) for transportation, *are initiated by the parents' outreach to the sponsoring organizations instead of by a referring health professional, *and may include those without medical conditions due to the customary lack of pressurization and duration Examples Commercial aviation The following commercial aviation operators are sorted by airlines' names' alphabetical order. Aerolineas Argentinas conducts fantasy flights between Buenos Aires' two main airports, Ministro Pistarini International Airport and Jorge Newberry Airport.

The Loch has for many years been used as a fishery and is well known for its abundant fish life. A curling pond is situated on the Northern shoreline and is nominally used by the Abdie Curling Club and Abdie ladies Curling Club. A speculative study suggests that the loch was created by glacial deposits from the surrounding Ochil Hills at the end of the last ice-age. The water level and shoreline have changed over time due to roads, railway, sluice gate and farmland. Natural history Lindores Loch is a protected Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is designated for the flora and fauna of its wetlands and open water habitats. Specifically its high diversity of pondweeds (potamogeton), large area of reed bed, wet woodland and notable birds. There are also two rare species of water beetle recorded at this site. Geography The loch is nestled in the Ochil Hills between Woodmill Hill to the west and Dunboghill to the East and Kinnaird Hill to the North. The water stretches from the village of Lindores southwards for a distance of 1.3 km. It is a shallow loch with a maximum depth of 3m. History The old Abdie Parish Church ruins are close to the north shoreline. The ruins of Inchrye House, a grand Victorian Gothic house to which estate the loch once belonged, lay to the East. The rail line between Perth and Ladybank is located on the west shoreline. The loch was an important source of water for powering mills in the Lindores valley, where up to 13 mills of various types operated from the Middle Ages up to the 20th century. In 1617 armed vandals destroyed two mills belonging to Sir Michael Balfour of Denmilne by demolishing the dam.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1894), pp. 51-2. A rare mid-1860s curling house survives here, once used by the Abdie Curling Club to store its members curling stones and other equipment.Curling History Blog Culture The area near Lindores Loch is mentioned in Sir Walter Scott's play Macduff's Cross: :'You do gaze‚Äî :Strangers are wont to do so‚Äîon the prospect. :Yon is the Tay, rolled down from Highland hills, :That rests his waves, after so rude a race, :In the fair plains of Gowrie. :‚ÄîFurther westward, :Proud Stirling rises. :‚ÄîYonder to the east :Dundee, the gift of God, and fair Montrose, :And still more northward, lie the ancient towers :Of Edzell.'

Pilgrim Family  The American Land Rights Association has done coverage in Wrangell, Alaska, between the Pilgrim family and the NPS, over a bulldozing incident in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Some coverage was done on this event by the ALRA on their newsletter here, which was part of a much bigger inquiry on what the National Park Service was doing in Alaska. The ALRA supported the pilgrims family use of the Revised Statute 2477, a written law enacted by the United States Congress, to state that the path bulldozed in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve was private land owned by the Pilgrim family. A map showcasing the trails in Alaska that are documented by the Revised Statute 2477, as of August 13th, 2013, can be seen on this here. The Revised Statute 2477 was however, repealed by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. This repeal however, did not \\"terminate right-of-way conveyed under R.S. 2477\\" allowing the pilgrim family to utilize the Revised Statute 2477 as a support to their case. The Bureau of Land Management has also stated the Revised Statute 2477 as a \\"complex and controversial issue with far-reaching implications to the management of federal lands throughout the West.\\"  Hammond Family  The American Land Rights Association has also done coverage on the issue between the Hammond family and the Bureau of Land Management in Oregon. The ALRA believe that the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service are presenting an \\"abuse of power\\" towards the Hammond family being sentenced to five years. The ALRA also believe that \\"peaceful protest is always the way to go\\" and that sending the Hammond family for an additional time in jail is a \\"great injustice.\\" The ALRA redistributed this news of what was happening to the Hammond family, and making a request of unification from western communities, through use of the Land Rights Network. The ALRA had reported that the Hammond family set a \\"minor fire that cost less than $100\\" and burned \\"127 acres of land.\\" The ALRA had also reported what prosecutors stated on the arson charges with \\"the fires were set to reduce the growth of juniper trees and sagebrush\\" and to \\"accelerate the growth of rangeland grasses for the Hammond's' cattle.\\" The United States Department of Justice however, have documented the burning of land by the Hammond family as affecting \\"139 acres of public land\\" to \\"destroy all evidence of game violations.\\" The United States Department of Justice had also documented that \\"Witnesses at trial, including a relative of the Hammonds, testified the arson occurred shortly after Steven Hammond and his hunting party illegally slaughtered several deer on BLM property.\\" The ALRA believe that the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service had sentenced the Hammond family to \\"gain ownership of the Hammond ranch which is intermingled with Federal ground in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge\\" and to \\"inflict as much pain as possible on the Hammonds to reduce the chances other ranchers will stand up for their rights.\\" The ALRA had also reported on the interference of Ammon Bundy during the Hammond family incident with the Bureau of Land Management. The Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, led by Ammon Bundy, was commented on by Len Vohs, the mayor of Burns from 2008 to 2010, stating \\"many locals and himself, share the frustration with the federal government that drove Bundy and others to occupy the wildlife refuge\\" and continued on saying \\"few support their tactics, and wish they would just go home.\\" Len Vohs had also stated \\"the occupiers, few if any of whom are from the Burns, do not speak for the town\\" in regards to Ammon Bundy's group, who had also attended the rally for the Hammonds.

History The gothic mansion was built in 1876 for Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Holmes, the owner of the Hornchurch Brewery. The grounds included the pitch used by Hornchurch Cricket Club. The house was put up for sale in June 1914 after the death of the owners. First World War During the First World War it was purchased by the Army Council. From November 1914 it was used as a military depot, housing first the 23rd Royal Fusiliers and then the 26th Middlesex Regiment. In January 1916 it was decided that Grey Towers would become the command depot of the New Zealand Contingent, although was later changed, and from July 1916 it was used as the New Zealand Convalescent Hospital, with 1,500 beds. Demolition In the interwar period Hornchurch developed as a suburb of London and land was required for house building. Grey Towers was demolished in 1931. The driveway to the house is now a road of suburban houses called Grey Towers Avenue and the entrance gates were moved to Hylands Park. Towers Cinema opened on part of the site on 3 August 1935.

History  Castelo Branco gets its name from the prior existence of a Luso-Roman castrum or fortified settlement called Castra Leuca, on the summit of the hill of Colina da Cardosa. The population grew on the slopes of this hill. Little is known of the history before 1182. There is, nevertheless, a document, from this date, mentioning the donation to the Templars of a piece of land called Vila Franca da Cardosa, by a noble Fernandes Sanches. In 1213 it received its autonomy or foral and the name Castel-Branco appears for the first time. Pope Innocent III confirmed this in 1215 giving it the name of Castelo Branco. It was around this time that the Templar Knights built the walls and the castle. In 1510 a new foral was conceded by Manuel I and in 1642 the town acquired the status of Vila de Castelo Branco. In 1771 Castelo Branco became a city and a bishopric (see below) until 1881.

Its summers are among the hottest of Portugal, influenced by its inland position. Winters are mild with cool nights, but frosts are rare and never severe. Inland areas further south in the country have hotter temperature extremes, although averages are very similar. There is somewhat of a seasonal lag in summer since September is significantly warmer than May in spite of less daylight. Winter temperatures are more consistent with the daylight cycle, since temperatures drop sharply in autumn months.  Economy  The city is home to Centauro, a company which produces industrial coolers, refrigerators and freezers. The Portuguese subsidiary of Danone has a factory in Castelo Branco which produces Danone's dairy products for the entire Iberian Peninsula.

Transportation  Railways: Castelo Branco is the principal station located some up the Beira Baixa Railway Line from Entroncamento to Guarda. It runs via Abrantes, Rod√£o, Castelo Branco and Fund√£o with services currently terminating at Covilh√£ some short of Guarda. Rail services are operated by CP - Comboios de Portugal (Portuguese Trains) and consist of three stopping trains (Regionais) and three fast trains (Intercidades) per day from Lisbon via Entroncamento. The fast trains take less than 3hours to reach Castelo Branco from Lisbon Santa Apolonia and Lisbon Oriente main stations. Stopping trains are considerably slower. From Entroncamento, the route branches off the Lisbon to Porto main line onto the Beira Baixa line following the mighty Tagus river crossing it twice on impressively long bridges. From Abrantes a series of reservoirs come into view. For lengthy stretches the single track clings to the NW flanks of the reservoirs providing exhilarating forested views as you speed along the waterside. The services are operated by comfortable and purposeful 'Iberian Gauge' (5ft6in) 25 kV electric multiple units. After passing through some deep gorges into Rodao station the line then heads north away from the river and on to Castelo Branco and finally Covilh√£. From Covilh√£ northwards to Guarda trains were operated by more leisurely diesel motorcars. This scenic stretch of mountainous rural line provides the strategic last leg of the Beira Baixa Railway linking it to Guarda via Belmonte. However, in recent years it has been closed for modernisation and electrification. The partially completed works, originally due for completion in 2011, are sadly still on hold due to serious funding issues associated with the economy. This inconveniently cuts off otherwise direct rail options from Castelo Branco to destinations north of Covilh√£.

Belliveau's Cove, 1931 Belliveau's Cove Post Office Belliveau's Cove was established in 1768 and is located on the west coast of the Nova Scotia peninsula on the St. Mary's Bay. Like many of the small Nova Scotia coastal port villages, Belliveau Cove was known for their wooden ship building, shipping industry and attendant services. All of the Belliveau family ships were built on the beaches just north of the north wharf along with ships for the Theriault family and other interests. The second largest wooden ship ever constructed in Canada, the County of Yarmouth, was built there in 1884. The wooden pepper-shaker-style lighthouse on end of the north wharf was established in 1889 and existed until 1973; its foundation had much deterioration and a storm caused the lighthouse to fall in the ocean. A replica lighthouse was built at the same location in the 1980s by the community and is maintained as a private navigational aid. The harbor is still used today by a small number of pleasure craft and small fishing boats. Due to the high tides, the harbor can only be used for 4 to 6 hours at a time on the rising and falling tides. Situated in the bay of St. Mary's, the village experiences the majestic Bay of Fundy tides that have an amazing 28 foot range. When the tide is out, Belliveau Cove is a popular clamming area. The Joseph and Marie Dugas Municipal Park, named after the first Acadian couple to arrive in the area in 1768, has a wharf, lighthouse and 5 km nature trail bordering the shoreline and freshwater wetlands. At Major's Point, the first Acadian cemetery dating from 1755 and The Little Chapel or \\"La petite chapelle\\" can be visited. The village also has a summer Farmers Market every Saturday between 10 am and 2 pm from May to September at the Joseph and Marie Dugas Municipal Park. On Friday nights at the municipal park is the Beaux Vendredis supper and music celebration featuring fresh lobster, clams and crab, as well as local Acadian music. The beach at the wharf has also become an attractive spot to fly kites. South of Belliveau cove is Church Point with the largest wooden church in North America, and to the north is the village of St. Bernard, with the grandest stone church in Nova Scotia.

History The Armenian Revolutionary Federation was founded in Tiflis (Tbilisi in modern-day Georgia) in 1890 by Christapor Mikaelian, Stepan Zorian, and Simon Zavarian. The party operates in Armenia and in countries where the Armenian diaspora is present, notably in Lebanon where the Armenian Revolutionary Federation is considered the strongest political party within the Lebanese-Armenian community. The party adheres to socialism and is part of the Socialist International. 19th century until 1918 The party became initially active in Lebanon during the Ottoman Empire (end of 19th century and end of World War I) through Armenian students registered to study in Beirut colleges and universities during the Ottoman rule in Lebanon. 1920s to 1950s The party also gained many members with the increasing waves of Armenian immigrants flooding into Lebanon in the early 1920s fleeing the Armenian Genocide during World War I. From 1923 to 1958, conflicts erupted among the three traditional Armenian political parties, the Tashnags (Armenian Revolutionary Federation), the Hunchaks (Social Democrat Hunchakian Party) and the Ramgavars (Armenian Democratic Liberal Party) struggling to dominate and organize the diaspora. The party had media presence very early on with the short-lived \\"Pyunig\\" newspaper (in Armenian ’ì’´÷Ç’∂’´’Ø) published in Beirut in general reflecting the views of the party. The Aztag daily (in Armenian ‘±’¶’§’°’Ø) replaced Pyunig and started publication on March 5, 1927, in Beirut, Lebanon. It is the official party organ of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's Lebanese Central Committee and considered one of the biggest dailies of the Armenian diaspora. Civil strife 1956‚Äì1958 After the death of Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia Karekin I in 1952, the seat in Antelias remained vacant for nearly four years. In 1956, Archbishop Zareh Payaslian was consecrated Catholicos of Cilicia as Zareh I despite the opposition of Catholicos of Echmiadzin of All Armenians Catholicos Vazgen I who refused to recognize his authority considering Zareh I's choice as partisan. This controversy greatly polarized the Armenian community of Lebanon. The regime of the Lebanese President Camille Chamoun in support of Zareh I served to polarize the situation further. With failure of all mediation, and in the context of the Lebanese civil strife of 1958, an armed conflict erupted within the Lebanese community as well, between supporters of Catholicos Zareh I (mainly adhering to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation) and the opponents of Zareh I mainly adhering to the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchakians) and Armenian Democratic Liberal Party (Ramgavars), with the two latter parties supporting the positions of the Catholicos of All Armenians Vazgen I and the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin in Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia. The situation developed into armed confrontations and various shootings and killings between the different groups resulting in a big rift within the Armenian Apostolic Church in Lebanon and worldwide. The conflicts calmed down after 1958 with the establishment of the regime of President Fouad Chehab in Lebanon. 1960s to 1975 Politically the party remained allied with the Phalangist Party of Pierre Gemayel and at a later stage with the Tripartite Alliance (in Arabic ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÑŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿ´ŸÑÿßÿ´Ÿä) made up of the Maronite Christian leaders Camille Chamoun, Pierre Gemayel and Raymond Edde. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation generally ran joint election tickets with the Phalangists, especially in Beirut and Metn constituencies with large Armenian populations and reserved Armenian seats according to the confessional division of electoral districts. securing all Armenian Parliamentary seats in Beirut and the Metn in 1960, 1964, 1968 and 1972 parliamentary elections. The official ARF party journal Droshak resumed publication in Beirut in 1969 and continued until 1985, when the party organ moved to Athens, Greece because of the security situation in Lebanon. 1975 Lebanese Civil War until 2000 The ARF (Tashnag), along with most other Armenian groups, refused to take sides between the warring Lebanese factions or to play an active military role in the Lebanese Civil War, and declared what became known as \\"positive neutrality\\" (in Arabic ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸäÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ•Ÿäÿ¨ÿßÿ®Ÿä; in Armenian ‘¥÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂ ’â’ß’¶’∏÷Ñ’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂) of the Armenians between the various Lebanese factions. This position was prompted by the ARF trying to avoid an inter-Armenian conflict after the 1956‚Äì1958 incidents. Thus the Armenian regions were somewhat spared from a devastating conflict, although they continued to suffer from shellings and various military conflicts in Nabaa, Karantina and the Syrian intervention. But ARF and the general Armenian consensus neutral position and refusal to ally openly with the right-wing Christian forces soured the long-standing relations between the ARF and the Phalangist party, and more particularly the Lebanese Forces (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by Bachir Gemayel, Pierre Gemayel's son). The Lebanese Forces responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud. In addition, the statue dedicated to the Armenian Genocide and located in Bikfaya was also targeted by a bombing by pro-Lebanese Forces elements. Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms to defend their quarters. In an ensuing onslaught, the Lebanese Forces closed outposts of the party in various regions that had been created for keeping the peace in the predominantly Armenian regions during the Civil War. After things calmed down, mediations resulted in the ARF party continuing its control of the Armenian districts with a lower key operation and presence in agreement with Christian leadership of the country. In the midst of the Lebanese civil war, and in a surge of retaliation against Turkish targets worldwide led by the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), another guerrilla organization called Justice Commandos Against Armenian Genocide (JCAG) emerged and carried out a string of its own assassinations and operations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Tashnags. 21st century Ethnic Armenians are allocated six seats in Lebanon's 128-member National Assembly. The Lebanese branch of the ARF has usually controlled a majority of the Armenian vote and won most of the ethnic Armenian seats in the National Assembly, A major change however occurred in the parliamentary election of 2000. Negotiations to form a joint ticket between the ARF and the Karama (Dignity) party of Rafik Hariri broke down over Hariri's insistence that all candidates elected on his list, including ARF candidates, would have to form subsequently a unified parliamentary block‚Äîa rarity in Lebanese politics. This would effectively make the Armenian vote in the Chamber subservient to Hariri's wishes and practically dissolve \\"The Armenian Bloc\\" in the Lebanese Parliament. In addition, Hariri refused the ARF proposal to choose an Armenian candidate for the sole seat allocated to Lebanon's Evangelical community (many of whom are ethnically Armenian), insisting that the seat should go to an ally of his. The ARF decided to go it alone, although the other Armenian parties, namely Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchakians) and Armenian Democratic Liberal Party (Ramgavars) joined Hariri's list. In an unprecedented sweep, the Dignity movement and its allies captured 13 of Beirut's 19 seats, and the ARF was left with only one parliamentary seat in the Metn district in alliance with Michel Murr, its worst result in many decades of Parliamentary representation. It was also the first time ever that the Huntchakian and Rangavar parties gained seats in the Parliament. In the 2005 elections, the ARF called for a boycott of the elections in Beirut, disturbed that the four seats normally reserved for Beirut's large Armenian community had again gone unopposed to Hariri's candidates and his Hunchakian and Ramgavar allies plus some independent Armenian candidates. The ARF held one seat through its MP Hagop Pakradounian from the Metn district that includes Bourj Hamoud heavily populated by Armenians. The ARF has generally avoided entanglement in sensitive domestic issues, usually supporting whichever government has been in power. However, the ARF harshly criticized the Lebanese government's decision in 2006 to invite the deployment of Turkish troops as part of the multilateral United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeeping force. On August 5, 2007, a by-election took place in the Metn district, to replace the slain anti-Syrian minister Pierre Gemayel, the ARF decided to support Camille Khoury, the candidate backed by opposition leader Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement. Camille Khoury faced off against Phalangist leader Amine Gemayel and subsequently won the seat. Government supporters blamed Gemayel's loss on the Armenians. Amine Gemayel accused the ARF of cheating and called for the ballot in Bourj Hammoud to be cancelled. Gemayel said that he had fared better \\"among Christians\\" and accused the Dashnaktsutyun of trying to \\"impose its will on the people of Metn\\". Lebanese politician Gabriel Murr accused the ARF of rigging the vote as \\"they always do\\". Murr pointed out that Aoun didn't win the Maronite vote but that he had won the Armenian vote, which was included in the Metn district to manipulate the electoral results. Hagop Pakradounian, a leader of the ARF in Lebanon, and the Armenian Deputies Bloc asked for a public apology. Pakradounian and the Armenian Deputies Bloc condemned comments made by Amine Gemayel and Gabriel Murr over the Armenian community's support for the Free Patriotic Movement. The current ARF Central Committee Chairperson in Lebanon is Mr. Hovig Mkhitarian. The ARF Lebanon branch is headquartered in Bourj Hammoud in the Shaghzoian Centre, along with the ARF Lebanon Central Committee's Aztag daily newspaper and \\"Voice of Van\\" 24-hour radio station. After failure to come to a consensus with the Hariri camp, part of the March 14 Alliance, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation has decided to become officially part of the March 8 Alliance since its formation in 2005. March 8 Alliance is made up of the Free Patriotic Movement and \\"Change and Reform Bloc\\" (headed by Michel Aoun), by Amal Movement, Hezbollah and other smaller factions as well as the ARF. The March 8 Alliance formed the official opposition to the March 14 Alliance government headed by the Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and consequently by Prime Minister Saad Hariri. ARF's position was in sharp contrast to Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchakians) and Armenian Democratic Liberal Party (Ramgavars) who remained part of the March 14 Alliance. After six years in opposition (2005 until January 2011), and with the joining of the Progressive Socialist Party headed by Walid Jumblatt to the opposition March 8 Alliance, the latter attained the majority in January 2011 to form the next Lebanese government. After protests from October 2019 onwards until January 2020, which aimed for a change in the political arena, Vartine Ohanian became the first Lebanese Minister of Armenian descent in the Government of Hassan Diab, after she was proposed by the ARF.

She was known for spreading awareness of the condition. Although the average life expectancy for sufferers is 13 years, Okines was part of a drug trial that had seen her surpass doctors' predictions of her projected lifespan. She died on 2 April 2015 at the age of 17, having lived four years beyond doctors' initial predictions. Okines was diagnosed with progeria at the age of two, and doctors put her projected lifespan at thirteen years. She frequently travelled to Boston in the United States to receive new treatments. In 2012, her autobiography, titled Old Before My Time, was published; it was co-authored by Okines, her mother Kerry, and contributor Alison Stokes. Television appearances Okines was the subject of television specials in both Europe and the United States. Discovery Health aired a special titled Extreme Aging: Hayley's Story, which focused on the balance of the disease being currently terminal but with a possible cure on the horizon. In the UK, a television documentary titled Extraordinary Lives also discussed Okines, her condition, and her options. When she was 13 years old, she was featured on a French television show on 20 January 2012 called Tous Diff√©rents (\\"All Different\\", NT1). At that time she already had a physical age of 102 years. When she was ten years old, Okines was featured in \\"Hope for Hayley\\", an episode of the British series Extraordinary People. The episode concerned Okines' trips to Boston for treatment. She was featured in the second part of a three-part documentary series called Make Me Live Forever, in which presenter Michael Mosley investigated a number of proposed treatments to enable humans to extend their lifespan. Okines was discussed in relation to telomeres (short telomeres are a characteristic of progeria) and their apparent role in the ageing process. She was also featured in a report by Tara Brown on the Australian version of 60 Minutes. Books Old Before My Time is Okines' first and only book that chronicled her early life and struggle with progeria. Her follow-up book Young At Heart followed her years as a teenager with progeria, notably with teenage-like interests and her struggle with paralysis. Fundraisers Although the United States' Progeria Research funded Okines's treatment, her family had to fund the air fare. Some athletes were inspired by Okines to raise money for progeria research. London's Chelsea Football Club raised thousands of pounds through a charity raffle in Okines's honour. Additionally, after Steve Keen saw Okines on a television special, he bicycled to support her. In December 2010, Okines met Justin Bieber after a group of people started an awareness campaign on Twitter. \\"Voices of Tomorrow\\" When Jane Winiberg saw a progeria television special, she and Mark Street wrote a song about Okines and other children. The Kids Choir 2000, which includes Okines, performed the vocals on the song, titled \\"Voices of Tomorrow\\". \\"Life Will Find a Way\\" is another similar track on the album, and the profits are being donated to the Progeria Research Foundation.

Background  Wei Chun was born in 773, during the reign of Emperor Daizong. His family was from the Tang Dynasty capital municipality Jingzhao (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi) ‚Äî i.e., the Chang'an region.Old Book of Tang, vol. 159. His family claimed original ancestry from a line of officials of Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Later Yan, Northern Wei, Northern Zhou, Sui Dynasty, and Tang, although Wei Chun's male-line ancestors, for several generations prior to his father Wei Wan (ÈüãËê¨), were not listed to have any official titles.New Book of Tang, vol. 74. Wei Wan served as a staff member for a military governor (Jiedushi) of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). At some point, Wei Chun changed his name to Wei Chuhou due to naming taboo for Emperor Daizong's great-grandson Emperor Xianzong (Li Chun) ‚Äî although it is not clear whether Emperor Xianzong was then emperor. It was said that Wei Chuhou was an expressive child, and he was filially pious toward his stepmother. When observing mourning periods when his father and stepmother died, he lived at their tomb. After the mourning period was over, he travelled throughout the Chang'an region. It was said that he was well-learned in the Five Classics and the histories, and that he was talented in writing.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  Early in Emperor Xianzong's Yuanhe era (806-821), Wei Chuhou passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi (ÈÄ≤Â£´) class, and further passed a special examination for those considered intelligent and upright in their behavior. He was thereafter made Xiaoshu Lang (Ê†°Êõ∏ÈÉé), a copyeditor at the Palace Library. When the chancellor Pei Ji was put in charge of editing imperial history, Pei retained him to participate in the project in addition to his regular office, and while doing so, he went through serving as the sheriff of Xianyang County (Âí∏ÈôΩ, in modern Xi'an) and then You Shiyi (Âè≥ÊãæÈÅ∫), a low-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). While serving in this editing role, he participated in the editing of 50 volumes of historical records of Emperor Xianzong's grandfather Emperor Dezong, and his accounts were considered credibly-written. Thereafter, Wei Chuhou was promoted to be Zuo Bujue (Â∑¶Ë£úÈóï), a consultant at the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), and then successively as Libu Yuanwailang (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, L«êbu) and Kaogong Yuanwailang (ËÄÉÂäüÂì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, L√¨bu, note different tone than the ministry of rites). He was respected by the chancellor Wei Guanzhi. As a result, however, when Wei Guanzhi was demoted in 816 due to his disagreements with Emperor Xianzong on Emperor Xianzong's campaigns against warlords, Wei Chuhou was sent out of the capital to serve the prefect of Kai Prefecture (ÈñãÂ∑û, in modern Chongqing).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. He was later recalled to serve as Hubu Langzhong (Êà∂ÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisorial official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu), and thereafter, while serving at that position, became in charge of drafting imperial edicts.New Book of Tang, vol. 142.  During Emperor Muzong's reign  After Emperor Xianzong died in 820 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. Emperor Muzong was impressed by Wei Chuhou's scholarship, and he made Wei a deputy imperial scholar (Áø∞Êûó‰æçË¨õÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Shijiang Xueshi). Wei was also made Jianyi Daifu (Ë´´Ë≠∞Â§ßÂ§´), and later Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau, while retaining his status as deputy imperial scholar. As Wei considered Emperor Muzong to be neglectful with his studies, he, along with his colleague Lu Sui, wrote a 20-volume summary of the I Ching, Classic of History, Shi Jing, Spring and Autumn Annals, Classic of Rites, Xiao Jing, and Analects, entitled, the Guiding Words from the Six Classics (ÂÖ≠Á∂ìÊ≥ïË®Ä). Emperor Muzong appreciated the work, and rewarded them with gold and silk. At that time, Emperor Muzong's favorite official Zhang Pingshu (ÂºµÂπ≥Âèî) advocated that the state-supervised salt monopoly be further converted into a state-run business (with even stricter control by the state), believing that this would have great economic benefits. Zhang submitted a petition with 18 points, and Emperor Muzong tentatively indicated that he agreed with it, but distributed the petition among the officials for comment. Wei wrote a 10-point response rebutting Zhang, and when Emperor Muzong showed Wei's response to Zhang, Zhang, having no response to Wei, withdrew his proposal. As, at that time, the chronicles of Emperor Xianzong's reign had not yet been edited, Emperor Muzong put Wei and Lu in charge of the project, with each of them on duty on alternate days. Wei was also made acting deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang).  During Emperor Jingzong's reign  In 824, Emperor Muzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Jingzong. After Emperor Jingzong's ascension, the chancellor Li Fengji became very powerful. Li Fengji was resentful of the official Li Shen, and thus falsely accused LI Shen of not supporting Emperor Jingzong and instead wanting to support Emperor Muzong's brother Li Cong (ÊùéÊÇ∞) the Prince of Shen. Li Shen was exiled, and Li Fengji further tried to have Emperor Jingzong order Li Shen's death. Wei Chuhou, who passed the imperial examinations in the same year as Li Shen, submitted a defense of Li Shen, pointing out that there was no real evidence of Li Shen's alleged crime and that, as Li Shen was a close advisor of Emperor Muzong's, Emperor Jingzong should not be acting against him so quick after Emperor Muzong's death. When Emperor Jingzong subsequently discovered a petition in the archives in which Li Shen sought to have Emperor Jingzong created crown prince, Li Shen was spared. Later in the year, after Emperor Jingzong was shocked that the warlord Wang Tingcou (the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei)) had slaughtered the family of the deceased general Niu Yuanyi (ÁâõÂÖÉÁøº), who had remained loyal to the imperial government and who had resisted Wang, Wei pointed out that the former chancellor Pei Du, then serving as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), had great contributions in Emperor Xianzong's campaigns against warlords and should have been allowed to remain chancellor. Emperor Jingzong did not recall Pei at that time, but did, at Wei's suggestion, bestow the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã) on Pei. Soon thereafter, Wei was made deputy minister of defense, and when he met Emperor Jingzong, who was then spending much time in feasts and games, to thank him, stated, \\"Your subject has committed a great crime. I beg for my life.\\" Emperor Jingzong responded, \\"What are you talking about?\\" Wei responded: Emperor Jingzong appreciated his advice and awarded him with colored silk and silver vessels. Li Fengji continued to resent Li Shen, and after Emperor Jingzong issued another general pardon in summer 825, initially, the edict that Li Fengji drafted allows exiled officials who had previously moved toward the capital be allowed to be moved again ‚Äî but intentionally failed to mention officials who had not previously been moved, to prevent Li Shen from being moved. When Wei pointed this out, Emperor Jingzong revised the edict to allow such movements, and Li Shen thus was moved closer to the capital, from his then-post as the military advisor to the prefect of Duan Prefecture (Á´ØÂ∑û, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong), to serve as the secretary general of Jiang Prefecture (Ê±üÂ∑û, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). Around the new year 827, Emperor Jingzong was assassinated by a group of eunuchs and imperial guard officers, led by the eunuch Liu Keming (ÂäâÂÖãÊòé), who were resentful of his harsh temper. Liu tried to have Emperor Muzong's brother Li Wu the Prince of Ji√†ng made emperor, but another group of eunuchs, led by the powerful eunuch Wang Shoucheng, attacked Liu's group and slaughtered them. Wang was intending to make Emperor Jingzong's brother Li Han the Prince of JiƒÅng (note different tone) made emperor, but did not know how to explain what had happened to the people. He consulted Wei, who argued that nothing should be hidden from the public, and that the entire incident should be explained. He further outlined the ceremony for Li Han to take the throne ‚Äî for a declaration to be issued in Li Han's name explaining how the incident had occurred and how the conspirators had been destroyed; for the officials then to submit three successive petitions asking Li Han to take the throne; and then for Emperor Muzong's mother Grand Empress Dowager Guo to issue an edict ordering Li Han to take the throne. Wang followed Wei's suggestions, and Li Han subsequently took the throne (as Emperor Wenzong).  During Emperor Wenzong's reign  After Emperor Wenzong took the throne, Wei Chuhou, for his contributions during the crisis, was made the deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, Zhongshu Shilang) and made a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi. He was also put in charge of editing the imperial history, given the honorary title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (ÈäÄÈùíÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´), and created the Duke of Lingchang. It was said that while serving as chancellor, Wei focused on dealing with the problems at hand and had little regard for his own welfare. During Emperor Dezong's reign, then-chancellor Qi Kang had abolished the prefectural-level office of Biejia (Âà•Èßï, chief advisor to the prefect) as unnecessary, and persons who would have ordinarily been made Biejia were instead kept as advisory officials with no real authorities at the capital. Further, during and after Emperor Xianzong's campaigns, officers who had contributions during the battles were often kept at the capital to serve on imperial princes' staffs; as a result, these highly decorated officials crowded the imperial meetings and were often left with nothing to do. Wei restored the Biejia office for 60 prefectures and thus relieved the crowding at these imperial meetings. Emperor Wenzong, initially, was diligent in listening to the advice of the imperial officials, but he was indecisive, and it was often the case that after he had made a decision, he would change it. In summer 827, Wei objected to this situation and offered to resign; Emperor Wenzong apologized and did not accept his resignation. As of 827, Emperor Wenzong was waging a general campaign against the rebel general Li Tongjie, who had seized Henghai Circuit (Ê©´Êµ∑, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) after the death of his father Li Quanl√ºe (ÊùéÂÖ®Áï•), who served as military governor. Emperor Wenzong ordered the nearby circuits to contribute soldiers to the campaign, but Shi Xiancheng the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), one of whose children was married to a child of Li Quanl√ºe's, was secretly aiding Li Tongjie with food supplies. Pei Du, who was by then again chancellor, was unaware of this and believed Shi to be faithful, but on one occasion when Shi sent a messenger to Chang'an, Wei stated to the messenger: When the messenger relayed this to Shi, Shi became apprehensive and did not dare to aid Li Tongjie any further. Subsequently, when one of the military governors acting for the imperial cause, Li Zaiyi the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), was fighting against Li Tongjie and his ally Wang Tingcou the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), his soldiers often killed the Henghai and Chengde soldiers that they captured. Wei wrote a letter to Li Zaiyi rebuking him for the behavior, and Li Zaiyi obeyed his order. Thereafter, the captured Henghai and Chengde soldiers were usually spared. It was said that Wei lived frugally at home, often dressing like an ordinary scholar rather than a chancellor, and was hard-working. He was also said to be stern, such that his staff members did not dare to make private requests of him. He focused on commissioning officials with talent, such that he was willing to overlook character flaws or past inappropriate behavior ‚Äî and for this was both praised and criticized. He was a fervent believer of Buddhism, particularly later in his life. He had more than 10,000 volumes in his collection of books, and in most of them, he wrote notes by hand. As the lead editor of the imperial histories, he began the project of chronicling Emperor Xianzong's reign, and while he did not see it to its completion, it was said that he laid the framework. On January 29, 829, he was attending a meeting with the other chancellors and Emperor Wenzong, when he suddenly stated, \\"Your subject is ill.\\" He withdrew from Emperor Wenzong's presence. Emperor Wenzong had eunuchs accompany him back to his mansion. He died that night, and was given posthumous honors. It was said that because of his capability as chancellor, the public mourned his death.

The entire city was almost destroyed and around 5,000 people were killed. The city's Rector Simone Ghetaldi was killed and over three quarters of all public buildings were destroyed. At the time, Dubrovnik was the capital of the Republic of Ragusa. The earthquake marked the beginning of the end of the Republic.  Tectonics  Dubrovnik's region is located in the eastern part of the Adriatic Sea and is a narrow strip of land, dotted by a series of bays, with the Dinaric Alps in the background, and hundreds of islands along the coast. The city of Dubrovnik was built in the most seismically active area in Croatia, which makes earthquakes the strongest in the whole country. It is the only Croatian town that is shown in red on the seismic map, which means that it is exposed to potential hazard of the strongest earthquakes, those of 10 degrees in the Mercalli scale.  Damage  The largest natural disaster in Dubrovnik history happened around 8 in the morning on April 6th, 1667. Survivors of the event witnessed a rumbling sound followed by a tremendous kick that rocked the city. This event is thought to be the biggest one in the history of Dalmatia and practically defines seismic hazard in the coastal area of Croatia. Citizens of the city witnessed huge stones rolling down the hill of Srƒë destroying everything in their way. A powerful tsunami devastated the port, flooding everything near the shore. Large cracks appeared in the land, and the city's water sources dried up. The dust created by the destroyed buildings were thick enough to obscure the sky. Strong winds fueled the fire from homes and bakeries, turning it into the blaze that would not be extinguished for almost 20 days.  Aftermath  The Sponza and the Rector's palace were the only buildings that survived the natural disaster. The city was reconstructed in the baroque style that has survived intact to today. Despite the reconstruction, the decline of the Mediterranean as a hub for trade meant that Dubrovnik, like other Mediterranean ports, began a steady decline. Overall, more than 6,000 people were killed, among whom were the Rector and half of the members of the Great council. The effects of the earthquake also resulted in the loss of half of the nobility population.  Thievery  The earthquake had destroyed almost the entire city and buried around 3000 people. Alongside the fire, one more catastrophe came and made terrible damage to the city ‚Äì robbers. Given that the earthquake killed the Rector and a great part of the government, there was total anarchy. People would cut the ears and jaws from the dead to take their earrings and gold teeth. Everyone was stealing - rich and poor alike.

History of American Bibliographies Charles Evans (1850‚Äì1935), supported by myriad people, wrote the first book on the history of printing and books, from Colonial times to the Federal Era, entitled American Bibliography. Almost 50 years after Evans, Ralph Shaw (1902‚Äì72) and Richard Shoemaker (1907‚Äì70) began to catalogue where Evan left off. This began a regional catalogue that evolved into a national catalogue called the National Union catalogue.  Presidents  In 1988, Ruth Mortimer, then of Smith College, was elected president of the BSA, the first woman to take on the role. She served until 1992.

The population in 2011 was 14,318,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 513.80 km¬≤. The city Estremoz itself had a population of 7,682 in 2001.UMA POPULA√á√ÉO QUE SE URBANIZA, Uma avalia√ß√£o recente - Cidades, 2004 Nuno Pires Soares, Instituto Geogr√°fico Portugu√™s (Geographic Institute of Portugal) It is located in the Alentejo region. History Estremoz, 13th century entrance Central square of Estremoz with a marble pillory in Manueline style (originally from the early 16th century, restored in the 20th century. The region around Estremoz has been inhabited since pre-historic times. There are also vestiges of Roman, Visigoth and Muslim occupation. During the Reconquista, Estremoz was captured in the 12th century by the army of knight Geraldo Sem Pavor (Gerald the Fearless), who had also conquered neighbouring √âvora. However, Estremoz was soon retaken by the Moors and only in the mid-13th century was it reconquered by the Portuguese King Sancho II. An important strategic site between the Kingdoms of Portugal and Castile, Estremoz received a charter (fuero) in 1258 from Afonso III after the Moors were driven out a second time, which promoted Christian colonization in the area. King Dinis rebuilt the castle as a royal palace, further promoting the area. His widow, Dowager Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, died in Estremoz castle on July 4, 1336, shortly after mediating a peace treaty between her son Alfonso IV of Portugal and grandson Alfonso XI of Castile. Her grandson Pedro I of Portugal died in the Franciscan monastery at Estremoz in 1367. During the 1383‚Äì1385 Crisis, Nuno √Ålvares Pereira established his headquarters in Estremoz, then defeated the Castilian forces at the Battle of Atoleiros. During the Portuguese Restoration War (1640‚Äì1668), Portuguese forces (including from Estremoz) defeated the Castilians in the nearby and decisive Battles of Ameixial (1663) and Montes Claros (1665). Geography Administratively, the municipality is divided into 9 civil parishes (freguesias): * Ameixial (Santa Vit√≥ria e S√£o Bento) * Arcos * Estremoz (Santa Maria e Santo Andr√©) * √âvora Monte (Santa Maria) * Gl√≥ria * S√£o Bento do Corti√ßo e Santo Est√™v√£o * S√£o Domingos de Ana Loura * S√£o Louren√ßo de Mamporc√£o e S√£o Bento de Ana Loura * Veiros Economy Marble quarry near Vila Vi√ßosa Together with the two other marble towns, Borba and Vila Vi√ßosa, Estremoz is internationally known for its fine to medium marble that occurs in several colours: white, cream, pink, grey or black and streaks with any combination of these colours. Especially the pink marble (Rosa Aurora and Estremoz Pink) is in high demand.Marble in Portugal This marble has been used since Antiquity as a material for sculpture and architecture. The first exports in Roman times were probably for the construction of the Circus Maximus of Emerita Augusta, in modern-day Spain. The Portuguese navigators exported this marble to Africa, India and Brazil. The marble from this region was used in famed locations such as the Monastery of Jer√≥nimos, the Monastery of Batalha, the Monastery of Alcoba√ßa and the Tower of Bel√©m. There is so much marble around Estremoz that it is used everywhere; even the doorsteps, pavements and the cobble stones are made out of marble. This marble is even converted into whitewash for painting the houses. Portugal is the second largest exporter of marble in the world, surpassed only by Italy (Carrara marble). About 85% of this marble (over 370,000 tons) is produced around Estremoz. In the quarries marble blocks are cut from the rock with a diamond wire saw, a durable steel cable with a series of circular diamond beads. The initial conduit for the wire is made by drilling a horizontal hole and a vertical hole of which the ends meet exactly inside the rock. The wire saw may need a day to cut through the marble. The Estremoz marble has been designated by the International Union of Geological Sciences as a Global Heritage Stone Resource.

The crime may involve stating one's address as a place where s/he never lived, or continuing to use a previous address where one no longer lives as one's own. Laws pertaining to these types of crimes vary by location. In one form of address fraud, the perpetrator uses a former address as their current address to receive mail by deliberately failing to report an address change and using the old address on legal documents. In another form, a person misrepresents a communal mail box at their home as their exclusive address to take advantage of benefits available to others in the home. Motives for address fraud The crime is often associated with identity theft, taking place in about one-third of identity theft cases. Address fraud has been committed by parents attempting to get their children into a public school in a jurisdiction other than where they live. Public school systems generally require that students live in the municipality the school serves, and giving false information to gain admission is a crime. People have used address fraud to vote in a jurisdiction other than their own. A notable example is Ann Coulter, who was investigated for voting in the wrong precinct. Some drivers commit address fraud to take advantage of lenient laws in a jurisdiction they don't live in. For example, a person may not qualify for a driver's license in their own state, but may qualify in another. Most states require that new residents get a state driver's license within a certain time of establishing residency‚Äîfor example, 60 days in Illinois. Not having a local state license is an additional offense in the event of a traffic violation. Some wealthy people set up an official address at a low rent location in a low tax jurisdiction to avoid higher taxes where they actually live. They live most of the time in their true home, but don't pay taxes there. People with bench warrants also use an old address to evade authorities.

The tax credit was signed into law by Gov. Ed Rendell in July 2004. The tax credit for qualifying productions equals a 25% reduction in Personal Income Tax, Corporate Net Income, Capital Stock/Foreign Franchise Tax. However, because most productions filming in Pennsylvania do not incur a tax liability in the state, the credits are fully transferable, which means they can be sold to a company or individual in the state who does have a tax liability. In order to qualify for the tax credit, the production must incur 60% of its total production expenses within Pennsylvania. The credit also applies to individual television shows that are 15 minutes or longer and intended for a national audience. Watchdogs, including the Pennsylvania Common Cause criticized lobbyist Leslie McCombs for failing to properly register as a lobbyist for Lions Gate Entertainment while lobbying on behalf of the tax credit. A 2009 report from the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee in the Pennsylvania General Assembly found that the tax credit supported 4,000 jobs and produced $4.5 million between 2007 and 2008. During the 2009 Pennsylvania budget impasse, the tax credit was in danger of being repealed. Instead, its total amount was reduced from $75 million to $42 million, with that number increasing to $60 million the next year. The tax credit was expanded again during the state budget negotiations in summer 2016. $65 million will be available for fiscal year 2017-18.Gigler, Dan,(July 13, 2016) \\"Pennsylvania Senate Expands Film Tax Credit Program by $5 Million\\", Pittsburgh Post- Gazette.

From 1912 until the outbreak of the First World War, Worthington spent two years working with Edwin Lutyens, whom Worthington found to be inspirational. Worthington fought with distinction as a captain in the Manchester Regiment, and was severely wounded on 1 July 1916 during the offensive on the Somme, but he survived overnight in a shell hole and was rescued the following day.

Career  In 1923, Worthington was appointed Professor of Architecture at the Royal College of Art, resigning in 1928 to return to the family firm of Thomas Worthington & Son. He was awarded an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1929 New Year Honours. That same year he was appointed Slade Lecturer in architecture at Oxford University, and later designed many buildings for the university and its colleges, as well as the internal restoration of the Radcliffe Camera in 1939 and the Bodleian Library in 1955. Following Percy Worthington's death in 1939, Hubert became the principal of the family firm. In 1943, he was appointed by the Imperial War Graves Commission (now, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) as principal architect for Egypt and north Africa, work that involved the selection of sites and the design and supervision of the various cemeteries and memorials to the fallen and missing; among them the Malta Memorial one at Floriana, Malta, to missing airmen. The cemetery at El Alamein, which contains more than 7,000 graves, was designed by Worthington; as was the Heliopolis War Cemetery. His major post-war rebuilding commission was the Inns of Court, London, including initial designs for the Inner Temple Hall and Library, reconstruction of Mitre Court and some restoration in King's Bench Walk, but Worthington's failure to manage the project to the satisfaction of the Benchers led to his dismissal, in the wake of substantial delays and financial mismanagement. The construction and final design of the Inner Temple Hall and Library was, therefore, completed by his assistant T. W. Sutcliffe and by Sir Edward Maufe who was brought in to replace Worthington. Of more personal interest to Worthington was his work on repairing the damage caused to Manchester Cathedral during the Manchester Blitz of 1940, a task that was not completed until 1955. Honours Worthington served as vice- president of the RIBA from 1943‚Äì5 and was a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission from 1945‚Äì1950. He received a knighthood in 1949, was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy in 1945, and an Academician of the Society in 1955.

Longn√º (; Sanskrit: nƒÅgakanyƒÅ; Vietnamese: Long n·ªØ), translated as Dragon Girl, along with Sudhana are considered acolytes of the bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara in Chinese Buddhism. However, there are no scriptural sources connecting both Sudhana and Longn√º to Avalokite≈õvara at the same time. It is suggested that the acolytes are representations of the two major MahƒÅyƒÅna texts, the Lotus S≈´tra and the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra, in which Longn√º and Sudhana appear, respectively. The depiction of Longn√º and Sudhana with Avalokite≈õvara may have been influenced by the Jade Maiden () and Golden Youth () who both appear in the iconography of the Jade Emperor. She is described as being the eight-year-old daughter of the Dragon King (; Sanskrit: nƒÅgarƒÅja) of the East Sea. In the Lotus S≈´tra The dragon king¬¥s daughter presents her priceless jewel to the Buddha; frontispiece of a 12th-century Lotus Sutra handscroll in the \\"Heike Nokyo\\". Longn√º is depicted in the 12th Chapter of the Lotus S≈´tra (Skt. Saddharma Pu·πá·∏çarƒ´ka S≈´tra) as being full of wisdom and achieving instant enlightenment. In the Lotus S≈´tra, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ Bodhisattva speaks of her, saying: > There is the daughter of the nƒÅga king SƒÅgara who is only eight years old. > She is wise; her faculties are sharp; and she also well knows all the > faculties and deeds of sentient beings. She has attained the power of > recollection. She preserves all the profound secret treasures of the > Buddhas, enters deep in meditation, and is well capable of discerning all > dharmas. She instantly produced the thought of enlightenment (Skt. > bodhicitta) and has attained the stage of nonretrogression. She has > unhindered eloquence and thinks of sentient beings with as much compassion > as if they were her own children. Her virtues are perfect. Her thoughts and > explanations are subtle and extensive, merciful, and compassionate. She has > a harmonious mind and has attained enlightenment. However, the Buddha's disciple ≈öƒÅriputra, a Sravaka, does not believe that a woman can attain buddhahood. In response, the nƒÅga maiden offers a pearl to the Buddha, symbolizing her life and ego, and he accepts it. She then instantly transforms into a perfected male bodhisattva, and then attains complete enlightenment. According to Schuster, the Lotus Sutra¬¥s argument \\"is directed against the notion that some bodies (male) are fit for the highest destinies, and other bodies (female) are not.\\" In Chan Buddhism, the story was taken as an example to emphasize the potential of sudden awakening. In folk tales Tale of the Southern Seas A single chapter in the Complete Tale of Avalokite≈õvara and the Southern Seas (), a sixteenth century Ming Dynasty novel is the first text that connects Longn√º and Sudhana together as being acolytes of Avalokite≈õvara. When the Dragon King's third son was out for swim in the sea in the form of a carp, he was captured by a fisherman. Unable to transform into his dragon form due to being trapped on land, he was going to be sold and butchered at the local market. Once Avalokite≈õvara learned of his predicament, she gave Shancai all her money and sent her disciple to buy him from the market and set him free. Because the carp was still alive hours after it was caught, this drew a large crowd and soon a bidding war started due to people believing that eating this fish would grant them immortality. Shancai was easily outbid and begged the fish seller to spare the life of the fish, but to no avail and earning the scorn of the people at the market. It was then that Avalokite≈õvara projected her voice from far away saying, \\"A life should definitely belong to one who tries to save it, not one who tries to take it\\". The crowd realizing their mistake soon dispersed and Shancai was able to bring the carp back to Avalokite≈õvara and return it to the sea. As a token of gratitude, the Dragon King asked Ao Guang to bring the \\"Pearl of Light\\", but his granddaughter volunteers to go in his father's place instead. After offering the pearl to Avalokite≈õvara, she decides to stay with her and become her disciple to learn the Buddhist Dharma. Chinese Customs - Avalokite≈õvara The Precious Scrolls Longn√º depicted as a female bodhisattva in China. Unlike the Complete Tale of Avalokite≈õvara and the Southern Seas which only briefly mentions Longn√º, the Precious Scroll of Sudhana and Longn√º (), an eighteenth-nineteenth century scroll consisting of 29 folios, is completely devoted to the legend of Longn√º and Sudhana and seems to have a Taoist origin. The text is set during the Qianfu period of the Tang Dynasty. One day when Sudhana is walking down a mountain path to visit his father he hears a voice crying out for help. Upon investigation, it turns out to be the voice of a snake trapped in a bottle for the last eighteen years. The snake begs Sudhana to release her, upon which she turn into her true form, that of a monster, and threatens to eat him. When Sudhana protests at the snake's behavior, she makes the argument that than ƒìn (ÊÅ©, a kind act) is repaid by a feud, and that is the way of the world. However, the snake agrees to submit the argument to three judges. The first judge the argument is presented to is the human incarnation of the Golden Water Buffalo Star, who agrees with the snake, given its past experience with humans. The Buffalo Star relates how it never wanted to descend to earth but was pushed out of the gates of heaven by K·π£itigarbha who took pity on the toiling masses. K·π£itigarbha vowed that if the humans did not repay a favor with a favor, his eyes would fall out and drop to the ground. Because of the Buffalo Star's fall to earth, which was face first, it lost all of its upper front teeth. It suffered greatly at the hands of humans; after years of toiling for its master, it was butchered and eaten. Because of this, K·π£itigarbha's eyes did indeed fall out, and transformed into the snails that the buffaloes now trample on when it plows the fields. The second judge they encounter is the Taoist priest Zhuangzi, who also agrees with the snake, citing an experience he had when he resurrected a skeleton who then immediately took Zhuangzi to court and accused him of stealing his money. The last judge they meet is a young girl. The girl tells the snake that it can eat her as well, if the snake could show her how it was able to fit into the bottle which Sudhana had released it from. As soon as the snake worms itself back into the bottle, it is trapped. The girl then reveals herself to be Avalokite≈õvara. When the snake begs for mercy, Avalokite≈õvara tells it that in order to be saved, it must engage itself in religious exercises in the Grotto of the Sounds of the Flood (present day Fayu Temple) on Mount Putuo. Three years later, Sudhana formally becomes an acolyte of Avalokite≈õvara along with the Filial Parrot. After the snake has submitted itself to seven years of austerity, it cleanses itself of its poison and produces a pearl. It then transforms into Longn√º and becomes an acolyte of Avalokite≈õvara.

Life  Parthenope was born in Naples, Italy, and was named after its Greek predecessor, Parthenope. She was the oldest daughter and child of William Nightingale and his wife, Frances Smith. After her parents' three-year tour in Italy, Parthenope and her sister Florence moved to Embley Park, their father's estate in Hampshire, England. Parthenope and her sister were educated at home by a governess, although their father later taught them Greek, Latin, German, French, Italian, history and philosophy. Despite being less scholarly than her sister, Parthenope was fluent in French and developed a love for literature and art. Although at first opposed to her sister becoming a nurse, Parthenope became an active supporter of Florence's work during the Crimean War.  Marriage and career  On 24 June 1858, Parthenope married her sister's rejected suitor, Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, MP for Buckingham, a supporter of liberal causes and possessor of the family seat, Claydon House. After marriage, the new Lady Verney was able to develop her own talents independent of the shadow of her more famous sister; she soon turned Claydon House into a salon for interesting people, and was responsible for extensively remodelling and restoring Claydon House. She preserved and catalogued the family papers, and began scholarly research into the Verney family. She began writing stories and articles for Fraser's Magazine, Cornhill Magazine, and Macmillan's Magazine. She also published five novels; Avenhoe (1867), Stone Edge (1868), Lettice Lisle (1870), Fernyhurst Court (1871), and Llanaly Reefs (1873), and a two-volume book, Peasant Properties and Other Selected Essays. Much of her writing concerned social questions of the day, and ranged from essays on \\"class morality\\" to reporting on \\"the Miseries of War\\", social differences between the poor of other nations, and religion. Later years In later years, the two sisters lived near each other on South Street, London. Parthenope began suffering from arthritis in the 1880s, which despite the employment of a secretary, impeded her writing and resulted in her becoming bedridden. After a long illness with cancer, she died in May 1890 aged 71 at Claydon House. After her death, two collections of her works were published: Essays and Tales and The Grey Pool and Other Stories. Her work on the Verney family papers was completed and published by Margaret Verney as Memoirs of the Verney Family during the Seventeenth Century.

Retrieved on 2011-04-24. Before its proscription it was led by Anjem Choudary. On its website, Islam4UK described itself as having \\"been established by sincere Muslims as a platform to propagate the supreme Islamic ideology within the United Kingdom as a divine alternative to man-made law\\" to \\"convince the British public about the superiority of Islam, thereby changing public opinion in favour of Islam in order to transfer the authority and power to the Muslims in order to implement the Sharia (in Britain)\\".Islam4UK, \\"About Us\\" Activities  On 16 October 2009, members of the organisation protested against the visit to Britain by Dutch MP Geert Wilders. They carried banners with slogans such as \\"Shariah is the solution, freedom go to hell\\" and \\"Geert Wilders deserves Islamic punishment\\".Mirror.co.uk, \\"Protesters greet Dutch far-right MP\\" In January 2010, the group gained widespread media attention by announcing plans to hold a protest march through Wootton Bassett; an English town where unofficial public mourning takes place for corteges of armed forces personnel killed on active service, as they make their way from RAF Lyneham to Oxford. Reports that the group planned to carry empty coffins to \\"represent the thousands of Muslims who have died\\" were denied by the group, although the empty coffins had been proposed by Choudary himself. Choudary said that the event would be peaceful, and that it was not timed to coincide with any mourning processions. The announcement was condemned by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who said that plans for the march were \\"disgusting\\" and that \\"to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be completely inappropriate\\". The Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, indicated he would agree to any request from the Wiltshire Police or local government to ban the march under Section 13 of the Public Order Act 1986. Choudary said he chose Wootton Bassett to attract maximum attention and, he asserted, 500 members of Islam4UK would carry 'symbolic coffins' in memory of the Muslim civilians 'murdered by merciless' coalition forces. The Muslim Council of Britain stated that it \\"condemns the call by...Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett\\", and continues, \\"Like other Britons, Muslims are not opposed to Britain‚Äôs Armed Forces.\\" The Wiltshire Islamic Cultural Centre stated \\"We, along with all other Muslim community groups in Wiltshire and the surrounding area, including Bath Islamic Society and Swindon Thamesdown Islamic Association, unreservedly condemn this march,\\" adding, \\"Therefore we are putting the record straight and letting the media and general public know that the vast majority of Muslims have nothing to do with this group\\", and asking that Wiltshire Police ban the march. They stated that they, along with Call to Islam Centre and Masjid Al- Ghurabah, would counter-demonstrate against \\"Islam4UK/Al-Muhajiroon\\". On 10 January 2010, Islam4UK said it was cancelling its planned march in Wootton Bassett; however, the police had not actually received a request for permission for the march.  Proscription  Islam4UK was listed as an alias of Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect, already proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2004, by an order on 14 January 2010. In announcing the proscription, the then British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said: \\"It is already proscribed under two other names ‚Äì Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect\\". In the January 2010 order and a November 2011 order, the names Al Muhajiroun, Call to Submission, Islamic Path, London School of Sharia and Muslims Against Crusades were also listed as aliases. In June 2014, Need4Khilafah, the Shariah Project and the Islamic Dawah Association were added to the list. Note that the order is not needed to establish an alias as identical to another name of a proscribed organization, it is enough that the two are to all intents and purposes the same, and that the individual prosecuted has performed a proscribed act. Islam4UK issued a statement saying, \\"Today's ban is another nail in the coffin of capitalism and another sign of the revival of Islam and Muslims.\\" They restated their goal: \\"Therefore, we will one day liberate our land from occupation and implement the Shariah not just in Muslim countries but also right here in Great Britain. This is something that we believe in, live by and hope that in our lifetime we will witness\\". In a further statement, issued on the same day via their website, they stated that \\"Islam4UK has been contacted by authorities to (force) shut down its operations, we stress this domain name will no longer be used by us, but the struggle for Khilafah (aka \\"the Caliphate\\") will continue regardless of what the disbelievers plot against the Muslims.

Early life Donald Lewis Kaufman was born on 8 October 1930, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to Harry and Ruth Klein Kaufman. His father and uncle had previously started Kaufman Brothers, a wholesale candy store, in 1922. Kaufman was educated at the North Adams State College. He then did national service in the Army in the early 1950s. Afterwards he joined Kaufman Brothers. KB Toys Kaufman Brothers became a toy retailer in the 1970s, with the name Kay-Bee Toy & Hobby, later known as KB Toys. Kaufman served as vice president of the company and helped to expand the chain to shopping malls in nearly every U.S. state. Kaufman retired from his position as vice president in 1981. Personal life Kaufman married Faith Dichter and they had three daughters. The marriage was eventually dissolved. He then married Sally Golden, who had two children from her previous marriage. Throughout his adult life he spent vacations touring toy fairs in the Northeast and in Europe and amassed a huge collection of antique toy cars and trucks. The collection Kaufman's important collection of antique toys included his first item, International Harvester Red Baby truck, purchased for $4 from a collector friend in 1950. The collection also included a working 1912 M√§rklin live-steam fire engine and he had more than 700 cars and trucks arranged on shelves in a four-level annex to his property. Other larger items included 40 pedal and oversized pressed-steel cars. The total size of the collection was estimated at 7,000 items, which he amassed with the help of his wife, Sally. \\"It was a team effort...It was one of my lifelong pleasures but when she came into my life 20-some years ago she partnered in it and enjoyed what we did just as much as I did. I couldn't have done this without her.\\" In March 2009, about a fifth of his collection had been sold at auction by Bertoia Auctions for $4.2 million. In September a further 1,100 toys brought in an estimated $3 million. At the time of the first sale, Jeanne Bertoia stated it would take a series of 4-6 sales to sell the entire collection. Kaufman said, \\"It's time for me to sell.\\" Death Kaufman died in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on October 12, 2009 from a heart attack.

Kirchheimer worked as a research analyst at the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA, starting in World War II and continuing to 1952. Biography Kirchheimer attended school in Heilbronn and Heidelberg from 1912 to 1924. He then studied law and sociology in Munich, Cologne, Berlin and Bonn. In 1928 he completed his studies with a doctorate (Dr. jur., magna cum laude) from the University of Bonn for a thesis titled Zur Staatslehre des Sozialismus und Bolschewismus (On the State Theory of Socialism and Bolshevism). His doctoral advisor was Carl Schmitt. Kirchheimer was considered his \\"favourite student\\". From 1930 to 1933, Kirchheimer was an employee of the social democratic journal Die Gesellschaft and lecturer in political science. From 1932 to 1933 he also worked as a lawyer in Berlin. Kirchheimer had already in his youth tendency to socialism. Later he became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. During the Weimar Republic, the young Kirchheimer came to prominence with sensational analyses of the relationship between social structures and constitution. His essay from 1930 Weimar und was dann? Entstehung und Gegenwart der Weimarer Verfassung (Weimar and then what? Origin and present of the Weimar Constitution), in which Kirchheimer described the Weimar Constitution as an unsustainable foundation of the state, was widely discussed. Kirchheimer was together with Ernst Fraenkel and Franz Leopold Neumann close to Carl Schmitt. In 1932 Kirchheimer published an essay entitled Legalit√§t und Legitimit√§t (Legality and Legitimacy) in the socialist journal Die Gesellschaft (Die Gesellschaft, Band 2, Heft 7, 1932). Carl Schmitt adopted this title for a famous essay of the same name. He explicitly referred to Kirchheimer. Schmitt had also repeatedly quoted him elsewhere. After the Nazi seized power in 1933, Kirchheimer emigrated to Paris. Here he worked for four years as a researcher in the as well emigrated Institute for Social Research. He began working with Georg Rusche on Sozialstruktur und Strafvollzug (Punishment and Social Structure). The Rusche-Kirchheimer version of Punishment and Social Structure was published in 1939 as the first English-language publication of the Institute. In the meantime Kirchheimer had broken off contact with his teacher and mentor Carl Schmitt, who had risen to become the \\"crown lawyer of the Third Reich\\". On 11 November 1937 Kirchheimer emigrated to the United States with his wife Hilde Kirchheimer and his daughter Hanna (born in 1930). However, the marriage was divorced there in 1941. In New York, Kirchheimer continued form 1937 to 1942 his work for the Institute of Social Research as a research assistant in law and social sciences. At the same time, he was a lecturer at Columbia University. In 1943 Kirchheimer moved with his second wife, Anne Rosenthal, to Washington, D.C., where their son Peter was born in 1945. He initially worked part-time for a year (1943 to 1944), then full-time from 1944 to 1952 as a research analyst in the Research and Analysis Branch of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA. His intelligence reports were later republished in Secret Reports on Nazi Germany: The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort. On 16 November 1943 Kirchheimer received American citizenship. He was a visiting lecturer in sociology at Wellesley College (1943). He also worked as a lecturer at the American University (1951 to 1952) and at Howard University (1952 to 1954). From 1952 to 1956 Otto Kirchheimer was head of the Central Europe Section in the State Department. Kirchheimer left the OSS and accepted a visiting professorship at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research (1954). The next year he became full professor of Political Science there (until 1961). Here he wrote his book Political Justice. The Use of Legal Procedures for Political Ends, which was completed in 1961. From 1960 to 1965 Kirchheimer was Professor of Political Science at Columbia University. From 1961 to 1962 he was also Fulbright Professor at the University of Freiburg. On 22 November 1965 Kirchheimer died of a heart attack while trying to board a plane at Dulles Airport. He was buried at the Jewish cemetery in Heilbronn on January 18, 1966. Research Kirchheimer's multifaceted academic work reflects in an almost unique way the political and scientific experiences and conflicts of the Weimar Republic, National Socialism, French and American exile, and the founding and establishment phase of the two new German states that emerged after 1945. Kirchheimer's contributions mostly arose out of concrete events, which, however, do not remain thematically isolated but contain elements of a comprehensive theory of modern statehood, democracy, the rule of law, modern administration and intermediary organizations. Kirchheimer began his publishing activities as a young socialist during the Weimar Republic. The focus of his work was the relationship between the constitution and social structure, as well as the analysis of social power relations and their impact on constitutional law. Using various examples, he examined the tension between political \\"legal order\\" and economic \\"power order\\". Kirchheimer shared with Carl Schmitt the rejection of parliamentarism and the criticism of pluralism. Kirchheimer is therefore also attributed to \\"left-wing Schmittianism\\". For Kirchheimer and Schmitt, a parliamentary consensus in the class state was in principle impossible. For both, the majority system was bound to the precondition of homogeneity, because otherwise it was not the parliament that decided on politics, but economic power complexes. Kirchheimer regarded the Weimar Constitution only as an outdated legal mechanism that would inevitably have to fail due to the real balance of power. After the National Socialists seized power, the focus of Kirchheimer's work shifted to the analysis of \\"German fascism\\". In doing so, Kirchheimer expressly opposed the thesis of the Doppelstaat (dual state), which his comrade-in-arms from the Weimar days, Ernst Fraenkel, had put forward. He also opposed the view of the Frankfurt School, according to which the National Socialist had transformed monopoly capitalism into state capitalism. Similar to Franz Neumann's Behemoth. Struktur und Praxis des Nationalsozialismus 1933‚Äì1944 Kirchheimer claimed politics is determined by the power struggle between different power groups. As with Neumann, Kirchheimer too asserted there can be no structurally unified state authority under National Socialism; the Third Reich thus appeared as a \\"non-state\\". According to Kirchheimer - again in Schmittian thinking - the social groups take possession of the state and its functions, which they divide among themselves. This would result in a coexistence and opposition of different power complexes, in which the question of binding decision-making authority would remain open. He is father of the concept of a \\"catch-all party (Allerweltspartei)\\". Otto Kirchheimer's conception of the catch-all party was part of his more comprehensive theory of party transformation, encompassing four interrelated political processes. By tracing the development of the catch-all thesis and placing it within the wider context of Kirchheimer's complete work, it is possible to reconstruct a more precise understanding of what Kirchheimer meant by the catch-all concept, which itself remains highly contested. Kirchheimer's anxiety about modern democracy originated with what he saw as the vanishing of principled opposition within parliament and society, and the reduction of politics to the mere management of the state. This leads to collusion of political parties and the state, severing of the societal links of party organisations, and erosion of the classic separation of powers. Vanishing opposition, cartelisation and professionalisation of politics pits citizens against a powerful state, which increases political cynicism and apathy. Kirchheimer's comprehensive approach remains relevant to much of the contemporary debate about the transformation of Western political systems. The German Research Fund (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) is funding the research and editorial work for an edition in five volumes of the Gesammelte Schriften (Collected Writings) of Otto Kirchheimer. The project began in late 2015 at Greifswald University and is scheduled to take about five years.  Works  * Punishment and Social Structure (1939) (with Georg Rusche). * Political Justice.

His last name was legally changed after his parents' divorce. His work in military electronics, communications, and spectroscopy culminated in medical electronics and x-ray products with the founding of the company Bio-Imaging Research. Early life After attending schools in Scottsville, Virginia and High Mowing School in Wilton, New Hampshire, Moore received a B.S. in nuclear physics from MIT in three years (where he and Walter Marvin Jr. founded the Tech Model Railroad Club in 1946), and won a National Science Foundation fellowship that led to an M.S. in solid-state physics from Harvard's School of Applied Science. Professional career His first full-time employment was at Raytheon in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he worked on radar and telemetry. At Hycon Eastern (Cambridge, Massachusetts; later acquired by Northrop), he moved from classified missile technology to become Systems Manager of a communications design office in Bangkok, Thailand. On his return, he again worked in aircraft and missile telemetry as Director of Research and Engineering at ASCOP (Princeton, New Jersey; later a division of EMR/Schlumberger). In 1960, he joined Lockheed Electronics in Plainfield, New Jersey, where he advanced from Manager of Operations Analysis to Scientific Advisor to the President, while contributing to \\"moon-bounce\\" communication systems and optical signal processors, and creating an infrared laboratory and corporate acquisition analysis. While there, he was appointed to the Lockheed Corporate Research Council, and also attended Columbia University in New York half-time. For the latter, his Ph.D. thesis proved experimentally that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Venus has enough greenhouse effect to warm its surface to the spacecraft-observed temperature of over 460 ¬∞C (860 ¬∞F). After receiving his doctorate, Moore created new designs in spectroscopy and fluorometry as Director of Product Development at Spex Industries in Metuchen, New Jersey. In 1976 he joined EMI Medical, the inventor of X-ray CT scanning, in Northbrook, Illinois. There, he advanced to Vice-President of Engineering, and built the team that created the first CT scanner to take a picture in under 3 seconds. When EMI got out of the medical electronics business, he founded Bio-Imaging Research (Lincolnshire, Illinois). Initially, BIR created the world's first one-second CT scanner for Toshiba, and then branched into MRI, ultrasound, and industrial x-ray scanners, including the megavolt x-ray systems that inspect trucks and cargo containers at ports and border crossings. He was awarded the Chicago Area High-Tech Entrepreneur of the Year in 1987 and 1989. In 2006, he sold BIR's medical division to Toshiba Medical, and in 2007 sold its industrial and security divisions to Varian Medical Systems. Moore served on several standards committees for medical imaging, and was Chairman of the Surface Weapons Board of the U.S. Naval Research Advisory Committee. He has published and presented numerous papers, including before the World Health Organization in Geneva. He retired after 27 years on the board of TC Manufacturing, and consulted in medical and radiation physics until passing away in 2018. Personal life He had five children (Robin [deceased], Sheila, Marjorie, Deborah [deceased], and Laurel) by his first marriage in 1948 to Joan Elizabeth Sanders (1928‚Äì1998), and two children (Jonathan Moore and Cris Moore) by his second marriage in 1963 to Betty-Ann Jorgensen (1938- ).

Development  The IS-2 Mucha (Mucha ‚Äì Fly) was designed to provide an intermediate solo trainer for the revived Polish gliding movement after World War II, along with the IS-1 Sƒôp advanced soaring and competition aircraft, IS-3 ABC primary trainer and IS-A Salamandra basic trainer. The Mucha and its developments gave the majority of Polish pilots the experience they required to get the best out of their gliders. Construction was all-wood with plywood skinning for loaded areas and fabric covering for lightly loaded areas such as control surfaces and the wings aft of the main spars. The undercarriage consisted of a semi-recessed mainwheel and small skids under the nose and tail. The cockpit, covered by a built-up plexi-glas canopy was directly forward of the wing leading edge. Control surfaces were of standard wood and fabric construction with the ailerons fitted with external mass balances. The first flight of the first prototype, (SP-561), took place at Bielsko on 24 April 1948, piloted by Ing. Peter Mynarskiego. Only relatively minor problems required rectification with changes to the instruments, airbrake actuation mechanism, improvements in cockpit sealing to reduce draughts and softer front skid damping rubber. Despite its training role the IS-2 had a reasonable performance and held two world records, as well as giving pilots a glider capable of FAI Diamond badge flights, and gain experience of cloud flying. Record flights included:- *Andrzej Ziemia≈Ñski (1953r.) - Straight distance, 615 km. *Jan Gawƒôckiego (1957) ‚Äì Straight distance, 637 km. *Rudolf Kopernok ‚Äì Out and return, 500 km (Katowice -Leszno-Katowice). Production of the IS-2 started with the IS-2 Mucha bis of which 20 were built, and continued with the IS-2 Mucha ter, of which 116 were built. Later variants with much improved features include the SZD-12 Mucha 100 and the SZD-22 Mucha Standard, as well as the SZD-7 Osa which incorporated an experimental laminar flow wing with a 'Mucha ter' fuselage for research purposes.  Variants  * IS-2 Mucha ‚Äì the prototype Mucha (regn. no. SP-561) * IS-2 Mucha-bis ‚Äì the first production model starting with SP-887, first flown on 21 May 1949, 20 built. * IS-2 Mucha-ter ‚Äì the second production model starting with SP-1046, first flown on 10 July 1950, 116 built. * SZD-7 Osa - The SZD-7 Osa was based on the IS-2 Mucha, with a laminar flow aerofoil section developed by T. Tadeus Kosti. Little information on laminar flow aerofoils was available but Kosti was able to design the aerofoil for the SZD-7 Osa to achieve laminar flow to at least 18% chord. As well as the laminar flow wings the 'Osa' introduced the SZD plate style airbrakes, which were installed aft of the mainspar. The first flight of the 'Osa' took place at Bielsko airfield piloted by Adam Zientek. Specifications (IS-2 Mucha) See also References *Taylor, J. H. (ed) (1989) Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation.

Motivation  The goal of the EPTS is development of shared understanding of event processing terminology. The society believes that through communicating the shared understanding developed within the group it would become a catalyst for emergence of effective interoperation standards, would foster academic research, and creation of training curriculum. In turn it would lead to establishment of event processing as a discipline in its own right. The society is trying to follow example of the Database technology when relational theory provided theoretical foundation and homogenized the technology through introduction of Structured Query Language (SQL). The EPTS members hope that through combination of academic research, vendor experience and customer data they will be able develop a unified glossary, language, and architecture that would homogenize Event Processing in the similar way.  Organization  The EPTS is organized into several working groups.  Use Case Working Group  The Use Case WG collects and documents variety of usage scenarios of event processing in broad spectrum of applications. in order to classify such applications; The group has already collected use cases from Enterprise Information Technology Management, Fraud Detection, Business Process Management, Health Care, and Stock Trading. They have also created a comprehensive questionnaire to capture various facets of use cases. This data is used as input by the Architecture working group  Architecture and Meta-Model Working Group  The Architecture WG attempts to build a reference architecture for event processing. Since 2009 the meta-model working group has been merged with the reference architecture working group. The Meta Model WG serves as a liaison to a number of standards bodies. Members of this group are usually members of standards organizations such as OASIS, W3C, RuleML, OMG, DMTF and others - see the Event Processing standards reference model., (presentation) The first version of the EPTS reference architecture is published.Adrian Paschke, Paul Vincent, Alexandre Alves, Catherine Moxey: Tutorial on advanced design patterns in event processing.

ACM, Cambridge, UK, 2010. (presentation)  Language Analysis Working Group  The Language Analysis WG is collecting and organizing examples of various event processing languages used in industry and research in order to extract the language dimensions.  Interoperability Working Group  The Interoperability WG is studying requirements for interoperability. Its goal is to get to a set of agreed mechanisms that would allow interoperability between event processing systems produced by different vendors.  Glossary Working Group  The Glossary WG is developing a glossary of terms for Event Processing. The first version of the glossaryEvent Processing Technical Society, Editors: D. Luckham, R. Schulte, Event Processing Glossary - Version 1.1, July 2008 is already published. The glossary working group was led and its output was edited by Roy Schulte and David Luckham.  History  The society started as an informal group in 2005/2006. It was formally launched as a consortium in June 2008. Membership of the consortium is based on a formal agreement defining IP ownership terms and rules of engagement. The society is governed by a steering committee consisting of founding members of the organization, representatives of major vendors and scientists. It is partner of the major scientific event processing conference: Distributed Event Based Systems (DEBS), the major scientific rules conference: International Web Rule Symposium (RuleML) and also launched two Dagstuhl seminars on event processing, one in May 2007, and the second was held in May 2010. The event processing community is still active, but the EPTS seems to be in a passive state at the moment. At least the website of the society is not active any more since mid of 2014.

Description N. floridana is the largest watersnake in North America. Fully grown it will typically reach in total length (including tail), with the record-sized specimen having measured in total length.\\"Nerodia floridana \\". University of Florida Its coloration is solid grey or greenish- brownish with a white or yellow belly in adults, which darkens in color under the tail. Encircling the lower half of the eye is a row of scales, which is separate from the upper lip scales. Among all southeastern (U.S.) snakes, only the western green water snake has these features. Juveniles have typically, about 50 dark crossbars down the dorsum and on the sides, which fade gradually with age.South Carolina Department of Natural Resources: Florida green watersnake Natural Habitat N. floridana 's distribution is generally throughout Florida and in parts of southern Georgia. It is commonly found in southern South Carolina in open, marshy wetland areas. The snake is rarely found in rivers or streams. N. floridana prefers choked vegetation and calm waters such as swamps and marshes. It is also generally found in lakes, ponds, ditches, and occasionally in brackish water. Behavior and diet In southern Florida, N. floridana is active year round. Like other water snakes of the southeastern U.S., N. floridana hibernates during the winter in the northern, coldest parts of its range. In colder areas and months, the snake can be seen basking outdoors on sunny days. In southern Florida, it often travels overland on rainy days. Little is known about the diet of the N. floridana. Most reports suggest that their diet consists primarily of fish, including sunfish, crappies, and small bass. They also feed on frogs, especially pig frogs, tadpoles and salamander. Little is known about their methods for finding prey, but like other water snakes, the N. floridana swallows its prey alive. Reproduction This species bears live young (ovoviviparous) like other North American water snakes. A few observations have been made of matings in late winter or early spring. Females generally have very large litters and give birth in the summer. The size of the litter ranges from 20 to 40, and the young are typically born from June to September. The record litter for the species was 132 babies, taken from a dead female. Predators and defense Because of the huge litters of the N. floridana, most juveniles never reach adulthood. Common predators in its wetland habitat include river otters, hawks, herons, egrets, ospreys, turtles, kingsnakes, alligators, and several varieties of predatory fish. The snake's first impulse when threatened is to escape, and will then resort to biting or releasing a strong musk from its scent glands, if captured.

The film was produced by Ibanez for Azteca Films. The film was released as La muerte viviente in the United States as a Spanish-language film. It was later dubbed in English but received little theatrical distribution, and was then released for television. The film is also known as Cult of the Dead (in Hungary) and Snake People (in the United Kingdom). Plot synopsis Captain Labesch (Rafael Bertrand) arrives at a remote island, determined to crack down on the island's lawlessness, spurred by the voodoo rites practiced by the evil priest Damballah (Boris Karloff). Labesch starts with local tycoon Carl van Molder and his study of the island. Van Molder warns Labesch not to interfere with the local populace. Annabella (Julissa), van Molder's visiting niece, is a temperance crusader who wants her uncle to help fund the International Anti-Saloon League. She falls in love with handsome police lieutenant Andrew Wilhelm (Carlos East), despite his fondness for rum. Meanwhile, beautiful native girls are being transformed into zombies, and a sinister snake dancer named Kalea (Yolanda Montes) leads them to attack and devour any meddling policemen who get too close to their unholy rituals. In a dream, Annabella wakes up in a coffin. Another woman who looks like her is in a second coffin with a snake. The lookalike pursues and then kisses her. When Annabella is kidnapped and prepared to be the cult's latest human sacrifice, Labesch and Wilhelm have to infiltrate their ranks to save her, and they finally learn the secret identity of the all-powerful Damballah.

With Karloff signed, Vergara obtained financing for the four films from Columbia Pictures, which would then distribute them. Karloff received $100,000 per film. Karloff initially rejected the scripts for all of the films, but agreed to them after they were rewritten by Jack Hill. Filming was planned to take place in Mexico, but Karloff's emphysema prevented him from working at that altitude. Karloff's scenes in all four films were directed by Jack Hill at the Dored Studios in Los Angeles in the spring of 1968. Between shots, Karloff rested in a wheelchair. The films were then completed in Mexico at Studios America Mexico. Some additional scenes involving the van Molder character were filmed using a Karloff stand-in named Jerry Petty. Due to the unexpected death of Vergara, the release of the film was held up to determine ownership rights of inheritance under Mexican law. All four films in the package deal were released after Karloff's death in 1969. Reception The four Azteca Films productions for which Karloff shot his scenes in Los Angeles were released by Columbia Pictures over a two-year period after he had died in 1969. They were dismissed, by critics and Karloff fans alike, as undistinguished efforts. This film, when released, also appeared to be dated and inferior as between its filming and release, another zombie film, Night of the Living Dead (1968), had raised the standards for the genre. Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle said, \\"Though sometimes strange to the point of psychedelic, this tame offering consists of interminable scenes of native rites, women trying to look seductively evil, and shots of snakes.\\" See also * List of American films of 1971 * Boris Karloff filmography References External links  * Category:1971 films Category:1971 horror films Category:Mexican films Category:Mexican horror films Category:Films about zombies Category:Voodoo in fiction Category:Columbia Pictures films ","title":"Isle of the Snake People"},{"id":"24737200","text":"Mystery House was a radio drama series which began broadcasting on NBC in 1929.

But could this really succeed as a business model? Would people buy a mystery book if they already knew the ending? An interesting question, considering how little information there is available about the firm -- or if, in fact, it even existed. Research into this query turned up an address for \\"Mystery House\\" at 70 Park Avenue in New York City, where a hotel now stands, and that the publishing firm ceased operation sometime after 1964.

After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Fleet Air Arm aircraft flew from the aircraft carriers and to attack merchant vessels in the northern Norwegian port of Kirkenes and the north Finnish port of Liinakhamari in Petsamo. The War Cabinet and Admiralty pressed Admiral John \\"Jack\\" Tovey, commander of the Home Fleet, to attack, despite his reservations, that the prospects for success were not commensurate with the risks. The operation was intended to be a surprise but in the far north, the midnight sun at that time of year made it unlikely that the raiding force would go undiscovered. A German aircraft passed Force P and the carrier aircraft flew over a ship on their flights to Kirkenes and Petsamo, depriving the attackers of surprise. The Kirkenes force was intercepted by several German fighters as the aircraft attacked the few ships to be seen in the harbour, sinking one ship and setting another on fire. Eleven Fairey Albacores and two Fairey Fulmar fighters were shot down, for a loss of two aircraft. The force attacking Petsamo faced less opposition, losing a Fulmar to engine failure on the flight to the target and a Fulmar and an Albacore shot down during the attack. Minor damage was caused to jetties, a shipyard and oil storage tanks. The operation has been called an \\"unqualified disaster\\"; twelve Albacores and four Fulmars had been lost with nine men killed and 27 taken prisoner for no appreciable result; two Fulmar crewmen reached Russian territory after two days at sea in a dinghy. Background Continuation War In early September 1940, Germany and Finland promulgated a transit agreement for members of the to travel through Finland to Kirkenes in north Norway, despite a similar agreement being in force with Sweden from April 1940. In Directive 21, the instructions from Hitler for Operation Barbarossa, Murmansk was to be isolated by a military operation to cut the Murmansk‚ÄìLeningrad railway. The attack was to prevent the Red Army from moving forces from the interior and attacking iron ore mines in northern Sweden and nickel mines around Pechenga, only from Murmansk; the base at Kirkenes was only another further on. reconnaissance revealed a considerable garrison at Murmansk and excellent rail marshalling yards and port facilities. On 3 February 1941, the German Army of Norway received its operation order for the coming campaign, making the defence of northern Norway its priority. (Mountain Corps Norway) was to operate in Finland in defence of Pechenga in Operation Rentier until Finland declared war. The Finns were to cover the deployment of German troops in central Finland and to recapture Hanko, then operate to the south-west, either side of Lake Ladoga, when Army Group North had reached the Dvina River, meeting the German forces at Tikhvin. The German invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941 and the German offensive against the Murmansk railway Operation Platinum Fox (29 June ‚Äì 21 September) began, part of the larger Operation Silver Fox (29 June ‚Äì 17 November). Prelude Naval operations The German submarines U-81 and U-652 began operations off the Kola Inlet in July and five destroyers transferred to Kirkenes to join the training ship Bremse and other vessels. Before the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Home Fleet was mainly concerned with the exits of the North Sea from Norway to Greenland. After 22 June 1941, the emphasis of the Home Fleet began to shift northwards, from Norway to the Arctic. The Soviet leadership pressed the British to attack Axis sea traffic from Petsamo and Kirkenes. The governments in London and Washington were aware of the importance of Murmansk as a entrep√¥t for Allied war material. The Admiralty pressed Admiral John \\"Jack\\" Tovey to use the aircraft carriers and in operations against Axis shipping off northern Norway and Finland. Tovey stressed the risk in operating carriers so close to airfields, in conditions of the midnight sun, which in northern Norway lasts from about 14 May to 29 July. The Admiralty over-ruled Tovey and ordered him to conduct Operation EF with Force P. Force P Furious embarked Fairey Fulmar fighters of 800 Naval Air Squadron (800 NAS) and four Sea Hurricanes (A Flight) nine Swordfish of 812 NAS and nine Fairey Albacores of 817 NAS. Victorious had the Albacores of 827 and 828 NAS and the Fulmars of 809 NAS. Rear-Admiral Frederic Wake- Walker in sailed from Scapa Flow on 23 July with Force P, the two carriers, and the destroyers , , , , and . The force reached Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur (Seidis Fjord) in Iceland on 25 July, refuelled and sailed the following day for Norway. Achates struck a British mine off Iceland on 25 July and lost its bow, having to be towed home by Anthony. The destroyers were replaced by and . Little opposition from the was expected, despite the intensity of German ground operations in the direction of Murmansk and the Fulmars were expected to provide adequate air cover during the attack. The aircrew on Victorious were briefed to attack Kirkenes and those on Furious to raid Petsamo. Should the harbours be empty, the force from Victorious would attack an iron ore plant and those from Furious some oil storage tanks. During the night of Force P made course for its rendezvous, about north-east of Kirkenes and arrived three days later, dangerously within range of land-based aircraft, dependent on their fighter cover and anti-aircraft guns as the cloudy weather gave way to clear skies, increasing the risk of discovery. Just before the aircraft began to take off, a He 111 aircraft was seen, foiling the attempt at surprise. The three Albacore and one Swordfish squadrons took off first and the Fulmars followed after twenty minutes, the Sea Hurricanes remaining to guard the ships. Attack Kirkenes Victorious sent two sub-flights, consisting of twelve Albacores from 827 NAS, eight from 828 NAS and nine Fulmars from 809 NAS. The crews of 827 NAS were to attack ships around the Tower of Kirkenes and Langfjord as the eight from 828 NAS concentrated on Holmengraafjord and an anchorage east of Renoy Island. The aircraft flew towards the sun at low altitude to evade radar but passed over a German hospital ship, losing any remaining hope of surprise. The aircraft climbed to over the coastal mountains, being engaged by anti-aircraft fire as they did. The crews fired the colours-of-the-day as a ruse but this failed and the ground fire increased and then suddenly stopped. Thirteen Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters appeared, escorting nine Ju 87 () dive-bombers from a raid. The shipping in the harbour turned out to be a training ship and two medium-sized freighters which were attacked, bomb hits on the two merchantmen being claimed after the raid. The Fulmar escorts tried to divert the German fighters from the Albacores and shot down a Bf 110 for the loss of two Fulmars. The Albacores released their torpedoes quickly to get away from anti- aircraft fire, sinking one vessel, setting another on fire and causing minor damage ashore. The Albacores tried to escape the German fighters, having the advantage of superior manoeuvrability but eleven were picked off. An 827 Squadron pilot claimed a Ju 87 which flew in front of his Albacore, which was borne out later by German records. Incomplete German loss records confirm the loss of at least one Bf 110 to a Fulmar and one Ju 87 to an Albacore.Nordic Aviation During WW2 Petsamo Furious sent nine Swordfish of 812 NAS and nine Albacores of 817 NAS to raid Petsamo. A Fulmar was lost due to engine failure prior to the attack and the remainder found a harbour almost deserted, except for anti-aircraft guns. The aircraft dropped their torpedoes against a small ship and the jetties but these were wooden and easy to replace. The 800 NAS Fulmar bombers attacked a shipyard and the oil storage tanks but had little effect. The attackers were intercepted by Bf 109 fighters; an Albacore and a Fulmar were shot down. Aftermath Analysis By the early evening, the surviving aircraft had landed on their carriers and Force P had begun the voyage back to Scapa Flow. On 31 July a Dornier Do 18 began to shadow the force until two of the Sea Hurricanes shot it down. The commander of Furious called the raid In 2005, Ron Mackay called the raid an \\"unqualified disaster\\"; twelve Albacores and four Fulmars had been lost with nine men killed and 27 taken prisoner. The vulnerability of the Albacore and Fulmar aircraft against modern fighters had been demonstrated but the Swordfish of 812 NAS had escaped loss, perhaps because the raid on Petsamo had encountered less opposition than that on Kirkenes. Mackay wrote that it would have been better to send the Sea Hurricanes to cover the raid, despite hindsight suggesting that four Sea Hurricanes were hardly adequate to defend the ships. Casualties In 2005, Ron Mackay wrote that twelve Albacores and four Fulmars had been lost with nine men killed, 27 taken prisoner and two men rescued by Soviet forces after two days at sea in a dinghy. In 2012, Ben Jones wrote that 16 aircraft were lost in the raids and in 2014, Martyn Chorlton wrote that Victorious lost 13 Albacores and their crews in the raid. Subsequent operations The Albacore squadrons were transferred from Victorious during August and replaced by 817 and 832 NAS. Victorious became part of Force M, operating towards Bear Island and the approaches to the White Sea, during Operation Dervish. On 3 September, an attack on ships sailing from Troms√∏ to Kirkenes began but when cloud cover dissipated, the formation leaders aborted the attack according to their instructions, because of the risk of interception by the fighters based at Banak. Force M remained off the Norwegian coast and on 12 September an attack was made on ships and shore installations at Bod√∏, one ship being sunk and an aluminium factory at Glomfjord being damaged. The lack of fighter opposition led to a second raid being planned but this was cancelled when the force was spotted by a He 111. Victorious was carrying two Grumman Martlet fighters borrowed from , which caught up with the German bomber and shot it down. Two Blohm & Voss BV 138 flying boats began to shadow the force and the FAA Fulmars found it impossible to penetrate their armour with .303 Browning machine-gun fire. A raid on 9 October was hampered by heavy seas and five of the 13 Albacores on deck were damaged; three Albacores managed to find and attack a freighter. During the afternoon, eight composite crews from 817 and 832 NAS attacked two merchantmen which were escorted by flak ships and achieved several bomb hits, one ship crew taking to their lifeboats.

The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The structure's shell has been preserved as monument after a disastrous fire. Architecture The church was originally built 1843-1846 in the simple monumental tradition of the Greek Revival style, with a gray stone facade of a series of arched bays on the exterior facade. The simple church was enlarged in 1849 into a cruciform plan that could seat a thousand parishioners. The interior was remodeled in 1895.

History St. Joseph's served as the mother church for the German Catholic churches in the region. Many of these satellite churches and schools lured away parishioners and students, causing building replacements to the complex and finally closure and sale in the 1970s. The church suffered a serious fire in October 1974. See also: The fire destroyed the church, except for the tower and walls, forcing the parish to abandon the ruin. The Landmark Society of Western New York, the State University College at Brockport, city officials, members of the Downtown Development Corporation, and the original Roman Catholic religious order all supported preserving the bell tower and three extant bays (front facade) as a monument encased in a park, named St. Joseph's Park.

Twin town  * Mutzig, Bas-Rhin, France  History  Almeida, Portugal In and around the environment of Almeida, evidence of Human occupation can be found back to the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Evidence has also been found of Roman occupation followed by the Suevi and the Visigoths. The first fortification constructed in the settlement were constructed by the Muslims who occupied the village until Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula. It was during this time that the current name was first used, in the form of the Arabic al-Ma'ida ('the plateau').  Sancho I, The Populator  The village of Almeida was captured from the Moors by the second king of Portugal, Sancho I in the 12th century because of its strategic position on the new country of Portugal's border with Spain. So important to the security of the country, Sancho had the village heavily fortified. The castle was refortified on three further occasions by King Dinis, King Manuel I and by King Jo√£o VI. The present 12 pointed star fortification was constructed in 1641 to a Vaubanesque plan on which the French military engineer is believed to have personally worked, during the castle's final stages of completion.  Spanish occupation  During the Seven Years' War (1754 to 1763) which involved most of the great powers of Europe, Spain with the help of France launched an attack on Portugal due to its alliance with Great Britain.

Its editorial position is satirical and conservative. According to figures provided by the paper's management, it had a circulation of 40,000 copies a week in 2006. Its headquarters is in Paris.  History   First decade  In 1962, Minute was created by Jean- Fran√ßois Devay, former director of L'Aurore. In its early years, Minute included a large number of articles devoted to show-biz and humorous cartoons. The paper's politics rapidly hardened, particularly following the end of the Algerian War. It became less and less devoted to show-biz news, and became a political newspaper regarded as right-wing but supporting no particular party. During its heyday (250,000 copies sold per week 1962-1981) the editorial staff were invited to participate every Sunday in Club de la presse, a television and radio show about politics. The tone was very critical of Charles de Gaulle, and the paper had many readers among those disaffected with the Algerian War. Pieces by Fran√ßois Brigneau, who joined the paper in 1963, were noted for their biting anti-Gaullist prose. In 1965 the paper contributed to breaking news of the Ben Barka affair. The list of shareholder-benefactors of the paper included such names as Fernand Raynaud, Fran√ßoise Sagan, Juliette Gr√©co (despite being left-wing and a supporter of Fran√ßois Mitterrand), Eddie Barclay and Marcel Dassault. Devay died of cancer in 1971. He was replaced as head of publishing by Jean Boizeau. Fran√ßois Brigneau took on the chief editorship for a time but the extreme political tone with which he infused the paper led to his replacement, and he returned to his position of star editor. During the 1970s the paper adopted an far-right editorial line. Until 1975 Minute was subject to bomb attacks for three times. Move to the far- right In the second half of the 1970s, Minute adopted a hard-right line marked by its support for the National Front, to whom the newspaper's journalists devoted many articles. Ultimately the party head-hunted Minute's information officer. At the very beginning of the 1980s, sales of the paper, affected by the support shown to Jean-Marie Le Pen and the loss of investigative reporter such as Jean Montaldo (resigned in 1972), started to decline. Nevertheless Minute retained political influence, and was particularly anti-communist. For example, it helped to publicise the accusations by the daily l'Express against Georges Marchais (the communist leader who, unknown to most French people at the time, had volunteered to work in the Messerschmitt aircraft factory in Germany during the Second World War), and similar charges against Georges Guingouin, former leader of the wartime Maquis du Limousin. Serge de Beketch, formerly head of information, became chief editor of Minute in 1979. He left the paper in 1986 when Jean-Marie Le Pen chose him to manage National-Hebdo. Among other famous Minute journalists was Patrick Buisson, historian of the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te and, 30 years later, adviser to Nicolas Sarkozy. Twice, in August 1982 and in April 1985, Minute offices were attacked. An anarcho-communist group called Action Directe claimed responsibility. In 1987-88 the editorial staff split and formed the rival publications Minute and Le Chardon. Le Chardon would only last a few months before the editorial team reformed under the name Minute-Le Chardon. In 1990, Serge Martinez, a National Front deputy at the time who later became second-in-command and financier of Bruno M√©gret, bought Minute. He transformed the paper into a more news-focussed format and the title became La France, with Minute only appearing as a subtitle or surtitle depending on the issue. He sold the paper three years later as the new formula did not succeed in increasing sales. That same year (1993), G√©rald Penciolelli bought Minute with the intention of turning it back into its original form and abandoning the news focus. Its overall layout was also changed to one that greatly resembled the appearance of Le Canard encha√Æn√© (\\"The Chained Duck\\"); it accompanied this change with the slogan \\"Not all ducks are on the left\\". Nicolas Miquet unsuccessfully attempted in February 1999 to purchase Minute, then in financial difficulty. Two months later, Penciolelli's publishing company became insolvent and was dissolved by the Commercial Court (tribunal de commerce). In the issue dated March 1999, the management appealed to its most faithful readers to save the paper. Publication stopped for a few months, during which Miquet launched the paper L'Hebdo, subtitled Le Nouveau Minute. The editorial team, in dispute with Penciolelli, announced its intention to buy back the paper and in the interim published the pastiche Un Faux Minute (\\"a false Minute\\"), denouncing the actions of both Penciolelli and Miquet. In December, the Commercial Court assigned the paper to Catherine Barnay, a close associate of G√©rard Penciolelli. In January 2002 Jean-Marie Molitor bought the paper. Molitor has continued to own it ever since. During the 2002 presidential election Minute correctly predicted that Prime Minister Lionel Jospin would be eliminated in the first round of voting, and that Jean-Marie Le Pen would qualify for the second round. This prediction was also made by some politically like-minded newspapers such as Pr√©sent, Rivarol, National- Hebdo, and Le Libre Journal and also the weekly satirical magazine Le Canard encha√Æn√© and the daily Les Quatre V√©rit√©s. Current political position Today, Minute is a newspaper close to the far-right which styles itself as uniting the souverainist and nationalist right. Since Minute is not affiliated with a powerful press conglomerate, it is highly dependent on sales revenues. Little by little, Minute has disappeared from certain retail outlets where it had no more than one or two buyers. According to the newspaper, this amounts to a boycott targeting papers with limited circulation. Minute accuses other newspapers of plagiarism (¬´ pillerai[en]t sans citer ¬ª lit. \\"pillaging without citation\\"). The paper was the first paper to reveal that Fran√ßois Mitterrand had an illegitimate daughter. Minute has been regularly convicted of defamation, which has led to its inclusion in French Trivial Pursuit as the answer to \\"Which newspaper can boast the highest number of court proceedings?\\" In 1999, the paper refused to take sides in the schism of the National Front between the supporters of Bruno M√©gret and Jean-Marie Le Pen. In an editorial published in July 2006, Jean-Marie Molitor made a call for \\"patriotic unity\\" between partisans of Jean-Marie Le Pen, Philippe de Villiers and Bruno M√©gret. Minute has also repeatedly called for the right wing of the UMP to join the coalition. During the Kosovo War, Minute supported the Yugoslav government and its president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. The first page of the issue circulated on 31 March 1999 was entitled \\"The Serbs are protecting us against Islamist invasion. Today, Kosovo, tomorrow, France\\". Before the 2002 presidential election, Minute published more than 50 conversations with elected members of the RPR, the UDF and the National Front, and organised debates between right- wing and National Front personalities. This led to controversy among certain left-wing personalities, including Julien Dray, who protested at the significant number of deputies from the UMP who had agreed to interviews with Minute. For the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Minute headlined with \\"Are there too many blacks in the French team?\\". In addition, the issue released before the world cup final was titled \\"Bye-bye hooligan\\" with a photo of Zinedine Zidane, who had been sent off the field after head-butting an Italian player who had insulted him. The article which followed compared Zidane to a young thug from the banlieue, the rough suburbs. During the 2007 presidential elections Minute gave its support to the candidature of Jean-Marie Le Pen. In 2010, Minute supported Bruno Gollnisch in the election for president of the National Front after Jean-Marie Le Pen's retirement. Marine Le Pen, harshly criticised by the paper, was however elected by the congress at Tours on 16 January 2011. Le Canard encha√Æn√© reported that representatives of Minute were denied entry to the congress because of ¬´hostilit√© ill√©gitime¬ª. The tensions between the party under Marine Le Pen and the newspaper have surfaced regularly, particularly around the debate over marriage equality (¬´mariage pour tous¬ª \\"marriage for all\\"). In January 2013, Minute questioned whether there was a gay lobby in the National Front and attacked its vice-president Florian Philippot. In response, Marine Le Pen described Minute as a \\"rag\\". Florian Philippot, for his part, described their analysis as \\"worthy of far-right conspirators from the inter- war period\\", suggesting \\"gay\\" was being used in the same way as \\"Jew\\", and accused the daily of \\"the lowest level of politics\\". In June 2013, Minute again courted controversy with the front-page headline ¬´ Jeux de mains, jeux de vilains ! ¬ª, referring to the death of Cl√©ment M√©ric, a far-left antifascist activist, in a brawl with a group of far-right skinheads. This saying is difficult to translate, but is something said to children who are being too rough along the lines of \\"it'll all end in tears\\" or \\"hands are not for hitting\\" but with a light-hearted, humorous tone. On 12 November 2013, Minute made its contribution to the ongoing series of racist insults aimed at French Guianan born Attorney-General Christiane Taubira with its front cover headline ¬´ Maligne comme un singe, Taubira retrouve la banane ¬ª \\"Crafty monkey, Taubira recovers her banana\\". Since Taubira championed the passage of France's gay marriage law she has become a target for opponents of the law. The headline refers to one child brought to protest by her parents waving a banana in her face and to her chant: ¬´ La guenon, mange ta banane ¬ª \\"Ugly ape, eat your banana!\\". The previous week National Front candidate Anne-Sophie Leclere had published a picture on Facebook comparing Taubira with a monkey, for which she was expelled from the party. Following this latest controversy, prosecutors have begun investigating Minute for \\"public insults of a racist nature\\" at the urging of Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and the Interior Minister, Manuel Valls is examining whether it is possible to legally prevent distribution of the magazine.

Missouri, 439 U.S. 357 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case related to the Sixth Amendment. It challenged Missouri's law allowing gender- based exemption from jury service. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who later became a Supreme Court Justice, and Lee Nation argued for Duren in what became Ginsburg's last case before the Supreme Court as an attorney. Part of her argument was that making jury duty optional for women should be struck down because it treated women's service on juries as less valuable than men's, and also discriminated against men who enjoyed no such exemption.  Background  Duren was indicted in 1975 for first-degree murder and first-degree robbery. In a pretrial motion to quash his jury panel, and again in a post-conviction motion for a new trial, he claimed that his right to trial by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of his community was denied by provisions of Missouri law granting women who so request an automatic exemption from jury service. He claimed that this Missouri law violated his sixth amendment rights to an impartial jury.  Issues  Missouri state law at that time permitted women (and those over age 65) to be exempted from jury duty upon request.at pages 361‚Äì362 Furthermore, women who failed to show up for jury duty were automatically exempted.footnote 14 on page 362 noted that the practice of allowing women to simply not show up was itself not authorized by any law or regulation, and that if men failed to show up for jury duty, they could be subjected to penalties for contempt of court In Taylor v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court held that systematic exclusion of women from the jury pool resulted in jury pools that were not representative of the general population.  Decision  The conviction was overturned and remanded back to trial court. Five other cases before the Supreme Court were also decided in the same way: Harlin v. Missouri, (439 U.S. 459), Lee v. Missouri, (439 U.S. 461), Arrington v. Missouri, Burnfin v. Missouri, Combs v. Missouri and Minor v. Missouri. The decision was held to be retroactive.

Known for his height of 7'1\\" (216 cm), he is the tallest player to play first-class and international cricket, a title that was previously shared by former West Indian fast bowler Joel Garner and Australian pace bowler Bruce Reid. Domestic career  First-class contract  After impressing coaches at the NCA, Irfan got several offers from first-class teams including Habib Bank and ZTBL. However it was KRL opener, Azhar Ali, who convinced KRL coach Rashid Iqbal to give Irfan a trial with Khan Research Laboratories (KRL). Azhar had seen Irfan take 4 wickets against Pakistan A and had immediately called KRL telling them that Irfan would be a good fit for their team. Irfan went for the trial and got selected. He made his first-class debut in the QEA Trophy in October 2009 playing for Khan Research Laboratories. He bowled economically but was unable to take any wickets in a high scoring game. In his second first-class game, Irfan took 7‚Äì113 in the second innings and 9 wickets overall in the match. His first wicket in professional cricket was of young Pakistani international batsmen Ahmed Shehzad. He also took the wicket of Imran Farhat and injured Hasan Raza with a bouncer before taking his wicket. Irfan continued to impress early on in his first-class career. In his third match he grabbed 11 wickets to help his side to the first win of the championship. He recorded 5/27 in the first innings and 6/96 in the second innings. Before he was offered a lucrative break in cricket, Irfan contemplated giving up the game and was working for a plastic pipe company. He confirmed his height as 7'1\\" which makes him the tallest first-class cricketer of all time above county players Anthony Allom, Paul Dunkels and Will Jefferson, each individually measured at 6'10\\".  T20 franchise career  Irfan announced that he had signed a memorandum of understanding with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to represent them in the 2011 IPL Season. This deal is only valid as long as the PCB and the BCCI give their approval. The main reason for Irfan being given a trial with KKR was because former Pakistani pace-bowler Wasim Akram recommended Irfan to the KKR management. Irfan's contract will earn him $75,000 plus another $2,000 dollars for every game he plays in. However the contract needs to be approved by the Board of Control for Cricket in India Irfan's contract also requires approval from the Pakistan Cricket Board On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Edmonton Royals in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. He was the joint-leading wicket-taker in the tournament for the Edmonton Royals, with six dismissals in six matches. In August 2018, during the 2018 Caribbean Premier League, Irfan conceded just 1 run and grabbed 2 wickets from 4 overs, bowling for the Barbados Tridents against the St Kitts and Nevis Patriots. This was the most economical four- over spell in T20 cricket. In September 2018, he was named in Balkh's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament. The following month, he was named in the squad for the Sylhet Sixers team, following the draft for the 2018‚Äì19 Bangladesh Premier League. In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Rajshahi Royals in the 2019‚Äì20 Bangladesh Premier League. Rajshahi Royals were the Bangladesh Premier League champions that season, and in the final, Irfan took 2/18 in his four over stint. International career Early days Irfan worked in a pipe factory, earning just 300 rupees ($3) a week, before being spotted by former first- class cricketer Nadeem Iqbal in a club match, after which he made his debut for the Pakistan national cricket team at 28 years of age. Irfan was brought in to replace Pakistan's two prominent and core bowlers Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif, who were accused of spot fixing. This was a perfect opportunity for Irfan to shine for Pakistan as they looked to move forward without their two great bowlers. However, Irfan's ODI debut against England in 2010 saw a reduction by 9 overs in the match due to bad weather conditions. He finished the match with bowling figures of 0‚Äì37 off 5.3 overs, before going off the pitch with cramps. During this early stretch in his career, many were displeased by Irfan's performance. This was mainly due to his speed in the debut series against England; it underwhelmed many as it only showed 130‚Äì135 km/h on the velocity radar. To make matters worse, England had won the match by 24 runs. Irfan was dropped after the series and was not brought back until the India series on 25 December 2012. Irfan made his Twenty20 International debut against India in the first Twenty20 International match on 25 December 2012 when the Pakistani team was touring India. Irfan was seen as a prominent figure in the series win against India as he emerged as the wild card that propelled Pakistan to victory. In this series he displayed marked improvement as his bowling speeds reached 145 km/h, rising from the 135 km/h he had over two years ago. At 7\`1 and bowling at brisk pace, Irfan brings a new dimension to the Pakistan bowling attack.  The Emergence  Irfan's improvement did not go unnoticed, as the Pakistan selectors touted him \\"the surprise package\\" in South Africa in March 2013. Irfan did not disappoint as he consistently troubled the South African batsmen with his pace and height. Irfan finished the first innings with 3 wickets and 1 maiden in 21 overs, conceding 86 runs with an economy rate of 4.09. In the second innings Irfan was unable to take a wicket, returning figures of 0-35 off 10 overs. Suspension 2017 Irfan was suspended from all forms of cricket on 29 March 2017 by the PCB for failing to report two approaches to corrupt the game during the 2017 Pakistan Super League. The suspension was backdated to the 14 March 2017, the day that he was initially provisionally suspended. In addition, Irfan was fined PKR 1 million. Irfan can have his suspension lifted after six months if he assists the PCB in its ongoing investigations and doesn't breach the anti corruption code during that time.

The place was previously known as Klipdrift, meaning stony drift, a translation from a still earlier !Ora name, !a |aub. Canteen Kopje is best known for its long and exceptionally rich Earlier Stone Age sequence, spanning circa >0.5 to 1.7 million years, occurring within gravels exposed in late nineteenth/early twentieth century mining pits. Also attracting attention are more recent archaeological levels in the overlying Hutton Sands, which contain material known as Fauresmith, Middle Stone Age, Later Stone Age, and late Iron Age with evidence of protocolonial/colonial contact and interaction, probably, with nineteenth century diamond diggers. The importance of Canteen Kopje as a heritage site was recognized, and a area known as Erf 91 was proclaimed as a protected reserve in 1948. Gideon Retief, Mining Commissioner of Barkly West from 1942 to 1951, was instrumental in preserving the site and creating the first open air exhibit here. Subsequently, in 2000, information panels were erected by the McGregor Museum. These were refurbished in 2016. A walking trail was laid out for visitors to view the early diamond diggings and archaeological research sites. The Barkly West Museum contains further information and examples of artefacts from the site, while material excavated by archaeologists is housed principally by the McGregor Museum, the approved archaeological repository for the Northern Cape Province in nearby Kimberley. In 2016 the protected heritage site was directly threatened after the Department of Minerals and Energy issued a permit for part of the site to be mined. Although a heritage permit had not been issued by the South African Heritage Resources Agency, mining commenced on 18 March 2016. An urgent interdicted was granted by the Northern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa on 19 March, being made final on 19 April 2016.Canteen Kopje - Cultural Heritage under Threat In the 1940s the archaeologist Clarence Van Riet Lowe predicted: ‚ÄúWhen the last diamond claim has been abandoned, archaeologists throughout the world will be interested in Canteen Kopje, in the Vaal River diggings, where lie the prehistoric remains of a million years of human evolution.‚Äù Alluvial diamond diggings One of the hills in the vicinity of Canteen Kopje was the site of the first alluvial diamond diggings (as opposed to surface prospecting) on the Diamond Fields of South Africa, which precipitated the rush to these parts in 1870. Digging continued here until the early 1940s. Batlhaping Kgosi (Chief) Jantjie Mothibi controlled, for as long as he could, the influx of white ‚Äúdiamond seekers‚Äù to the region. Prospectors were allowed to use sharp sticks, but were not permitted to ‚Äútouch the ground with pick and shovel‚Äù. For their part, as noted by Jerome Babe in his 1872 book, The South African Diamond Fields, ‚ÄúNatives would form themselves in long lines, joined hand in hand, and walk slowly over the ground and look for diamonds, especially after rain; and if they found one they would take it to a trader...[Finds were exchanged for] horses, wagons, cows, sheep, cash, goods, etc at a deuce of a pace‚Äù. In January 1870 diggers from KwaZulu- Natal were working their way along the Vaal River, finding diamonds at Klipdrift, on the ‚ÄúOld Koppie‚Äù, upslope from Canteen Kopje. Using ‚Äúpick and shovel, in spite of the natives‚Äù, they unearthed more, precipitating the diamond rush. Soon both banks of the Vaal River were thronging with diggers of many nationalities, and by the end of the year there were five thousand people at Klipdrift alone. The diggers formed a Mutual Protection Association and elected Stafford Parker as their leader. Klipdrift was renamed Parkerton (from 1873 it was called Barkly West), and a Diggers‚Äô Republic was proclaimed in July 1870. A popular early cradle sieve for recovery of diamonds was the so- called ‚ÄúLong Tom‚Äù, which was reliant on large quantities of water. An improved version less dependent on water was developed by the American digger, author of The South African Diamond Fields, Jerome Babe. His ‚Äòdry sifter‚Äô, known as the ‚ÄúYankee Baby‚Äù, is still used in the twenty first century by some small- scale diggers. At the time, its inventor was said to be ‚Äúthe first Babe to rock his own cradle‚Äù. The centrifugal or rotary washing machine ‚Äì now standard on diggings in the area ‚Äì is more sophisticated. In a slurry, a concentrate of heavy diamond-bearing deposit is separated from lighter waste. Diggers staked their claims near the river, and dug the gravel where it was exposed at or near the surface. Where the gravel was buried deeper under silt and sand - such as at Canteen Kopje - large pits were dug. From these and from vertical shafts, the diggers tunnelled out precarious passageways in which a man could hardly stand. Geology The sequence of geological deposits in the vicinity of Canteen Kopje comprises: *Resistant 2 800 million year old andesitic lavas of the Ventersdorp Supergroup, underlying the entire area. *Thin patches of circa 280 million year old basal Karoo Sequence sediments made up of tillite and shale locally. *Shallow remnants of 19-17 million year old Older Gravels on the tops and upper slopes of adjacent hills. *Up to circa thickness of >0.5 to 1.7 million year old Younger Gravels formed largely from rock debris washed from adjacent hillsides. *Up to thick reddish windblown Hutton Sands that accumulated during drier intervals since about 0.3-0.5 million years ago. Diamonds at or near Canteen Kopje are confined to the Older and Younger Gravels. Around 90-120 million years ago, a swarm of volcanic pipes, centred on Kimberley to the east, brought diamond-bearing kimberlite to a higher surface formed of Karoo Sequence sediments. Subsequent erosion has lowered the entire regional landscape by over and in the process the diamonds were released from their host rock. It has been estimated that at least 50 million carats of diamonds were set free in this way from the five kimberlite pipes in the vicinity of Kimberley alone. Most of those were flushed away to the sea long ago in past and present river channels, but along the way some were trapped in alluvial deposits such as the Older and Younger Gravels along rivers in this region. Recognition of archaeological significance general view of Canteen Kopje site from the nearby hill Earlier Stone Age artefacts were noted in the area by Colonel James Henry Bowker and Mary Elizabeth Barber at the time of the earliest diamond diggings. Eminent prehistorians including C. van Riet Lowe, the French prehistorian, the Abb√© Henri Breuil and J. Desmond Clark visited and described it. Breuil was here in 1929 and again in the 1940s, when he famously noted that \\"not only are there enough specimens [there] to fill a museum to overflowing but to build it of them also.\\" Preserved and almost lost On account both of the mining history as well as the finding of Acheulean artefacts at this spot, a 10 morgen portion of Canteen Kopje was declared a National Monument (since 2000 known as a provincial heritage site) in 1948.Oberholster, J.J. 1972. The historical monuments of South Africa. Stellenbosch: The Rembrandt van Rijn Foundation for Culture for the National Monuments Council. Mining recommenced in the vicinity in the 1990s and Canteen Kopje was nearly lost. Pressure was exerted for the site to be de-proclaimed as a heritage site, to allow for renewed diamond digging and ‚Äòempowerment‚Äô of small scale miners. The local community recognised the value of conserving heritage and supported the efforts of the then National Monuments Council and the McGregor Museum to preserve the site, which was then developed as an open-air museum. The new Barkly West Museum was created at the same time. Renewed threat was experienced in 2016. In 2014 the Department of Minerals (DMR) issued a permit for mining to take place on part of the declared site. The South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA) was alerted and in response, because of the existing formal declaration, a Cease Works Order was put in place to prevent mining from taking place. Pressure was exerted however and in March 2016 the Cease Works Order was lifted, following which, on 16 March 2016, a diamond mining operation commenced work by fencing off an area around that for which they have a DMR mining permit. Public access to the remainder of the heritage site was blocked. Section 27(18) of the National Heritage Resources Act (NHRA) (Act 25 of 1999) states that: \\"No person may destroy, damage, deface, excavate, alter, remove from its original position, subdivide or change the planning status of any heritage site without a permit issued by the heritage resources authority responsible for the protection of such site.\\" Section 51. (1) of the NHRA states that: \\"Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any person who contravenes‚Äî (a) sections 27(18), 29(10), 32(13) or 32(19) is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both such fine and imprisonment as set out in item 1 of the Schedule.\\" Since the mining concern has commenced mining operations without such a permit issued by SAHRA, it is clearly in contravention of an Act of the Republic of South Africa and therefore is guilty of an offence. Archaeological and geological investigations from the 1990s Excavations in the late 1990s were carried out by Peter Beaumont of the McGregor Museum. John McNabb from the University of Southampton worked with Beaumont in analysing the Acheulean stone artefact technology.Beaumont, P.B. 1990. Canteen Koppie (Klipdrift). In Beaumont, P. & Morris, D.

Further excavations have been carried out by archaeologists from the University of the Witwatersrand (inter alia for application of cosmogenic nuclide burial dating) and the University of Toronto. The current active programme of research has yielded an as yet unpublished basal date of some 2.3 million years, while excavations involving students from the Sol Plaatje University in Kimberley investigate the most recent circa 19th century contact period archaeology showing interaction between local communities and colonial diggers. Crucial to the interpretation of the archaeology of the site, is an understanding of site formation in relation to the adjacent hill and the Vaal River which at different periods cut down first to the north of the site and then the south west.Helgren, D.M.

There is a marked 'Victoria West' Acheulean horizon (named for the town in the Karoo where these stone tools were first described) in the upper part of the gravels, subject to a current Southampton PhD project. The lower part of the sequence contains simpler, older Acheulean technology. Later Stone Age material at and just below the surface has been studied in two excavations by archaeologists from the University of the Witwatersrand and Toronto. Canteen Kopje Skull The Canteen Kopje Skull was found in the vicinity in 1925 by diamond digger Kenneth Kemp, working 2.4 m down at an unrecorded locality at Canteen Kopje. A number of fitting skull fragments were presented by Kemp to the magistrate J.G. van Alphen, who in turn donated them to the McGregor Museum. They were studied soon afterwards by Robert Broom, who described it in Nature in 1929. In Broom‚Äôs reconstruction, the skull appeared to have features similar to an allegedly archaic skeleton found at Boskop near Johannesburg. In 2011-12 X-ray Computerised Tomography scans of the skull, carried out at the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation near Pretoria, suggested it falls within the range of variation of Khoe-SƒÅn populations of the Holocene (last 12 000 years), and is not ‚Äòarchaic‚Äô as Broom had suggested. Reconsideration of the evidence also points to it having come from the Hutton Sands and not the Younger Gravels, as previously presumed.

If N >1 is an integer, then an N-ary FCSR of length r is a finite state device with a state (a;z) = (a_0,a_1,\\\\dots,a_{r-1};z) consisting of a vector of elements a_i in \\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,N-1\\\\\\\\}=S and an integer z. The state change operation is determined by a set of coefficients q_1,\\\\dots,q_n and is defined as follows: compute s = q_r a_0+q_{r-1} a_1+\\\\dots+q_1 a_{r-1} + z. Express s as s = a_r + N z' with a_r in S. Then the new state is (a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_r; z'). By iterating the state change an FCSR generates an infinite, eventually periodic sequence of numbers in S. FCSRs have been used in the design of stream ciphers (such as the F-FCSR generator), in the cryptanalysis of the summation combiner stream cipher (the reason Goresky and Klapper invented them), and in generating pseudorandom numbers for quasi-Monte Carlo (under the name Multiply With Carry (MWC) generator - invented by Couture and L'Ecuyer,) generalizing work of Marsaglia and Zaman. FCSRs are analyzed using number theory. Associated with the FCSR is a connection integer q = q_r N^r + \\\\dots + q_1 N^1 - 1. Associated with the output sequence is the N-adic number a = a_0 + a_1 N + a_2N^2+\\\\dots The fundamental theorem of FCSRs says that there is an integer u so that a = u/q, a rational number. The output sequence is strictly periodic if and only if u is between -q and 0. It is possible to express u as a simple quadratic polynomial involving the initial state and the qi. There is also an exponential representation of FCSRs: if g is the inverse of N \\\\pmod q, and the output sequence is strictly periodic, then a_i = (A g_i \\\\bmod q) \\\\bmod N, where A is an integer. It follows that the period is at most the order of in the multiplicative group of units modulo . This is maximized when is prime and is a primitive element modulo . In this case, the period is q-1. In this case the output sequence is called an l-sequence (for \\"long sequence\\"). l-sequences have many excellent statistical properties that make them candidates for use in applications, including near uniform distribution of sub-blocks, ideal arithmetic autocorrelations, and the arithmetic shift and add property. They are the with-carry analog of m-sequences or maximum length sequences. There are efficient algorithms for FCSR synthesis. This is the problem: given a prefix of a sequence, construct a minimal length FCSR that outputs the sequence. This can be solved with a variant of Mahler and De Weger's lattice based analysis of N-adic numbers when N=2; by a variant of the Euclidean algorithm when is prime; and in general by Xu's adaptation of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. If L is the size of the smallest FCSR that outputs the sequence (called the N-adic complexity of the sequence), then all these algorithms require a prefix of length about 2L to be successful and have quadratic time complexity. It follows that, as with LFSRs and linear complexity, any stream cipher whose N-adic complexity is low should not be used for cryptography. FCSRs and LFSRs are special cases of a very general algebraic construction of sequence generators called Algebraic Feedback Shift Registers (AFSRs) in which the integers are replaced by an arbitrary ring and is replaced by an arbitrary non-unit in .

Construction and United States Navy career, 1919-1922 Discoverer was laid down as the United States Navy minesweeper USS Auk (Minesweeper No. 38) by the Todd Shipyards Corporation at New York, New York, on 20 June 1918. She was launched on either 28 September 1918 and commissioned on 31 January 1919. Auk assisted in sweeping the North Sea Mine Barrage in 1919. She spent 1920 in ordinary at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and was redesignated AM-38 that year. She was decommissioned at Portsmouth on 28 December 1920. United States Coast and Geodetic Survey career While Auk lay in reserve, the Coast and Geodetic Survey found itself in urgent need of ships to replace those which for reasons of age or unsuitability for the work to be performed had been disposed of. While ships like Auk were, in general, well-adapted to the kind of work they would be performing in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, being robust, steel- hulled ships that had proved their seaworthiness while in Navy service as minesweepers, their accommodations were too small to take care of the large surveying parties that were to be embarked on board for the hydrographic and topographic work they would perform in the survey; however, their design permitted their conversion to allow the increase in accommodation necessary for survey work. Under the terms of an Executive Order of 12 October 1921, Auk and her sister ship, the minesweeper USS Osprey (AM-29) were taken to the Boston Navy Yard at Boston, Massachusetts, and transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey on 7 April 1922. The Survey renamed them USC&GS; Discoverer and USC&GS; Pioneer respectively. While in Coast and Geodetic Survey service, Discoverer, Pioneer, and survey ship USC&GS; Guide‚Äîthe former Navy minesweeper USS Flamingo (AM-32)‚Äîbecame known as the \\"Bird Boats\\" because of their original Navy names. On 8 April 1922, Lieutenant Commander H. A. Seran, USC&GS;, took charge of Discoverer and Pioneer. Discoverer, with Lieutenant Commander Seran in command, stood out of Boston on 28 April 1922 and transited the Cape Cod Canal that day. She reached the William Cramp & Sons shipyard at Philadelphia on 29 April 1922 and soon commenced a major overhaul and conversion into a survey ship. Discoverers metamorphosis was completed by early August 1922; and, on 9 August 1922, she got underway from Philadelphia for the Virginia Capes. Reaching Norfolk, Virginia, on 10 August 1922, she tarried there until heading out to sea on the evening of 1 September 1922. Giving the United States Atlantic Fleet ‚Äî then on maneuvers in the Southern Drill Grounds ‚Äî a wide berth, Discoverer steered south to Kingston, Jamaica, and steamed from there across the Gulf of Mexico, conducting sampling and surveying work along the way. Transiting the Panama Canal on 8 October 1922, Discoverer then proceeded up the coast of Central America and Mexico and reached San Diego, California, shortly after midnight on 27 October 1922. Working out of San Diego, San Francisco, and Oakland, California, Discoverer frequented the waters of Southern California, engaged in coastal survey work, for the rest of 1922 and the early portion of 1923. In 1923, Discoverer moved north to the waters of the Territory of Alaska, where she operated through the summer of 1925 except for with occasional visits to Seattle, Washington, or San Francisco for upkeep. Discoverers service in Alaska began in a most notable fashion. While underway for the port of Uyak, Alaska, on 6 June 1923, she picked up an SOS from the U.S. Navy minesweeper USS Cardinal (AM-6), which had become stranded on the rocks off either the southern end or east coast of Chirikof Island the previous night. Discoverer and the U.S. Navy oiler USS Cuyama (AO-3) headed for the scene. Discoverer arrived first, at 2150 hours on 6 June 1923, and dropped anchor. Training her searchlight on the stranded minesweeper, she attempted to launch a whaleboat, but the moderately rough seas to windward of Discoverer forced her to abandon the attempt. She raised her anchor at 2225 hours and crept ahead, maneuvering to make a lee for the whaleboat, until she struck a rock at 2232 hours. Lieutenant Commander Seran immediately ordered full speed astern, and Discoverer backed to a position half a nautical mile (about 0.9 kilometer) from where she had struck the rock, letting go her anchor again in 13 fathoms (78 feet or about 24 meters of water). Discoverer made no further attempt to reach Cardinal that night; but, on the morning of 7 June 1923, with the sea moderating, she lowered a whaleboat commanded by her executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Clem L. Garner, USC&GS.; The whaleboat proceeded to the stranded minesweeper and returned with 17 of Cardinals men. Meanwhile, Cuyama arrived on the scene and radioed Discoverer that she, Cuyama, could take the remaining 16 men‚Äîthe commanding officer, two other officers, and 13 enlisted men‚Äîoff Cardinal. However, nine of Cardinals, men had made it to shore the previous night, and were unaccounted for. Discoverer steamed off in search of them and located them, safe and sound, awaiting rescue. Lieutenant Commander Garner and eight men, using a motor whaleboat and a motor sailing launch, brought off the remaining Cardinal sailors from their perch ashore; later that afternoon, Discoverer transferred the shipwrecked sailors to Cuyama.

Cuyama, was rendered in accordance with the best traditions of that brotherhood of men that go down to the sea in ships.\\"This quotation, from the Dictionary of Naval Fighting Ships (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/a14/auk-i.htm) is unattributed. Completing this tour of duty in Alaskan waters in late September 1925, Discoverer proceeded south and arrived at San Francisco on 10 October 1925. On 12 October 1925, she shifted to Oakland where she underwent voyage repairs and prepared for her next deployment, getting underway for the Hawaiian Islands on 28 December 1925 and reaching Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, on 5 January 1926. She conducted hydrographic and topographic surveys of the Hawaiian Island chain, ranging as far as French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island, near Midway Atoll, through the late summer of 1927. In the spring of 1928, Discoverer returned to Alaskan waters, where she explored the topography and hydrography of the Alaskan coastline until 1941. Each spring she proceeded north from Seattle and commenced her work for the year, which lasted through the summer and into the autumn. She then returned to Seattle each autumn for routine upkeep and maintenance while her officers and men plotted the data gathered during the years operations and wrote reports of the work conducted. The ship's Alaskan ports of call included Kodiak, Seward, and Dutch Harbor, among others, and she operated in places such as False Pass, Tigalda Bay, Spruce Island, and Three Brothers' Reef. On 30 June 1930, she again had occasion to assist mariners in distress, when she lent assistance to the Alaska Steamship Company steamship Orduna, which was aground at Granite Mine, Port Wells, Prince William Sound, Alaska. As Discoverers years in Alaskan service wore on, the Aleutian Islands became increasingly important to commerce and aviation and, as the United States began to edge closer to war with Japan, to national defense as well, so Discoverer and the other ships in the Coast and Geodetic Survey assigned to Alaska maintained vigorous charting and mapping operations. Transfer to U.S. Navy 1941 Between 1939 and 1941, as World War II was fought in Europe prior to the entry of the United States into the war, the U.S. Navy expanded and began to cast about for auxiliary vessels to support its growing number of combatant ships. One of the ships the Navy sought was Discoverer, and an Executive Order of 19 June 1941 authorized the transfer of Discoverer to the Navy for service as a salvage ship. Operating of Dutch Harbor, Cold Bay, Womens Bay, and Kodiak, Alaska, Discoverer concluded her last operations with the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the summer of 1941. She departed Ketchikan, Alaska, on 22 July 1941, bound for Seattle and turnover to the Navy. Arriving at Seattle on 25 July 1941, Discoverer shifted to Pier 41 at Seattle on the afternoon of 26 August 1941. There, at 1440 hours that day, Lieutenant Commander E. Froberg, USN, accepted custody of the ship. Later career Discoverer retained her name in Navy service, becoming USS Discoverer (ARS-3). She operated as a Navy salvage ship in Alaskan waters from 1942 to 1946. She was sold in 1947. Commemoration Discoverer Bay at Kodiak Island, Alaska, and Discoverer Island, a small island in that bay, are named for Discoverer.

(pdf) and remains active in the states of California, Ohio, and Texas today. Open to members of any heritage today, the order provides low-cost insurance and mutual aid and has historically promoted the preservation of German language and traditions. History An emblem commonly used by the society in the early 20th century, depicting Arminius with his sword aloft; other common symbols used include German oaks and beehives A former meeting hall of the Sons of Hermann built in 1912, and subsequently converted to a church, in South Holyoke, Massachusetts The Sons of Hermann was formed by Dr. Philip Merkel, George Heiner, John Blatz, A. Auer, R. Schwendel, W. Kohler, and Philipp Germann on the Lower East Side,According to Albert Clark Stevens, The Cyclop√¶dia of Fraternities, 2nd ed., New York: Treat, 1907, p. 282, the fifth and seventh names are R. Schivendel and Philipp Hermann. He and the New York Times both have \\"Dr. Philip Merkel\\" as the first name. in response to anti- German sentiment during a period of heavy German immigration to the United States. One account, published in the St. Paul Morning Call in 1896, is that the order was founded after the funeral procession for a German was hindered and the mourners insulted by nativists, prompting protest meetings of German Americans, at one of which a speaker said another Hermann (Arminius) was needed to protect the Germans from their enemies.Stevens, p. 283. It was an offshoot of the Odd Fellows.Stanley Nadel, Little Germany: Ethnicity, Religion, and Class in New York City, 1845‚Äì80, University of Illinois Press, 1990, , p. 111. By 1848 the organization had grown to six groups with 800 members, and on December 25, 1848, a national grand lodge was formed in Milwaukee. Hundreds of lodges were organized during the nineteenth century; by 1895 there were about 30,000 members, and in 1896 there were Grand Lodges in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington in addition to New York, as well as scattered members in 15 other states with a total membership of 90,000. A German-language account ten years after that mentions affiliates in Canada and in Germany itself.Georg Schuster, Die Geheimen Gesellschaften, Verbindungen und Orden, Volume 2 Leipzig: Theodor Leibing, 1906, p. 511. However, like all things German, the order declined sharply in popularity with the outbreak of World War I.Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History, ed. Thomas Adam, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 985 . The order's symbolic colors are black, red and gold, representing German unity: black for ignorance, prejudice and indifference; red for the light and enlightenment spread by German culture and the German spirit; and gold for true freedom, which man arrives at through knowledge and labor. The order never had degrees. It has had rituals since its inception; at one point the Roman Catholic Church refused church burial to members of the Sons of Hermann because of their ritual.Kathleen Neils Conzen, Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836‚Äì1860: Accommodation and Community in a Frontier City, Harvard University Press, 1976, p. 169. But by the 1970s neither the initiation rite nor the burial rite was required. The burial rite mentions that the departed is now with the Almighty, but the order does not limit its membership to believers in a supreme being.Alvin J. Schmidt with Nicholas Babchuk, Fraternal Organizations, Greenwood encyclopedia of American institutions 3, Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood, 1980, , p. 153. German Jews participated fully in the Sons of Hermann; the order's insurance fund was led by Jacob Brandeis and Rabbi Emanuel Gerechter, the former also directing the order's choral group in Milwaukee.Avraham Barkai, Branching Out: German-Jewish Immigration to the United States, 1820‚Äì1914. Ellis Island Series. Holmes & Meier, 1994, , p. 184. At one point the order had a female auxiliary called the Daughters of Hermann, open to the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of the Sons.Stevens, pp. 283-84. Harmonia Lodge No. 1 in San Antonio was the first Sons of Hermann lodge to offer its members non-profit life insurance (proposed in 1873).\\"From Folk Hero to Fraternalism,\\" Sons of Hermann Hall, Dallas, December 16, 2008.

Accessed October 18, 2009. This is now a major feature of membership; ritual initiation is not required. Minnesota Hermann Monument, New Ulm, Minnesota Under the leadership of Julius Berndt, then national secretary, the Sons of Hermann paid for an American monument to Hermann modeled on the Hermannsdenkmal in Germany. It was completed in 1897 and is located in New Ulm, Minnesota, where Berndt was head of the local chapter.Adam, pp. 985‚Äì86. Following the First World War, anti- German sentiment remained in America and the local order disbanded thereafter, donating the statue and grounds to the City of New Ulm in 1929. Texas In 1861 the first lodge in Texas, Harmonia Lodge No. 1, was organized in San Antonio. On March 27, 1890, the Texas grand lodge was formed, consisting of Harmonia Lodge of San Antonio and seven other lodges in Austin, Taylor, Temple, Waco, La Grange, Brenham, and Houston, with a combined membership of 242. 92 more lodges were formed in the next year. In 1896 the first sister lodge for women was dedicated in Sherman, and in 1920 the first mixed lodge for both men and women, in San Antonio. In 1920 the Order of the Sons of Hermann in Texas, which by then was wealthier and had more members than all other lodges elsewhere in the United States combined, declared itself independent of the national order. The Texas order phased out the German language (Texas German) in favor of English by 1937. By 1965 only half the membership was of German heritage, and by 1994 membership was open to all. Membership grew as restrictions were lifted.\\"Order of Sons of Hermann,\\" Stichting Argus. Accessed October 18, 2009.

Gringoire () was a political and literary weekly newspaper in France, founded in 1928 by Horace de Carbuccia (son-in-law of Jean Chiappe, the prefect of police involved in the Stavisky Affair), Georges Suarez and Joseph Kessel.Myriam Anissimov, Romain Gary, Le Cam√©l√©on, √©ditions Folio, 2006, chapitre 19, p. 145. It was one of the great inter-war weekly French papers, following a formula started by Candide, and taken up not only by Gringoire but also by the left-wing papers Vendredi and Marianne. The style involved according significant space to politics, having a high-quality literature page, having grand reportages and grand feuilletons (in this case with Pierre Drieu La Rochelle and Francis Carco), satirical cartoons (the main illustrator of Gringoire was Roger Roy), and a simple presentation. From the centre-right to right-wing nationalism At the outset Gringoire was a pamphlet, the principal trait of a paper called a mac√©doine (mish-mash), a term coined by Carbuccia himself. Marxism and the left in general were its favourite targets. It represented the right-wing spectrum of the Union nationale led by Raymond Poincar√©, with a veteran-like style which it retained throughout. After the 6 February 1934 shooting of veterans of the First World War, following the general trend toward radicalisation, the influence of Action fran√ßaise made itself felt. In October 1935, Gringoire declared itself against the international sanctions imposed on Italy following its invasion of Abyssinia to avoid pushing Mussolini toward an alliance with Hitler. For a long time the paper had showed itself favourable to the Italian regime, as well as to the Salazar regime in Portugal. It also developed an increasingly marked Anglophobia. Henri B√©raud, the paper's editor, published in the 11 October 1935 issue a humoristic article titled \\"Do we have to reduce England to slavery?\\". From 1930 the paper, was Germanophobe and nationalist. Its special correspondent in Germany, Xavier de Hauteclocque, forcefully denounced the nazi r√©gime. Initially favorable to a military intervention against Germany, by 1938 Gringoire was hostile to war because of the perceived weakness of the French military in the face of growing militarism in Germany. The novelist Romain Gary who published two novels in Gringoire: The Storm (15 February 1935) and A Small Woman (24 May 1935), under his real name Roman Kacew. When the journal, \\"having turned strongly to the right, then to the extreme-right\\" became hostile to Jewish immigration, Gary stopped sending his writings despite the significant compensation he received, of 1000 francs per 6-column page.Myriam Anissimov, Romain Gary, Le Cam√©l√©on, √©ditions Folio, 2006, chap. 19, p. 145 and p. 147). In his essay on William Butler Yeats, George Orwell cites the predominance of advertising by clairvoyants in Gringoire as an example of the affinity of mysticism with right-wing politics. From nationalism to Vichyism From 1936 onwards, a second radicalisation took place, involving a convergence of anti-war views and a vitriolic hostility to the left. People who espoused war were deemed by extension communist sympathisers. Gringoire took editorial positions viewed as anti- semitic while simultaneously welcoming journalists who were Jewish or of Jewish descent such as Joseph Kessel and Irene Nemirovsky. Jews were accused of wanting war in order to overthrow the Nazi regime (which Gringoire also criticized) at a time of French military weakness. Certain Jews were also denounced as the supreme agents of communism in France, and favoured immigration, despised by Gringoire as a source of problems. The Popular Front of France and the Popular Front of Spain were excoriated by Gringoire. Andr√© Tardieu was the editorial writer from 1936 to 1939; when he had a stroke, Philippe Henriot and Roland Dorgel√®s joined the editorship. In the 1930s, Gringoire was widely appreciated‚Äîto the same extent as Candide, L'Action fran√ßaise and Je suis partout‚Äîin right-wing Romanian circles. It sold excellently in Bucharest. Gringoire approved the Munich Accords, which provoked a fight between Tardieu (who opposed the accords) and B√©raud (who was in favour). In spring 1939, Gringoire criticised the 1938 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Germany, and from July 1939 to May 1940, rallied to the politics of national defence. Its tone changed after the defeat; Gringoire, allying with the Vichy regime, fully approved the armistice and Philippe P√©tain's national revolution. However, while some of the journalists were ideologically collaborationists, Carbuccia was, according to Pascal Ory, in favour of strategic collaboration and sought to protect his Jewish and resistant journalists. He stopped the newspaper's circulation on 25 May 1944. Among the paper's contributors was Ir√®ne N√©mirovsky, a politically conservative ethnic Jew of Russian origin who had converted to Catholicism. After the war started, Gringoire was the only magazine that continued to publish her work, pseudonymously, thus \\"guarantee[ing] N√©mirovsky's family some desperately needed income.\\" She was arrested in 1942 by the French gendarmerie and handed over to the Nazis; she died of typhus a month after her arrest. Gringoire's military correspondent, Henri Pelle-Desforges joined the resistance. He was arrested by the Germans and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp where he died in 1944.

It is designed to alleviate the drudgery software developers experience writing persistence domains. nHydrate is free as an open source project on GitHub.com under the MIT License. nHydrate was originally created in 2003 as a private project to solve the issues with the .NET Framework 1.1. Using ADO.Net Datasets is cumbersome and error prone, so a small generated framework was created to relieve developers of the CRUD work. As a private project it was later inspired by the work of the NHibernate group. nHydrate was a private project from 2003 until 2009. It was used at various companies in the Atlanta, Georgia, area but never widely released. It was publicly released on September 10, 2009. nHydrate is built on the .NET Framework 4.0. From version 5.0 and above, the entire framework has been reworked to use only Entity Framework as it internal data access layer. The modeler is now visual with a main diagram like other modeling products. All code interactions are simply Entity Framework now so there is no learning curve for developers when using the generated output. Feature summary nHydrate's primary feature is mapping .NET objects to an SQL server database. The CRUD layer (create, update, delete) is also implemented. There are numerous retrieval mechanism facilities. nHydrate generates the SQL for all CRUD operations as well as advanced LINQ capabilities. The product is not database portable. The framework is designed to work exclusively with Microsoft SQL Server. There is an internal project to use MySql but this is not yet a public release. The tool is entirely sited within Visual Studio.NET and all model maintenance and generation is handled directly from the environment. There are no XML files or other complex configuration scenarios to navigate like almost all other ORM tools. The VS.NET plugin GUI editor provides an interface to interact with a visual model and edit a model. History nHydrate was started by Michael Knight, and later added Chris Davis. By 2006, the platform had much of its current functionality, minus LINQ, and was being used in applications in the Atlanta area.

In most jurisdictions, use of the term \\"organic\\" or equivalents like \\"bio\\" or \\"eco\\", on any product is regulated by food authorities. In general these regulations stipulate that livestock must be: allowed to graze, be fed an organically certified fodder or compound feed, not be treated with most drugs (including growth hormone), and in general must be treated humanely.Organic Dairy Industry in Canada, Agriculture Agri-Food Canada http://www.dairyinfo.gc.ca/pdf/organic_profile_eng.pdf There are multiple obstacles to forming firm conclusions regarding possible safety or health benefits from consuming organic milk or conventional milk, including the lack of long term clinical studies. The studies that are available have come to conflicting conclusions with regard to absolute differences in nutrient content between organic and conventionally produced milk, such as protein or fatty acid content. The weight of available evidence does not support the position that there are any clinically relevant differences between organic and conventionally produced milk, in terms of nutrition or safety. Legal definition In general, all livestock used to produce organic milk must be maintained using the methods of organic farming as defined in the jurisdiction where the milk will be sold, and generally must be certified in order to be marketed as organic. In general, these laws require that livestock be allowed to graze on pasture, be fed organic certified feed (which may not include byproducts of animal slaughter), and that the animals not be treated with drugs (although it is also illegal to withhold necessary drugs from a sick animal in order to maintain that animal's organic status). * Australia: NASAA Organic Standard * Canada: * European Union: EU-Eco-regulation ** Sweden: KRAV ** United Kingdom: DEFRA * Norway: Debio Organic certification * India: NPOP, (National Program for Organic Production)NPOP, (National Program for Organic Production) * Japan: JAS StandardsJAS Standards * United States: National Organic Program (NOP) Standards Comparison with conventional milk Chemical composition Studies have examined chemical differences in the composition of organic milk compared with conventional milk. These studies generally suffer from confounding variables, and are difficult to generalize due to differences in the tests that were done, the season of testing and brand of milk tested, and because the vagaries of agriculture affect the chemical composition of milk. Treatment of the foodstuffs after initial gathering (whether milk is pasteurized or raw), the length of time between milking and analysis, as well as conditions of transport and storage, also affect the chemical composition of a given batch. Nutrient content A 2012 meta-analysis of the scientific literature did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products, and found that results varied from study to study. The authors found 4 studies on each of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol levels in milk; differences were heterogeneous and not significant. The authors found few studies on fatty acids in milk; all (but for one) were of raw milk, and suggest that raw organic milk may contain significantly more beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and vaccenic acid than raw conventional milk. The authors found no significant differences between organic raw milk and conventional milk with respect to total protein, total fat, or 7 other vitamins and fatty acids tested. A different review concluded, \\"Results to date suggest that the nutritional content of organic milk is similar to that of conventional milk. There may be a different profile of fatty acids in organic milk, with a higher proportion of PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) relative to other fatty acids, but this effect does not appear to be consistent. This difference will be smaller in fat-reduced milk.\\" A less comprehensive review published in 2012 looking only at data from studies published from 2008 to 2011 found that organic dairy products contain significantly higher protein, total omega-3 fatty acid, and 5 other fatty acids, but less linoleic acid, oleic acid, and omega-6 fatty acids than those of conventional produced milk. It also found that organic dairy products have significantly higher omega-3 to -6 ratio and Œî9-desaturase index than the conventional types. Chemical and pesticide residue A consumer concern that drives demand for organic food is the concern that conventional foods may contain residues of pesticides and chemicals. Many investigations of organic milk have not measured pesticide residues. One review of the literature concluded the \\"available evidence indicates that regular and organic milk contain similar trace levels of chemical and pesticide residues.\\" Health and safety With respect to scientific knowledge of health and safety benefits from a diet of organic food, several factors limit our ability to say that there is any health benefit, or detriment, from such a diet. The 2012 meta-analysis noted that \\"there have been no long-term studies of health outcomes of populations consuming predominantly organic versus conventionally produced food controlling for socioeconomic factors; such studies would be expensive to conduct.\\" A 2009 meta-analysis has noted that there have been very few studies that have looked at direct human health outcomes. In addition, as discussed above, difficulties in accurately and meaningfully measuring chemical differences between organic and conventional milk make it difficult to extrapolate health recommendations based solely on chemical analysis. The authors of the 2012 meta-analysis ultimately concluded that the review \\"(...) identified limited evidence for the superiority of organic foods. The evidence does not suggest marked health benefits from consuming organic versus conventional foods, (...)\\". A review of the literature published by the American Academy of Pediatrics published in 2012 concluded: \\"There is no evidence of clinically relevant differences in organic and conventional milk. There are few, if any, nutritional differences between organic and conventional milk. There is no evidence that any differences that may exist are clinically relevant. There is no evidence that organic milk has clinically significant higher bacterial contamination levels than does conventional milk. There is no evidence that conventional milk contains significantly increased amounts of bovine growth hormone. Any bovine GH that might remain in conventional milk is not biologically active in humans because of structural differences and susceptibility to digestion in the stomach.\\" Taste One review noted that some consumers like the taste of organic milk, while others do not, and suggested that the amount of heat treatment is likely to be a significant factor in determining the taste of the milk. Certain treatments, such as ultra-heat treatments used by milk producers, can impart a slight nutty taste to the milk. Overall, the results of taste testing \\"are not clear- cut\\" as to whether organic or conventional milk is preferred. Economic factors Compared to conventional milk farms, organic milk farms produce significantly less milk per cow and cost more to operate. Organic dairy co-ops have been a successful economic survival strategy for small to medium-sized producers in the American midwest. Organic milk accounts for 18% of milk sales in the US and was worth $2.5 billion in 2016.

Biography  Taras Voznyak was born after his father returned from exile in Magadan (exile lasted from 1945 to 1956). The family settled in the town of Broshniv- Osada. * 1974‚Äì1979 ‚Äì Taras Voznyak studies at Lviv Polytechnic Institute (currently Lviv Polytechnic National University) * 1980‚Äì1984 ‚Äì Taras Voznyak serves as an officer in the armed forces in the town of Iziaslav of Khmelnytskyi Oblast. During army service he translates philosophy works by Edmund Husserl, Roman Ingarden, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Max Scheler. * After demobilisation in 1984, Taras Voznyak starts working as a programmer at Lviv Factory of Milling Machines. After Gorbachev's thaw he becomes an activist of democratic movement and co-organises the first general strike in Ukraine (at Lviv Factory of Milling Machines). Taras Voznyak was close to an informal group of intellectuals united under the name \\"Lvivska Shkola\\" (Lviv School). Ihor Klekh, Hryhoriy Komskyi, Mykola Yakovyna and others were part of this group, which was operating in Lviv in the 1980s. He organised the printing of samizdat culturology literature. He translated a large number of texts and also published within samizdat, in particularly the books of Polish-Jewish writer Bruno Schulz.  Editor ‚Äì Independent Cultural Journal \\"–á\\"  In 1987 Taras Voznyak together with Mykola Yakovyna initiated the creation of the Independent Cultural Journal. The name of the Journal ‚Äì \\"–á\\" ‚Äì was thought up by Ukrainian translator Hryhoriy Kochur and linguist Yuriy Shevelyov during the meeting in Lviv. The first issue of the Independent Cultural Journal \\"–á\\" was published in 1989. Since then Taras Voznyak remains the Journal's editor-in-chief and publisher. With the support from Reform Movement of Lithuania \\"Sajudis\\", the first five Journal issues were manufactured as photocopies in Vilnius. The photocopies would be brought to Lviv, and then they were stitched and distributed nationally in Ukraine. This is when Oleksandr Kryvenko, the editor of samvydav Lviv newspaper \\"Postup\\", joined the Journal team. In 1995 the Journal was officially registered ‚Äì Taras Voznyak, Mykhaylo Moskal and Oleksandr Pohranychnyi became the Journal founders. Independent Cultural Journal \\"–á\\" is published in paper and electronic form. The Journal has long ago transformed into an influential NGO and a think tank. The main issues, which the NGO Independent Cultural Journal \\"–á\\" is working upon, are the issues of civil society, human rights, interethnic relations, cross-border cooperation, multiculturalism, European integration, regionalism, globalisation and anti-globalist movements, ecumenical dialogue, political changes in the region. As a leader of NGO Independent Cultural Journal \\"–á\\" Taras Voznyak organises and holds numerous international, national and local conferences, meetings, round table discussion, and other events. He is the initiator and organiser of community campaigns on the promotion of cultural heritage of Halychyna ‚Äì in particular the sculptor of 18th century Johann-Georg Pinzel, writer and painter Bruno Schulz, writer Zygmunt Haupt. Journal \\"–á\\" has become a cult publication in Lviv. Journal's series have been reconstructing local identities of Halychyna, Volyn, Zakarpattya, Bukovyna for many years. Several Journal issues have been promoting the almost non-existent Polish, Jewish and Armenian cultural landscapes of the region ‚Äì Polish, Jewish and Armenian \\"uni-verse\\" of Halychyna. A range of Journal issues is dedicated to phenomena of the cities ‚Äì Lviv, Chernivtsi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Kolomyja, Zhovkva. In 2001, an honorary distinction \\"Order for Intellectual Bravery\\" was established (initiated by Taras Voznyak and Oleksandr Pohranychnyi), which since then has been accepted by Borys Tarasyuk, Nataliya Yakovenko, Myroslav Popovych, Emma Andijevska, Roman Viktyuk, Vyacheslav Bryukhovetskyi, Valentyn Sylvestrov, Myroslav Marynovych, Hryhoriy Hrabovych, Andrzej Nikodemowicz, Borys Gudzyak, Pavlo Chuchka, Yevhen Zakharov, Roman Petruk, Bohdan Osadchuk, Leonid Finberg, Mustafa Jemilev, Anatoliy Hrytsenko, Ihor Isichenko, Oksana Pakhlyovska, Andriy Sodomora, Igor Shevchenko, Yaroslav Grytsak, Aleksandra Gnatyuk, Moses Fishbein, Bohdan Soroka, Bohdan Havrylyshyn, Mykola Kniazhyckyi, Karmela Cepkolenko, Kostiantyn Sigov, Ruslana Lazhychko, Vladyslav Troickyi, Bogumila Berdychovska, Tiberij Silvashi, Iza Chruslinska, Taras Prochasko, Oksana Lyniv, Yavhen Bystryckyi, Pawe≈Ç Piotr Smole≈Ñski, Yosyf Zisels, Patriarch Filaret, Stanis≈Çaw Rosiek, Tamara Hundorova, Oleksander Roitburd.

It is believed to have recently evolved from the sympatric vendace, Coregonus albula.  Description  Coregonus fontanae is highly dwarfed, and is believed to be the world's smallest type of cisco. The maximum length recorded for this species is , and is believed to be a typical size. Stechlin ciscoes are silvery pink in body color, with a bluish-brown back and glassy fins. The Stechlin cisco is taxonomically distinguished from the vendace and the other dwarfed cisco species by its low number of lateral line scales (69‚Äì77), by some bodily proportions, by the length of its gill rakers, by its slow growth, by its glassy fins, and by its spring spawning season.  Taxonomy and evolution The existence of two forms of vendace-like whitefish in Lake Stechlin was noted by G. Bauch in 1953 and A. K. Awand and colleagues in the 1990s. During Maurice Kottelat and J√∂rg Freyhof's survey of the freshwater fish of Europe, the taxonomic status of the deviating form was more closely examined, and Freyhof with M. Schulz described it as a separate species on the basis of its spring spawning season and small size. They named it in honor of German literary figure Theodor Fontane, whose last completed novel, Der Stechlin, used Lake Stechlin's landscape as a backdrop. The Stechlin cisco represents the extreme of a pattern of cisco adaptive radiations into dwarf, spring- spawning, cold-tolerant forms in northern European lakes after the last glacial period 12,000 years ago. The results of this evolution in various lakes were formerly considered to be single species, Coregonus trybomi, but mitochondrial DNA and allozyme studies show that the spring-spawning populations in various lakes each evolved independently from the vendace. As of 2009, the Stechlin cisco was one of only three of these dwarf species that had been scientifically described, the third being Coregonus lucinensis from the lake Breiter Luzin, from the Gro√üer Stechlinsee.  Distribution  This species is restricted to the Gro√üer Stechlinsee (also called Lake Stechlin), near the town of Stechlin in the north of Brandenburg state in Germany. Lake Stechlin is a deep, cool, chalky, oligotrophic lake of recent glacial origin. Lake Stechlin has an area of and reaches a maximum depth of and a mean depth of . In Lake Stechlin, this species and the vendace (Coregonus albula) make up 95 percent of the fish biomass. Lake Stechlin is part of Stechlin-Ruppiner Land Nature Park, and there are no threats to this species, so it is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.  Ecology  Stechlin ciscoes feed primarily on cladocerans and copepods. They are found throughout the lake, though they are generally pelagic in cool, deep water. They differ little in dietary preferences from the sympatric vendace, but they differ substantially in habitat. They live to be four to five years old, and spawn in the spring, unlike the vendace. They have been found to have a reduced metabolic rate as an adaptation to their habitat.

Early Life and Career Morris was born 15 June 1865 in Winchester, England to auctioneer Thomas Shewell Morris (1832‚Äì1877) and Harriet Chick (d.1865) of St John's Place.Cinamon, G.

Upon his father's death in 1877, and aged 12, he was placed in the guardianship of Emily and her brother Joseph Morris (1836‚Äì1913) in Reading, Berkshire. Possibly affected by his father's illness, Emily noted that between June 1874 and Christmas 1877 Talwin had suffered \\"a nervous illness... said by the medical man to have been a phase of hysteria\\".Lancing College (2006) ‚ÄòTalwin Morris (1965-1911): artist and designer‚Äô, Lancing College magazine Chosen for a theological career by Emily, from 21 September 1880 he attended Second's House of Lancing College in West Sussex, notably playing the role of Lady Plato in John Baldwin Blackstone's farce A Rough Diamond, before withdrawing from his studies in April 1882.

He was later described however by artist Mary Newbery Sturrock (1892-1985) as \\"a tall pale-complexioned man, who favoured the dress of the artist of the day, in clock and wide-brimmed hat\\". Between 1882 and 1885 he was articled to the architectural firm his uncle Joseph Morris ran with Spencer Slingsby Smallwood at 9 Friar Street in Reading, Berkshire, winning a prize in 1885 in the Berkshire Archaeological and Architectural Society's drawings competition.Arnold, H. G. & Gold, S. M. (1989) Morris of Reading: a family of architects. London: Ancient Monuments Society, pp.55-57 The practice specialised in church architecture, and Morris's sketchbooks from this time are full of renderings of Norman doorways, fonts and arches from the surrounding villages of Tidmarsh, Purley on Thames, Swallowfield, Silchester, Cholsey, Finchampstead and White Waltham. Today some of these sketches are held in the collection of Glasgow Museums. Following his apprenticeship, he obtained work in London between 1885 and 1890 with architect James Martin Brooks (1859-1903). Despite this training he seems not to have registered with the Royal Institute of British Architects.Correspondence between Mr Gold and British Architectural Library held in biographical file on Talwin Morris at Library of Royal Institute of British Architects In 1888 he became engaged to his second cousin Alice Marsh (1861‚Äì1955), daughter of Joseph, a miller and Justice of the Peace for Kingston upon Thames, and Ellen Grace Marsh. Alice would later go on to enjoy her own highly successful career as an author of children's books under the name Alice Talwin Morris. From 1891 he took up post as sub art-editor under M. H. Spielmann for Black and White, a new weekly magazine published by Cassell, designing many of its decorative initials and headpieces.Cinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.1, the first of which appeared on 3 October 1891 to illustrate a review of The American by Henry James. Here Morris provides a letter T with swirling nasturtiums, though the incorporated portrait of James is not by him. Other pieces were used to decorate individual stories, or to head up the 'Books' or 'Chess' sections, and were often reused long after Morris left the magazine. By 1892 he had also designed the masthead of Cassell's Saturday Journal. Around this time he was sharing rooms in Belle Vue Road, Kingston upon Thames with his second cousin, the miller and collector Ernest Marsh (1843-1945). On 21 May 1892 he and Alice finally married at St John's Parish Church in Kingston upon Thames, with his occupation listed on the marriage certificate as 'clerk'.Cinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.11 The marriage certificate was witnessed by his aunt Emily, Ernest Marsh, and members of Alice's immediate family. They lived at 1 Field Court, Gray's Inn, London, a short walk from the offices of Black and White at 33 Bouverie Street.Cinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.1 Move to Glasgow Responding to an advertisement placed in The Standard on 21 February 1893 for an Art Director for publishers Blackie and Son, he moved to Glasgow in May 1893. The advert specified \\"a competent draughtsman well versed in art matters, of some taste in literature, fitted to take charge of the scheming and production of book illustrations and decoration and able to carry on the correspondence concerned therewith\\". Whilst working for Blackie and Son, Morris continued to accept freelance commissions, such as mastheads for the popular Cassell periodical Magazine of Art. Morris soon made the acquaintance of the artists and designers associated with the Glasgow School of Art via Robert Blackie (1820-1896) who sat on the committee of the School from 1871 to 1892.Information from Glasgow School of Art Archives http://www.gsaarchives.net/ Although he never attended the School, Morris soon became friends with Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his contemporaries, and his own work quickly began to incorporate Glasgow Style motifs. He is known, for example, to have visited the art studio of the sisters Frances Macdonald and Margaret Macdonald at 128 Hope Street. Around 1897 Morris wrote an unpublished manuscript (commonly considered a piece for Studio Magazine) Concerning the Work of Margaret Macdonald, Frances Macdonald, Charles Mackintosh and Herbert McNair: an Appreciation which is now held by Glasgow Museums.Morris, T. (1897) 'Concerning the Work of Margaret Macdonald, Frances Macdonald, Charles Mackintosh and Herbert McNair: an Appreciation', unpublished manuscript, Glasgow Museums E.1946.5.x Responding to an advert of 1 March in the Glasgow Herald, he and Alice leased Dunglass Castle from July 1893 and began to design its interiors.Gleeson White, J. W. (1897) 'Some Glasgow designers and their work: part II', The Studio, XI(54), pp.227‚Äì236 Morris is also known to have been a keen collector of Martinware ceramics, a passion he shared with his cousin Ernest Marsh.Haslam, M.

(2016) 'Interconnections: Talwin Morris, Alice Morris and Ernest Marsh', The Bookplate Journal, 14(2), pp.110-115 The house was sold in July 1899 to the parents of his friends Margaret and Frances Macdonald, and Morris's interiors were subsequently completely remodelled by Mackintosh.See http://www.mackintosh-architecture.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/browse/display/?rs=353 Today, Dunglass Castle sits derelict within an oil refinery and is classified as a Building at Risk.See http://www.buildingsatrisk.org.uk/details/896833 The Morrisses moved to the newly built Torwood in Bowling, West Dunbartonshire where Morris could enjoy a garden studio.Cinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.1 He is incorrectly listed as Dalwin Morris in the 1901 census, and employed a domestic servant called Elizabeth Gourlay. Artist Mary Newbery Sturrock later recalled visiting the Morrisses as a little girl, and picking primroses on the hill at Torwood. Mackintosh also visited, and drew flowers in the garden. Influence on Book Design From 5 October-5 December 1896 Morris exhibited three book cover designs (The Universe, English Essays, and Daddy Samuel's Darling) at the fifth exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society at the New Gallery, London. Morris became hugely influential in Victorian book design by moving away from the popular narrative bindings of the time to a more modern Art Nouveau approach where line, curve and decoration are used to entice the reader. The book designs of Dante Gabriel Rossetti have been cited as a particular influence.Grieve, A. (1973) ‚ÄòRossetti‚Äôs applied art designs 2: book bindings‚Äô, Burlington Magazine, vol. 115, no. 839, pp.79-84 At Blackie and Son his output was prolific, producing many designs that could be printed in different colourways across series such as the Red Letter Library and Library of Famous Books. He also designed books for Morison Brothers of Glasgow, Cassell, J. G. Cotta of Stuttgart, J. C. C. Bruns of Minden, F. Volckmar, Mudie's Select Library, and from 1898 the Blackie subsidiary Gresham.Cinamon, G. (1981) 'Talwin Morris and the Glasgow Style: Part II', Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Newsletter, 29, pp.8‚Äì10 In 1906 he also supplied the cover design of the influential German magazine Dekorative Kunst. Though many of his book designs are unsigned, some feature his 'signature' of a single dot followed, after a pause, by a further two dots (a stylised rendition of his initials in morse code which would consist of a long dash followed by two shorted dashes). Others feature a stylised elongated TM monogram. During his tenure, Morris also commissioned book designs by designers such as Ethel Larcombe and Silver Studio.Gibbs, R. J. (2007) ‚ÄòDesigns for the serial titles of Blackie‚Äôs and Mudie‚Äôs by Talwin Morris, Ethel Larcombe and C. R. Mackintosh‚Äô, Journal of the Scottish Society for Art History, vol. 12, pp.22-26 Non-Book Design From 1893 Morris designed brass metalwork and textiles for his home Dunglass Castle, and several pieces now reside in the collection of the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery. His interior scheme at Dunglass later featured in an article for Studio Magazine. At the 1896 Arts and Crafts Exhibition he bought the watercolour Part Seen, Part Imagined from his friend Charles Rennie Mackintosh for 3 guineas, and designed his own frame to house the work (now in Glasgow Museums). In November‚ÄìDecember 1900, Morris exhibited a repouss√© bronze mirror at the 8th exhibition of the Vienna Secession, organised by the Vereinigung Bildender K√ºnstler √ñsterreichs and curated by Josef Hoffmann. Here his work was shown in room I, as opposed to room X which housed the work of Mackintosh and other Glasgow artists.. At the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1901, Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed a pavilion for the department store Pettigrew & Stephens, and Morris provided the accompanying poster. Around the same period, his work was featured in a special winter number of The Studio on jewellery and fans. Here a jewelled shoe buckle in copper, and a cloak clasp and waist band in beaten silver were featured In 1901 Morris produced designs for a dining room for Mrs Bruno Schroeder, now in Glasgow Museums. Also in 1901 he designed a scheme for a remodelled entrance to the Blackie works (at 17 Stanhope Street in the Townhead area of the city and built by Alexander 'Greek' Thomson), which included a pair of wrought iron grilles, swing doors, a stained glass fanlight, and fingerplates in beaten brass. In later years Agnes Blackie recalled \\"the appointment in 1892 [sic.] of a disciple of art nouveau, Talwin Morris, as head of the art department, had tangible effect, not only on the design of book covers, but on the appearance of the office at 17 Stanhope Street\\" Blackie, A. (1959) Blackie and Son 1809-1959: a short history of the firm, Glasgow, Blackie & Son, pp.42-43 Much of the scheme was lost when the Blackie Works were demolished in the 1960s and relocated to Bishopbriggs. In 1902 his work was selected for exhibition alongside those of his contemporaries at the influential Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna held in Turin, at which he sold a beaten metal mirror and received orders for four more.Buchanan, W. (2004) 'Talwin Morris, Blackie and the Glasgow Style', Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Journal, 87, p.10 The 'Scottish Section' had been organised by Francis Henry Newbery, Headmaster of Glasgow School of Art and consisted mostly of Glasgow artists across a suite of three rooms designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Also in 1902 he introduced Charles Rennie Mackintosh to his employer Walter Blackie (1860-1953), which led to Mackintosh receiving the commission to design Blackie's home, Hill House, Helensburgh.Blackie, W. W. (1968) 'Memories of Charles Rennie Mackintosh: II', Scottish Art Review, vol. 11, no. 4, pp. 6‚Äì11 Morris's own double candle sconce of a peacock hangs at Hill House. Around 1903‚Äì1904, Morris designed an ink stand in pewter and blue/green enamel for the Tudric range of Liberty & Co. An example is held in the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery. Designs for an overmantle, dining table, sideboard and bookcase for William Adlington Barrow Cadbury from this time are held in Glasgow Museums. In 1910, Morris designed the memorial of his employers the Blackie Family in Glasgow Necropolis, which was then carved by John Mossman. Death and Posthumous Reputation Morris retired at the age of 44 through ill-health in 1909 and was succeeded by his deputy A. A. Campbell. He died from a cardiac embolism on 29 March 1911 at just 45 years oldCinamon, G. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition. London: William Morris Gallery, p.2, leaving an estate valued at ¬£855 14s 7d. On 31 March 1911, notice of his funeral was published in the Glasgow Herald. His body lies in Dumbarton Cemetery, marked by a gravestone designed by his friend Charles Rennie Mackintosh at the behest of his widow Alice.A sketch and brief description were included in the journal British Architect, 11 October 1912. Mackintosh's pencil and wash designs for the monument are now held in the Hunterian Art Gallery collection, Glasgow.

This quotation had previously been used for Macleod's own memorial. At her own wish, Alice's ashes were later to join those of her husband, upon her death in 1955. His one piece of published writing, the 9th special supplement of Percy Venner Bradshaw's the Press Art School titled The Illustration of Children's Books, was published posthumously in 1912 with an addendum by his successor A. A. Campbell.A copy is held in the British Library.

He currently works as an independent quarterback coach in Tampa. College career Freshman Although a highly touted recruit, during his first semester on campus in the Spring of 2007, Garcia was suspended twice from practice after being arrested for public intoxication and, later, keying a professor's car. These charges were dropped after Garcia made restitution to the professor and completed a pre-trial intervention program. The following Spring, in March 2008, Garcia and two teammates were arrested and cited for underage drinking. That same evening, Garcia pulled a fire alarm and discharged a fire extinguisher in his dormitory. No formal charges were filed but, as a result of these incidents, Garcia was suspended from the university. After his reinstatement, as a redshirt freshman in the Fall of 2008, Garcia started three games for the Gamecocks. He was named SEC Freshman of the Week for his performance in a 24‚Äì17 victory over Kentucky (169 passing yards and 1 touchdown in a half of play).

It was also called the Upper Harz Railway or Harz Railway. It was built in order to enable the Magdeburg- Halberstadt Railway Company (Magdeburg-Halberst√§dter Eisenbahngesellschaft or MHE) to access the mines in the Harz mountains.  The Innerste Valley Railway  Viaduct over a country road shortly before the terminus Former railway station in Lautenthal Former railway station in Wildemann The Innerste Valley Railway was built between 1874 and 1914 and linked several formerly isolated mountain villages in the Upper Harz to the existing railway network in the northern Harz Foreland. The railway was built in 1875 by the MHE from its marshalling yard at Vienenburg through Grauhof and Langelsheim to Lautenthal. Its original passenger services to Langelsheim on the Vienenburg‚ÄìLangelsheim railway via Grauhof ended as early as 1884 and all traffic ceased in 1954; a direct line to Goslar being employed instead. Until the cessation of regular services in 1976 the line branched off at Langelsheim station from the existing Neuekrug-Hahausen‚ÄìGoslar railway and ran past the halt of Innerstetalsperre (before the construction of the dam there was a halt at Lindthal, now under water) to Lautenthal, from there through the Innerste valley via Wildemann, Silbernaal-Grund halt and Silberh√ºtte station, later renamed Frankenscharrnh√ºtte, to Clausthal-Zellerfeld. From 1914 trains were able to run from there to the terminus of Altenau passing through the station at Clausthal Ost.  Planning and construction  There had been ideas about building such a line, important to the mining industry in the Upper Harz, for a long time. But the narrow Innerste valley posed major problems for a standard gauge railway. In 1874 the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway Company began work and bored a tunnel through the Gallenberg in Wildemann, which was finished in July 1875. Services to Clausthal started on 15 October 1877 and, in 1914, the line was extended to Altenau.  Changes and end  In the 100-year history of the Innerste Valley Railway there were many changes. More and more mines were closed, the Second World War took it one stage further and in the mid-1950s mail services between Goslar and Altenau were withdrawn and transferred to the road. At the beginning of the 1960s significant construction work was needed and the line had to be moved when the valley was flooded during the building of the Innerste Dam. The end was signalled when, in 1967 the mines in Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Lautenthal were closed. Goods traffic reduced dramatically and finally ceased completely. Passenger numbers no longer covered the costs and so the Deutsche Bundesbahn announced the line's closure. The last timetabled trains ran on 29 May 1976. For the line's centenary celebrations of the Langelsheim‚ÄìClausthal line special trains ran on 15 and 16 October 1977 hauled by the oil-fired steam locomotive no. 41 096, after when the track was lifted and the railway buildings sold. It was reported that, as \\"the revenge of the Innerste Valley Railway\\", a locomotive employed to lift the track derailed because the section of track in front of it had already been removed.  Yesterday and today  Footpath on the line of the old Innerste Valley Railway The bridges and viaducts of the Innerste Valley Railway still mark parts of the Upper Harz. From the B 242 between Seesen and Clausthal-Zellerfeld and the old country road between Clausthal- Zellerfeld and Altenau in the Heller valley there are still good views of the impressive structures. All the station buildings and some of the other small buildings remain. The old trackbed of the Innerste Valley Railway is now a walking and cycle path in summer and a cross-country skiing trail in winter. The cycle path is part of the Lower Saxon long-distance route (RFW No. 5), the Weser-Harz-Heide cycle route, which runs from the L√ºneburg Heath over the Harz to Rhumequelle, then via G√∂ttingen to Hann. M√ºnden. The northern portal of the tunnel is blocked with rubble. At the southern end there is a memorial tablet on the right-hand side.

Eight people were killed by gunmen in a car, who shot randomly in a bar in the Sabana Seca barrio of Toa Baja, 15 miles from San Juan. Twenty people, some related to two different bands between drug dealers, were wounded in the shooting. The two gunmen, Alexis Candelario-Santana, 42, and David Oquendo-Rivas, were convicted by a federal jury on March 8, 2013, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Puerto Rico Man Sentenced to Life in Prison in 2009 Mass Shooting. U.S. Department of Justice. San Juan Office. Office of Public Affairs. San Juan, Puerto Rico. 28 August 2013.  The Shooting  On October 17, 2009, at approximately 11:50pm, Alexis Candelario Santana and David Oquendo-Rivas arrived at the grand opening of the La T√≥mbola pub. Armed with several types of semi-automatic pistols assault rifles including .9mm semi-automatic pistols, 40 caliber semi- automatic pistols, 45 caliber semi-automatic pistols, AK-47 and AR-15 type assault rifle, the pair opened fire on the patrons congregating outside of the pub. They soon entered the building and continued to fire rounds throughout the establishment. Among those deceased included six men (three of which were Candelario-Santana godson, Rond√≥n-Feliciano's stepson and Candelario-Santana's cousin) one pregnant woman, and her unborn child. Another 19 pub patrons were injured and taken to Rio Piedras Medical Center where three of those injured underwent surgery for their wounds.  The Trial  This incident was investigated by the FBI alongside the Puerto Rico Police Department. Documents spanning from 1993 to 2003 which were used as evidence to convict Candelario- Santana showed that he controlled a drug trafficking organization centered in the Sabana Seca area of Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. Candelario-Santana's organization sold numerous drugs bought from several sellers including crack, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. The trial also introduced evidence that Candelario-Santana either orchestrated or committed the murders himself of 13 people he thought posed a threat to his operation between 1995 and 2001. The assailants, Alexis Candelario-Santana and David Oquendo-Rivas, faced life in prison after being convicted on March 8, 2013, for the murders of eight individuals, an unborn child, and the attempted murder of the other twenty injured people. Both were brought up on the following charges; 28 counts of violent crime in aid of criminal activity, one count of criminal conspiracy, nine counts firearm possession and use during a crime of violence, one count of drug trafficking, and one count of possession of a firearm with a prior conviction as Candelario-Santana previously been incarcerated. On August 23, 2017 the federal court ordered a new trial seeking the death penalty for both defendants starting with jury selection on August 1, 2018.

It is a area with over a thousand graves, at least 100 of which are those of Revolutionary War dead or veterans . The cemetery was established prior to the war, but became known as a burial ground for casualties of the conflict when many were buried there, particularly after the nearby Battle of Saratoga, when a hundred bodies were reportedly put in one mass grave. More of the conflict's dead are buried here than in any other graveyard in Washington County, and possibly the state. The cemetery has suffered some neglect over the years, but that has slowly been reversed since it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Property The cemetery is a roughly rectangular area surrounded by a slate fence, 3 feet (1 m) high by 2¬Ω feet (76 cm) extending southwest from the south side of Archibald Street. On its south side is farmland. The neighborhood is residential and the houses across the street are small. The surrounding hills can be seen from the cemetery. It is generally flat with some mounds. It is just to the south of the village's historic district. Outside the main entrance's two wrought iron gates (one for pedestrians and the other for carriages) on granite posts are two signs. One is a two-sided marble obelisk whose inscription honoring the veterans buried here indicates it was placed jointly by the town and state in 1933. It is considered a contributing object to the Register listing. The other sign, a blue-and-yellow historical marker similar to those used by the state, was placed by the village in 1962. Past the entrance a wide path runs across the cemetery. It passes a cluster of mounded family vaults and then enters the main ground, with many marble headstones. The majority face east, the preferred orientation for graves in the 18th century. Their full number was not known until a Daughters of the American Revolution count in 1954 which put the number at 1,040, dating from 1769 to 1923. A recount in 1998 found 58 more, bringing the total to 1,098. Two more mounded family vaults are located against the rear wall. A fenced-off plot belonging to the Law family is against the north wall. There are some footstones, and 10 slate table stones, but the majority are headstones. The earliest graves are clustered against the north side, including three in red sandstone, a rare material for 18th-century Washington County graveyards. Many of them have unusual stones with carved funerary art by Zeruabel Collins, a local stonecutter. History The cemetery was founded a few years after Salem was first settled by a combination of migrants from Massachusetts and religious refugees from Ireland. The first known burial is Solomon Barr in 1767, the year the cemetery was formally established. Local legend has it that the next one was an unknown local Indian who wandered into the settlement and died. The earliest existing gravestone is that of Abram Savage, who died in 1769 at the age of 18. Many of the early burials were people of regional historical significance. James Turner's family owned the Turner Patent, the local land grant. Joshua Conkey and his wife Dinah were both present at the nearby Battle of Bennington. St. John Honeywood was a Yale graduate who was the second principal of the local school. A poet and painter as well, his version of \\"Darby and Joan\\" is still anthologized today. The local men buried in the cemetery who served in the war did so for the most part as members of the White Creek Militia, some later becoming part of the Continental Army. In addition to the nearby battles like Bennington and Saratoga, some saw action further from home at places like Monmouth. There are roughly a hundred known to have served. If the men supposedly buried in a mass grave after Saratoga were to be confirmed as buried here, that number would be doubled, making it one of the largest burial sites of Revolutionary War soldiers in the country. Local stonecutter Zeruabel Collins is credited with 36 of the cemetery's stones, including Savage's, the first. Those use funerary art similar to that of his father, also a stonecutter. Later ones show his own style, characterized by a deeply cut face with prominent jaw, small wings arising from it, positioned above an intricate twisted scroll-like floral motif. Also unusual in the cemetery are the sod-covered burial mounds. These were possibly a custom brought from Scotland or Ireland by that group of settlers. They are made of dry laid-up slate with an east-facing Roman arch sealed with stones and an iron gate. An empty one that has been examined suggests the masons took great care with their work. In 1791 the town created a committee drawn from its two Presbyterian congregations to oversee the cemetery, hire a supervisor and build a fence to deter gravestone theft and illegal burials. It appears that this later task was not accomplished until 1870 when money was made available. Thirty years later, in 1821, the cemetery received its oldest decedent, when 104-year-old James McNish, father of Lt. Alexander McNish, Esq., died September 18 and was laid to rest. Almost four decades after that, a new rural cemetery was opened west of the villages, and burials at the Revolutionary War Cemetery began to decline. After 1898, only one burial, that of John Gillis in 1923, took place, and then under special permit. After the Register listing, in 1999, the Salem Cemetery Committee was formed to restore and oversee the Revolutionary War Cemetery as well as two others in the town. It took photographs of the gravestones and found that half of them had either been knocked over or were in danger of falling. Others were buried and overgrown, and a lightning strike later damaged a section of the wall. The committee has put out information brochures, compiled lists of those buried, put American flag holders next to the headstones of veterans, and promulgated regulations for the taking of stone rubbings.

It was inspired by Steve Brodie, who in 1886 claimed to have jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge and survived. The story centers around Hop Kelly, a daredevil busboy. Some Bowery gamblers try to prevent him from surviving a jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. The 1965 musical is notable for having closed after its opening night performance on Broadway, becoming one of the biggest flops in Broadway history. Background Inspired by the 1880s tale of Brooklyn Bridge-jumper Steve Brodie, the musical features period characters Diamond Jim Brady, Frank and Jesse James, Tony Pastor, Lillian Russell and John L. Sullivan. Of the show's origins, Eddie Lawrence, lyricist and librettist, recalled that: \\"Moose Charlap had finished doing his songs for Peter Pan, starring Mary Martin, and a couple of one-acts of mine were being performed while I toured late night TV plugging my comedy album. During the afternoons, we worked on Kelly. It was a labour of love.\\"Sleeve notes for CD Kelly.

Broadway Musicals, 1943‚Äì2004, McFarland, 2006 Lawrence further recalls that \\"we ran into some producers who said they'd been waiting for this show all their lives and wanted to present it on Broadway.\\" The show's original producer was Broadway stalwart Edward Padula (in association with January Productions), whose deal included a motion picture adaptation.Sleeve notes for LP Eddie Lawrence and Moose Charlap sing their Songs from Kelly. Original Cast Records OC8025 (1980) Toward the end of 1963, it was reported that the budget had been set at $350,000, with $100,000 to be invested by Roulette Records. At this early stage, a number of actors were named as possible leads. Impressionist Frank Gorshin and film actor Richard Harris were both considered for the lead male role, while Mark Charlap's wife, pop singer Sandy Stewart, was considered for the lead female role. Lindsey Anderson was engaged as the show's director. Rehearsals were scheduled to start on 27 January 1964, with a Broadway opening planned for March. None of this, however, came to pass. By April of that year, the show had been taken up by new producers, David Susskind, Daniel Melnick, and Joseph E. Levine of Embassy Pictures. Levine financed $250,000 of the $400,000 budget, with the balance coming from Columbia Records and six other investors. The sponsors acquired the motion picture rights by placing a down payment of $500, with the ultimate cost rising to a maximum of $650,000 based on a percentage of ticket sales for each of the show's profitable weeks.Zolotow, Sam. \\"New Group Plans to Put On 'Kelly'; Levine, Susskind, Melnick Will Produce Musical\\", The New York Times, April 17, 1964. Accessed October 18, 2009. Before its Broadway opening, the show was presented for three weeks in Philadelphia and half a week in Boston. While Kelly was in tryouts, roles played by Ella Logan, Jack Creley, and Avery Schreiber were cut by show doctors Leonard Stern and Mel Brooks. Pre-Broadway promotion for the show included an event on the Brooklyn Bridge with a series of chorus girls.\\"City Lends the Brooklyn Bridge to Show Girls and Press Agent\\", The New York Times, October 28, 1964, accessed October 18, 2009. Directed and choreographed by Herbert Ross, the musical began previews at the Broadhurst Theatre on February 1, 1965 and opened (and closed) on February 6 after seven previews and one performance. The cast included Wilfrid Brambell, Don Francks, Anita Gillette, Mickey Shaughnessy, Eileen Rodgers, and Jesse White. Scenic design was by Oliver Smith, costume design by Freddy Wittop, and lighting design by Tharon Musser.Kelly at the Internet Broadway Database The show's logo, which featured on posters and playbills (and, much later, on the LP and CD covers) was designed by French-born illustrator Tomi Ungerer, who was then (and remains) best known for his children's picture books. Industry representatives quoted in The New York Times stated they \\"could not recall any other Broadway musical representing such a comparable expenditure that became a casualty so quickly.\\" Costs had ballooned to $650,000, with the biggest loser being Levine, followed by Melnick and Susskind, who had invested a total of $150,000. There had been increasing arguments between the producers and writers, with Susskind complaining that the authors were unwilling to make changes per the recommendations of the investors. Charlap and Lawrence were so upset with changes that they filed suit in New York Supreme Court seeking an injunction to prevent the play from opening. While the judge urged that the parties pursue arbitration, lawyers representing Charlap and Lawrence were threatening to sue for damages that had been caused through \\"unauthorized changes, omissions and additions\\" made to the musical.Zolotow, Sam. \\"$650,000 'Kelly' Lasts One Night; Joseph E.

In his review in The New York Times, critic Howard Taubman opened by noting that \\"Ella Logan was written out of Kelly before it reached the Broadhurst Theater Saturday night. Congratulations, Miss Logan,\\" and continued to describe what he saw as a production for which there were \\"ample critical, if not legal, grounds for an injunction,\\" lampooning the legal wrangling that had gone on about the production.Taubman, Howard. \\"Theater: 'Kelly' Opens at Broadhurst; Musical Comedy About Old New York\\", The New York Times, February 8, 1965.

October 18, 2009. Later that year, there were reports of an off-Broadway revival of the show, to be produced by David Rubinson of Columbia Records. This was intended to present the show in its original form, as conceived by Lawrence and Charlap, as opposed to the much-revised and re-written version that finally opened on Broadway. Synopsis In 1880s New York, teenage busboy Hop Kelly, an Irish immigrant, is a sentimental daredevil who wants to make a successful jump from the Brooklyn Bridge and become a hero. He has chickened out of three attempts already. A group of Bowery gamblers are betting against him surviving the jump, and they don't like the suspense. They decide to throw a dummy off the bridge in his place, but Hop really wants to make the jump, and eventually he successfully does so. Original recordings Although Columbia Records were one of the show's original backers, no cast album was ever commercially recorded. As was typical at the time, a demonstration recording of the show's score was recorded by its composer and lyricist/librettist at an early stage in its inception. Produced by Frank Military in 1964, the recording was performed by Charlap and Lawrence themselves, and included thirteen songs from the score. Because the show subsequently underwent considerable revision, this demo recording included several songs that were eventually cut from the show, or otherwise went unused in the produced version. The demo recording, which was only ever intended as a limited edition for private circulation amongst potential backers and so on, was finally commercially released in 1980, fifteen years after the showed closed. The LP, simply entitled Eddie Lawrence and Moose Charlap sing their songs from the Musical Kelly formed part of a series of albums on the Original Cast label, founded in 1975 by Bruce Yeko and Doris Chu Yeko, which specialised in obscure musical theatre recordings. The album's executive producers were the Yekos and Eddie Lawrence. It was dedicated to the memory of Moose Charlap, who died in 1974. Moose Charlap's wife, Sandy Stewart, who was a cabaret and jazz vocalist, released her own pop version of the song \\"Never Go There Anymore\\" in 1965, with a lush arrangement by Don Costa. The song subsequently become something of a standard. In 2000, it was described by Stephen Sondheim as one of the songs that he wishes that he'd written, at least in part.Rich, Frank. \\"Conversations With Sondheim\\", The New York Times Magazine, March 12, 2000, accessed December 12, 2016 Concert recording In 1998, the York Theatre Company in New York City presented a concert version of Kelly as part of its \\"musicals in mufti\\" series spotlighting neglected Broadway scores. Performers included Brian D'Arcy James, Jane Connell, George S. Irving, John Schuck, Marcia Lewis, and Sandy Stewart, who was in the original production. Interest in the concert among theatre buffs resulted in sold-out performances and a cast recording.Kenrick, John. \\"Flops on CD: I to M\\", Musicals101.com, 2003, accessed December 12, 2016 The concert recording was released by Original Cast records, the same label that had released the demo recording in 1980.

This recording, which reflected the original score before all the revisions took place on the road, included a number of songs were later cut from the show or had not otherwise been used in the Broadway production.

In 2016, Comboios de Portugal decided to sell the historic locomotive stationed at the Tua station to a foreigner, a decision that generated some controversy. On 11 March, the president of the municipal council of Carrazeda de Ansi√£es asked that the government step-in reverse its sale. Architecture The front facade of the railway station The passenger platform at the Tua station The station is situated in an isolated position along the riverway. A little distance from the station, implanted to the east, is the old train roundhouse/terminal. The platform is quite small, about , situated between a hilltop and gentle surface that descends to the riverbank. Between the station and the river is a roadway. According to a report, it was difficult (without affecting the departures at the site) to enlarge the slope side, without excavating a trench on ground of compact shales. The work would be very expensive due to the volume of excavating the material. Expanding to the riverside, requiring landfill and installation of supporting walls, would not provide enough space, because the Douro was quite close (and would result in blocking the riverway in the process. The solution at the time was to dig from the sides and side of the river, exploiting the stone and debris to build a supporting wall and embankment. In this way, the surface of the station would be widened sufficiently for the station lines. The work required prior agreement with C.N., the Junta Aut√≥noma das Estradas (Autonomous Roads Board) and Direc√ß√£o dos Servi√ßos Hidr√°ulico (Hydraulic Services Directorate), and an estimated cost of 2100 contos: excavations to the rock (240 contos), supporting wall, embankment and diverting the road (1060 contos), new rail lines (140 contos), extensions of the pier and warehouses (10 contos), new platforms (140 contos), extending the building (150 contos), equipment (scales, etc.) (40 contos), fencing (20 contos), various and unforeseen tasks (200 contos).

The family was described by Patrik Inderbitzin in 2001, and the order Jahnulales was created in 2002 to accommodate the family. The distinguishing characteristic for members of the family are the unusually wide hyphae (\\"widest hyphae reported in the ascomycetes\\") that support the spore- bearing structures, and the presence of ascomata both with and without stalks. The genus Aliquandostipe has a pantropical distribution, having been found in Central America and southeast Asia; Jahnula has a wider distribution. Species in the family are saprobic, and are typically found growing on rotting wood. Taxonomy The name of the type genus Aliquandostipite is derived from the Latin aliquando meaning sometimes, and stipite with a stalk. Description Like other members in the class Dothideomycetes, species of the Aliquandostipitaceae are characterized by having a bilayered ascus wall that develops in what a called a lysogenic cavity; the internal structures of the ascus (the centrum) are contained within a compact hyphal body, called the ascoma. Family Aliquandostipitaceae members are those that have features similar to the holotype genus, Aliquandostipite, which is characterized by having ascomata that are immersed, bursting through the surface (erumpent), or above the surface (superficial). The hamathecium (a general term for tissue between the asci that projects inwards in the internal cavity of the ascus) is made of cells known as pseudoparaphyses, defined as hyphae that originate above the level of the asci and grow downwards between the developing asci. The asci are bitunicate (with differentiated inner and outer walls) or fissitunicate (bitunicate asci with a 'jack-in-the-box' design). The mycelia of the fungus is visible on the substratum (the layer immediately under the growing surface), and made up of thick hyphae (up to 50 ¬µm wide) that may bear ascomata.  Distribution and habitat  Species in the type genus Aliquandostipite have been found in tropical locales including Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, and Guangdong Province in China, on branches and sticks either lying on the ground or submerged in water. Species in the genera Patescospora and Jahnula have been found in Egypt, Thailand, and China; in 2006, several new Jahnula species were found in North and Central America.

This is a monotypic taxon, containing the single genus Loramyces; the genus contains two aquatic species, L. juncicola, named by American mycologist William H. Weston in 1929, and L. macrosporus, first described by C.T. Ingold and B. Chapman in 1952. Taxonomy In his 1929 publication, Weston never designated an order or family for the genus Loramyces, mentioning difficulties resolving its taxonomic placement. The genus has been placed historically in several different families in the outdated Sphaeriales order, including the Halosphaeriaceae, the Sphaeriaceae, the Loramycetaceae, and the Trichosphaeriaceae. The taxonomy of the genus was reevaluated in 1987, and was named by S. Digby and R.D. Goos in 1987. Species in the family are found in North America and Europe, where they grow in a saprobic fashion on submerged, decaying plant tissue. Description Members of the family Loramycetaceae lack stromata, the compact mass of mycelium (with or without host tissue) that supports fruit bodies or in which fruiting bodies are produced. The ascomata, which are formed within a gelatinous matrix, are deeply cup-shaped, almost like a perithecium. The outer tissue layer of the ascomata is thin-walled and translucent. The ascospores are 2-septate, translucent, and have a long basal cellular appendage with a gelatinous sheath. This sheath is thought to play the role of a \\"flotation mechanism\\", and ultimately give the ascospores a greater chance to become attached to the upper part of the host plant. The black ascomata of Loramyces juncicola reach diameters of roughly 1.5-2 mm; they are shaped like flattened spheres when mature. Atop the ascomata are openings (ostioles) that are 20‚Äì30 ¬µm wide and that protrude from the surface. After the ascomata have released their grey- colored ascospores, the top portion typically disintegrates leaving a partially closed cup. The spores of this species are hyaline, thin-walled, and spindle-shaped with dimensions of 17‚Äì22 ¬µm long and 4‚Äì6 ¬µm wide. The ascospores, which are surrounded by a gelatinous matrix, are divided into two cells by a septa. The apical cell has a bluntly rounded point, while the basal cell is thin and thread-like, bearing a slightly curved tail-like appendage. Habitat The species Loramyces juncicola was originally found on growing dead, partly softened stems of Juncus militaris that were submerged in fresh water to a depth of a few inches to as much as a few feet in a pond on Nashawena Island, off the Massachusetts coast. The habitat, situated a short distance inland, was buffered from the motion of waves by a thick growth of the Juncus plants that also partially shaded the water. It is known that warmer water inhibits the growth of ascomata, but it is not clear whether this is due to inhibition of the Loramyces fungus, or growth enhancement of bacteria that compete for nutrients. The gel-like substance surrounded the fruit bodies probably helps prevent the fungus from drying out when exposed to air by sinking water levels.

Species in the family have a widespread distribution in both temperate and tropical oceans, and are typically found growing on submerged wood or on seaweed. In 2000, Molecular analysis of several species of Lulworthia and Lindra led to the reassignment of their parent genera to the new order Lulworthiales in addition to the new family Lulworthiaceae. History and taxonomy The type genus Lulworthia was originally described in 1916 by George Kenneth Sutherland to contain the species Lulworthia fucicola, a fungus found on the seaweed commonly known as the bladder wrack at Lulworth on the coast of Dorset, UK. The fungus has since been collected several times from submerged wood, but never again from the original algal host; it was subsequently reported that specimens found on wood were morphologically different from those originally described growing on algae. Since the original specimens had deteriorated beyond use, a holotype was designated, using submerged-wood specimens found in Chile in 1984. The genus Rostrupiella was created in 2007 to contain the species Rostrupiella danica, a Lulworthia-like species collected on driftwood found along the Danish coast and from the northwestern coast of the USA. Lulworthia fucicola was originally found on the algae Fucus vesiculosus Description The ascomata, roughly spherical to cylindrical in shape, may be either embedded in or on the material to which the fruit body is attached. Atop the ascomata is a small rounded process with an opening (an ostiole) through which ascospores may be released. The brown- to black-colored ascomata can be either leathery (coriaceous) or dark-colored and readily broken (carbonaceous). The internal structure of the ascomata, the centrum, is at first filled with a transparent pseudoparenchyma (a type of tissue made of hyphae that are twisted and matted together) dissolves upon reaching maturity.

Biography He was born in Tursi in the province of Matera. He had a very troubled childhood, his mother dying prematurely.Albino Pierro, A land of ricorde His childhood was also characterized by a disease that often the sight forced him to live his days in the shadows: > When I was a child I stood in the corners of the rooms > and the dark little eyes > my stinging, red (and how) covered nettle. > They said the country > that I would become blind ...Albino Pierro, When I was a child As a teenager, after a period of frequent journeys, to Taranto, Salerno, Sulmona, Udine and Novara, he settled finally, in Rome in 1939. He graduated in 1944 in philosophy, and in 1946 began his career as a letter published in various collections in the language, until in 1959 with A land we remember which began its production in dialect Tourist Office. Since then he pulled away from the language of his native land, where the militant criticism reflected the deepest impressions of the Romance languages, thanks to phonic resources and symbolic idiom. Through careful and continuous work and formal metrics, Pierro was able to recreate the dialect, and the evocative atmosphere related to the memory of his childhood, which returned to him many regret that contribute to the pain inside due to the distance from his land. > ...How am I to do, my Madonna, > as I do? > I've left the country > which gave me the breath of heaven, > and now in this town, > I slam in his face only the walls, > many things haunt me and cries, > like a vermicaio ...Albino Pierro, was written on his face In 1976, has won the award Carducci for poetry.

Macdonald, first Prime Minister of Canada, by sculptor George Edward Wade (1853-1933), located at Place du Canada in the Montreal's Dominion Square.  Work  At the top, an allegorical female figure carrying a horn of plenty represents Canada. Below, the children symbolize the seven provinces that made up Canada at the time. The bronze is housed under a stone baldachin replete with copper bas reliefs of industrial and agricultural trades practised in the Dominion he first commanded. While the plaza is arranged along the skewed cardinality characteristic of Montreal, Macdonald looks west-northwest, under a canopy created by trades, at the vast expanse awaiting the command coming from Montreal. Also, he faces off against the tribute to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, across the street in what is now Dorchester Square. The two cannons flanking the monument were used at Sevastopol in the Crimean War and were a gift from Queen Victoria to the City of Montreal in 1892, to mark the 250th anniversary of the founding of the city.  History  The monument was unveiled by John Hamilton-Gordon, Earl of Aberdeen, Governor General of Canada on 6 June 1895. Vandalism and calls for removal Reassessments of Macdondald's role in Canadian history, particularly his assimilationist policies toward Indigenous Canadians and racist views of Asian immigrants, led to statues of Macdonald being removed and sometimes vandalized in other cities in the first decades of the 21st century. Since 2017, the Monument has itself been subjected to repeated vandalism, and was painted blue during an Extinction Rebellion protest.https://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/canada/2019/3/21/1_4346453.html Renewed calls for removal In the midst of the anti-racism protests of 2020, which took place worldwide in solidarity with those following the killing of George Floyd while in police custody, and the removal of Confederate Army statues in the United States, Canadian cities have seen a rise in calls to remove Macdonald statues, and those of others linked to Canada's colonial legacy. Early in June, it was reported that the Monument was on a list of fifteen statues across Canada subject to petition for removal, with a Change.org petition begun in Montreal calling for the Monument's removal having garnered 2100 signatures as of 8 June. Several sculptures and monuments depicting historical figures across Canada \\"with ties to racist elements of Canada's past\\" were defaced, including a park bench statue of Macdonald covered in red paint in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. On 29 August 2020, during a defund the police protest, the statue in the monument was vandalized, toppled and decapitated. Montreal Mayor Val√©rie Plante condemned the actions and said the city plans to restore the statue.  Gallery  Image:Dedication of Sir John A.

The organization provides ethical standards for the usage of nonhuman animals in laboratories. Its goal is to prevent harmful conduct on animals. The CCAC was established in 1968 by the National Research Council at the request of the Medical Research Council. Its initial goal was to \\"investigate the care and use of experimental animals in Canada\\", with a mandate \\"to work for the improvement of animal care and use on a Canada-wide basis\\". The organization is a non-legislated, participatory, peer review system‚Äîall experimental care and use of animals in Canada is subject to its rules and regulations. The organization explains its position on the use of animals in research: The CCAC uses assessment panels, which meet with personnel from research institutions such as colleges and universities, to evaluate animal care and use within the facilities. While there, the panels interview individual investigators and observe specific techniques. If an institution does not meet the standards set by the CCAC, then the CCAC issues recommendations to the offending institution, typically for housekeeping or facility maintenance concerns. Research in which vertebrates or cephalopods are used in Canada are subject to the requirements of the CCAC; however, research can be exempt if shown to be necessary. The CCAC was funded entirely by annual grants from the Medical Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, two of Canada's largest granting agencies, from the organization's inception in 1968 to 1994.

Music career The group was formed during the final stages of Superstar Tour and consisted of the three female members who were proclaimed winners of the contest: Laura Pisu (born October 18, 1984 in Cagliari), Emma Marrone (born May 25, 1984 in Florence, but raised in Aradeo) and Colomba Pane (born May 15, 1985 in Naples). Their debut single \\"Stile\\" was presented at Italian Music Awards (IMA), the single was released on 19 December 2003 through Universal Music and reached the #24 in the Italian Singles Chart. After the first single the group began recording their debut album. During the recording of the album, many misunderstandings and disagreements between the girls have begun. Consequently, the group went in hiatus in 2004 and the recording of the debut album was shelved. In 2005 the girls have announced the end of the hiatus, announcing that they are now working on a total different project and on a new kind of music and they announced the upcoming release of their very first album through Universal Music. The group has recorded the soundtrack of the cartoon W.I.T.C.H, which aired on Italia 1 with great success. In May 2006 was finally released their debut album LS3, an English language album with 90s dance influence. The album consists of eleven tracks: the W.I.T.C.H soundtrack, six dance tracks sung together, one solo song for each of the three girls (\\"Don't leave me\\" for Laura, \\"Catchy\\" for Emma and \\"Yes, I'm cool\\" for Colomba) and a cover of Ace of Base's All That She Wants. The album has been a commercial failure due to poor promotion. The release of \\"Day To Come\\" as promotional single was then cancelled. The group broke up after few months after the album release. After the official break-up, Emma Marrone recorded an album with the rock group Mjur, released through Dracma Records in 2008. In 2009 Marrone took part of the ninth edition of the talent show Amici di Maria De Filippi, which relaunched her music career. Emma won the competition, and in March 2010 Emma's debut solo EP Oltre and the first single \\"Calore\\" were released. The single and EP were both #1 in Italian Charts. Emma is nowadays a notable solo artist in Italy and also internationally. She took part twice at the Sanremo Music Festival, the first time in 2011 along with Mod√† with the song \\"Arriver√†\\" and the second time in 2012, where she won the festival with the song Non √® l'inferno. She also represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 with the song La mia citt√†. After Emma's big success as solo artist, the two CDs from Lucky Star (\\"Stile\\" CD single, but above all the \\"LS3\\" album CD) have become two ultra rare collector's items, difficult to find and with very high market value. Laura Pisu in 2010 appeared in Ligabue's music video for the single \\"Un Colpo All'Anima\\". She is notable in Sardinia to have been a vocalist in many discos, performing with the stage name of Velenia or Dea. In the web there are many cover songs recorded from Pisu as a solo artist. She is also a well-known animal rights activist. There aren't news about Colomba Pane, who has retired from the music business.

It is also closely related to the construct of unlimited love that has been expounded by Stephen G. Post. Compassionate love refers to love that \\"centers on the good of the other\\" (p. 3, Underwood, 2008Lynn G. Underwood (2008). Compassionate love: A framework for research. In Beverley Fehr, Susan Sprecher, & Lynn G. Underwood (Eds.), The Science of Compassionate Love: Theory, Research, and Applications (pp. 3-25) (table of contents), Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. ). It is distinct from altruism, compassion, and romantic love. Since 2001, the scientific study of compassionate love has received several million dollars in research support from the Fetzer Institute and the Institute for Research on Unlimited Love (IRUL). The emergence of the term compassionate love has been described by Lynn G. Underwood in a chapter in the first edited book on compassionate love research, The Science of Compassionate Love.Beverley Fehr, Susan Sprecher, & Lynn G. Underwood (Eds.), The Science of Compassionate Love: Theory, Research, and Applications (2008). (table of contents), Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. The term first emerged in the context of a research meeting at the World Health Organization (WHO) for developing tools to assess quality of life to be used in diverse cultures. The group included researchers from all over the world, from both religious and nonreligious backgrounds. One of the facets of interest was loving kindness, or love for others. Underwood writes that \\"There was considerable discussion of the appropriate wording for this aspect. The Buddhists were not happy with the word 'love' but wanted 'compassion' to be used, which for them fit the concept. The Muslims in the group (from Indonesia, India, and Turkey) were adamant that compassion was too 'cold' and that 'love' needed to be there as it brought in the feeling of love.... 'compassionate love' was the compromise phrase\\" (pp. 8-9, Underwood, 2008Underwood (2008). (see earlier reference for full citation)). Scientific research on compassionate love began to emerge after a 1999 conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that brought together several key theorists and researchers, and produced an edited book reflecting major ideas.Stephen G. Post, Lynn G. Underwood, Jeffrey P. Schloss, William B. Hurlbut (Eds.), Altruism and Altruistic Love: Science, Philosophy, and Religion in Dialogue (2002).(table of contents), New York: Oxford University Press. , Approaches to defining it According to Underwood's framework, which has informed a substantial portion of the scientific research, 5 key and defining features of compassionate love include: *Free choice for the other *Some degree of accurate cognitive understanding of the situation, the other, and oneself *Valuing the other at a fundamental level *Openness and receptivity *Response of the heartUnderwood (2008), pp 7-8. (see earlier reference for full citation) Underwood's approach was incorporated in the initial funding for scientific research on compassionate love, based on a Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by Fetzer Institute in 2001. Bioethicist and theologian Stephen G. Post's approach to altruistic love has also informed a substantial portion of the scientific research on compassionate love, although he more often uses the terms altruistic love and unlimited love. Post's understanding of unlimited love is presented in his 2003 book, Unlimited love: Altruism, compassion and serviceStephen G. Post (2003). Unlimited love: Altruism, compassion and service (2003). Philadelphia: Templeton Foundation Press. . Post draws on work published in the 1950s by eminent Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin, who described 5 dimensions of love (intensivity, extensivity, duration, purity, and adequacy). Compared to Underwood's definitions of compassionate love, Post's definition of unlimited love places greater emphasis on extensivity ‚Äì in particular, the extension of love to all human beings. Unlimited love as defined by Post might therefore be viewed as a subtype of compassionate love. Post's approach was incorporated in the second batch of funding for scientific research on compassionate love, based on an RFP issued by the Institute for Research on Unlimited Love in 2002. Health effects Several of the research projects on compassionate love that were funded by Fetzer and IRUL investigated health effects from engaging in compassionate love, which evidence suggests are primarily positive. Post edited a scholarly book that described many scientific findings related to compassionate love, altruism, and health.Stephen G.

Allen is an American professional wrestler and promoter, best known by his ringname \\"Big\\" Paulie Gilmore or Gilmorea, who wrestled on the New England independent circuit for the Century Wrestling Alliance, the National Wrestling Alliance, the Millennium Wrestling Federation and the World Wrestling Alliance during the 1990s and early 2000s. He is also the owner of New World Wrestling, a small promotion based in southeastern Massachusetts, which was formerly associated with NWA New England from 2004 to 2005. He is best remembered as Trooper Gilmore, a popular super heavyweight \\"fan favorite\\", in both the original Century Wrestling Alliance and NWA New England where he was a main rival of \\"heel\\" wrestler Tony Rumble. He also won the NWA New England Tag Team Championship with The Outpatient as Criminally Insane and Corporal Robinson as 5-0. He was an ally of MWF Tag Team Champions Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas during their feud with Ox Baker's MWF stable Ox's Army and, in NWW, twice won the promotion's tag team titles with Jimmy \\"Jact\\" Cash and Brutus \\"the Barber\\" Beefcake. He has also been a frequent opponent of King Kong Bundy and Abdullah the Butcher when touring the Northeastern United States. Career Century Wrestling Alliance (1996-1998) James E. Allen made his debut in 1994 and spent a brief time on the local independent circuit prior to joining the Century Wrestling Alliance in 1996. It was in the CWA that he would become a mainstay as Trooper Gilmore for over a decade. Appearing on the promotion's Public-access television cable TV show Mass Madness, he lost to Tombstone at the Harry DellaRusso Stadium in Revere, Massachusetts on June 27, 1997. On October 4, he fought twice in one night while at The Sports Palace in New Britain, Connecticut losing to both The Outpatient and King Kong Bundy. Two weeks later, Allen fought three matches in two separate events. The first was against Tombstone at the sold-out Good Time Emporium in Somerville, Massachusetts. Later that evening in Lawrence, he lost to El Diablo and Erich Sbraccia, the latter one half of the CWA Tag Team Champions with Knuckles Nelson. This event was also sold out. NWA New England (1998-2001) Allen remained with the promotion as it joined the National Wrestling Alliance as NWA New England in 1998. He would, however, make appearances for the Universal Wrestling Alliance and Unified Championship Wrestling during the late-1990s. On June 7, 1998, he and Joel Davis lost to \\"Big\\" Val Puccio in a handicap match at the Devine Ice Arena in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He also wrestled Joe Gulla, one half of the House of Pain with Frank Gulli, later that night. Allen formed a brief tag team with Steve Morabito in his feud with then NWA New England Tag Team Champions House of Pain but broke up following their loss to them at the Taste of the Boss supercard in Boston on September 19. This was the team's first title defense since winning the titles from the New York Posse (Curtis Slamdawg & Jay Kobain) the previous day. That same day, he wrestled another two matches at the Everett Rec Center in Everett, Massachusetts. The first was against Tre' and the second a tag team match with Joel Davis against the House of Pain. On February 12, 1999, Allen won his first major title when he defeated Curtis Slamdawg for the NWA New England Heavyweight Championship in Mansfield, Massachusetts, but lost the title to Knuckles Nelson a week later. This match was later aired on its weekly television series, Mass Madness. Allen would eventually become a main rival of Tony Rumble, one of the promotion's top \\"heels\\" and leader of The Brotherhood (Dukes Dalton, Rick Fuller, Knuckles Nelson & Eric Sbraccia). His match against Rumble at Southbridge High School on March 13 was included when the promotion was featured on ESPN's Outside the Lines. He took six \\"chair shots\\" from different members of The Brotherhood before he was pinned by Rumble. On April 3, he again lost to King Kong Bundy in Milford, Connecticut and also Dean Power, one-half of World Championship Wrestling's The Power Company, at the Good Times Emporium on April 22. He also took part in the promotion's first show outside New England three days later, promoted under its original name, teaming with Joel Davis to defeat The Outpatients in Ogdensburg, New York on April 25. On May 29, 1999, he lost to Brotherhood member Dukes Dalton at the Good Times Emporium. On June 22, 2000, Allen lost to Mike Johnson in a match to determine the first NWA New England Brass Knuckles Champion in Somerville, but won the title from Johnson in a rematch a month later. Allen held the title for several weeks until losing to Gino Martino in a five-way match with Zach Mason, Jaime Paine and Nemesis on August 24. At the end of the year, Allen was one of several wrestlers from NWA New England and Extreme Championship Wrestling to appear for Mike Sparta's World Wrestling Alliance in Lynn, Massachusetts on November 25, 2000. Jimmy Snuka and The Patriot were also on the card. In early-2001, Allen was awarded NWA New England Television Championship by his then manager and former champion Bull Montana on NWA New England Spotlight. He lost the title to Beau Douglas who beat him in a televised match in May 2001. Allen then formed a tag team with former rival The Outpatient, calling themselves Criminally Insane, and defeated Zak Mason & Chris Charisma for the vacant NWA New England Tag Team Championship at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Wakefield, Massachusetts on July 21, 2001. This was during the promotion's Summer Sizzler Tour. He also appeared at a weekend event at Killer Kowalski's Institute of Professional Wrestling on August 10. Among those present included Frankie Kazarian, Jason Rumble, Vinnie Capelli, John Rodeo and The Ark Angels (Damon D'Arcangelo and Phoenix King). He and The Outpatient would hold the titles for over three months before dropping the belts to Trailer Park Trash (\\"Dirty\\" Deuce Malone and \\"The Scrub\\" Steve Sabo) in Woburn, Massachusetts on October 27, 2001. Independent circuit and New World Wrestling (2002-2004) Allen branched out to other parts of the country during the first half of 2002, mostly in other National Wrestling Alliance-affiliated promotions in the Eastern United States and in Florida. In February 2002, he entered the Best of the Best Tournament, co-promoted by NWA East and NWA Tri-State, but was eliminated by Nikita Allanov in the opening rounds in Titusville, Pennsylvania. He also made two appearances at the City Park Pavilion in Parkersburg, West Virginia wrestling NWA Tri-State's Dash Bennett on February 2 and Mr. Attitude on April 6, the latter match resulting in a double-countout. He also made a one-time appearance for Jason Knight's Assault Championship Wrestling facing Jason Rage on September 17 edition of Assault TV: The Dot Com Edition. In the spring of 2003, he made several appearances for Ultimate Championship Wrestling. On March 2, he was pinned by UCW Television Champion \\"Nature Boy\\" Gary Gold in a triple threat match with \\"Iceberg\\" Sonny D. at Club Escapades in Raynham, Massachusetts. Three weeks later at a local high school in Canton, Massachusetts, Allen joined La Familia members Tony Cianci and Vinny Giuliani in a 6-man tag team match against Paco Rivera, D.C. Dillon and \\"Diehard\\" Eddie Edwards which ended in a double-disqualification. One of his last appearance was at the Family Center in Braintree, Massachusetts in which he and Apocalypse lost to UCW Tag Team Champions Beau Douglas & Todd Hansen. Before leaving the promotion, he lost to UCW Heavyweight Champion Don Vega in a triple threat match with the Outpatient on April 23. In late-2003, Allen formed his own promotion, New World Wrestling, and appeared at its first show held on December 6, 2003. Shortly afterwards, Allen dropped his former in-ring persona of Trooper Gilmore to return \\"to his Italian roots\\" and began wrestling under the name \\"Big\\" Paulie Gilmore (or Gilmorea). He soon formed a tag team with Jimmy \\"Jact\\" Cash known as Men of Business and, on July 25, 2004, lost to The Millennium Killaz (Gino Martino and Ali Mohammed) in a match to crown the first NWW Tag Team Champions. The titles were vacated later that year when Ali Mohammed suffered a near-career ending injury, a cracked tibiae and torn ligaments, during a match with Allen for Ultimate Championship Wrestling in Attleboro, Massachusetts. Returning to NWA New England for the 2004 Tony Rumble Memorial Show in Sanford, Maine, he and Mark Moment lost to The Rough Ryders (Nixx and Raines) in a triple threat match with The Elite (Sonny Roselli and Larry Huntley) for the NWA New England Tag Team titles. The following night in Bellingham, Massachusetts, Allen won the vacant NWW Tag Team Championship in a match against The Widowmaker & ‚ÄúDangerous‚Äù Donny Rotten. Anthony \\"Spaz\\" Parziale, an on-air radio personality for WAAF, was the cornerman for Men of Business. They lost the titles to Southern Extreme (Widowmaker and The Texas Outlaw) in Attleboro on August 20, 2005. That same night, Allen became the first NWW SuperCrush Battle Royal Champion and held the title until it was won by Pierre Vachon almost two years later. Millennium Wrestling Federation and NWA New England (2005-2006) In 2005, Allen debuted in the Millennium Wrestling Federation with manager Bull Montana and allied himself with MWF Tag Team Champions Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas in their feud with Ox Baker's stable Ox Baker's Army (The Outpatient, Pierre \\"The Beast\\" Vachon & The Islanders). He also soon found himself subject to a kayfabe vendetta by MWF Commissioner Dr. Von Johnson who would force him to wrestle increasing difficult opponents and stipulations. At the Road to the Gold supercard, Allen lost to The Outpatient and, the following month at Halloween Horror, had to wrestle The Islanders in handicap match. Allen joined Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas in an 8-man tag team match with The Sandman to defeat Ox Baker's Army at the Soul Survivor III supercard in Lynn, Massachusetts on November 5, 2005. This effectively ended the near 2-year feud between Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas and Ox Baker. Manager Johnny Fabulous also made his debut in this match and would appear with Todd Hanson & Beau Douglas for the next few months. Allen was later named as a suspect when Dr. Von Johnson was assaulted by an unknown assailant while leaving the Braintree Moose Lodge after an MWF event. He also began teaming with Apocalypse, then under the name Corporal Robinson, as 5-0 in NWA New England. On November 25, 2005 at the 6th annual Tony Rumble Memorial Show, he and Robinson won the NWA New England Tag Team Championship from Larry Huntley and Nick Santone, substituting for Sonny Roselli, in a triple threat match with Makua and Eric Egoh at Ringside Entertainment Complex in Revere, Massachusetts. He and Robinson eventually lost the titles to Pierre and Damien Vachon in Fall River, Massachusetts on May 11, 2006. New World Wrestling (2007-) After nearly two years, the NWW SuperCrush Battle Royal Championship was won by Pierre Vachon in Sandwich, Massachusetts on March 31, 2007. On March 11, 2008, he was interviewed on the internet radio show In Your Head in which he discussed his career and promoted New World Wrestling's upcoming tour of Cape Cod. On March 29, Allen defeated Brickhouse Baker at the Plymouth Community Intermediate School in Plymouth, Massachusetts. On April 5, in East Sandwich, Massachusetts, Allen and New World Wrestling participated in a benefit show for the Sandwich High School wrestling team The Blue Knights. During the event, Allen accepted an open challenge put out by then NWW Tag Team Champions Moondog Maximus & Professor Sushi. Sushi had substituted for regular tag team partner Tony Kahuko. He later revealed his partner as former World Wrestling Federation superstar Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake and together went on to win the tag team titles that night. Allen and Beefcake were stripped of the titles following the event. Since neither team had a tag team partner \\"authorized by NWW Board of Directors\\", according to NWW Commissioner Steve Burgundy, the titles were declared vacant and would be filled at a later date. On January 17, 2009, Allen wrestled APCW Heavyweight Champion \\"Bionic\\" Dan Bidondi in an event for Action Packed Championship Wrestling at the American Legion Hall in Seekonk, Massachusetts. This was Bidondi's first title defense since winning the title from \\"Nature Boy\\" Gary Gold who had also been suspended from the promotion with his manager Johnny Fabulous. On March 11, he made a second appearance on In Your Head to promote an upcoming New World Wrestling event at Sandwich High School. The event featured former Extreme Championship Wrestling veterans Justin Credible and Spike Dudley. The show was later broadcast live on In Your Head on March 14.

The most recent US farm crisis occurred during the 1980s.Steve Huntley. \\"Winter of Despair Hits the Farm Belt,\\" U.S. News & World Report v100 January 20, 1986, 21-23Joshua Hammer. \\"Double Slaying in Rural Minnesota Spotlights Distress of America's Debt-Ridden Farmers\\", People Weekly, v20 October 31, 1983, 129-131Bob McBride. \\"Broken Heartland: Farm Crisis in the Midwest\\", The Nation, v242 February 8, 1986, 132-133. Crisis of the 1920s and 1930s A farm crisis began in the 1920s, commonly believed to be a result of high production for military needs in World War I. At the onset of the crisis, there was high market supply, high prices, and available credit for both the producer and consumer. The U.S. government continued to instill inflationary policy following World War I.Perkins, Van L. \\"Crisis in Agriculture: The Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the New Deal,\\" 1969. By June 1920, crop prices averaged 31 percent above 1919 and 121 percent above prewar prices of 1913. Also, farm land prices rose 40 percent from 1913 to 1920.Shideler, James H. \\"Farm Crisis, 1919-1923,\\" Berkeley: University of California Press, 1957. Crops of 1920 cost more to produce than any other year. Eventually, a price break began in July 1920 which squeezed farmers between both decreasing agricultural prices and steady industrial prices. Examples of decreasing agriculture prices include: By 1933, Cotton was only 5.5 cents per pound, corn was down 19.4 cents per bushel, and hogs declined to $2.94 instead of their respective 1909-1914 average prices of 12.4 cents per pound, to 83.6 cents per bushel, and $7.24 per hog. Furthermore, a region of the great plains was hit by an extreme drought which added to the agricultural difficulties of the time. Perkins, Van L. \\"Crisis in Agriculture: The Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the New Deal,\\" 1969. Reformation of the 1920s and 1930s Throughout this crisis there were many attempts to form Farmers' Unions. This was difficult considering the lack of effective communication technology, the lack of electricity on many farms, and the overall size of the country. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 intended to bring government aid to cooperatives. It allowed the Federal Farm Board to make loans and other assistances in hopes of stabilizing surplus and prices.Belden, Joseph N. \\"Dirt Rich, Dirt Poor: America's Food and Farm Crisis\\" 1986. Later, Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which was enacted on May 12, 1933, aimed to bring back pre World War 1 Farmers' abilities to sell farm products for the same worth they were able to buy non-farm products. The Act involved seven different crops: corn, wheat, cotton, rice, peanuts, tobacco, and milk. Farmers were paid to not plant those seven crops, thus decreasing supply and returning to market equilibrium. In order to prevent noncooperative farmers from taking advantage of other farmers decreasing supply the bill states \\"is to keep this noncooperation minority in line, or at least prevent it from doing harm to the majority, that the power of the Government has been marshaled behind the adjustment programs\\" In other words, the benefits from payments to cooperative farmers were designed to be more beneficial than being noncooperative and flooding the market. The AAA was deemed unconstitutional on January 6, 1936.Perkins, Van L. \\"Crisis in Agriculture: The Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the New Deal,\\" 1969. Further reformation included Farm Credit Act of 1933, which allowed farmers to re-mortgage no longer affordable property, as well as the Frazier‚ÄìLemke Farm Bankruptcy Act. 1980s crisis The United States experienced a major agricultural crisis during the 1980s. Record production during this time led to a fall in the price of commodities. Exports fell, due in part to the 1980 United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union. Farm debt for land and equipment purchases soared during the 1970s and early 1980s, doubling between 1978 and 1984. Other negative economic factors included high interest rates, high oil prices and a strong dollar. By the mid-1980s, the crisis had reached its peak. Land prices had fallen dramatically leading to record foreclosures. The Farm Credit System experienced large losses, which were the first losses since the Great Depression.1980s farm crisis Iowa Public TelevisionHistory of the 80s - Banking and the Agricultural Problems of the 1980s.

She was the first woman in Poland to support herself from writing and teaching, as well as one of Poland's first writers of children's literature. She made her debut in 1819 with a moralizing treatise A Souvenir After a Good Mother. In the 1820s, she edited a popular magazine for children and published several children books, that have won a wide audience over several generations. She also published a number of novels, including: The Letters of El≈ºbieta Rzeczycka to her friend Urszula (1824) and, arguably her best known work, The Diary of Countess Francoise Krasinska (1825), translated into several languages, and recounted as one of the first Polish psychological novels. Hoffmanowa raised the postulate of economic self-empowerment of women. She believed that the first step for women to achieve independence should be gaining education to enable paid work. However, she held conservative views on the role of women and referred to national and Catholic values. In 1826, her candidacy for membership in the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning was submitted, but she was not accepted as a woman. She remained unmarried until the age of thirty, long by the standards of her time for a woman, and only in 1829 she married Karol Boromeusz Hoffman. Until then she used her maiden name. Though writing was her main and most preferred activity and she considered herself primarily a writer, she also worked as a teacher (as an inspector or a visitator) of female schools, and lecturer in moral science at the Governess' Institute in Warsaw (1826‚Äì1831). She educated a number of young women, some of whom later became writers and teachers themselves. Hoffmanowa was recalled with respect and appreciation by some of her students; in turn her pupil Narcyza ≈ªmichowska criticized Hoffmanowa's conservatism. During the November Uprising of Polish people against the Russian Empire, Hoffmanowa was a co-creator and chairman of the Union of Patriotic Charity of the Varsovians and carried the help to the wounded soldiers. After the fall of the uprising in 1831, she and her husband fled to Paris, where their house became a meeting place for Polish political refugees. In Paris, Hoffmanowa was active in the Charity Association of Polish Ladies and the Literary Society, and was called ‚Äúthe Mother of the Great Emigration‚Äù. She was friends with Chopin and Mickiewicz. She died of breast cancer at the age of 46 and was buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.  Biography  She came from a moderately rich noble family. She was the daughter of Ignacy Ta≈Ñski, Polish writer and novelist. For some time she lived with her mother in Warsaw. In 1819 she published her first book, PamiƒÖtka po dobrej matce, czyli ostatnie jej rady dla c√≥rki (A Souvenir After a Good Mother, or Her Final Advice to Her Daughter), a monologue in which an older woman imparts final words of wisdom and advice to a daughter. In 1829 she married Karol Boromeusz Hoffman, writer, lawyer and historian, and changed her name to Hoffmanowa, a marital form of her husband's surname. After Poland's November Uprising against the Russian Empire was crushed in the second half of 1831, Hoffmanowa moved with her husband to Dresden, and later settled in Paris. She was called \\"the Mother of the Great Emigration‚Äù. In 1919 a Warsaw high school, one of the oldest in the country, was named after her.

It was among the last known gomphotheres and one of two South American gomphotheres alongside Cuvieronius, and was the predominant gomphothere on the continent ranging widely over most of South America excluding the high Andes. The species has a long and convoluted taxonomic history due to its morphological variability and confusion with related gomphothere taxa, which was only resolved during the 2010s.  Taxonomy  Two gomphothere teeth from Cuvier (1806) with \\"A\\" referring to ‚Äúmastodonte des cordill√®res‚Äù and \\"B\\" referring to ‚Äúmastodonte humboldien‚Äù Proboscideans in South America were first described by Georges Cuvier in 1806, but he failed to give them specific names beyond \\"Mastodon\\". Fischer in 1814 assigned the ‚Äúmastodonte des cordill√®res‚Äù specimen the first specific name \\"Mastotherium hyodon\\". In 1824, Cuvier classified the fossils of Mastodon andium as the \\"mastodonte des cordill√®res\\" specimen, and Mastodon humboldtii to the \\"mastodonte humboldien\\". Due to the Principle of Priority, this meant that Mastodon andium was invalid, as \\"Mastotherium hyodon\\" was named first from the same specimen. Today, neither tooth is considered diagnostic to any specific taxon. Notiomastodon, \\"southern mastodon\\" was named by Cabrera (1929). It was assigned to the Gomphotheriidae by Carroll (1988). For centuries, the taxonomy of gomphotheres, including Notiomastodon, had been subject to debate, with many generic and specific names for similar South American gomphotheres. The species is currently under dispute, whether it should belong to Notiomastodon or Stegomastodon as regardless of genus, the species is considered synonymous with Haplomastodon by most authors, as the specimens were not considered morphologically distinct from this species. This article treats Notiomastodon separately because in phylogenetic analyses, Notiomastodon/Stegomastodon platensis specimens are not sister taxa, which would make the genus polyphyletic. However, some authors think this is inconclusive, as they think the North American Stegomastodon material is too scarce and fragmentary to make a definitive statement.  Evolution  Notiomastodon belongs to the family Gomphotheriidae, a group of animals distantly related to modern elephants and mammoths. Notiomastodon seems to have had a 4-million-year-long ghost lineage, diverging from the clade that contains Rhynchotherium and Cuvieronius around the Late Miocene. This would imply that Notiomastodon had been evolving in southern Central America, where the fossils are poorly sampled, prior to its migration into South America during the Pliocene or Pleistocene. Gomphotheres arrived in South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama as part of the Great American Biotic Interchange, alongside many other taxa from North America. The oldest known record of gomphotheres in South America is a fragmentary vertebra from the Earliest Pleistocene (about 2.5 Mya) Uquia Formation of Argentina.Cione, A.L., Gasparini, G.M., Soibelzon, E., Soibelzon, L.H., Tonni, E.P., 2015. The Great American Biotic Interchange in Southern South America: Land Mammal Biostratigraphy, Climatic Evolution and Faunal Integration. Springer Briefs in Earth System Sciences. Springer, New York-London The oldest known remains definitively attributable to Notiomastodon are known from the late Early Pleistocene (1.2-0.8 Mya) from the Rio de la Plata, also in Argentina, consisting of a pair of tusks and other associated remains. A 2019 study using collagen sequencing found Notiomastodon closer to Mammut than to extant elephants, though how this affects gomphothere phylogeny is unclear.  Phylogeny  The phylogenetic position among trilophodont gomphotheres according to Moth√© et al., 2016 is:  Description  Among many other specimens, N. platensis is known from MECN 82, a 35-year- old male that would be around tall, with an estimated weight of . It had two tusks (one on either side of its trunk), like other members of the Gomphotheriidae, and none on the lower jaw, as with other brevirostrine gomphotheres. Unlike close relative Cuvieronius, its tusks were not twisted, but their length and shape are observed as greatly variable depending on the individual, as is morphology more generally440x440px  Paleobiogeography  Notiomastodon has been described as the 'lowland gomphothere'. The genus tended to inhabit seasonally dry, open forests, with a range lining most of the South American coastline and lowland interior, bar the Guiana Shield, with particularly large concentrations along the coast of Peru and in northeastern Brazil. In contrast, the other representative of South American gomphotheres, Cuvieronius, inhabited the mountainous Andes region from Ecuador to southern Peru and Bolivia, as well as lowland areas in north-east Peru. The diet composition of Notiomastodon varied widely depending on location, but probably primarily consisted of a mix of C3 shrubs and C4 grasses, whilst also serving as a primary disperser of the seeds for a variety of different plant species.  Behaviour  Notiomastodon was probably similar in population structure and behaviour to extant elephants.  Extinction  In 2019, a young specimen from Brazil was described with artifact embedded into its skull suggesting human hunting played a role in its extinction.

Origins  The origins of Clan MacNeacail are mysterious. The traditional account (as relayed, for example, by the Rev. John Morison of Bragar in Lewis in about 1680) holds them to have been the ancient proprietors of Lewis, but they lost much of their power and prestige when the Macleods succeeded to the island by marriage to a MacNicol heiress. Hebridean tradition claims that this was a forced marriage, with the bride seized and the warriors of the Clan MacNicol attacked, with their vessels sunk by the MacLeods off the coast of the island. By 1450, however, the MacNicols were firmly established in the Trotternish peninsula in Skye, serving as members of the Council of the Lordship of the Isles. By the end of the eighteenth century, the clan would become distinguished by the large number of clergymen within its roll call, present in parishes across the Western Isles and northern Scotland, and the ecclesiastical tradition appears to have been laid down by their Medieval ancestors. The MacNicols were the principal benefactors of the Cathedral Church of St. Columba at Snizort on Skye, where tradition holds that one hundred leading men of the clan received burial. Life Rev. Donald was the son of Malcolm MacNicol of Scorrybreac, tenth chief of the clan, and, according to family genealogies, the nephew of Sorley MacNicol of Drumuie, who had fought in the royalist armies of the Marquis of Montrose in the Civil War. He was brought up in the household of Sir James MacDonald of Sleat, as servitor to Sir James's son and heir. Donald graduated from Edinburgh University in 1659 (as recorded in the Catalogue of students in the faculties of the arts, divinity and law), and it is possible that it was his experience in the south of Scotland that prompted him to Anglicise the clan name as 'Nicolson'. The number of the Reverend Donald‚Äôs wives is uncertain, but he is generally credited with twenty-three children, through whom he is a common ancestor of many Skye families. He himself was a man of substantial means, appearing in the 1690s as a significant creditor of Macleod of Dunvegan. 'The Great Song of Scorrybreac', a Gaelic ballad composed in celebration of the marriage of Donald's son Malcolm to a daughter of MacLeod of Raasay records the affluence and splendour of the Nicolson household, and the success of the young men of the clan in 'wooing maidens' and 'winning wagers'. In 1689, the settlement following the Glorious Revolution remodelled the Scottish Church in a Presbyterian form and required ministers to swear an oath of loyalty to the new king, William III. Those Episcopalian 'Non-Jurors' who refused were branded as Jacobites and ejected from their livings, and Skye tradition records Rev. Donald Nicolson as one of the most forthright among their number, being eventually driven from his parish in 1697. His son Malcolm, who concluded his studies at Edinburgh in 1689, had been originally intended for the church, but also refused to accept the new establishment, and never served as a minister. The close association of the Nicolsons of Scorrybreac with Skye's leading Jacobite families, the MacDonalds of Sleat and the MacLeods of Rassay, makes it altogether credible to count Donald and Malcolm among the ranks of the Non-Jurors.  Descendants  On his death, the Reverend Donald was succeeded by his son Malcolm, who married Margaret Macleod of Raasay. A large number of his descendants (including at least two of his younger sons) entered the Church.Donald Mackinnon's The Clerical Sons of Skye (Portree, 1930) listed 32 of them. These included two grandsons, Reverend Malcolm Nicolson of the parish of Kiltarlity, Inverness-shire, who served as a military chaplain with the Fraser Highlanders in the British capture of Quebec in 1759, and John Nicolson, minister of Portree for over forty-years before his death in 1796, whose pastoral devotion was long remembered in Skye, and whose character was warmly recorded in Thomas Pennant's journal of his 1769 tour of Scotland. Notable descendants of Rev. Donald outside the church include Alexander MacDonald of Kingsburgh, who masterminded the sheltering of the fugitive Young Pretender Charles Edward Stuart on Skye in 1746, and Major Malcolm Hassels Nicolson (1843‚Äì1904), a veteran of the British campaigns in India and Afghanistan, who was promoted to ADC to Queen Victoria, and married the poet Adela Florence Nicolson.

The product is also known as manteiga de gado (cattle butter) and manteiga de cozinha (kitchen butter). Manteiga de garrafa is a dairy product made from the cream of cows' milk. The cream is processed by physical agitation, as in a blender or beating by hand, followed by cooking at a temperature of to . Salt may also be added. Some recipes for making manteiga de garrafa include a step prior to cooking in which the congealed cream is washed in cold water. The cooking process separates the cream into two components, the manteiga (butter) and the \\"borra\\" (a watery precipitate). The manteiga is separated from the borra by filtration, and then placed in bottles. The finished product is almost pure fat, with a low water activity. Accordingly, it is inhospitable to microbial growth and can be kept at room temperature. Manteiga de garrafa is a yellow-orange, viscous liquid which may be opaque or semi-translucent. It is strongly flavored, with flavors of cheese, fish, rancidity, and barnyard composing part of the flavor profile. Manteiga de garrafa is a characteristic part of the cuisine of the northeast of Brazil, particularly the Sert√£o. In cooking, the product is used in much the same way as ordinary butter. The borra that is removed during processing is also eaten. It can be eaten with bread, or used as an ingredient in farofa, carne-de-sol, feij√£o verde, and in cooking fried eggs or cassava (macaxeira). Manteiga de garrafa is a product of artesanal or small-scale manufacturing, as well as home production, and its quality and flavor can be variable.

Dise√±o del Rancho Primer Ca√±on o Rio de Los Berrendos History Job Francis Dye (1807‚Äì1883) was born in Allen County, Kentucky. In 1830, he joined a party of trappers heading west from Fort Smith. After wintering and spending most of 1831 in Taos, New Mexico, Dye joined another band of trappers which arrived in Pueblo de Los Angeles early in 1832. After a year of sea otter hunting, he worked for Captain John B.R. Cooper on his Rancho El Sur from 1833-35. Moving north again, Dye rented a portion of Joaquin Buelna‚Äôs Rancho Zayante near Santa Cruz, and built a small grist mill and a distillery.Job F.

Tehama County Pioneers by Keith Lingenfelter Dye arrived at his six square league grant in the company of Robert Hasty Thomes (Rancho Saucos), Albert G. Toomes (Rancho Rio de los Molinos), and William Chard (Rancho Las Flores). With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

They were executed via the electric chair in 1915 for the murder in 1913 of 75-year-old John Q. Lewis, a Confederate veteran of Blackstock, SC. The Griffin brothers were convicted based on the accusations of another black man, John \\"Monk\\" Stevenson, who was known to be a small-time thief. Stevenson, who was found in possession of the victim's pistol, was sentenced to life in prison in exchange for testifying against the brothers. Two other African Americans, Nelson Brice and John Crosby, were executed with the brothers for the same crime. However, some in the community believed that the murder might have been the result of Lewis's suspected sexual relationship with 22-year-old Anna Davis. Davis and her husband were never tried, possibly for fear of a miscegenation scandal. The Griffin brothers, who were believed to be the wealthiest blacks in the area, sold their farm to pay for their defense against the accusations. Over 100 people petitioned Gov. Richard Manning to commute the brothers' sentence. The signatories included prominent people including Blackstock's mayor, a sheriff, two trial jurors and the grand jury foreman. Nevertheless, they were sent to the electric chair. Thomas Griffin and Meeks Griffin were pardoned in October 2009 after Tom Joyner sought the pardons of his great-uncles from state appeals court in Columbia, South Carolina. Joyner learned about his relationship to the Griffins through a research conducted for the PBS documentary, African American Lives 2, by Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., which also traced 11 other relatives.

He embarked for France on 19 August, 1914. It was intended that he disembark at Le Havre, but the uncertainties of the early few weeks of the War saw a change of plan, and Burrows and six other chaplains landed further south at St Nazaire.IWM Diary of Pat McCormickBecause of this unexpected venue, no-one knew quite what to do with seven chaplains, and they appear to have busied themselves as Medical auxiliaries for a time. In September, 1914, Burrows went with ‚Äòthe first motor ambulance‚Äô (6-cylinder Wolseley cars), taking wounded soldiers to Le Mans. On 25 November, 1914, Burrows was sent to Boulogne.TNA WO339/23822There he had an unfortunate accident which caused some mirth. On 16 December, Bishop Gwynne, a future Deputy Chaplain-General, noted that Burrows ‚Äò... is only just recovering from a bad sprain in the leg from a fall into a grave while he was burying one of our soldiers in another. It must have been an awesome sight Chaplain, cassock - surplice book disappearing entirely into a six foot drop.‚ÄôUniversity of Birmingham Cadbury Research Centre,Gwynne's Army Book Burrows spent some time in hospital in Boulogne, was transferred to England, returned to France early in 1915 and was posted to No3 Casualty Clearing Station but was re-admitted to hospital with influenza on 8 February. He rejoined the British Expeditionary Force on 17 March. Two years later, Burrows resigned from the Chaplaincy.

A succession of posts followed as he made his way through the hierarchy most notably as Vicar of Grimsby and Rural Dean of Grimsby and Cleethorpes 1928-36. He was a preacher of renown with a particularly friendly manner which had matured during the active part of his chaplaincy in France. In 1947 he was appointed Dean of Hereford, and tried to place the Cathedral in harmony with a developing post-War world. He had ploughs, tractors and other agricultural machinery inside the Cathedral for seasonal services.Church Times obituary,11.11.1983He retired in 1961. Hedley Burrows was fiercely patriotic, and his Great War experiences never left him. He was proud of his medals, the Star, British and Victory.

It is tended to by the British Province of the Order of Carmelites. History The Carmelite friars took on the care of the Faversham parish in 1926 and acquired a building on Tanners Street, developing it as a church by 1937. The shrine of Saint Jude was built later, in 1955. On 28 October 1955, the Bishop of Southwark Cyril Cowderoy, with the Prior General of the Carmelite Order, the Prior of Aylesford, and many other priests and friars, dedicated the Shrine. Bishop Cyril described the place as \\"a jewel for the diocese\\". Since the 1950s thousands of pilgrims have come to Faversham from all over the world to visit and pray at the little shrine to Saint Jude. It is not a particularly large building, but it has become special to the many visiting pilgrims. The site The site includes the Faversham parish, which was founded in 1926 and developed as a church by 1937, with the shrine of Saint Jude following in 1955. Attached to the Shrine is an office, information centre, and welcome centre which serve the many pilgrims who visit, write, or send in their prayers. The venue also holds the distribution office for St Albert's Press (which is the publishing arm of the British Province of Carmelites). The shrine St Simon Stock The corridor between the church and shrine has a number of stained glass windows by the artist Richard Joseph King (1907‚Äì74), depicting important figures in the tradition of the Carmelite Order. First is the window of Saint Simon Stock (pictured). He was a Kentish man who became Prior General of the Order in the 1250s and who died in Bordeaux, France, in 1265. The other windows are of Saint Brocard, the prophet Elisha and the prophet Elijah. The statue of the Apostle Jude in the Inner Shrine beyond the Shrine Chapel is the work of art which most focuses pilgrims' devotion. The statue is fifteenth century gilt and polychrome wood, and was a gift from Mr & Mrs Murphy, given in memory of their sons Matthew and Michael both of whom died in action in the Second World War. The Shrine, the mosaic apse, ironwork and exterior frieze in mosaic were designed by Michael Leigh A.R.C.A., who worked on various churches and some of the mosaics in Westminster Cathedral. The reliquary which stands in the inner shrine is called the Augsberg Reliquary, and is a modern copy of a silver monstrance from 1547. The reliquary has been modified to display the relic, a bone fragment of Saint Jude. Finally, there are three designs from the eminent artist Adam Kossowski. In the entrance to the church and the shrine are holy water stoops by him, and there are also three ceramic plaques by him. Fire and new icons In 2004 a fire broke out in the Shrine Chapel, destroying the murals and damaging much of the other artwork. Happily, the windows and ceramics could be repaired, but the murals had to be replaced. The decision was made to install icons depicting saints inspired by the Carmelite Rule of Saint Albert, in commemoration of the 8th centenary of the Carmelite Rule in 2007. The icons were written by Sister Petra Clare, a Benedictine hermit living in Scotland. The icons are of: Saint Albert giving the Carmelite 'way of life' (Rule document) to Saint Brocard on Mount Carmel; Blessed John Soreth and Blessed Frances d'Amboise; Saint Elias Kuriakos Chavara and Blessed Isidore Bakanja; Blessed Titus Brandsma and Saint Edith Stein. List of Shrine Directors and Chaplains Before 2008, the Shrine was managed by the Shrine Director who had the dual role of chaplain and manager. However, this was changed after 2008 with the management of the site handled by an office manager, and then later the current Development Manager. A friar took on the role as Chaplain to run the spiritual side.

Collapse premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009 to positive reviews. Overview Ruppert, a former Los Angeles police officer who describes himself as an investigative reporter and radical thinker, has authored books on the events of the September 11 attacks and of energy issues. Critics in the mainstream media and in D.C. called him a conspiracy theorist and an alarmist. Director Smith interviewed Ruppert over the course of fourteen hours in an interrogation-like setting in an abandoned warehouse basement meat locker near downtown Los Angeles. Ruppert‚Äôs interview was shot over five days throughout March and April 2009. The filmmakers distilled these interviews down to this 82 minute monologue with archival footage interspersed as illustration. The title refers to Ruppert‚Äôs belief that unsustainable energy and financial policies have led to an ongoing collapse of modern industrial civilization. Critics have variously described the film as supportive and as critical of Ruppert‚Äôs views. Smith himself, speaking at the Toronto International Film Festival premiere, said that \\"What I hoped to reveal was ... that his obsession with the collapse of industrial civilization has led to the collapse of his life. In the end, it is a character study about his obsession.\\" Synopsis Sitting in a room that looks like a bunker, Ruppert briefly recounts his life including his parents' ties to U.S. intelligence agencies and Ruppert‚Äôs own career as an LAPD beat cop and detective. Ruppert then summarizes current energy and economic issues, focusing mainly around the core concepts of peak oil and sustainable development. He also criticizes fiat money, fractional reserve banking, compound interest, and leveraging, and discusses alleged CIA drug trafficking. The bulk of the film presents Ruppert making an array of predictions including social unrest, violence, population dislocation and governmental collapses in the United States and throughout the world. He draws on news reports and data available via the Internet, but he applies a unique interpretation which he calls ‚Äúconnecting the dots‚Äù. Smith periodically stops Ruppert to question his assumptions and provide a note of skepticism. Critical reception After its premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called Collapse ‚Äúone of the few true buzz films of the festival‚Äù and wrote that ‚Äúyou may want to dispute [Ruppert], but more than that you‚Äôll want to hear him, because what he says ‚Äî right or wrong, prophecy or paranoia ‚Äî takes up residence in your mind.‚Äù Daily Variety wrote that Collapse was ‚Äúunnervingly persuasive much of the time, and merely riveting when it's not, Ruppert's talking-head analysis gets the Errol Morris treatment from director Chris Smith (American Movie), whose intellectual horror film ranks as another essential work.‚Äù The Onions A.V. Club wrote that \\"in several immensely poignant moments, we can also see an angry, lonely, vulnerable man whose life epitomizes the title as much as the globe does. There are many layers to the man and the movie, and I for one left the theater shaken.\\" Roger Ebert wrote, \\"I don't know when I've seen a thriller more frightening. I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen. \\"Collapse\\" is even entertaining, in a macabre sense. I think you owe it to yourself to see it.\\" Distribution In October 2009 the filmmakers announced that Collapse would premiere simultaneously in theaters in New York City and via video on demand on November 6, 2009. According to press announcements, this unique release arrangement ‚Äúwill mark the first time a film will be released this soon after it premiered at a festival without distribution.‚Äù  See also  * Collapse (film, 2010) References External links  * Review at Row Three.com Category:2009 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about peak oil Category:2009 documentary films Category:Peak oil films Category:Films directed by Chris Smith ","title":"Collapse (film)"},{"id":"24739649","text":"Maresciallo Guido Nardini was a World War I flying ace credited with six aerial victories.

His reported birth date differs according to authority consulted; dates given are 30 July 1881Franks et al 1997, p. 147. or 13 March 1893. He earned a pilot's license, No. 590, at Betheny, France before World War I, on 22 August 1911. World War I military service As World War I heated up, Nardini volunteered for military service despite his age. As a soldato, Nardini opened his victory skein flying a Nieuport 10 on 27 June 1916, when he, Alessandro Buzio, and a couple of other pilots shot down an enemy airplane after a 20 kilometer chase over Verona. The feat earned Nardini a Bronze Medal for Military Valor. By February 1917, he was serving with 78a Squadriglia as a Caporal, flying frequently as the wingman to Italy's leading ace, Francesco Baracca. Nardini used a Nieuport 17 to score his second victory on 14 June 1917. This victory earned him a Silver Medal for Military Valor. A month later, he shot down his third victim, on 18 July. Nardini transferred to 91a Squadriglia, but on 10 February 1918, shortly after his arrival, he had an accident while test piloting a Nieuport 17. Baracca had also transferred into squadron; on 3 May 1918, Nardini and Baracca jointly incinerated a Hansa- Brandenburg C.I south of Grave di Papadopoli.Gutmann 2002, p. 25. Two weeks later, Nardini, Gastone Novelli, and Cesare Magistrini teamed up on the Albatros D.III of Franz Gr√§ser over Pero, and Nardini was a live ace and Gr√§ser a dead one. Nardini was subsequently awarded a second Bronze Medal for Military Valor. A month later, on 15 June 1918, after two years of combat, Nardini rounded out his list with a solo victory over another Albatros D.III. On 23 August 1918, he was hospitalized for injuries suffered in a fall from a motorcycle. Post World War I Nardini continued to serve through war's end and beyond. In 1923, he transferred to the newly established Regia Aeronautica. He was promoted out of the enlisted ranks, becoming a Maresciallo. While flying over Ciampino airfield, Guido Nardini bailed out of an airplane in trouble, and was killed by a malfunctioning parachute on 26 January 1928.The Aerodrome website Retrieved on 3 April 2013.

History The idea for a national Smithsonian museum dedicated to the artistic, musical, literary, political, economic, and other socio-economic contributions of Americans with Cuban, Mexican, South American, and Spanish backgrounds (among others) was first broached in the mid-1990s.Taylor, Kate. \\"National Latino Museum Plan Faces Fight.\\" New York Times. April 20, 2011. In April 1993, Robert McCormick Adams, Jr., Secretary of the Smithsonian, and Constance Berry Newman, Under Secretary, appointed a 15-member task force to study the role of and focus on Latinos in Smithsonian Institution budget, collections and exhibits, governance, personnel policies, and programs.Holmes, Steven A. \\"Report Criticizes Smithsonian On Hispanic Focus and Hiring.\\" New York Times. May 11, 1994. On May 10, 1994, the task issued a report, titled Willful Neglect, which concluded that the Smithsonian had ignored the contributions of Hispanics and Latinos in its exhibits and that a new national museum might help to correct the problem. In 2003, Representative Xavier Becerra introduced legislation to establish a commission to study such a museum. However, the bill did not become law for several years. On May 8, 2008, the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of the National Museum of the American Latino Act of 2007 was signed into law. The law created a 23-member commission whose members were appointed by the President and the leadership of the House and Senate. The commission was authorized to spend $3.2 million over two years, and charged with studying the need for a museum, the museum's vision and purpose, possible governance structure, potential sites, construction costs, and how funds for the museum might be raised. (It is not charged with making proposals about the specific exhibits or content of any museum.) The commission held its inaugural meeting on September 18-19, 2009.\\"National Museum of American Latino Commission Holds Inaugural Meeting.\\" Press release.

In February 2010, the commission gave a preliminary estimate of $250 million to $500 million for construction alone. The commission hired contractors to help with its feasibility studies. A series of public meetings were held to judge public interest in a museum, and provide input and feedback on the issues under discussion by the commission.\\"Input Sought on National Latino Museum.\\" New Mexico Business Weekly. April 1, 2010. In May 2010, commission staff said that the commission was considering a traveling or \\"virtual\\" museum, as well as locating the museum in a city other than Washington, D.C..Toohey, Marty. \\"Latino Museum Hearing Today at State Capitol.\\" Austin American-Statesman. May 1, 2010. The commission also heard testimony voicing concern over the use of the word \\"Latino\\" in the museum's name.Santiago, Fabiola. \\"Commission Weighs Creation of National Hispanic Museum.\\" Miami Herald. June 3, 2010. Report The commission's report was originally expected in the fall of 2010. However, on April 21, 2011, the New York Times reported that the commission had already settled on a building about in size, which would be approximately the same size as the $250 million National Museum of African American History and Culture. The newspaper also reported that the commission has selected four sites (all of them on the National Mall) for the proposed museum (although three of the sites would be additions to existing museums rather than a stand- alone museum). The commission issued its report on May 4, 2011.Taylor, Kate. \\"Commission Asks Congress to Support a Smithsonian American Latino Museum.\\" New York Times. May 5, 2011. Accessed 2012-08-07. Nine sites were considered for the potential museum, including one on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. But this site, although preferred by the commission, was ultimately rejected due to security concerns and because the land would continue to be owned by the United States Senate and not the Smithsonian. Instead, the report recommended that an underground museum be built on the National Mall next to and below the Arts and Industries Building, with an entrance and introductory displays within a portion of that historic structure.Alvardo, Monsy. \\"Menendez Among Backers of Bill to Create Smithsonian American Latinos Museum.\\" Bergen Record. November 16, 2011. The commission said it would cost $600 million to build and endow the museum, and said that half of this money should be raised from private donors. The commission also said that Congress would not need to provide funding until at least 2017. Fundraising for both construction and the endowment would take a total of 10 years.Boehm, Mike. \\"La Plaza Stumbles as Push for National Museum Gains Foothold.\\" Los Angeles Times. December 19, 2011. Legislative attempts to establish a museum In mid November 2011, nine members of the Senate and two members of the House of Representatives introduced legislation (H.R. 3459) in Congress to authorize the Smithsonian to establish the new museum and to proceed with planning and fund-raising. On December 8, a group known as the Friends of the National Museum of the American Latino announced that actress Eva Longoria and music producer Emilio Estefan had agreed to lead campaign to build support for the museum. The museum proposal drew criticism for encouraging cultural isolationism, for seeking space on the already-crowded National Mall, and for its cost. The 2011 legislation was not acted on, and died at the end of the 112th Congress on December 31, 2012.Boehm, Mike. \\"Backers of American Latino National Museum Push Bill in Congress.\\" Los Angeles Times. March 18, 2013. Accessed 2013-07-31. On March 15, 2013, new legislation (H.R. 1217/S. 568) was introduced in Congress to designate the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building as the site of the museum. The bills, co-sponsored by Senators Bob Menendez, Harry Reid, and Marco Rubio and by Representatives Xavier Becerra and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, would also require the Smithsonian to establish a formal panel to study how to fund the museum and what a construction timeline should be. The bills would not commit the government to build the museum, however. According to the San Antonio Express-News, museum backers already have a design for the proposed museum, and will begin a formal push to win passage of the legislation at the beginning of August 2013.Ayala, Elaine. \\"Latinos to Congress: Swift Passage of Smithsonian Latino Museum Act.\\" San Antonio Express-News. July 24, 2013. Accessed 2013-07-31. But the bills languished in Congress and Fox News Latino called the museum effort \\"in indefinite limbo\\". In June 2017, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation to establish a Smithsonian National Latino Museum.https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/sens-menendez- cornyn-introduce-the-smithsonian-american-latino-museum-act Joined on the Capitol grounds by actress and activist, Diane Guerrero, to formally introduce the legislation, the National Museum of the American Latino Act (H.R. 2911) advances the 2003 effort by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL-27) and former Representative Xavier Becerra to secure a location on the National Mall. The current version of the bill in the House of Representatives has 10 Republican and 17 Democrats as cosponsors. In the Senate (S. 1364), Senators Menendez (D-NJ) and John Cornyn (R-TX) are the sponsors, being joined by 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats as cosponsors on the bill.https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th- congress/house-bill/2911/cosponsors The legislation follows the funding model of the newly opened and highly acclaimed National Museum of African American History and Culture with a 50/50 split of public and private dollars. It also authorizes the Smithsonian Institution to conduct a feasibility study over an 18 month period. Additionally, Friends of the National Museum of the American Latino (FRIENDS), the organization spearheading the effort to establish a National Smithsonian Latino Museum, have built a coalition of over 100 partners that includes corporations, nonprofits and trade associations, that joined the official campaign to pass the Act and establish a National Latino Museum.

Ros-Lehtinen and Senator Menendez held a press conference with celebrated Latina actress Diane Guerrero on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. announcing the renewed effort to establish a Smithsonian National American Latino Museum, which was covered by numerous media outlets including NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/effort-build-american- latino-museum-national-mall-gets-push-bipartisan-n772786 New Jersey.com,http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/06/menendez_seeks_dc_museum_to_highlight_hispanic_americans.html Latina,http://www.latina.com/entertainment/celebrity/diane-guerrero-national- latino-museum-dc and others.

They extend southwest from the Kanektok and Narogurum Rivers to Hagemeister Strait and Kuskokwim Bay and support the only existing glaciers in western Alaska. They are the highest Alaskan mountain range west of the Alaska Range and north of the Alaska Peninsula: some summits in the range have many glaciers. To the west is the Kuskokwim River and to the east are the Bristol Bay lowlands. The Ahklun Mountains have many lakes, some more than deep. The mountains cover approximately 80 percent of the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge also contains tundra and coastal plains. Environment The Ahklun Mountains are dominated by alpine tundra, heath, and barrens, while moist sedge-tussock meadows occur in valley bottoms. Black spruce forest occurs on some hills and ridges. Forests of white spruce, paper birch, and alder cover the low hills along the major rivers. Blackpoll warblers are common breeders in conifer stands in river valleys. Beaver are abundant, supporting a large annual harvest. Sockeye salmon are the most abundant fish. Chum, king, silver salmon, and rainbow trout are also numerous. The average annual precipitation ranges from , while the average annual temperature ranges from . The growing season extends approximately from May 15 to September 10. Glaciers The Ahklun Mountains in the Togiak Wilderness The glaciers were first mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey, who used photogrammetry methods based on a 1972 series of aerial photos, revealing the presence of 116 glaciers. In 2006, 109 of these glaciers were resurveyed with the existence of 97 verified and 12 thought to have disappeared. This showed that over just three decades there had been a large decrease in the amount of land area covered by glacial ice in these mountains. The scientific community has long recognized the importance of glaciers as indicators of climatic change. In 2015, researchers analyzed aerial and satellite images from 1957, 1984, and 2009. They found that 10 out of 109 of the glaciers of the Ahklun Mountains originally mapped by the U.S Geological Survey in the 1970s had completely disappeared.http://www.fws.gov/alaska/external/newsroom/pdf/15-01.pdf They also compared the size of the glaciers using aerial photographs and satellite images and found that the glaciers had lost about 50 percent of their total area. At this rate of melting, they predict that all of the glaciers in the Ahklun Mountains will be gone by the end of this century. Geological evidence show that during the Pleistocene era there were repeated glaciations that have carved out a large number of valley troughs. On the eastern side, these troughs contain networks of glacial lakes, some that are over deep and are dammed by terminal moraines. On the southern and western side, the valleys are broader and are interspersed with rolling uplands pierced by rugged massifs. Lowlands In the lowlands, areas not reached by the glaciation, the principal geographic features are the moraines and ridges formed by thrusting ice.

It was decided to build dispersal bases away from the primary bases to be used in the event of an emergency. Vatry was selected to be one of these \\"NATO Dispersed Operating Bases\\". No flying unit was ever permanently assigned to Vatry and it was used for dispersal training only. However, it did require the same level of equipment as a standard air base. NATO security personnel were required to control base access, guard equipment, munitions and supplies stored on the facility, as well as prevent vandalism. Construction began in 1953, and Vatry Air Base was designed for 50 fighters with three large hangars constructed. In 1956 construction was completed and Det #2, 48th Air Base Group from Chaumont- Semoutiers Air Base was designated as the host unit. Aircraft from the United States Air Force 21st, 48th, 49th and 388th Fighter-Bomber Wings deployed to Vatry, usually one fighter squadron at a time. In 1959 Vatry Air Base was phased down and all munitions, equipment and supplies were sent to Chaumont Air Base's Base Supply and the host detachment was inactivated. The facility was transferred to the United States Army as a training facility in 1960. With the French withdrawal from the integrated NATO military structure in 1967, the American forces left Vatry Air Base and it was closed. For many years, Vatry Air Base was under the control of the French Air Force and used for a training facility. About 2000 it was sold to civil interests and today is being used as an international heavy cargo airport.

Its plot follows an unstable Vietnam War veteran who wages war against his oppressors in a small Southern town. It was also released under several alternate titles, including Ruckus in Madoc County, The Loner, and Eat My Smoke. Plot Kyle Hanson is an emotionally bruised veteran of the Vietnam War who finds himself unable to rejoin mainstream society and lives as a drifter. While stopping in a small Southern town to eat, local bullies begin harassing him, a situation that culminates in a violent altercation with redneck Homer, after which Kyle flees. Relying on his special forces training, he manages to evade pursuing deputies. Kyle spends the night in a barn at the home of Jenny Bellows, a young mother whose husband went missing-in-action in Vietnam, and is presumed dead. Jenny now resides with her son, Bobby, and father-in-law, Sam Bellows, the richest man in town. In the morning, after Sam leaves on a business trip, Jenny encounters Kyle, who walks into the home uninvited. Having heard of the altercation the day before and the rumor that he is dangerous, Jenny is initially frightened, but soon finds herself sympathetic to Kyle. Sheriff Jethro Pough learns that Kyle was previously incarcerated in a military psychiatric hospital during his service, and was catatonic for over a year. Meanwhile, several local men plan to hunt Kyle and eject him from the community, led by the imperious Deputy Dave. After evading several townspeople by fleeing into the woods, Kyle rejoins Jenny, and the two ride motorcycles together. She invites him into her home, and offers to wash his clothes and allow him to bathe. Meanwhile, a number of townsmen and local law enforcement stalk the house, having trailed Kyle there. Kyle manages to thwart their attempt at capturing him by causing their cars to explode and stealing a truck. Following a high-speed chase, Kyle crashes the truck into a river but escapes, leading the townsmen to believe he is dead until they are unable to find his body. Kyle returns to Jenny's home, where she reveals to him that Sheriff Pough has just informed her that her husband has been confirmed as deceased by the military. Later that night, Kyle accompanies Jenny and Bobby to the local fair, where they spend the evening at the carnival. Cece, a local farmer, spots Kyle with Jenny and calls Deputy Dave. The two men assail him at the carnival and kidnap him while Jenny takes Bobby to the bathroom. The men bring him to Homer's farm, where they hold him hostage in a grain elevator. Locked in a cage, Kyle suffers posttraumatic stress disorder flashbacks to his time in Vietnam. The following morning, Deputy Dave brings a large gathering of men to the grain elevator to harass and beat Kyle. They attempt to wage a fight with him, but Kyle beats several of the men up before leaping from the top of the grain elevator into a river below. The townsmen attempt to find Kyle in the water, but he hides beneath the surface to evade them. He steals a boat and is swiftly pursued by the men, who race after him in two others. Meanwhile, Jenny hears gunfire from the river, and picks up Sam and Sheriff Pough from her house to bring them to the scene. Using liquor bottles found in his boat, Kyle fashions molotov cocktails, which he hurls at his attackers from the shore, causing their boats to explode and leaving them stranded on a small island in the river. Kyle is pursued on the island by the men, though Cece is now fearful of him. Kyle camouflages himself with mud and terrorizes his attackers with a number of traps and makeshift weapons, instilling fear in all of them. Jenny, Sam, and Sheriff Pough descend upon the scene as all of Kyle's attackers flee fearfully into the river. Sam, having been informed by Jenny that Kyle is harmless, declares that Kyle may stay on the river island and have it as his own. Jenny looks on fondly as Kyle washes the mud from himself in the water. Cast Release The film was first released in July 1980 under the title Ruckus in Madoc County. The following month, in August 1980, it was released in some U.S. cities under the alternate title The Loner. Other alternate titles included Eat My Smoke. Home media Paragon Home Video released the film under the Ruckus title on VHS in 1983. Anchor Bay Entertainment released it on DVD in 2000, reissuing it with an alternate cover art in 2002. Similarities to First Blood Ruckus was released two years before First Blood, but there are numerous similarities between the films. The original rights for David Morell's novel went through 10 years of passing hands before culminating in the 1982 film. It's entirely possible - and likely - that Ruckus was inspired by one of the many First Blood screenplays circulating around Hollywood at the time.

It is unusual in having virtually no straight lines and no descenders. It was created by Morris Fuller Benton and issued by American Type Founders in 1910. A light version, Light Hobo, was released in 1915. Matrices were offered for mechanical composition by Intertype. The lower case letters provided the basis for Robert Wiebking's Advertisers Gothic of 1917. There are several theories regarding the font's name, and in fact it is widely recognized as one of the more interesting mysteries in typographic history. One theory states that its name came from a story stating that it was sketched in the early 1900s, sent to the foundry nameless, and progressed so little for so long, that it was called \\"that old hobo\\". Hobo, originally called Adface, was finally patented in 1915 along with Light Hobo. The prevailing bow-legged shape of the letterforms inspired another long-held theory that it was so named because they resembled those of a bow-legged hobo. The most complete and most plausible theory demonstrates how Benton, who lived and worked near a large Russian community, must have seen a particular cigar poster spelling what appears to read like \\"HOBO!\\" (\\"–Ω–æ–≤–æ\\", Russian for \\"New!\\"). The poster's hand-lettering of the word bears striking and unique resemblances to the font; the shape of the O at the extreme right of the poster was probably traced by Benton to match his own Capital O precisely, and those shapes helped define the design of the font. Digital versions of this face are often found in Mac OS and Microsoft Windows systems.  Usage in popular culture  Hobo was used as the main typeface in the title sequence and promotional materials of the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Hobo was also used in the opening titles of The Dukes of Hazzard, Hobo also used as the main typeface in the title card sequence of Winx Club. Hobo was used as the long closing credits of Tic-Tac-Dough. Hobo was used as the opening and ending credits of the popular television show That '70s Show. Hobo was used in Pantages Theatre logo. Hobo was used in the logo of Ubu Productions from 1982-2002 Hobo also gets used in the Bon App√©tit test kitchen videos.

The refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Long Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The refuge was established December 27, 1954, through a donation by the Morton family. It encompasses diverse habitats including bay beach, a brackish pond, a freshwater pond, kettle holes, tidal flats, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, shrub, grasslands, maritime oak forest, and red cedar. The refuge's diversity is critical to Long Island wildlife. The north/south orientation of the refuge's peninsula creates important habitat for shorebirds, raptors and songbirds as they navigate the coastline during migration. Habitats along the beach attract nesting piping plovers, roseate terns, least terns, common terns, and shorebirds. The waters surrounding the refuge are considered critical habitat for juvenile Kemp's ridley sea turtles and are occasionally used by loggerhead sea turtles. Waterfowl use of the refuge peaks during the colder months. Long-tailed ducks, white-winged scoter, goldeneye and black ducks will most likely be spotted during winter.

One such group is that of the O'Donohue Lives, so called after one of the manuscript's contributors, Diarmaid √ì D√∫nchadha. These works are mostly eighth- and ninth-century Lives of saints whose monasteries lay in central Ireland (around Slieve Bloom), in parts of Munster, Mide and Leinster.

The collection also includes five short Lives of saints associated with northern churches (in Ulster or the Airg√≠alla): Mo Lua of Drumsnat, Daig of Inniskeen, Mochta of Louth, √âogan of Ardstraw and Mac Nisse of Connor. Their feast-days are given in August or the beginning of September.

Two seats can be fitted for training purposes. Only one was built. Design and development The A1 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane. The wing has straight edges, with sweep only on the leading edge, and squared tips. It is a single piece structure of light alloy construction, with Frise type mass balanced ailerons which are fabric covered aft of the spar; a ground adjustable trim tab is fitted on the port side. There are no flaps. The empennage is also straight tapered and of similar construction to the wing, though the rudder is fabric covered. There is a small dorsal fin. All rear control surfaces are horn balanced; the tailplane's incidence can be adjusted on the ground and the starboard elevator has a ground adjustable trim tab. The fuselage is a mostly fabric covered welded tube structure with wooden formers, though the upper decking is plywood. The cockpit has a side hinged bubble canopy. Normally flown as a single seater, a second seat can be added for training. The fixed, conventional undercarriage is from a de Havilland Chipmunk, with hydraulic brakes in the wheels. The A1's construction was delayed by funding problems: though design work began in 1968, the first flight was not made until 1976. By mid-1977 some 40 hours had been flown under the power of a 156 kW (210 hp) Rolls-Royce Continental IO-360-D. This was then replaced with a 209 kW (280 hp) Lycoming IO-540-D (Special) driving a three blade propeller which markedly improved the performance. Revised ailerons were fitted, the rudder horn balanced and heightened. Only one aircraft (G-BCIT) was built and this remains in store at Cranfield in 2010.

It is the only land-locked refuge in the complex. Sayville consists primarily of oak-pitch pine forests interspersed with grasslands. This sub-unit supports a diversity of migratory songbirds and raptors. The refuge contains the largest population of sandplain gerardia (a federally endangered plant) in the state of New York. Management activities focus on protecting and enhancing habitat for this endangered plant and for migratory birds. History The refuge was established in 1992 by the transfer of a parcel of vacant Federal Aviation Administration land. In 1990, Congress legislated the transfer of an additional parcel from the FAA to the refuge. That exchange was to be completed after the FAA had removed all buildings and improvements. Those have since been removed, and the transfer was completed in February 2007.

His First World War service in the Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops was marked by his abilities in organizing, staffing, and commanding flying squadrons. He also became a flying ace credited with six aerial victories Postwar, he commanded the Austrian Flugpolizei. Early life On 17 January 1885, Nikitsch entered the world at Gross-Czakowitz, Austro-Hungarian Empire, in present day Czechoslovakia. After primary schooling, he attended a Technical High School for four terms, then Cadet School for a further four terms. Military career Infantry service Upon graduation from Cadet School, he became an officer in the Austro-Hungarian 35th Infantry Regiment.Franks, et al, pp. 194--195. His athletic prowess led to his assignment to teaching some 700 fencing and gymnastics instructors to coach their sport. He also earned himself many Gold Medals in fencing, culminating in his becoming a Junior World Master in 1910. Aerial service In the early days of the First World War, Nikitsch was recruited for pilot training. By May 1915, he was capable of flying as Deputy Commander of Fliegerkompanie 16 (Flik 16) out of Villach on the Italian Front, though primarily on test flights. Transferred to Fliegerkompanie 14 (Flik 14) on the Russian Front in late July 1915, Nikitsch learned to excel in artillery direction missions supporting the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army. He was awarded the Bronze Military Merit Medal with Swords. In November 1915, he was posted to Strasshof (near Vienna) as commander; there he would assemble, outfit, and train entire squadrons headed to battle. These units included Fliks 24 through 38. However, on 3 July 1916, Nikitsch crashed while on a test flight, leading to a short spell in hospital. In January 1917, Nikitsch was finally granted his request for a combat assignment. He was told to form Flik 39 at Strasshof as his own unit. He had his novices trained, supplied, and organized by March. They were posted to Czik-Szereda on the Romanian Front. It was a small sloping airstrip with a hazardous drop-off at one end. It soon became apparent that the French and Russian opposition had to be prevented from attacking Flik 39's reconnaissance machines. Nikitsch modified one of his unit's two-seaters into a single-seater escort fighter. In July, fighter craft and pilots from Fliks 29, 31, 33, and 39 were massed to protect the area's recon machines, Nikitsch among them. On 19 July, Nikitsch scored his first aerial victory flying an Albatros D.III; his second came four days later. With his favorite mount being a Hansa-Brandenburg D.I, he shot down two Nieuports and a Farman during August 1917. On 27 November 1917, he scored one final victory, again using an Albatros. As the Battle of Caporetto raged, Flik 39 was detailed in support of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Corps. Additionally, on 16 October 1917, Nikitsch was tasked with managing several Austro-Hungarian and German squadrons during the battle. As the Austro-Hungarians advanced some 100 kilometers and communications began to break down, Nikitsch knit the air effort together with repeated recon and courier flights. His success in this earned him both classes of the Iron Cross and the Order of the Iron Crown with War Decorations and Swords. Nikitsch was named to command Fliegerkompanie 63J in January 1918. A serious crash intervened, sending him to hospital. After a long convalesensce, he would be sent to command an Aviation Training Battalion in Wiener Neustadt until war's end. Postwar Nikitsch studied law at the University of Graz, earning his Juris Doctorate. He also commanded Austria's covert Flugpolizei, which had been founded using aircraft left over from the war. On 7 September 1927, Nikitsch was test flying a French fighter when it suffered engine failure. He died in the crash. Endnotes Bibliography * Franks, Norman; Guest, Russell; Alegi, Gregory (2008).

Najdi is most famous for his 1994 short story collection The leopards who have run with me ()). Biography Bijan Najdi was born in Khash, a county in Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran. His parents were from Gilan. When he was four, he lost his father in a murder incident. He got his basic education in Rasht. He got his M.A in Mathematics and was one of the first writers to go to the front in Iran-Iraq war. He started writing when he was young, and published his notable book \\"The leopards who have run with me\\" in 1994, three years before his death. This book received a Gardoun award as one of the best short story collections ever written in Iran.Ibna.com Style Najdi uses Persian literature's figures of speech to make his style unique. Considering Najdi's works through linguistic point of view, in some of his stories what we have is actually poetry. Language is a base for Praise and poetry and it is the language that forms a poem for its poet and a story for its writer. Language in Najdi's work is more poetic rather than a social reality. Each language consists of linguistic elements which are regularly put together. Combination of phonemes forms words and words make sentences or phrases. But this is not the only feature of linguistic elements; they can replace each other. Combination and replacement of linguistic elements, forms metonymy. Metaphor is one of these functions which is extensively used in literary works. Examples from Leopards *\\"The white winter, walks its white cold beyond the window.

It was broadcast originally on April 13, 1995, on the cable network Nickelodeon. The plot follows series regulars Grandpa Boris and the babies as they become trapped in the attic on Passover; to pass the time, Boris tells the Jewish story of the Exodus. During the episode the babies themselves reenact the story, with young Tommy portraying Moses, while his cousin Angelica represents the Pharaoh of Egypt. \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" was directed by Jim Duffy, Steve Socki, and Jeff McGrath from the script by Peter Gaffney, Paul Germain, Rachel Lipman, and Jonathon Greenberg. The episode was conceived in 1992 when Germain responded to a Nickelodeon request for a Rugrats Hanukkah special by creating a Passover episode instead. The episode scored a 3.1 Nielsen Rating, making it \\"the highest-rated show in Nickelodeon's history\\", and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, including from Jewish community publications. It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, an Annie Award, and a CableACE Award. The episode also, however, attracted Controversy, when the Anti-Defamation League compared the artistic design of the older characters to anti-Semitic drawings from a 1930s Nazi newspaper. The episode made Rugrats one of the first animated series to focus on a Jewish holiday; its success precipitated the creation of another special, \\"A Rugrats Chanukah\\", which also attracted critical acclaim. A novelization of the episode was in 2007 exhibited at the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Plot As the episode opens, Tommy and Angelica Pickles and their parents are all gathering to celebrate the Passover Seder at the home of Didi's parents, Boris and Minka Kropotkin. Stu and Angelica, who are Christians, both find Passover boring, and Angelica argues why she and her parents should be at the Seder at all, especially considering Boris and Minka aren't actually related to them. Following an argument with Minka about what type of wine glasses they should use (either the glasses that belonged to Minka's mother or the ones that belonged to Boris' father), Boris storms out of the room; the two families arrive and Didi tries comforting her mom, who believes Boris has run away. Boris hasn't reappeared by the time Tommy's best friend, Chuckie Finster, and his dad, Chas, arrive to join the celebration. When the Seder begins, Angelica releases the babies due to Tommy leaving his screwdriver behind. The children set off to search for toys, eventually finding Boris in the attic. Boris explains that he felt bad about yelling at Minka, and had gone to look for her mother's wine glasses, but had become locked inside when the door closed behind him (it can't open from the inside). Angelica tests the door, and inadvertently locks them all in again. Angelica tells Boris that he's not really missing anything and admits that she thinks that Passover's a dumb holiday. Boris tries convincing her otherwise by telling her and the boys the story of the Exodus, hoping to improve their understanding of Passover. As he talks, Angelica imagines herself as the Pharaoh of Egypt, who commands the Hebrew slaves (imagined as the other Rugrats and numerous other babies) to throw their newborn sons into the Nile River. One Hebrew slave defies the order by putting her infant son, Moses (imagined as Tommy), into a basket and setting the basket afloat in the river. The basket and baby are discovered by Pharaoh Angelica, who shows Moses around her palace and kingdom, and decides to make him her partner. As Boris explains that the Pharaoh was oblivious that Moses himself was actually a Hebrew, Chas enters the attic, looking for the kids, and becomes locked in with the rest of them. He sits down and listens as Boris continues: years later, Boris says, Moses stood up for an abused Hebrew slave (imagined as Chuckie), and was outed as a Hebrew. The episode then pictures Tommy as Moses fleeing to the desert, where he becomes a shepherd and forgets about Egypt and the Pharaoh, until the voice of God calls to him from a burning bush, telling him that he must free the Hebrews from slavery. Moses confronts the Pharaoh and demands that she free the Hebrews. She refuses and calls her guards (one of which was a kid named Justin, voiced by Dana Hill) to drag Moses away; he curses her kingdom with terrible plagues until she relents and allows Moses to leave with the enslaved Hebrews. As Boris is explaining how the Pharaoh deceived the Hebrews and prevented them from leaving, Angelica's parents, Drew and Charlotte, arrive and become locked in with the others. Boris resumes the story: the Pharaoh's treachery causes Moses to curse her once more, this time with a plague on the first-born children of Egypt. The Pharaoh, after realizing that she herself is a first-born child, bargains with Moses: he can leave if he calls off this final plague. Moses hesitates at first, but complies and leads the Hebrews out of Egypt. The Pharaoh reneges on her promise after realizing that she set all of the Hebrews free like the slave who gets the Reptar cereal, the slave who gets the goat milk, and the slave who prepares her bath. She leads out her remaining army to pursue them. Minka, Didi, and Stu arrive in the attic to find the group enthralled by the end of Boris' story: Moses, cornered, calls down the power of God to part the Red Sea, which the Hebrews are approaching. They pass through the parted waters, which then crash back together behind them, engulfing the Pharaoh and her army. Underwater, Pharaoh blames Cynthia for this mess they are in as Cynthia is snatched up by a shark. With the story over, the family gets up to finish the Seder only to see the wind blow the door shut, locking them all in. Boris decides to tell them another story. At first, Chas thinks is about how the Hebrews wandered the desert for forty years before finally reaching the Promised Land. Boris actually explains that it's actually a story about how his aunt and uncle met at Passover Seder back in Russia. Production Melanie Chartoff voiced both Didi and Minka in the episode. The episode's inception in 1992 followed a call by Nickelodeon to the Rugrats production staff, pitching the concept of a special episode concerning Hanukkah. The crew agreed instead that a Passover special would offer both \\"historical interest\\" and a \\"funny idea\\", so Paul Germain‚Äîfounder of the series along with Arlene Klasky and G√°bor Csup√≥‚Äîpitched the Passover idea instead. Germain wrote the episode's teleplay along with regular Rugrats writers Peter Gaffney, Rachel Lipman, and Jonathan Greenberg; animators Jim Duffy, Steve Socki, and Jeff McGrath directed. While scripting the episode, now entitled \\"A Rugrats Passover\\", the writers were forced to audit many elements of the portrayal of plagues, particularly the third one, so it could still be accessible to children and not too frightening. Though regular episodes of the series comprised two separate 15-minute segments, \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" had a special 22-minute format, occupying the show's full network Rugrats slot. The show's voice actors each spent from fifteen minutes to four hours in recording sessions for the episode. Themes \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" was unusual among contemporary animations in its attention to Jewish ritual and tradition. Its portrayal of a Seder dinner received press attention as a rare occurrence in children's programming. The episode was also unusual among animated series for discussing the characters' religious affiliations. It revealed Boris, Minka, and Didi's adherence to Judaism, and compared it with the relative non- participation of Stu and his side of the family. Chuckie and his father Chas, meanwhile, were portrayed as nonreligious yet inclusive and enthused to learn about the customs of the holiday. As with other Rugrats episodes, \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" depicts \\"the innocence of a baby's perception of the world,\\" emphasizing the young characters' intense, childlike reactions to their environment. Creator Klasky identified the episode's depiction of the Pickles family as \\"very loving, [and] basically functional\\" as strikingly different from the prevailing trends in contemporary television programming. Another episode element common to the series' broader themes is its treatment of Angelica's mother Charlotte, who throughout the episode is glued to her cell phone and engrossed in her business life, despite her professed desire to provide Angelica with an educational environment. Reception Ratings and accolades \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" was broadcast originally on April 13, 1995, on the Nickelodeon television network. Repeats of the episode began that Saturday at 7:30 p.m. The episode received a Nielsen Rating of 3.1, with a 4.8% share of American audiences, making it the sixth most-watched cable telecast that week. According to Catherine Mullally, Vice President and Executive Producer of Nickelodeon Video and Audio Works in 1995, the episode was the highest Nielsen-rated telecast in the network's history. The episode was supplanted as Nickelodeon's most-viewed in 1998, by another Rugrats special, when the Thanksgiving episode \\"The Turkey Who Came to Dinner\\" attracted 3.7 million viewers (9.4/28). The episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the category \\"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour),\\" but lost to The Simpsons episode \\"Lisa's Wedding.\\" At the 23rd Annual Annie Awards it was nominated in the category \\"Best Individual Achievement for Writing in the Field of Animation,\\" but was beaten by the episode \\"The Tick vs. Arthur‚Äôs Bank Account\\" from Fox Kids' animated series The Tick. In 1995, it was Rugrats' submission for a CableACE award; it received a nomination but did not win. Home video and related merchandise The episode was released in several formats, including DVD and VHS. It appears on the video release A Rugrats Passover alongside features \\"Toys in the Attic\\", and Rugrats Passover: Let My Babies Go. The cassette was reissued, alongside newer Rugrats videos Grandpa's Favorite Stories and Return of Reptar, in early 1997. Publisher Simon Spotlight in 1998 released a novelization of the episode, entitled Let My Babies Go! A Passover Story, written by Sarah Wilson and featuring illustrations by Barry Goldberg. Critical response \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one of the series' all- time most popular episodes. John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote of the episode \\"If not a first, it certainly is a rarity.\\" Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called the episode \\"among the best holiday TV specials ever produced.\\" Other reviews applauded the episode for its treatment of Judaism. Authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin, in their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim praised the episode for celebrating \\"secular Jewishness in the wisest and most entertaining fashion [...] Grandpa Boris regales the kids with an epic, albeit abridged, Exodus story.\\" Halley Blair of Forward Magazine called the episode \\"a comical primer for getting children ready for upcoming seders,\\" and Danny Goldberg, in How The Left Lost Teen Spirit, noted that the episode's Jewish themes were \\"clearly expressed in the context of a mass appeal entertainment.\\" Among many positive reviews of the episode in Jewish community publications, Gila Wertheimer of the Chicago Jewish Star said that the episode \\"will entertain children of all ages ‚Äì and their parents.\\" Joel Keller of AOL's TV Squad, on the other hand, noted in 2006 that he \\"always hated\\" the episode, and resented that it was one of only two Passover-themed television episodes he could find via a Google search. Anti-Defamation League controversy \\"A Rugrats Passover,\\" along with other Rugrats episodes featuring Boris and Minka, attracted controversy when the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) claimed that the two characters resembled anti-Semitic drawings that had appeared in a 1930s Nazi newspaper. Nickelodeon's then-president Albie Hecht, himself Jewish, professed himself dumbfounded by the criticism, calling it absurd. The controversy resurfaced in 1998 when the ADL criticized another appearance of Boris, this time reciting the Mourner's Kaddish in a Rugrats comic strip published in newspapers during the Jewish New Year. Unlike Hecht, Nickelodeon's new president Herb Scannell agreed with the criticism and apologized, promising never to run the character or the strip again. Legacy \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" has been Nickelodeon's first programming about Passover; the network went on to broadcast other episodes concerning Jewish traditions, including \\"Harold's Bar Mitzvah\\", a 1997 episode of Hey Arnold! in which the character Harold Berman prepares for his Bar Mitzvah. Rugrats in turn produced a second Jewish holiday episode, this time to meet the network executives' original Hanukkah special pitch. David N. Weiss, who had recently converted to Judaism, and J. David Stem collaborated to write the script, and Raymie Muzquiz directed. The episode, entitled \\"A Rugrats Chanukah,\\" was originally broadcast on December 4, 1996, on Nickelodeon and received a Nielsen rating of 7.9 in the Kids 2‚Äì11 demographic. Like \\"A Rugrats Passover,\\" it was critically acclaimed and became among the most popular episodes in the series. In 2007 the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma opened an exhibition of Biblical images in art and pop culture, including a poster for Let My Babies Go! A Passover Story, the picture book based on \\"A Rugrats Passover\\". Other items highlighted in the gallery included a promotional poster for The Simpsons episode \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" and a vintage Superman comic book entitled \\"The Red-Headed Beatle of 1000 B.C.,\\" featuring the character Jimmy Olsen's time-traveling adventures in the Biblical age.

He argues an earlier date for Aed's vita based on archaic spellings in the Codex Salmanticensis, names which in later recensions have been updated. To this evidence Jim Tschen Emmons added that the vita in CS conforms more closely to earlier saints' Lives, particularly that of St. Martin of Tours with which it shares certain similarities and that of St. Brigit in its episodic nature (Emmons, \\"Limits of Late Antiquity,\\" Ch. 2). Moreover, one sees no evidence of the reforms of the Celi De nor the Gregorian reforms--these absences do not preclude a later date, but taken with the other evidence helps support an earlier date (Emmons, \\"Limits of Late Antiquity,\\" 139).Emmons also provides a translation and commentary for the version of the vita in CS. See Appendix A in his \\"Limits of Late Antiquity.\\" Although the Life borrows from Adomn√°n's life of Columba, a copy of which may have been obtained from the nearby monastery of Durrow, its central concerns are with local violence and with the poverty and insecurity of women, especially nuns. √Åed seems to have had a profound interest in the well-being of religious women.

On one occasion, when he perceived that the girl serving him was pregnant he fled from the building both to avoid the pollution and to shame her.

One of these results is now known as de Bruijn's theorem. According to this theorem, a \\"harmonic brick\\" (one in which each side length is a multiple of the next smaller side length) can only be packed into a box whose dimensions are multiples of the brick's dimensions.. Example De Bruijn was led to prove this result after his then-seven-year-old son, F. W. de Bruijn, was unable to pack bricks of dimension 1\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot 4 into a 6\\\\cdot 6\\\\cdot 6 cube... The cube has a volume equal to that of 27 bricks, but only 26 bricks may be packed into it. One way to see this is to partition the cube into 27 smaller cubes of size 2\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot 2 colored alternately black and white. This coloring has more unit cells of one color than of the other, but with this coloring any placement of the 1\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot 4 brick must have equal numbers of cells of each color. Therefore, any tiling by bricks would also have equal numbers of cells of each color, an impossibility.. De Bruijn's theorem proves that a perfect packing with these dimensions is impossible, in a more general way that applies to many other dimensions of bricks and boxes. Boxes that are multiples of the brick Suppose that a d-dimensional rectangular box (mathematically a cuboid) has integer side lengths A_1 \\\\cdot A_2 \\\\cdot \\\\dotso \\\\cdot A_d and a brick has lengths a_1 \\\\cdot a_2 \\\\cdot \\\\dotso \\\\cdot a_d. If the sides of the brick can be multiplied by another set of integers b_i so that a_1b_1,a_2b_2,\\\\dots a_d b_d are a permutation of A_1, A_2,\\\\dots,A_d, the box is called a multiple of the brick. The box can then be filled with such bricks in a trivial way with all the bricks oriented the same way. A generalization Not every packing involves boxes that are multiples of bricks. For instance, as de Bruijn observes, a 5\\\\cdot 6 rectangular box can be filled with copies of a 2\\\\cdot 3 rectangular brick, although not with all the bricks oriented the same way. However, proves that if the bricks can fill the box, then for each a_i, at least one of the A_i is a multiple. In the above example, the side of length 6 is a multiple of both 2 and 3. Harmonic bricks The second of de Bruijn's results, the one called de Bruijn's theorem, concerns the case where each side of the brick is an integer multiple of the next smaller side. De Bruijn calls a brick with this property harmonic. For instance, the most frequently used bricks in the USA have dimensions 2\\\\tfrac{1}{4}\\\\cdot 4\\\\cdot 8 (in inches), which is not harmonic, but a type of brick sold as \\"Roman brick\\" has the harmonic dimensions 2\\\\cdot 4\\\\cdot 12.. De Bruijn's theorem states that, if a harmonic brick is packed into a box, then the box must be a multiple of the brick. For instance, the three-dimensional harmonic brick with side lengths 1, 2, and 6 can only be packed into boxes in which one of the three sides is a multiple of six and one of the remaining two sides is even.. Packings of a harmonic brick into a box may involve copies of the brick that are rotated with respect to each other. Nevertheless, the theorem states that the only boxes that can be packed in this way are boxes that could also be packed by translates of the brick. provided an alternative proof of the three-dimensional case of de Bruijn's theorem, based on the algebra of polynomials.. Non-harmonic bricks The third of de Bruijn's results is that, if a brick is not harmonic, then there is a box that it can fill that is not a multiple of the brick. The packing of the 2\\\\cdot 3 brick into the 5\\\\cdot 6 box provides an example of this phenomenon. An (a_1+a_2)\\\\cdot (a_1a_2) box, tiled with a_1\\\\cdot a_2 bricks, for the case a_1=2 and a_2=5 In the two-dimensional case, the third of de Bruijn's results is easy to visualize. A box with dimensions A_1=a_1 and A_2=a_1\\\\cdot a_2 is easy to pack with a_1 copies of a brick with dimensions a_1,a_2, placed side by side. For the same reason, a box with dimensions A_1=a_1\\\\cdot a_2 and A_2=a_2 is also easy to pack with copies of the same brick. Rotating one of these two boxes so that their long sides are parallel and placing them side by side results in a packing of a larger box with A_1=a_1+a_2 and A_2=a_1\\\\cdot a_2. This larger box is a multiple of the brick if and only if the brick is harmonic.

He became a flying ace during World War I despite his indifference in claiming victories; he was credited with six confirmed victories, seventeen unconfirmed, and an unknown number unclaimed. He later was instrumental in developing Antwerp's airport. Pre- World War I activities Lieutenant Jan Olieslagers turned in his bicycle to become an early motorcycle speed record holder; he was the first to go per hour, and was 1902 World Champion. In 1909, he purchased a Bl√©riot monoplane, receiving Pilot's Brevet No. 5 in October. In 1910, he won the Meeting d'Aviation de Rheims. By 1913, he had set seven world aviation records. In June 1914, he proved himself as good an aerobaticist as Roland Garros. World War I At the beginning of World War I, when the Germans invaded his native Belgium, the German government tried to enlist Olieslagers in aerial observation duties. He volunteered himself and his Bl√©riot XI airplane to his nation's military, as did his two brothers, Jules and Max. Jan Olieslagers was promoted to Sergeant, then commissioned before the end of 1914. Aerial activities On 5 January 1915, he crashlanded, injuring his left arm and leg, as well as his chest. On 12 September, he became the first Belgian pilot, as well as one of the first pilots overall, to claim an aerial victory, when he forced down an Aviatik C.I. At the time, he was flying a Nieuport 10 dubbed le Demon, which was the only craft in the Belgian air force painted with camouflage markings and the outside circle of the roundels inscribed in black. He then had a string of four unconfirmed claims before he traded his Nieuport 10 for a Nieuport 11. He scored his second confirmed victory on 17 June 1916, destroying a Fokker D.II over Pijpegale, Belgium. Seven more unconfirmed claims for aerial victories while flying the Nieuport 11 closed out 1917. Olieslagers seems to have begun 1917 with a newer Nieuport, but with two more unconfirmed victories in his newly acquired Hanriot HD.1. Then, on 14 June, he destroyed a German reconnaissance plane over Schore. The following day, he scored for the fourth time, setting a Fokker D. II afire over Keiem. Two more unconfirmed wins followed. Then, on 4 November 1917, he fainted while flying and crashed onto Les Moeres aerodrome. He was taken to hospital in a coma, but aroused a few days later. He returned to flight duty in January 1918, but would not score again until 3 May. On that day, he had one of two claims confirmed. On the 19th, he would set an Albatros D.V aflame over Woumen for his last official victory, although he would have one more unverified win. Professional conduct As if Olieslagers' poor record of approvals was not sufficient to keep his score low, he also habitually took the fight to the Germans and was indifferent to the paperwork to staking claims. Although he submitted one combat report on 30 March 1916 for a witnessed triumph behind enemy lines, which went unverified for lack of an officer's confirmation, he usually did not bother with claims for wins behind the German lines. Jan Olieslagers seldom took leave, although he did visit Colonel Isaac Newton Lewis, the machine gun inventor, in London on many occasions. He tended to busy himself around his home aerodrome and the airplanes assigned to him. He habitually broke in rookie pilots, cushioning their entry into the deadly art of aerial warfare. Aerial career summary Olieslagers was an excellent pilot; he had his brother Jules for a talented mechanic. The combination usually meant a reliable airplane under the ace, but on 9 November 1918, engine problems brought Jan Olieslagers down in a field near Eeklo. It was his 518th and final combat sortie; he had fought in 97 dogfights over a four-year stretch. Post World War I Olieslagers was not demobilized until 23 September 1919. He returned home, and opened a garage. On 1 April 1921, he was pensioned off as a reserve Lieutenant. He had not ceased working for his nation; in 1923, he was largely responsible for the opening of the new Antwerp airport. Even today, his statue stands by the entrance. When Jan Olieslagers died of cancer on 23 March 1942,The Aerodrome website Retrieved on 7 October 2020 Belgium was once again occupied by the Germans. Although the Nazis had banned both the playing of the Belgian national anthem and the display of the Belgian flag, as a mark of his nation's regard, Olieslagers' casket was defiantly draped with the flag he had served so well, while the Belgian National Hymn was played in his honor.

He was an Italian volunteer soldier in the French liberation army FTP-MOI. His name is one of the ten featured on the \\"affiche rouge\\", the propaganda poster displayed by the Germans during the trial of the 23 members of the Manouchian group. His photograph is also on the poster, with the caption \\"Fontanot, Italian communist, 12 attacks\\".  Early years  Spartaco Fontanot was born on 17 January in Monfalcone, in the province of Gorizia in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. He arrived in France at the age of two, his antifascist parents having been obliged to leave Italy when Benito Mussolini came to power. After elementary school, he took classes at the technical college of Puteaux, which he left with a \\"certificate of professional aptitude\\" as a fitter, turner, and draftsman. His wish was to become an engineer, but his parents were not able to help him pursue his studies, and he started at a small factory as a turner. He still harbored the ambition to become an engineer by taking night classes at the √âcole des Arts et M√©tiers in Paris.  Second world war  At the time of the German occupation in 1941, Fontano quickly devoted himself to the armed struggle, and, in 1942, he volunteered for the FTP's immigrant section in the Paris region, a part of the French forces of the interior (FFI). Unable to divide his efforts, he stopped taking night courses. In March 1943, the police came to arrest his father and sister. A wanted man, he was forced to quit his parental home. He took part in numerous attacks and sabotages against the occupying forces and against German officers, notably at Rueil, Place de la Concorde, and even bus stations. Of note are the assassination operations he undertook against :fr:Julius Ritter, and against General von Schaumburg, the commandant of greater Paris. He also sabotaged many electricity pylons and was rated as an excellent shot. Because of his command experience as the head of an operational detachment under the command of Missak Manouchian, he was appointed lieutenant in the French Forces of the Interior, the FFI (Forces Fran√ßaises de l'Int√©rieur). Arrested in Paris by the police on 13 November 1943, Fontano did not give them any information. He was transferred to Fresnes prison and sentenced by the military court; his execution took place on 21 February 1944 at Mont Val√©rien along with 21 of his comrades. Spartaco Fontanot was one of three heroes in his family; Jacques Fontanot (18 years old) and N√©rone Fontanot also gave their lives for the liberation of France.

Joris van Schooten (1587‚Äì1651) was a Dutch Golden Age painter and the uncle of the Leiden mathematician Frans van Schooten. Biography Allegory of the foolishness of Man, 1607 According to Houbraken he was born in Leiden with a talent for drawing, and his teachers were upset that he drew animals on everything he was given. At 17 he was apprenticed to Coenraad van der Maas, a good portrait painter, for 3 years, in which short amount of time he became good enough to start out on his own.Joris van Schoten biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature In Delft he was strongly influenced by the school of Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt. After he had learned enough to start his own workshop, he decided to travel to Italy, but his parents married him to Marijtgen Bouwens van Leeuwen, so he cut off his travel plans and returned to Leiden.Joris van Schooten in the RKD He was a successful painter who was respected in the community. He joined the Leiden Guild of St. Luke and was one of a group who sent a petition to the city fathers in 1609 for a new, more protective charter for the guild. It was rejected and they attempted this again in 1610 and it was again rejected. He won lucrative portrait commissions from the Leiden schutterij in 1626 and painted a historical piece for the city hall of Leiden where the mayor van der Werff offers his sword to the hungry people of Leiden with the speech; If it will help you, cut my body into pieces and distribute this among you - this will comfort me. He also won a commission from the Lutheran Church in 1640 for a series of paintings on the life of man. According to the RKD, he was son of a Flemish immigrant in Leiden who was registered as the pupil of Evert van der Maes in The Hague in 1604 for three years, and he married Marijtgen who was from Oegstgeest on May 17, 1617 in Leiden. He was the teacher, not the pupil, of Coenraed van der Maes van Avenrode (probably a family member of Evert), and also the teacher of the painters Jan Lievens and Abraham van den Tempel. According to Simon van Leeuwen he was also the teacher of Rembrandt.Joris van Schooten as teacher of Rembrandt and Lievens in Simon van Leeuwen's Korte besgryving van het Lugdunum Batavorum nu Leyden, Leiden, 1672 Legacy His paintings in the Lutheran church and the city hall of Leiden still hang where they were installed.Lutheran Church of Leiden He was the teacher of Rembrandt, Jan Lievens, and Abraham van den Tempel.

Graham.  Plot  Lisa Connors, an Anders University freshman, has big hopes of a job at the university newspaper. Her ambitious mother, Gwen, suggests Lisa should join a sorority, Pi Gamma Beta (Œ†ŒìŒí), as she herself had great fun during her days in the sorority. Lisa applies to Pi Gamma Beta, the most prestigious sorority on campus. Lisa also talks her way into joining the school newspaper. At the paper, she meets Steven Tyler, a fellow student with whom she becomes involved romantically. In order to join the sorority, mainly consisting of snobs who enjoy others' suffering, candidates must endure the cruel humiliation of hazing. Shelby Blake, another freshman desperate for sorority acceptance, immediately befriends Lisa. When Steven discovers Lisa and Shelby's experiences in connection with PGB, including, apparently, having to eat broken glass, he is appalled. He publishes an article critical of hazing. This leads to his being beaten up. Lisa refuses to cooperate when the sorority require the two applicants to strip and strut back and forth across a table while the sorority call out degrading and hurtful names and draw on the candidates' skin. In consequence, Lisa is absent when the girls take Shelby up a clock tower to hang a banner. Shelby falls to her death when sorority sister, Drea Davenport, orders her to go over the railing. The next day, the sorority sisters claim that Shelby went up to the tower to hang the banner by herself when she was drunk as a surprise. At Shelby's funeral, it is revealed that she was afraid of heights and that she had not been drinking on the night of her death, raising Lisa and Steven's suspicions as to the real cause of her death. Reluctantly Lisa, with Steven's prompting, decides to investigate, at the risk of her reputation and academic future, even though the hostile sorority claims it was an accident. With Steven's help, Lisa contacts a student who was involved in a cruel hazing by the same sorority a year earlier. This student reveals that she almost died and received a settlement from the university to keep quiet. Lisa realizes that Shelby was pressured by her peers into doing something really dangerous that resulted in death. When Lisa uncovers the truth, the school authorities and the other Greeks do their best to silence her, but Lisa is determined to end the hazing. One night while she is walking with Steven, she is kidnapped by several Fraternity boys and dropped off in the snowy woods into a small, icy stream. Steven finds her in the morning and returns her safely to the school, where her mother is waiting for her. Lisa tricks the sorority leader and another sister into going to the Bell Tower where Lisa plays a tape recording of the other girl's account of her near death from Pi Gamma Beta's hazing. As Lisa, her mother, and Steven walk past Greek Row, the Pi Gamma Betas are all removing their belongings, possibly because Pi Gamma Beta's charter has been terminated. Lisa's mother admits that she enjoyed being in Pi Gamma Beta because of the people, not the actual sorority. Lisa's relationship with Steven endures.

Variety called it unconvincing and spoke negatively about the cast and crew as well: 'No one's doing much acting, and director Graham seems hung up on the premise that the telepic's serious. Swank's appealing, but the character's a blank; Gosselaar gives his role the old college try, but nothing's there. Von Oy, suggesting there could be more to her part than is apparent, doesn't find it'. It continued: 'Camerawork and editing are perfunctory, and Roger S. Crandal's production design's conventional. Michael Tavera's score is monotonous'. The New York Times was more praiseful of Swank's acting, saying that she 'gives an excellent account of herself in this made-for-TV movie'.

The third section, \\"Who Is John Galt? 1957‚Äì1968\\", discusses the growth of the Objectivist movement based on Rand's philosophy, and her relationship and eventual break with her prot√©g√© Nathaniel Branden. The final section, \\"Legacies\\", covers the final years of Rand's life and the continuing reaction to her after her death. Burns also includes an \\"Essay on Sources\\" describing the scholarship about Rand and her own use of the Ayn Rand Archives. Reception The book has received generally positive reviews. Booklist described it as a \\"thoroughly engaging biography\\" and \\"eminently readable\\". In a review for The Washington Times, libertarian journalist Brian Doherty said that the book provides \\"a proper sense of where Rand really stands in American ideological history.\\" However, he says Burns is \\"less convincing\\" in showing \\"the connections between Rand and the American right wing\\" as indicated in the book's subtitle. A review by Nick Gillespie in The Wilson Quarterly said, \\"Burns is particularly sharp at analyzing how Cold War conservatives such as Buckley rejected Rand‚Äôs rationalism but eventually benefited from her popularity with college students during the 1960s.\\" American Thinker, a conservative website, described Burns as \\"honest about contradictions that plagued Rand\\" and said the book shows \\"the power of Rand's ideas and the hold she maintained over her followers\\". A brief review from Publishers Weekly was mixed, calling the book \\"exasperatingly detailed and slow-going at times\\", but complimenting Burns for her ability to \\"explicate the evolution of Rand's individualist worldview\\". Several reviews compared the book with another biography of Rand, Ayn Rand and the World She Made by Anne Heller, which was also released in 2009. Heller's book focuses on the details of Rand's life, in contrast to the intellectual history focused on by Burns. In a review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said the two books \\"make many of the same points and touch on many of the same biographical details\\", although Maslin prefers Heller's book for its greater detail. The two books were also reviewed jointly in The New Republic and Time. On October 15, 2009, Burns was interviewed about the book on The Daily Show. Host Jon Stewart said it was \\"incredible timing\\" for the book to be released at a time when Rand was experiencing a \\"resurgence ... in the culture\\", a reference to the popularity of Rand's writing among contemporary conservatives, including the Tea Party movement.

Sir John Barnard (c. 1685 ‚Äì 28 August 1764) was a British Whig politician and Lord Mayor of London.  Early life Barnard was the son of a Quaker merchant from Reading, Berkshire, also named John Barnard and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Robert Payne of Play Hatch in Oxfordshire part of Sonning. He abandoned the Quakers early in his life, and is said to have been baptised into the Anglican faith by Henry Compton, Bishop of London. The younger John Barnard initially worked alongside his father as a London City merchant. He was elected at the 1722 general election as one of the four members of parliament (MPs) for the City of London. Political career Barnard was a vigorous campaigner for the commercial interests that were his principal City of London constituency. In 1734 he successfully promoted an Act of Parliament \\"to prevent the infamous practice of Stock-Jobbing\\". This Act, which was renewed in 1737, later became known as \\"Sir John Barnard's Act\\" in recognition of his efforts.London Stock Exchange (1986) He was selected one of the two Sheriffs of London for 1736‚Äì37. His campaign for City interests continued in the Parliament of 1737, with proposed legislation to reduce interest payments on the national debt, thereby lowering commercial taxation. A further clause would have introduced a Playhouse Act to regulate operation of theatres in the City of London, the disorderly operation of which posed risks of local theft or property damage. Both measures were defeated by the Parliamentary majority headed by Sir Robert Walpole. Nonetheless, Barnard's advocacy was rewarded via election as Lord Mayor of London later in the year. The defeat of Barnard's bills cemented his political opposition to Walpole's administration. From 1738 he joined a faction headed by Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke which rejected Walpole's entire legislative programme. He did not take part in his faction's proclaimed secession from parliament in 1738, but did continue to speak against the government as opportunities arose, including on the proposed resolution of European disputes ahead of what would become the War of the Austrian Succession. On this subject in March 1738, Barnard offered a philosophy of foreign relations opposed to Walpole's attempts to reach a negotiated settlement: > A dishonourable peace is worse than a destructive war...All nations are apt > to play the bully with respect to one another; and if the government or > administration of a nation has taken but one insult tamely, their neighbours > will from thence judge of the character of that nation...and will > accordingly treat them as bullies do noted poltroons; they will kick and > cuff them upon every occasion. Walpole resigned as Prime Minister in February 1742. Barnard was subsequently a supporter of the proposal for an enquiry to investigate Walpole's actions over the preceding ten years with a view to making charges of corruption. He was one of the 21 members named to the enquiry, but little progress was made as most of those called as witnesses refused to testify. The only substantive allegation ‚Äì that of bribing electors in the districts of Wendover and Orford ‚Äì failed when it became clear the evidence was essentially hearsay. Barnard supported a subsequent motion to introduce a Bill of Indemnity pardoning witnesses from any crimes if they testified against Walpole or his Ministers, but the legislation was defeated in the House of Lords. Death Barnard left Parliament at the 1761 general election, and died in 1764. He is commemorated in an ornate bust displayed in the Temple of British Worthies at Lord Cobham's country house at Stowe, alongside similar statues of Elizabeth I and Sir Francis Drake.Simms, p. 259.

It was revived and popularized by Eric Von Schmidt and Tom Rush in the 1960s, and later by the bluegrass musician Tony Rice. History \\"Wasn't That a Mighty Storm\\" likely originated as a spiritual in the black churches in the early part of the 1900s. In the days before radio and television, almost every major public event inspired songs, which spread like text messages spread today, so the precise origin of songs is often hard to pin down. \\"Wasn't That a Mighty Storm\\" was a tale of hardship and trouble and the sometimes inscrutable hand of God. Although the song dwells on a tragic subject, it was typical of songs of this time; in a similar vein, there were dozens of songs written about the sinking of the Titanic and the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. The song was first recorded in 1934 by a preacher named \\"Sin-Killer\\" Griffin for the Library of Congress, in a session conducted by folk song collector John A. Lomax at Darrington State Farm (now the Darrington Unit), a prison near Sandy Point, Texas. The prison inmates served as Griffin's congregation, and Griffin claimed authorship of the song. Since this is the first known appearance of the song, it is not clear whether the song dates to the very famous 1900 Galveston hurricane, which (as of 2014) remains the deadliest natural disaster in United States history, responsible for an estimated 6,000 to 12,000 fatalities. Although as popularized in the 1960s, the song itself references the year 1900 and the lyrics state \\"Now Galveston had no seawall\\"‚Äîwhich was built after the flood‚Äîsome listeners have heard this line as \\"Now Galveston had a seawall\\" which in 1900 it did not, the main reason for the extensive death toll. This may be a clue that the song lyrics were written or at least standardized after the 1915 Galveston hurricane by which time a seawall had been built. Sin- Killer Griffin Sin-Killer was a well-known preacher, with a mesmerizing delivery and full confidence in the name he had given himself. Death was a subject on which he preached frequently. Relatively little is known about his life, which makes it all the more intriguing that back in 1889, in Denton, Texas, a \\"Sin-Killer Griffin\\" tried to organize black Americans to invade Africa. There is some evidence this was the same Sin-Killer Griffin who resurfaced before John Lomax 45 years later, though this reference hasn't been verified conclusively. Griffin told Lomax he'd written \\"Wasn't That a Mighty Storm\\" years earlier, and the lyrics suggest that someone did, since one verse references the flood happening \\"fifteen years ago.\\". Later Versions The song largely stayed in the church until the late 1950s, when folk song revivalists began to record cover versions of rural acoustic songs that had been recorded in previous decades. Eric Von Schmidt found \\"Mighty Storm\\" in the Library of Congress collection, and with his friend Rolf Cahn put together a compelling folk arrangement with powerful guitar chords and a bluesy melody. Von Schmidt handed it off to his fellow New England folkie Tom Rush, who recorded it on a popular album in the early 1960s. The Chad Mitchell Trio recorded a version of the song under the title \\"A Mighty Day.\\" It appeared in their 1961 album \\"Mighty Day on Campus.\\" It was revived again in 1972 by a late incarnation of the country band J.R. Mainer's Mountaineers, who may have performed it back in the 1930s. It was then recorded by Nanci Griffith, who is from Texas herself. Somewhere along the way Sin-Killer Griffin's \\"fifteen years\\" became \\"50 years,\\" suggesting the song was written around 1950, which it wasn't. But most of the other lyrics remained the same, even though several later singers credited themselves with an \\"adaptation\\" of \\"traditional\\" lyrics, usually cutting out Griffin. Tom Rush, an American folk singer, guitarist and composer, recorded \\"Galveston Flood\\" in 1966 for his album Take a Little Walk With Me. Tony Rice, an American guitarist and bluegrass musician, later revitalized the song with a new generation when he recorded the tune as \\"Galveston Flood\\" on his album \\"Tony Rice Plays and Sings Bluegrass\\" in 1993. Tony Rice is considered one of the most influential acoustic guitar players in bluegrass, progressive bluegrass, newgrass and acoustic jazz.Tony Rice bio on www.flatpick.comInfo on Tony Rice on www.bluegrass.org.au Canadian folk band The Duhks recorded the song on their 2008 album Fast Paced World. James Taylor, American singer-songwriter, included his version of the song on his 2009 CD called Other Covers.

You know, the year of 1900, children, Many years ago Death came howling on the ocean Death calls, you got to go Now Galveston had a seawall To keep the water down, And a high tide from the ocean Spread the water all over the town. You know the trumpets give them warning You'd better leave this place Now, no one thought of leaving 'til death stared them in the face And the trains they all were loaded The people were all leaving town The trestle gave way to the water And the trains they went on down. Rain it was a-falling thunder began to roll Lightning flashed like hellfire The wind began to blow Death, the cruel master When the wind began to blow Rode in on a team of horses I cried, \\"Death, won't you let me go\\" Hey, now trees fell on the island And the houses give away Some they strained and drowned Some died in most every way And the sea began to rolling And the ships they could not stand And I heard a captain crying \\"God save a drowning man.\\" Death, your hands are clammy You got them on my knee You come and took my mother Won't you come back after me And the flood it took my neighbor Took my brother, too I thought I heard my father calling And I watched my mother go.

This community is distinct from the Rajasthani Khanzada Rajput, the descendants of Wali-e-Mewat Raja Naher Khan, who are a sub-clan of Jadaun gotra . They are also a community of Muslim Rajputs. They refer to themselves as Musalmaan Rajputs, or sometimes just Rajputs. After the Partition of India in 1947, many members of this community migrated to Pakistan. In addition, a small number of Khanzada are also found in the Terai region of Nepal.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan & J C Das pages 19 Manohar publications History and origin The word Khanzada in Persian means son of a khan, or king. This has literally the same meaning as the word Rajput, which also means son of a king in Sanskrit. The term khanzada originally applied to the Bachgoti Rajput family of the Rajahs of Hasanpur. They were said to have converted to Islam during the rule of Sher Shah Suri. This family claimed descent from Bariar Singh, a Bachgoti Rajput, who said to have emigrated from Sultanpur in the 13th century. The Bachgoti had started off as a clan of the Chauhan Rajputs of Mainpuri. Bariar Singh's grandson, Tilok Chand is said to have converted to Islam, and the family took the name khanzada.pages 94 and 95 in Daughters of the earth : women and land in Uttar Pradesh by Smita Tewari Jassal New Delhi : Manohar, 2001 The Mandarkia and Bharsaiyan are both strictly endogamous groupings, and as such differ from other Khanzada groupings who follow the custom of clan exogamy.pages 40-41 in Muslim Caste in Uttar Pradesh: A Study of Culture Contact by Ghaus Ansari. Ethnographic and Folk Culture Society, 1960 From the middle of the 19th century, the term Khanzada was extended to refer to all those Rajput clans, who had converted to Islam in Awadh and neighbouring Benaras division. The term is now used in the same manner as the term Ranghar, which refers to any Muslim Rajput in western Uttar Pradesh, and Khanzada is now used to describe any of the Muslim Rajput clans of eastern Uttar Pradesh. In addition, the Muslim Bhumihar of Ghazipur District are also included within the Khanzada category.pages 40-41 in Muslim Caste in Uttar Pradesh: A Study of Culture Contact by Ghaus Ansari. Ethnographic and Folk Culture Society, 1960 Present circumstances In northern Awadh, a region comprising roughly Barabanki District in south east to Lakhimpur Kheri District in the north west, the Khanzada have a followed a slightly different path, with a stronger identification with Islam. In a recent study of a Chauhan Khanzada village in Raisenghat Tehsil of Barabanki District, this particular community was seen to be strongly identifying with neighbouring Pathan communities, and there was increasingly intermarriage between the two groups. There economic condition in this region is also been affected, with a dwindling in the size of their farms, especially in Shravasti and Balrampur districts. Many are now, in fact, landless agricultural labourers.Family, kinship and marriage among Muslims in India / edited by Imtiaz Ahmad The Khanzada, however have been badly affected by abolition of the zamindari system, with many now destitute. They still remain a land owning community, but those especially in Balrampur, Gonda and Bahraich are now simply agricultural labourers. The community are also divided on sectarian lines, with the majority being Sunni, while a minority, mainly the ex-taluqdar families being Shia. Like other Indian Muslims, there is growing movement towards orthodoxy, with many of their villages containing madrasas. The madrasas have also facilitated the growth of Urdu, with it beginning to replace the Awadhi dialect they traditionally spoke.

Slade inherited his baronetcy from his father in 1962, and is usually known as Sir Ben Slade. His older brother, Robert, predeceased their father. Sir Ben was educated at Millfield School. He lives at Maunsel House in Bridgwater, Somerset. Slade is childless and has said he is looking for a male heir who has genetic similarity to one of his further paternal ancestors, who will take an interest in running the estate and to whom he will leave it in trust. He was married (from the late 1970s to 1991) to Pauline Myburgh (daughter of Major Claude Myburgh) and divorced, claiming that her 17 cats were an impediment to the marriage.'Wanted: Baby-maker for eccentric toff, 70' - Daily Express 19 April 2017 pg 24 He had a relationship with Fiona Aitken (currently wife of the Earl of Carnarvon) for a few years in the 1990s. His partner was Kirsten Hughes, star of Jane and the Lost City, until she \\"ran off with the handyman\\". Slade was later accused by a neighbour of having abused Hughes; however, Slade successfully sued for libel, and the neighbour admitted to fabricating the allegations in an attempt to sabotage Slade's planned music festival. In 2017 Slade separated from partner Bridget Convey because at age 50 she was too old to supply him with an heir. In the same year he advertised for a wife citing that she should have a shotgun licence, a driving licence, a coat of arms and be young enough to have sons. He rejected candidates from countries beginning with an 'I' or with green in the flag (except Italian and northern Indian women), Scots, lesbians and communists. Sir Benjamin has starred in The Guest Wing, a television programme about owners of country houses, which was shown on Sky Atlantic in April 2012. In 2019 the television show ‚ÄòBring in the Sherriffs‚Äô called to take goods of several thousands of pounds. The outstanding bill was paid before goods were taken and the sherriffs left.

His Paintings have been on collections in different places of the world. He graduated at the University of Santo Tomas, College of Fine Arts in the Philippines. He was a consistent winner in almost all competitions he entered that made him win an award as the Most Outstanding Atelier student in painting (ref. The Varsitarian, \\"The Thomasian as a Surealist\\" by Oscar T. Valeriano) His first one-man show was at the Hidaldo Gallery in Makati Commercial Center, Philippines - January 2, 1974. (ref. Manila Bulletin, Jan 1, 1974 issue, Home & Culture by Carmen Perez section). His painted Pumpkin won best entry at the 1998 Annual Pumpkin Contest at the Westin Hotel & Resorts in San Francisco, California. While some of his works were featured at the San Francisco State University's Literary Magazine, \\"From the Heart\\" or \\"Del Corazon\\". He was a runner up at the Burlingame Art Society competition in 2002. One of his old work was featured in the Encyclopedia of Philippine Art (ref. Encyclopedia of Philippine Art, Volume 1, pg 179). The Florida Medical Journal has one of his composition on its cover in 1990 (ref. The Journal of Florida Medical, September 1990, Vol 77, No.9). An abstract watercolor, metaphorically symbolizing the role of physicians in treating the sick. According to artist Ricardo G. Lacsamana, the outstretched hands symbolize the healing power of physicians, manifest as a healthy tree providing protection and comfort to the sick and infirm who are aided by philanthropic groups, as symbolized by the crutch. The dove and fish indicate that physicians do not escape criticism, while the central \\"internal\\" figures may connote the medical profession as a whole. He created a painting entitled \\"Transition\\" in commemoration of the Peace and Freedom and People Power Revolution (also known as the EDSA Revolution and the Philippine Revolution of 1986), which at that time was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Philippines. The painting was featured in \\"The Manila Times\\" in August 1986 (ref. The Manila Times, August 1986 issue). Lacsamana painted dreams draw admiration to art lovers. His symbols and very fertile imagination produce fantastic images... that takes you in a horizon where you experience dreaming differently, you never thought you could. He copes with contemporary problems such as flood, population explosion, Fil-American relations, women's liberation, poverty, the respective roles of the young and old in society, and with modern interpretations of the Bible.

In 2008, El Saghir introduced TV ratings, when episodes of the controversial show The Bold and the Beautiful were aired semi uncut with an intro-screen warning parents that the show was suitable for \\"Adults Only\\". The airing of the episodes was criticized for the sexual nature of the entire show. Further TV rating categories are due in 2010 where drama and TV shows will be rated from Parental Guidance (PG) to Adults Only.http://www.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=78247&http://www.iulm.it/document_loader.aspx?idDocument=16514http://www.egypttoday.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ArticleID=6624 The Egyptian Censorship Department participates in the Euro - Mediterraneo Annual Conference in Italy that aims to\\" develop mutually beneficial projects that involve the new public and private interlocutors in Arab states of the Persian Gulf, in the context of the priority sectors for the development of Mediterranean Sea area that include infrastructure and energy networks, logistics, technological innovation, information and mass media.\\"http://www.milanomediterraneo.org/ImagePub.aspx?id=40727 The ERTU also participates as an active member in the Eurovision TV Summit, held by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) in Switzerland, where Saghir is a member of the fiction committee.

The persepective of state censors has changed to drama makers, as dialogue between the censors and writers/directors has left old taboos like sexuality, drugs and politics and many social ills once in the dark, open for fair discussions before being censored. Many agree that the level of openness has been improved significantly and many artists and dramatists find the new department to be refreshingly dynamic and relatively liberal since Saghir took office.

Burnings take place as well to improve the timber stand and produce native wildlife foods, another area of study.Information courtesy the general profile for Pushmataha WMA written by Jack Waymire of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, available at History The WMA dates from 1947, when the State of Oklahoma purchased and established it as a deer preserve. At the time, the state's deer herd had been overhunted and had dropped to less than 500 animals. The state wildlife department nurtured a herd of native deer in the WMA and began exporting it to other parts of Oklahoma. The effort was very successful, and controlled hunts were allowed in its territory by the 1960s. Today the deer herd in the WMA is at a buck-to- deer ratio of 1:2.5. Elk has been reintroduced to the WMA, beginning in 1969. A total of 72 head of elk were captured at the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge and brought to the Pushmataha WMA. By 2000 the herd had prospered-- today it numbers approximately 40 animals--but its genetic diversity had suffered, causing an additional eight head of elk to be imported. Several had radio telemetry collars attached, and have yielded surprising data: young bulls, as example, travel over per week.Steve Burge, \\"Pushmataha Wildlife Management Area\\", Outdoor Oklahoma, May-June 2006, pp. 38-41. Plants Over 450 varieties of native plants have been cataloged in the WMA. Tree species include shortleaf pine, post oak, red oak, black oak, hickory, elm, blackgum, sweetgum, rusty blackhaw (Viburnum rufidulum), flowering dogwood, and hawthorn (Crataegus). There is also an abundance of high bush huckleberry, low bush huckleberry, different types of sumac, coralberry, poison ivy, greenbrier, blackberry and others.

Construction Discoverer was laid down on 10 September 1963 by Aerojet General Shipyards at Jacksonville, Florida. A very serious fire in the area of her meat preparation room and freezers brought her construction to a stop, but it resumed and she was launched on 29 October 1964. Soon after launching, she was moved to the Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Baltimore, Maryland, where she received a single computer system, the first system of its kind, which revolutionizing environmental data collection and processing; via the computer, Discoverers propulsion and other machinery was automated through a centralized engine room control (CERC) system, which measured and recorded the ships course and speed, magnetic field intensity, gravity, surface current, and temperature. She had chemistry, wet and dry oceanographic, meteorological, gravimetric, and photographic laboratories. She also had several precision oceanographic winches and an underwater observation chamber. After successful sea trials - in which she outperformed her sister ship USC&GS; Oceanographer (OSS 01), making ahead, more than she was designed for, and astern - she was delivered to the United States Government on 15 December 1966. At in length, she and her sister Oceanographer ‚Äî which entered service nine months before Discoverer ‚Äî were the largest vessels constructed for research purposes to date. Operational career The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey classified the ship as an \\"ocean survey ship\\" (OSS) and commissioned her as USC&GS; Discoverer (OSS 02),Appendix E: Class I Oceanographic Survey Ship the second Coast and Geodetic Survey ship of the name, on 29 April 1967 with Captain William F. Deane, USC&GS;, in command. For 30 years, she operated in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and from the Arctic to the Antarctic ice shelf. By conservative estimates, she steamed more than during her career, spending between 240 and 270 days of each year at sea. Home-ported in Miami, Florida, Discoverers first assignment was to represent the U.S. Government at the 1967 International and Universal Exposition, or Expo 67, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada; She was on display there from 2 July 1967 to 9 July 1967 Following Expo 67, Discoverer embarked on an intensive study of the Gregg Seamount in the North Atlantic Ocean. The research was the first of its kind to be conducted on a seamount. Discoverers scientific expedition moored and recovered complex oceanographic instruments during the research. Despite encountering numerous malfunctions in the equipment, Discoverers personnel persevered. Later in 1967, after a minor overhaul at Jacksonville, Florida, Discoverer operated on research expeditions in the Gulf of Maine and over the Atlantic Oceans Blake Plateau, investigating the status of manganese nodules on the ocean floor. In January 1968 she embarked on a three-month expedition of to gather information from the depths of the South Atlantic Ocean. She delivered personnel and equipment to the west coast of Africa, then headed back across the Atlantic to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Under the direction of Dr. Robert S. Dietz, she conducted operations in which data was used in the investigation of geological history and theories of continental drift. NOAAS Discoverer (R 102)When the Coast and Geodetic Survey and other United States Government agencies combined to form NOAA on 3 October 1970, Discoverer became part of the NOAA fleet as the research ship NOAAS Discoverer (R 102), the first NOAA ship to bear the name. Her home port later was shifted to Seattle, Washington. In 1985, she received a multi-beam bathymetric mapping sonar, the Inmarsat satellite communications system, and a Global Position Indicator. During her years of service, Discoverers assigned projects varied from cruise to cruise, and it also was common for several different projects to be carried out aboard her simultaneously. The types of studies carried out were varied and included biological, chemical, geological and physical oceanography, meteorological, and seismic research. Discoverers major projects included the Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE), the Radiatively Important Trace Species (RITS), the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the Combined Sensor Project (CSP), the Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System (GOALS) project, and NOAA's Vents project (involving the study of underwater volcanic and venting activity within of the coast of the state of Washington along the southern Juan de Fuca Ridge the Blanco Fracture Zone, and a marginal subduction zone). Ancillary projects, carried out in addition to the main objectives of each cruise, included the Automated Shipboard Aerological Program (ASAP), the Cadet Training Program (for students from the California Maritime Academy, the United States Military Academy, and the United States Naval Academy), marine mammal observations (she averaged 23 sightings of marine mammals per year), use of her Shipboard Environmental Data Acquisition System (SEAS) (averaging 1,700 weather reports per year, she was among the top ten reporting ships in the program in each year from 1989 through 1996 and was the top reporter in 1992, 1993, and 1994), and the Teacher at Sea Program (in which teachers came aboard to observe operations in the Vents program). During 1987, the United States Navy used Discoverer as a replacement for the Military Sealift Command oceanographic survey ship USNS Bowditch (T-AGS-21), installing Bowditchs narrow-beam mapping sonars, doppler sonar, and navigational equipment aboard Discoverer. During her final field season in 1996, Discoverer provided the at-sea platform for two of the largest oceanographic experiments ever conducted‚Äîthe first Aerosol Characterization Experiment and the final Pacific cruise for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment. These expeditions sought to determine the effects of atmospheric pollution on global climate, and to understand the physics of climate change on Earth. Results from these cruises were used to improve global climate, ocean circulation, and greenhouse gas models. NOAA decommissioned Discoverer at Seattle, Washington, on 16 August 1996. She remained inactive in reserve in the NOAA Pacific Fleet at Seattle until she was scrapped at Aliaƒüa, Turkey in 2010. Shark attack On March 23 1994, Discoverer was in the Pacific Ocean east of Easter Island allowing several members of her crew to engage in recreational swimming when a shark attacked the swimmers. After biting Seaman Phil Buffington, inflicting wounds on his legs that would require over 50 stitches to close, the shark attacked Heather Boswell, a 19-year-old student aboard for a six-month stint working in Discoverers galley, pulling her under, shaking her viciously, and biting off her left leg at mid-thigh. Three members of Discoverers crew‚ÄîMatthew N. Ofthus, Jon M. Knox, and Lisa K. Glover‚Äîcame to her rescue in a boat, with two pulling her from the shark's jaws and into the boat while the third beat the shark with a stick. The shark then moved toward a third swimmer who was still partially in the water while climbing onto Discoverer via a rope ladder, but shots fired by crewmen aboard Discoverer apparently drove it away before it could attack. Boswell and Buffington were brought aboard Discoverer, where the ship's registered nurse, Lieutenant Commander Judeth L. Layne of the United States Public Health Service, took charge of treating them. In Seattle, Commander Lawrence F. Simoneaux, NOAA Corps, Lieutenant Commander James Herkelrath, NOAA Corps, and Lieutenant Commander Steve C. Stringfellow, U.S. Public Health Service, set up a command post which provided life-saving medical advice to Layne aboard the ship and arranged logistical support for the evacuation of Buffington and Boswell and the arrival of emergency medical teams. In 1994, for their efforts in rescuing and saving the lives of the two injured swimmers, Layne, Ofthus, Knox, and Glover received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal and Simoneaux, Herkelrath, and Stringfellow received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal.sharkattacksurvivors.com 1994/03/23 Heather Boswell - Off Chile -Houtz, Jolayne, \\"She Felt Pop - Leg Was Gone -- Ingraham Grad Survives South Pacific Shark Attack,\\" Seattle Times, April 2, 1994.NOAA History: Hall of Honor: Commerce Medals Presented For Lifesaving and the Protection of Property 1955-2000 A five-person Air Force Medical Team, led by Major Darr Lafon, MD and Major Larry Martindale, RN flew on a KC-135 from Howard AFB Panama to Easter Island to meet the ship and take care of the shark bite victims. They had to go to the ship in small wooded Easter Island fishing boats and then climb the side of the ship to reach the deck. They spent four hours on the ship and stabilized Heather Boswell, who had lost almost half of her blood in the attack. After multiple transfusions, the team and ship's crew transported Ms Boswell through swells to the fishing boat landing at Easter Island. They flew seven hours back to Panama and Heather Boswell was taken to surgery at Gorgas Army Hospital for initial closure of what remained of her left thigh. After stabilization overnight, with more transfusions for Ms Boswell, both victims were transported back to Seattle in a C-21 Learjet air ambulance.

He was credited with six aerial victories.The Aerodrome website Retrieved 7 January 2018. Early life and service Giorgio Pessi was born on 17 November 1891 in Trieste, when it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He attended the local technical high school before studying engineering in Vienna and architecture in Munich. After World War I began, he fled to Venice in January 1915. When Italy finally entered World War I, Pessi volunteered to serve as a Sottotenente in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the Italian army.Franks et al 1997, pp. 150-151. World War I aerial service Pessi transferred to aviation service. On 10 October 1916, he received his advanced pilot's license, having qualified on Nieuport 10s at Malpensa. He was retained there as an instructor until May 1917. On 3 May 1917, Pessi adopted the nom de guerre of Giuliano Parvis; he wanted to avoid repercussions from the vengeful Austro-Hungarians who considered him traitorous. Pessi then completed gunnery school at San Giusto. On 25 May 1917, he was posted to command of 82a Squadriglia despite his inexperience. On 13 June, he transferred to the 78a Squadriglia. The following month, he transferred to 91a Squadriglia. He would fly a Spad VII fighter emblazoned with his personal marking of a crescent moon. Pessi scored his first aerial victory on 2 August 1917. He staked his eighth claim on 23 November 1917. All of his claims were for victories shared with such aces as Ferruccio Ranza, Giovanni Sabelli, and Francesco Baracca. He served with 91a Squadriglia until 16 March 1918. He was then transferred to the General Commissariat of the air force. It seems probable he upgraded his pilot's training in the next several months, as he arrived in the United States on 20 August 1918 as a Caproni Ca.5 pilot and saw out war's end there. The Caproni he brought to the United States was characterized as the world's largest flying machine.Cleveland Plain Dealer, 15 September 1918, p. 64. Note: Article retrieved from Pessi's page on The Aerodrome website. Post World War I service On 1 February 1919, the evaluation committee of the aviation military intelligence section released its list of victory confirmations for Italian pilots. Giorgio Pessi was credited with six aerial victories.Franks et al 1997, p. 116. One of the denials was for a 6 November 1917 claim where the Austro-Hungarian victim had fallen within his own lines; it was later proven that ace Rudolf Szepessy- Sokoll had died in that crash. Also in 1919, Pessi flew the Caproni Ca.5 heavy bomber under the Brooklyn Bridge. By 1922, Pessi had returned from America and set up a flying school in Anatolia, Turkey. In 1926, he joined Aero Expresso Italiana as its manager of the Brindisi to Istanbul line. On 18 July 1933, Pessi was flying this route, aboard Dornier Wal serial I-AZEE, when he disappeared on an overwater approach to Rhodes.

Today, the river-mouth can nearly be passed on foot at low slack-water, approximately in front of the old harbour master/postmaster's cottage site; and the estuary flanking the three historic homesteads is now characterised by mud-flats at low tide. Akitio Point approximately 1.5 km south of the river mouth, offers local fishermen a protective reef, where paua, crayfish and many types of game fish are easily caught. The Annual Fish Akitio competition draws amateur and professional fisherman from all over the region. 'The Point' was historically home to three historic landing sheds, which held the thousands of bales of wool produced annually by the local sheep stations, and also served to receive fencing wire and other manufactured goods from the passing shipping. A jetty, the remains of which characterise the low tide landscape, would run out into the surf to lighters that would ferry passengers and valuable cargo to and from the freighters. Wool was loaded onto lighters by bullock train. Several ships have been lost in the Akitio bay, including the Peladies (1,020 tonne) in 1899, parts of which can still be found at low tide or scattered around local historic landmarks. The beach remains a popular attraction for surfers and fishermen alike. Public (or party line) telephone connections were available at the main homesteads until as late as 1988/89, however private telephone wires between the riverside homesteads and the back block station quarters had been installed for over a century. Riparian remnants of the old saw mills and the various hydro infrastructure survive to this day. S S White Swan wrecked 29 June 1862 en route from Napier to Wellington Dannevirke, the modern service town for ƒÄkitio, is located 74 km inland from the coast, and is about an hour by car. In living memory, the journey into Dannevirke would take three hours, with coastal families making the trip 'to town' infrequently - staying for several days at a time in the local Hotel located where Dannevirke's KFC is presently situated. Prior to this, Steamer travel to Wellington or Napier was the preferred route to civilisation; although an active local community flourished, and more than five rugby teams were competing for local bragging rights at the peak of labour-force employment. Although travel by sea is no longer a routine necessity for residents, ƒÄkitio's connection to the river and the ocean have continued into the late 20th century through multi-sport events, as well as the sport of ocean racing (see below).  Sport and community  Condor of Bermuda, Brisbane, QLD 2003 * Notable rugby union players of the contemporary era are brothers Brad and Clint Newland, residing during their youth at Akitio Station. In addition to Rugby Union, the Akitio Station Cricket Ground also hosted the English Cricket team, as Mr Armstrong, owner of the Akitio Estate, was a well connected man with a keen interest in the sport.  National teams  Bridget Kight, of Akitio Station (great granddaughter to Mr Armstrong), played internationally for New Zealand's Black Sticks Women's Hockey team (2006‚Äì2008); and sister Charlotte Kight is a current (2009) member of the national Silver Ferns Netball team. The Akitio Challenge, an event first run in 1990 contributes to the local school's (Est. 1893) endowment fund; although more recently provides funding for other community projects also. The school closed in 2014. River rafting on the Akitio River  Water sports  The first several \\"Akitio Challenge\\" events caught the attention of the national news media when participation was promoted through a lottery prize draw for a ten-day luxury cruising vacation on the famous ex-maxi yacht, Condor of Bermuda; to be taken anywhere in the South Pacific.  Sports and social clubs  On a less formal tone, the Annual Akitio [motor] Bike Ride proves to be a popular event with the locals, and a keen chance to share and compare notes on stock performance and pasture management across the region.  Industry  Dipping sheep, ƒÄkitio, 1920s ƒÄkitio is primarily a farming district, specialising in sheep and beef production. Additional local industries are the crayfish; with annual quotas, and storage tanks at the Akitio Station Airfield, earth works, and limited boat repairs/shipwright services. With a permanent population fluctuating somewhere between 30 and 300 persons, the predominant labour force participation statistics are gathered from those working outside the village.  Public facilities  Opposite the site of the last (of three) remaining landing sheds is the Akitio Point Camping Ground, and the Akitio Surf Beach. Occupying the prime location, and incorporating the local surf lifesaving facilities, is the Akitio Boat Club, which has included members such as Condor campaigner, Bob Bell. The Community Centre, fire station, and public ablution facilities are located opposite the local primary school in the centre of the community, about 2.5 km from the Akitio Homesteads, and about 1 km from the end of the 'point'. The sealing of the road to ƒÄkitio from Dannevirke was completed around 1997.

In the first half of the decade, Bassey recorded nine albums, with three making the top ten. In March 1975, Bassey released a compilation that became her highest-charting album to date, The Shirley Bassey Singles Album (#2), and reflects the momentum Bassey had maintained since her 1970 \\"comeback\\". Good, Bad but Beautiful, released in the autumn of 1975, spent seven weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at #13, and earned a silver disc.Shirley Bassey on officialcharts.comBPI (manual search) The album reflects the formula that brought Bassey back to the charts: a combination of contemporary songs combined with her forte of standards, show tunes, and torch songs, featuring arrangements aimed squarely at the adult contemporary, or middle-of-the-road, audience. This was also achieved by modifying her backup orchestra to include electric guitars, a string and brass section with a more contemporary sound, and drumming that is more soft rock-oriented than jazz-oriented, while side two's opener, \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\" displays a smooth jazz style. This was Bassey's seventh album of the 1970s to make the Billboard 200, peaking at #186. It also reached #54 on the US R&B; chart. In the UK the album was awarded a silver disc six weeks after it was released. The original release was in stereo on vinyl and cassette.

He has identified himself using a variety of aliases to the media, although most sources correctly provide his first name as Andrew. As a member of the hacker group Goatse Security, Auernheimer exposed a flaw in AT&T; security that compromised the e-mail addresses of iPad users. In revealing the flaw to the media, the group also exposed personal data from over 100,000 people, which led to a criminal investigation and indictment for identity fraud and conspiracy. Auernheimer was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison, of which he served approximately 13 months before the conviction was vacated by a higher court. In 2016, Auernheimer was responsible for sending thousands of white-supremacist flyers to unsecured web-connected printers at multiple universities and other locations in the U.S. Since his release from prison, he has lived in a variety of locations in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In 2016, he told an interviewer that he was living in Kharkiv. In 2017, it was reported that he was acting as webmaster for the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as \\"a neo-Nazi white supremacist\\" known for \\"extremely violent rhetoric advocating genocide of non-whites\\".  Early hacking and trolling  Auernheimer claimed responsibility for the reclassification of many books on gay issues as pornography on Amazon's services in April 2009. Amazon said that he was not responsible for the incident. Even before the Amazon incident, several media publications profiled him regarding his hacking and trolling activities, including The New York Times, in which he claimed to be a member of a hacker group called \\"the organization,\\" making $10 million annually. He also claimed to be the owner of a Rolls-Royce Phantom. After the Times story on Auernheimer was published, reporters sought him out for commentary on hacking-related stories. Gawker published a story on the Sarah Palin email hacking incident and prominently featured Auernheimer's comments in the title of the story. In a 2008 interview, Auernheimer claimed responsibility for harassing the author and game developer Kathy Sierra in response to her \\"touchy\\" reaction to receiving threatening comments on her blog. This included posting a false account of her career online, including charges that she was a former sex worker, along with her home address and Social Security number. The post instigated further harassment and abuse of Sierra, which led her to withdraw from online activity for several years. Author Bailey Poland calls the \\"highly gendered nature\\" of his attacks on women a form of \\"cybersexism\\". He is a member of the Gay Nigger Association of America, an anti-blogging trolling group who take their name from the 1992 Danish movie Gayniggers from Outer Space. Members of Goatse Security involved with the iPad hack are also members of GNAA. He was also formerly GNAA's president.  AT&T; data breach  Auernheimer is a member of the hacker group known as \\"Goatse Security\\" that exposed a flaw in AT&T; security, which allowed the e-mail addresses of iPad users to be revealed. The flaw was part of a publicly-accessible URL, which allowed the group to collect the e-mails without having to break into AT&T;'s system. Contrary to what it first claimed, the group revealed the security flaw to Gawker Media before AT&T; had been notified, and also exposed the data of 114,000 iPad users, including those of celebrities, the government and the military. The group's actions rekindled public debate on the disclosure of security flaws. Auernheimer maintains that Goatse Security used common industry standard practices and has said that \\"we tried to be the good guys\\". Jennifer Granick of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has also defended the methods used by Goatse Security.  Investigation  The FBI opened an investigation into the incident, which led to a criminal complaint in January 2011 under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.United States District Court ‚Äî District Court of New Jersey, Docket: MAG 11-4022 (CCC). Filed with the court January 13, 2011 Shortly after the investigation was opened, The FBI and local police raided Auernheimer's home in Arkansas. The FBI search was related to its investigation of the AT&T; security breach, but Auernheimer was instead detained on state drug charges. Police allege that, during their execution of the search warrant related to the AT&T; breach, they found cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, and Schedule 2 and 3 pharmaceuticals. He was released on a $3,160 bail pending state trial. After his release on bail, he broke a gag order to protest what he maintained were violations of his civil rights. In particular, he disputed the legality of the search of his house and denial of access to a public defender. He also asked for donations via PayPal, to defray legal costs. In January 2011, all drug- related charges were dropped immediately following Auernheimer's arrest by federal authorities. The U.S. Justice Department announced that he would be charged with one count of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization and one count of fraud. Although his co-defendant, Daniel Spitler, was quickly released on bail, Auernheimer was initially denied bail because of his unemployment and lack of a family member to host him. He was incarcerated in the Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City before being released on $50,000 bail in late February 2011. A federal grand jury in Newark, New Jersey, indicted Auernheimer with one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computers and one count of identity theft in July 2011. In September 2011, he was freed on bail and raising money for his legal defense fund.  Trial  On November 20, 2012, Auernheimer was found guilty of one count of identity fraud and one count of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization. On November 29, 2012, Auernheimer wrote an article in Wired entitled \\"Forget Disclosure ‚Äì Hackers Should Keep Security Holes to Themselves,\\" advocating the disclosure of any zero-day exploit only to individuals who will \\"use it in the interests of social justice.\\" In a January 2013 TechCrunch article, he likened his prosecution to that of Aaron Swartz, writing Auernheimer was found guilty of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization. Before his sentencing hearing, Auernheimer told reporters, \\"I'm going to jail for doing arithmetic\\". He was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $73,000 in restitution. Just prior to his sentencing, he posted an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" thread on Reddit; his comments, such as \\"I hope they give me the maximum, so people will rise up and storm the docks\\" and \\"My regret is being nice enough to give AT&T; a chance to patch before dropping the dataset to Gawker. I won't nearly be as nice next time\\", were cited by the prosecution the next day in court as justification for the sentence. Later in March 2013, civil rights lawyer and George Washington University Law School faculty Orin Kerr joined Auernheimer's legal team, free of charge.  Imprisonment  Auernheimer was serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood Low, a low-security federal prison in Pennsylvania, and was scheduled for release in January 2016. On July 1, 2013, his legal team filed a brief with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that his convictions should be reversed because he had not violated the relevant provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. On April 11, 2014, the Third Circuit issued an opinion vacating Auernheimer's conviction, on the basis that the New Jersey venue was improper, since neither Auernheimer, his co-conspirators, nor AT&T;'s servers were in New Jersey at the time of the data breach. While the judges did not address the substantive question on the legality of the site access, they were skeptical of the original conviction, noting that no circumvention of passwords had occurred and that only publicly accessible information was obtained. He was released from prison on April 11, 2014.  After prison  In October 2014, Auernheimer published an article in The Daily Stormer, identifying himself as a white nationalist and neo-Nazi. Auernheimer lived for a time in Lebanon, Serbia, and Ukraine. In 2016, he told an interviewer that he was living in Kharkiv. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported Auernheimer to have left Ukraine in 2017 for Tiraspol, the capital of Transnistria. In October 2015, Auernheimer published the names of U.S. government employees who were exposed by the Adult FriendFinder and Ashley Madison data breaches. He told CNN, \\"I went straight for government employees because they seem the easiest to shame.\\" He has also been involved in the release of the undercover Planned Parenthood videos, which were under a temporary restraining order. The Washington Post quoted him as saying he did it \\"For the lulz.\\" In a pair of incidents in 2016, Auernheimer sent flyers adorned with racist and anti- Semitic messages to thousands of unsecured printers across the U.S.; flyers bearing swastikas and promoting The Daily Stormer were sent to several universities. He also claimed responsibility for 50,000 flyers sent to printers across the U.S., urging the killing of black and Jewish children and praising Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in a pair of terrorist attacks in Norway in 2011. He claimed to have used a tool to scour the Internet for unsecured printers, finding over a million vulnerable devices. An analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center has described Auernheimer and The Daily Stormers Andrew Anglin as \\"primary innovators\\" in the use of online trolling by right-wing extremists. An email leak by BuzzFeed News in October 2017 revealed that Auernheimer was in contact with Milo Yiannopoulos, who had asked Auernheimer for advice on an article about the alt-right. Yiannopoulos had asked his editor at Breitbart for permission for Auernheimer to appear on his podcast, which was rejected since the editor did not want Breitbart to associate with a \\"legit racist\\". In 2017, Auernheimer was reported to be working as the webmaster for The Daily Stormer. Despite his neo-Nazi affiliations, Auernheimer's mother has stated that he has Jewish relatives on both sides of his family.  References   Further reading  * U.S. v.

In the meantime, the National University of Mexico, the forerunner of UNAM, had been closed in 1833, and the Jurisprudence School was recreated at the College of San Ildefonso. In 1868, the National Preparatory High School was founded in the same building so the Jurisprudence School moved to the ex Convent of La Encarnaci√≥n,(now SEP) and finally to the ex Convent of Santa Catalina de Siena. In 1908, Diaz inaugurated this building as the Escuela Nacional de Jurispudencia (National School of Jurisprudence) . Two years later, Justo Sierra founded the Universidad Nacional de Mexico, who was a graduate of the Jurisprudence School. This school was integrated into the new university along with a number of other professional schools. In 1929, a student movement, of which the Jurisprudence School played a decisive role, succeeded in making the University autonomous, meaning the government would not directly dictate the school‚Äôs curriculum. In 1948, the Jurisprudence building became sole property of the university. In 1954, with the building of new facilities at the Ciudad Universitaria, the School moved south. The building now houses the continuing education and alumni services of the School of Law. The facade of the building is of two levels. The lower level is mostly devoid of any ornamentation but the upper level is based on Palladian architecture, especially in its use of columns with pediments. However, most of the building, inside and out shows an eclectic mixture of architectural styles, because it had been remodeled a number of times during different architectural periods. The interior contains what remains of the old convent‚Äôs patios although they have been greatly altered. The third floor was added at the beginning of the 20th century.

The bottom hemisphere of the pusher, with pieces of the boron shell, tamper, pit, and urchin.Critical Assembly is a sculpture by American artist Jim Sanborn which was displayed at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 2003. It included several elements, some actual and some re-created, which were part of the first project at Los Alamos laboratories to design the first atomic bomb. Sculpture Critical Assembly was displayed at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 2003 during an exhibit entitled \\"Atomic Time: Pure Science and Seduction.\\" The main part of the sculpture is a three-dimensional representation of components of an atomic bomb. The artwork included a disassembled sphere that had been designed to hold the nuclear payload of plutonium and uranium. Sanborn purchased the blank sphere from prior lab employees who had bought them as surplus after the experiments of the project ceased. The sculpture was surrounded by black cables which draped underneath eight tables holding different devices used in the research and implementation of the first atomic bomb. The actual cabinet-sized detection equipment used at Los Alamos were also on display. The sounds from geiger counters could be heard within the room, indicating low levels of radiation coming from four radium wrist watches. On the wall was a blue radium clock dial that was frozen at 5:30 a.m., July 16, 1945, the time of the Trinity blast in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Sanborn himself was born in 1945, in Washington, D.C. History For a number of years preceding the unveiling of Critical Assembly, Sanborn made several trips to Los Alamos, New Mexico. This was the site where the Manhattan Project worked on the world's first atomic bomb. With the assistance of retired scientists, hobbyists, and collectors, he was able to obtain actual lab equipment used in the atomic bomb's research. With this equipment he was able to piece together a \\"life-size re-creation of a hypothetical atomic lab.\\" Critical reception Blake Gopnik from the Washington Post wrote that \\"Sanborn's installation brings us face to face, in the most immediate way imaginable, with what it means to make an atom bomb.

Plot Marco Torino (Luther Adler), king of the gypsies in southern California, is terminally ill. He wants his younger brother to succeed him, but Stephano (Cornel Wilde) is determined to become a dancer instead. After turning a potential employer against him, Marco arranges a marriage for his brother to Annie Caldash (Jane Russell), a sexy gypsy. Stephano angers her father Theodore (Joseph Calleia) and brother Xano (James H. Russell) by resisting Annie's charms and refusing to marry her. Stephano loved the blonde Velma (Helen Westcott). Annie comes up with a scheme. Her father wants her to be paid a rich dowry from Stephano's, then run off before the marriage. Stephano's brother is trying to raise money for a trip to \\"the promised land.\\" She persuades Stephano to stage a phony wedding at which she will faint during the ceremony, whereupon they will split the dowry and teach their greedy relatives a lesson. But it is Stephano whom she ends up fooling, by going through with the marriage. An angry Stephano leaves with Velma, finding work in cheap dance clubs. He begins to miss Annie. He returns to the gypsy camp to find Marco and her together, surprisingly happy. Mistakenly believing they are now together and pulling a swindle, Stephano objects, but Marco explains that he is merely enjoying the last precious days of his life. Stephano agrees to become the new gypsy king, with Annie his queen.

Geography The Baj√≠o dry forests lie in the southwestern portion of the Mexican Plateau. They are bounded on the southeast, south, and southwest by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests, which occupy the folded mountains and volcanoes of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt that form the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau. The Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental bound the ecoregion on the northwest. The numerous mountains of the plateau which rise above the dry forests are occupied by sky islands of pine-oak forest. To the north, the Baj√≠o dry forests transition to the drier, more temperate Central Mexican Matorral. Most of the ecoregion lies within the basin of the Lerma River, and the dry forests extend around Lake Chapala at the eastern end of the region, and into the endorheic basins of Lake Cuitzeo and Lake P√°tzcuaro in the south. The cities of Guadalajara, Morelia, and Quer√©taro lie within the ecoregion. Fauna Native mammals include Mexican wolf (Canus lupus baileyi) and pocketed free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops femorosaccus). Birds include the black-throated magpie-jay (Calocitta colliei), thick-billed kingbird (Tyrannus crassirostris), whiskered screech owl (Otus trichopsus), orange-fronted parakeet (Aratinga caniculanis), dwarf vireo (Vireo nelsoni), and black-polled yellowthroat (Geothlypis speciosa). Development The ecoregion is densely populated, and centuries of human use have reduced the dry forests to small pockets. Dry deciduous forest used to be the dominant vegetation, but thorn scrub and subtropical matorral are now more common, interspersed with agricultural and pasture lands.

Electronic trees (e-trees) usually use L-systems to simulate growth. L-systems are very important in the field of complexity science and A-life. A universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised. The most widely implemented tree-generating algorithms are described in the papers \\"Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees\\", and Real-Time Tree Rendering 'Weeds', generated using an L-system in 3D. The realistic modeling of plant growth is of high value to biology, but also for computer games. Theory + Algorithms A biologist, Aristid Lindenmayer (1925‚Äì1989) worked with yeast and filamentous fungi and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria Anabaena catenula. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures. Central to L-systems, is the notion of rewriting, where the basic idea is to define complex objects by successively replacing parts of a simple object using a set of rewriting rules or productions. The rewriting can be carried out recursively. L-Systems are also closely related to Koch curves. A Fractal plant Environmental interaction A challenge for plant simulations is to consistently integrate environmental factors, such as surrounding plants, obstructions, water and mineral availability, and lighting conditions. Essentially, attempting to build virtual environments with as many parameters as computationally feasible, thereby, not only simulating the growth of the plant, but also the environment it is growing within, and, in fact, whole ecosystems. Changes in resource availability influence plant growth, which in turn results in a change of resource availability. Powerful models and powerful hardware will be necessary to effectively simulate these recursive interactions of recursive structures. Software *OpenAlea: an open-source software environment for plant modeling, which contains L-Py, an open-source python implementation of the Lindenmayer systems *Branching: L-system Tree A Java applet and its source code (open source) of the botanical tree growth simulation using the L-system. *Arbaro- opensource *Treal- opensource * L-arbor *Genesis 3.0 *AmapSim - from Cirad *GreenLab *ONETREE -Accompanying the CDROM is a CO2 meter that plugs into your local serial port.

Throughout this childhood, Johnson intended to pursue an office in the clergy.Sanders, Elizabeth, and Delwiche Engelhardt, \\"Fenton Johnson\\", The Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 229. Johnson grew up in Chicago, and he received his secondary education at various public schools in the city, including Englewood High School and Wendell Phillips High School. Johnson first began his undergraduate education at Northwestern University, which he attended from 1908 to 1909 and he went on to the University of Chicago. Johnson later attended the Columbia University Pulitzer School of Journalism. Following school, Fenton worked as a messenger and in the post office before he began to teach English at the State University of Louisville (SUL), which was a private, black, Baptist-owned institution in Kentucky that would later would Simmons College. He taught there from 1910 to 1911, and returned to Chicago in 1911 to concentrate on his writing career. Literary career In 1913, Johnson published his first volume of poetry, A Little Dreaming. The collection was a self-published work, along with his next two collections, Visions of the Dusk (1915) and Songs of the Soil (1916). But between the release of his first and second collection of poetry, Johnson moved to New York, where he attended the Pulitzer School of Journalism with the financial support of a benefactor. Following the release of his third book of poetry, Johnson moved back to Chicago, where he became one of the founding editors of The Champion in 1916. The Champion was formed in conjunction with Henry Bing Dismond, his cousin, who was also an aspiring poet and popular athlete, one of the few African-American college graduates chosen for officer training with the Army's Eighth Illinois Regiment at Camp Des Moines in 1918. The publication focused on black achievements and was published monthly. Two years after founding The Champion, in 1918, Johnson went on to found The Favorite Magazine, subtitled The World‚Äôs Greatest Monthly, with Dismond.Thomas, Lorenzo, \\"African Modernism and Twentieth Century American Poetry\\", Extraordinary Measures (University of Alabama Press, 2000). The Favorite Magazine published a few of Johnson's poems, and around this time Johnson's short stories were also being published in The Crisis. In addition to the short stories published in The Crisis, Johnson published his own collection of short stories entitled Tales of Darkest America in 1920. In the same year, he published a book of essays entitled For the Highest Good. During this period, from about 1912 to 1925, Johnson established connections in Chicago with Harriet Monroe, and several of his poems were accepted for the poetry magazine Poetry.Patton, Venetria K., and Maureen Honey, Double-take: A Revisionist Harlem Renaissance Anthology (New York: Rutgers University Press, 2011), 268. In addition, Johnson found publication in the anthology selected by poet Alfred Kreymborg in 1915 called Others: A Magazine of the New Verse. One of his most famous poems, \\"Tired\\", was published in 1919 in Others and it was also published in The Book of American Negro Poetry in 1922, among other poems of his. Johnson completed or nearly completed a fourth collection of poems entitled African Nights, but he did not succeed in publishing the collection.Wagner, Jean, Black Poets of the United States (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1973), 179‚Äì180. In addition to his poetry, editing, and essay writing, Johnson also worked as a playwright. By the age of 19, Johnson plays had been \\"produced on the stage of the old Pekin Theatre, Chicago\\". In 1925, his play entitled The Cabaret Girl was performed at the Shadow Theatre in Chicago, the only known title of his performed plays. In the 1930s, Johnson worked for the Federal Writers‚Äô Project, which was part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in Chicago. Directed by Arna Bontemps, part of the Federal Writers‚Äô Project focused on writing about the black experience in Illinois. Bontemps later acted as Johnson's literary executor. Johnson's poetry has a consistent presence in anthologies, including Weldon Johnsons, Book of American Negro Poetry; Harriet Monroe and Alice Corbin's The New Poetry: An Anthology of Twentieth Century Verse in English (1923); and Countee Cullen‚Äôs Caroling Dusk (1927). Criticism and reception The poetry of Fenton Johnson has often been seen by critics to be characterized by great irony and a kind of hopelessness resulting from an embattled African American experience. In his introduction to Fenton Johnson in The Book of American Negro Poetry, James Weldon Johnson writes that in many of Johnson‚Äôs poems, \\"there is nothing left to fight or even hope for.\\" Yet, James Weldon Johnson continues, \\"these poems of despair possess tremendous power and constitute Fenton Johnson‚Äôs best work.\\" Fenton Johnson is often seen as a poet who possesses a particularly fatalistic perspective branching from his experience as an African American, and this type of embittered poetry is what he is most known for. Also in his introduction, Johnson makes a few claims about Johnson's earlier works, finding that his first book of poetry, A Little Dreaming, ‚Äúwas without marked distinction.‚ÄùJohnson, James Weldon, \\"Fenton Johnson\\", The Book of American Negro Poetry (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1931), 1940‚Äì41. James Weldon Johnson also indicates in his introduction to Johnson that it was during the war period that Fenton Johnson adopted free verse, and ‚Äúbroke away from all traditions and ideas of Negro Poetry.‚Äù This newfound \\"formlessness\\", Johnson found, \\"voiced the disillusionment and bitterness of feeling the Negro race was then experiencing.\\" For James Weldon Johnson, then, Fenton Johnson's poetry became associated with despair, and such was how Johnson became framed within the larger The Book of the American Negro Poetry project, and subsequently in other anthologies. This \\"bitter\\" Fenton is particularly encapsulated in the lines of his poem \\"Tired\\": \\"I am tired of work. I am tired of building up somebody else‚Äôs civilization,\\" the poem reads. Johnson has a particular legacy within American Modernist poetry. He is noted to have been a part of writers who would become the makers of a \\"new\\" poetry, which sought to \\"throw over the traditions of American Poetry\\", as James Weldon Johnson would describe it. These \\"new\\" poems appeared in such magazines as Poetry, Others, and later, The Liberator, and they marked a progression from \\"commonplace traditionalism to the most revolutionary naturalism, from the rhymed, carefully scanned line to free verse, from conventionalized Negro dialect to the brawny language of [Carl] Sandberg‚Äôs Chicago Poems.\\" While \\"Tired\\" has been frequently anthologized, Johnson's earlier poems were made in more \\"conventional modes\\", including dialect poetry, as found in his first book, A Little Dreaming. The collection considered a wide range of topics, from a poem on Paul Laurence Dunbar, entitled \\"Dunbar\\", to medieval themes such as in \\"Lancelot‚Äôs Defiance\\".Johnson, Fenton, A Little Dreaming (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Humanities Text Initiative, 1997). Additionally, A Little Dreaming contains a customary Scottish poem, Irish poem, and even Yiddish poem, which points to a whole range of poetic influences during the early part of his poetic career. In Visions of the Dusk and Songs of the Soil, Johnson begins to incorporate \\"Negro spirituals\\", and here the transition into themes more heavily influenced by the African-American experience might be observed. In Songs of the Soil, Johnson writes that \\"The Negro has a history, and it is something more than a peasant.\\" Transitioning from here to the poem \\"Tired\\", we might find the \\"black revolutionary poet\\" that James Weldon Johnson proclaims Fenton Johnson to be and how many perceive him today. In 2016, Johnson was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame. In their induction notes, the Hall of Fame writes: Personal life Johnson was married to Cecilia Rhone. He was a member of the Authors League of America and of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

The refuge includes valuable wetlands for fish and wildlife; especially waterfowl, neotropical migrants, and anadromous fish. The refuge hosts 214 species of birds, including 88 breeding resident species and the largest inland heron rookery in the state; white-tailed deer; one of the largest natural wild turkey populations in North Carolina; and a remnant population of black bear along with numerous small game and a diversity of fish species, including the endangered shortnose sturgeon.

He grew up in the Washington, DC punk scene. Forming Soulside in 1983, their first release under the name Lunch Meat was a split 7‚Äù with Dave Grohl‚Äôs first band, Mission Impossible. After the first 7‚Äù, all their work (three albums and another 7‚Äù) was produced by Ian MacKaye and released on Dischord Records. Soulside toured extensively in the US, Canada, and Mexico, and toured Europe in 1989, including Eastern Europe. Soulside were the only American band to play at one of the illegal punk shows held in East Berlin in the 1980s, shows put on in tolerant Lutheran churches against the wishes of the dictatorship and its security organs such as the Stasi. The shows normally featured banned East German groups, and only rarely did international bands appear, traveling into East Berlin on tourist visas and playing in borrowed gear. After Soulside's split, Sullivan formed 7 League Boots in Boston, a band which blended reggae and rock. After releasing two 7‚Äùs and one album on Constant Change/Cargo Records, they broke up and Sullivan joined Rain Like The Sound Of Trains in DC, before forming Sevens with his brother Mark Sullivan. Both bands released albums produced by Tim Kerr. In his later years, Sullivan became an activist. Mentored by Eric Weinberger, a civil rights activist who had been on the Freedom Rides, he worked with Food Not Bombs (soup kitchens for the homeless) for five years in DC and Boston. He also helped form the DC chapter of the Anarchist Black Cross, a political prisoner support network, giving him close relationships with Ramona Africa from the MOVE Organization and various former Black Panthers and Weather Underground members. Today Bobby still makes music as B.Subtle with Moving Temple and Spontaneous Earth, an ‚Äúacoustic roots‚Äù band in Asheville, North Carolina. He also visits prisons and corresponds regularly with hundreds of inmates as Minister of Education for the Rastafarian UniverSoul Order, a prison ministry.

Founded some time during or before the reign of Henry V, the Inn educated lawyers including Edward Coke and John Selden, although it was never one of the larger Inns. It eventually developed into an institution of disrepute rather than of respect, and by the time it was dissolved in 1863 it was inhabited by only the worst lawyers. History It is believed that the Inns of Chancery evolved in tandem with the Inns of Court. During the 12th and 13th century the law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. During the 13th century two events happened which destroyed this form of legal education - firstly a decree by Henry III of England that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and second a papal bull that prohibited the clergy from teaching the law. As a result the system of legal education fell apart, and the lawyers instead settled immediately outside the City of London as close as possible to Westminster Hall, where Magna Carta provided for a permanent court. This was the small village of Holborn, where they inhabited \\"hostels\\" or \\"inns\\", which later took their name from the landlord of the Inn in question.Watt (1928) P.5 The Inns of Chancery sprung up around the Inns of Court, and took their name and original purpose from the chancery clerks, who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs.Steel (1907) p.586 For several centuries, education at one of the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning.Watt (1928) P.9 Lyon's Inn was located near Wych Street, and started off as a hostel \\"held at the sign of the lyon\\". It was an Inn of Chancery from at least the time of Henry V, although little more precise than that is known; records date from 1413.Steel (1907) p.590 It was finally purchased by the students and professors during the reign of Henry VIII. Lyon's Inn was a small Inn, with eighty students at its peak during the time of Elizabeth I, and educated people as noted as Sir Edward Coke, Sir Lewes Lewkenor Master of the Ceremonies and John Selden.Pearce (1848) p.265 The Inn was, at the best of times, governed by a Treasurer and twelve \\"Ancients\\".Loftie (1895) p.284 Lyon's Inn became a disreputable institution that \\"perished of public contempt long before it came to the hammer and the pick\\".Steel (1907) p.591 By the time it was dissolved it was inhabited only by the lowest lawyers and those struck off the rolls, and when surveyed it was found that it was run by only two Ancients, neither of whom had any idea what their duties were, and the Inn had not dined for over a century.

It is set in three movements and lasts approximately 31 minutes. It is dedicated to the violinist David Oistrakh, who premiered the work on May 3, 1969 in the Large Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. Oistrakh's contribution According to the dedicatee, the sonata was \\"greeted enthusiastically everywhere\\", and indeed, the third movement was the Russian piece on the set list for violinists at the 1970 Tchaikovsky Competition. The autograph resides in the Glinka Museum of Musical Culture in Moscow. Oistrakh collaborated with Shostakovich on several of the composer's major works, purportedly contributing his own insight and suggestions based on the violin's strengths and technical limitations. The work's inscription reads: \\"For the 60th birthday of David Oistrakh\\", who offered an explanation for its composition: > Dmitri had been wanting to write a new, second concerto for me as a present > for my 60th birthday. However, there was an error of one year in his timing. > The concerto was ready for my 59th birthday. Shortly afterwards, Dmitri > seemed to think that, having made a mistake, he ought to correct it. That is > how he came to write the Sonata ... I had not been expecting it, though I > had long been hoping that he would write a violin sonata. The unofficial premiere with Moishe Vainberg as pianist happened on 8 January 1969 in the Russian Union of Composers, the official premieres with Richter as pianist happened at Great Hall Moscow Conservatory on 3 May and at the Small Hall of Leningrad Philharmonic on 23 September. Before the official public premiere in May, Oistrakh and Shostakovich recorded the work informally in the latter's apartment, though the composer's physical handicap (he was diagnosed with polio in 1965) and a relative lack of rehearsal and polish is evident in the performance. Oistrakh later recorded the sonata with Sviatoslav Richter on piano for the official release (USSR Melodiya CM-02355-6 Deep-Blue Stereo Label). Contents Lasting approximately 30 minutes, the sonata is cast in three contrasting movements originally titled Pastorale, Allegro Furioso, and Variations on a Theme, respectively, but simply given Roman numerals in all published editions. Movement I. In soft quarter-note octaves, a tone-row in the piano opens the work, reminiscent of the first bars of Sergei Prokofiev's Violin Sonata No. 1 (Op. 80, 1946). Prokofiev's tempo indication is Andante assai for Op. 80, Shostakovich writes Andante for his Op. 134. Beyond a parallel austerity, Prokofiev's structural and textural influence in the movement is clear, particularly regarding the violin parts. Both composers follow darkly threatening opening material with hushed tracery that returns near the movements' respective finishes, and both end as inconclusively as they begin. Moreover, the composers share a preference for empty or open harmonies (primarily octaves) to those more tonally definite. Of particular note in the Shostakovich work is a relative freedom with meter, allowing for effective diminution and augmentation of the opening tone-row. First stated in the violin at Rehearsal 1, the movement's \\"theme\\" is given similar rhythmic treatment. The movement lasts approximately ten minutes. Movement II. Marked Allegretto (half-note equals 100), the second movement is abrasively energetic and violent. It is in a Sonata form,with the two main themes first heard one after another (the first at rehearsal 28, the second at 31) and then restated almost contiguously until the cadence at rehearsal 34. Long development sections based on the first and then second theme follow and end at rehearsal 45, with the same cadence motive found at 34. A \\"fake\\" recapitulation follows, that is a clear restatement of the first theme, followed by another short development based on the first and them the second theme, and the first theme again. This leads to the real recapitulation at rehearsal 53, which is followed by a coda. The movement harshness comes from a complete indulgence in rhythmic, tonal, and dynamic angularity. Tempo remains constant throughout its six-minute duration, however, so various rhythms diversify and give structure to the movement, characterized overall by a gritty relentlessness. The opening motif, stated in the violin, provides the rhythmic and thematic germ for the movement. Instead of actually adjusting tempo or dynamics, Shostakovich often prefers growing perceived accelerandos and crescendos out of thickening textures and shorter note values, which, particularly at Rehearsal 32, 47, and 51 give the movement the effect of frenzy or perhaps desperation. A grim tone-row (beginning 4 after Rehearsal 56) repeated in shorter and shorter note values during the recapitulation signals a departure from previous material, which is followed by a sarcastic herald call and the movement's abrupt end. Movement III. Originally marked Variations on a Theme, the third movement is a passacaglia with a short introduction. The introduction is heard at the beginning of the movement (rehearsal 58), and the passacaglia starts immediately after, at rehearsal 59, when we hear what will become the bass theme played by the violin in pizzicato. The passacaglia is occasionally interrupted or prolonged but otherwise it never stops repeating until the final, cadenza like, statement by violin solo is reached (rehearsal 75). At the end of the violin solo both instruments rejoin with a restatement of the introduction material by the piano. Starting at rehearsal 77 the material from the second theme of the first movement reappears, and we move toward a clear restatement of the ending of that movement at rehearsal 80, followed by a brief final codetta that includes the ponticello motive that was played multiple times by the violin in the first movement.

It represented an extremely diverse and disparate range of occupations, but its core support came from workers employed in cleaning and security services.  Formation  The union was first established on 6 May 1910 as the Watchmen, Caretakers and Cleaners Union of New South Wales (W.C.C.U.), which was created by the Organising Committee of the New South Wales Labor Council. The task of organisation was a difficult one due to the casualised and isolated nature of the occupations covered. Under the leadership of the first Secretary of the WCCU, Joe Coote, the union adopted a pragmatic approach to increasing union membership by including any workers not already represented by trade unions, such as paintmaking employees. To reflect the growing range of industries represented in 1915 the union changed its name to the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union.  Growth  After steady growth over the first half of the century, including winning paid sick leave, annual leave and a forty-hour week, the union really took off in the 1950s. A new rank-and-file leadership led by Ray Gietzelt took over to create a vibrant, member-driven union. Famous campaigns during the 1950s and 60s included organising workers paid to be Santa Clauses at Christmas and a group of dance instructors who were locked out for four months before winning their jobs back. In the late 1960s the FMWU absorbed the membership of the defunct Australian Leather and Allied Trades Employees' Federation. The strength of the \\"Missos\\" grew over these years, with membership increasing from 25,000 in 1955 to 88,000 by 1975. Ray Gietzelt remained General Secretary from 1955 to 1984.  Amalgamation  In 1992 the FMWU amalgamated with the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees' Union of Australia to form the Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers' Union (LHMU), later renamed United Voice.

The poem gained immediate popularity due to its strong pacifist anti-war message; its mockery of militarism, jingoistic fervour and hysteria; and its placement of blame upon those in power who profit by starting wars to be fought by commoners. The poem was commonly read as expressing the poet's disillusionment with J√≥zef Pilsudski's regime and increasingly militant rhetoric. At the same time it was openly criticised by both left and right-wing journalists. The rightists went as far as to suggest Tuwim be hanged for allegedly promoting desertion among Polish soldiers. Despite criticism, the poem became immediately popular in Poland. In recent years the poem was translated to English by Marcel Weyland. Weyland's translation contains one distorted passage as it is based on a faulty version of the text in common circulation in which a typo led to the substitution of the \\"lords\\" (\\"panami\\", instrumental grammatical case) by \\"maidens\\" (\\"pannami\\"), the result being rather ludicrous and far from intended by the poem's author.

It is located in the temple of Wat Traimit, Bangkok, Thailand. At one point in its history the statue was covered with a layer of stucco and coloured glass to conceal its true value, and it remained in this condition for almost 200 years, ending up as what was then a pagoda of minor significance. During relocation of the statue in 1955, the plaster was chipped off and the gold revealed. History The origins of this statue are uncertain. It is made in the Sukhothai Dynasty style of the 13th-14th centuries, though it could have been made after that time. The head of the statue is egg-shaped, which indicates its origin in the Sukothai period. Given that Sukothai art had Indian influences and metal figures of the Buddha made in India used to be taken to various countries for installation, this suggests the Golden Buddha statue may have been cast in parts in India.Buddhist Art Frontline Magazine (India), pg 71, May 13‚Äì26, 1989 The shape of the statue's head dates it to the Sukothai period Side view of the statue Later, the statue was probably moved from Sukhothai to Ayutthaya, about 1403.History of Golden Buddha Thai Buddhist website Some scholars believe the statue is mentioned in the somewhat controversial Ram Khamhaeng stele. In lines 23-27 of the first stone slab of the stele, \\"a gold Buddha image\\" is mentioned as being located \\"in the middle of Sukhothai City,\\" interpreted as being a reference to the Wat Traimit Golden Buddha. At some point, the statue was completely plastered over to prevent it from being stolen. The statue was covered with a thick layer of stucco, which was painted and inlaid with bits of coloured glass. It is believed that this plastering-over took place before the destruction of Ayutthaya kingdom by Burmese invaders in 1767. The statue remained among the ruins of Ayutthaya without attracting much attention. In 1801, Thai King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I), after establishing Bangkok as a new capital city of the Kingdom, and after commissioning the construction of many temples in Bangkok, ordered that various old Buddha images should be brought to Bangkok from the ruined temples around the country. At the time of King Rama III (1824-1851), the statue, still covered with stucco, was installed as the principal Buddha image in the main temple building of Wat Chotanaram in Bangkok. When Wat Chotanaram, located near Chinatown, fell into disrepair and was closed, the statue was moved to its present location at the nearby Wat Traimit in 1935. At the time, Wat Traimit was a pagoda of minor significance (like hundreds of other Buddhist temples that exist in Bangkok). Since the temple didn't have a building big enough to house the statue, it was kept for 20 years under a simple tin roof. The true identity of this statue had been forgotten for almost 200 years. Discovery of the golden statue In 1954, a new Viharn building was built at the temple to house the statue. It was moved to its new location on 25 May 1955; there are a variety of accounts of what exactly happened next, but it is clear that during the final attempt to lift the statue from its pedestal, the ropes broke and the statue fell hard on the ground. At that moment, some of the plaster coating chipped off, allowing the gold surface underneath to be seen. Work was immediately stopped so that an evaluation could be made. All the plaster was carefully removed and during the process, photos were taken and are now displayed in the Temple for visitors. Pieces of the actual plaster are also on public display. When all the plaster was removed, it was found that the gold statue actually consisted of nine parts that fit smoothly together. A key was also found encased in plaster at its base, which can be used to disassemble the statue, allowing for easier transportation. The golden statue was discovered very close to the commemoration of the twenty-fifth Buddhist Era (2500 years since Gautama Buddha's passing) so the Thai news media was full of reports and many Buddhists regarded the occurrence as miraculous. The new building at the Wat Traimit temple On 14 February 2010, a large new building was inaugurated at the Wat Traimit Temple to house the Gold Buddha. The building also contains the Bangkok Chinatown Heritage Centre and an exhibition on the origin of the Gold Buddha. Characteristics Panoramic view The statue is tall and weighs . (According to another account, the statue measures 3.91 meters from base to top, and 3.10 meters across the lap from knee to knee.) It can be disassembled into nine pieces. The statue was housed in a wat in Ayutthaya until the mid 19th century, and its provenance from Ayutthaya excludes the possibility of it having been made after about 1750. At US$1,400 per troy ounce, the gold in the statue (18 karat) is estimated to be worth 250 million dollars. The body of the statue is 40% pure, the volume from the chin to the forehead is 80% pure, and the hair and the topknot, weighing 45 kg, are 99% pure gold. The Buddha is represented in the traditional pose of Bhumisparsha Mudra (touching the earth with the right hand to witness Shakyamuni Buddha's enlightenment at Bodh Gaya). The original statues of Sukhothai sit on a common pedestal form. The flame that crowns the ushnisha is an innovation of Sukhothai that symbolises the splendour of spiritual energy. The line of the hairdressing forms a \\"V\\" shape in the root of the hairs, underlined by the elegant curve of the eyebrows that join above the aquiline nose, all according to the prescribed rules. The three wrinkles in the neck and the much elongated ear lobes, signs of his former status of prince, also form part of the code, as do the wide shoulders and the chest inflated.

During that time she has competed in two World Netball Championships (1995 and 2007), three Commonwealth Games (1998, 2006 and 2010), and two World Netball Series (2009 and 2010). Waya came to international prominence during the 2007 World Championships in New Zealand, where the Malawian national team (the \\"Queens\\") finished 5th, their highest ever placing. She announced her retirement after the tournament, but returned to international competition the following year. She remains the national team's most high-profile player, and was chosen as the flag bearer for the Malawi team at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. After the 2010 World Series in Liverpool, Waya again announced her retirement from international netball, along with Queens veterans Peace Chawinga-Kalua and Esther Nkhoma. She turned her attention to coaching, and later that year stepped into the role of head coach of the Malawi U-20 netball team. The Netball Association of Malawi (NAM) held negotiations with the three retired players to try to convince them to return to the Queens. On 15 June 2011, the NAM announced that Waya had agreed to return to the national team, along with Queens veterans Esther Nkhoma and Sylvia Mtetemela; Peace Chawinga-Kalua had earlier signed as assistant coach for the team. Media reports in Malawi indicated that the return of the three veterans players had caused major tension in the Queens squad, which led Waya to withdraw early from the squad's training camp. In domestic netball, Waya plays for the MTL Queens. She was married to the late Bullets FC player Fumu Ng'oma, before they later separated; Waya and Ng'oma have two sons.

Post-positivist (or reflectivist) theories of IR attempt to integrate a larger variety of security concerns. Supporters argue that if IR is the study of foreign affairs and relations, it ought to include non-state actors as well as the state. Instead of studying solely high politics of the state, IR ought to study world politics of the everyday world‚Äîwhich involves both high and low politics. Thus, issues such as gender (often in terms of feminism which generally holds salient the subordination of women to men‚Äîthough newer feminisms allow for the reverse too) and ethnicity (such as stateless actors like the Catalans or Palestinians) can be problematized and made into an international security issue‚Äîsupplementing (not replacing) the traditional IR concerns of diplomacy and outright war. The post-positivist approach can be described as incredulity towards metanarratives‚Äîin IR, this would involve rejecting all-encompassing stories that claim to explain the international system. It argues that neither realism nor liberalism could be the full story. A post-positivist approach to IR does not claim to provide universal answers but seeks to ask questions instead. A key difference is that while positivist theories such as realism and liberalism highlight how power is exercised, post-positivist theories focus on how power is experienced resulting in a focus on both different subject matters and agents. Often, post-positivist theories explicitly promote a normative approach to IR, by considering ethics. This is something which has often been ignored under traditional IR as positivist theories make a distinction between positive facts and normative judgement‚Äîwhereas post-postivist argue that discourse is constitutive of reality; in other words, that it is impossible to be truly independent and factual as power-free knowledge cannot exist. Postpositivist theories do not attempt to be scientific or a social science. Instead, they attempt in-depth analysis of cases in order to \\"understand\\" international political phenomena by asking relevant questions to determine in what ways the status-quo promote certain power relations. In 2009, 21 percent of international relations faculty characterized their scholarship as post- positivist.

The album was released on October 9, 2009 via Star Music through digital distribution from the record label's website and later in music stores in the Philippines. After a week, it was pulled out of display shelves due to some technical errors in the album and is expected to be released again in a week before the album's grand launch on November 1, 2009. The album contains ten OPM tracks, all composed by Constantino, with the collaboration of Morning Glory. Raimund Marasigan is the producer of this album. Its carrier single is \\"Lapit\\", a rock-inspirational song.

In an interview she stated that she felt pressured after the hit singles from her first album, \\"Hawak Kamay\\" and \\"Salamat\\", and was apprehensive that her third album would not be as successful after reading negative reviews about her second album Journey. These articles criticized her compositions as \\"just a cycle of tunes\\" and labeled her as an \\"overnight sensation\\". The inspirational advice of Raimund Marasigan, the former drummer of the now defunct band The Eraserheads, who promised to co-produce her third album, restored her spirit and motivation for songwriting and resulted in the ten tracks she wrote for Lapit. Singles and chart performance Lapit was released digitally via Star Records' official website on October 9, 2009 then in physical formats in music stores nationwide. A week later the album was pulled due to technical errors in the album track listing and was re-released before its grand album launch on November 1, 2009. Lapit would receive platinum status. \\"Lapit\\" was the lead single from the album, and Constantino's 14th top ten hit. The lyrics of the song had a resemblance with her first single which was \\"Hawak Kamay\\", an inspirational rock vibe. the music video of the song scored 2.87 million views on YouTube and became her second most viewed video, after \\"Jeepney Love Story\\", until August 2013 when it was surpassed by her single \\"Chinito\\". \\"Lapit\\" was used on the soundtrack for the ABS-CBN TV series Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo and Minsan Lang Kita Iibigin. The song reached the top of I FM Chart in the last week of 2009. In 2010 it won the Awit Awards \\"Texters' Choice Song of the Year\\". \\"Wag Kang Magtatanong\\" is a mid-tempo pop ballad written by Costantino.

It replaced Jovit Baldivino's rendition of \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\" at the number one spot. A music video was released in July 2010. The concept of the music video was an inspired animated one, in which the video shows Ivan Dorschner of Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Clash 2010 as the guy referring in the song, eventually disembarking the Jeepney, and unexpected cameo role by Filipino actor Piolo Pascual as a passenger, which replaced the seat of Dorschner.

This small animal was related to the living tuatara (Sphenodon). Diphydontosaurus may have hunted and eaten insects in the crevices of ancient caves using its claws. It may have grown to a length of . It is a rhynchocephalian more derived than Gephyrosaurus, yet more primitive than Planocephalosaurus, and shares traits with both of them. Description Diphydontosaurus was a small sphenodontian, measuring up to long. It had long, sharp claws to help it catch its prey, and peg-like piercing teeth to help it eat insects. These features are shared with the other primitive rhynchocephalians Gephyrosaurus and Planocephalosaurus. Classification Diphydontosaurus is known from many mostly complete specimens, which means that its classification as a rhynchocephalian is quite certain. In an analysis by Oliver Rahut and colleagues in 2012, it was found that Diphydontosaurus is the second most basal rhynchocephalian, after Gephyrosaurus, and the most primitive sphenodontian, more primitive than Planocephalosaurus. Their analysis is shown below: Paleoecology Diphydontosaurus was a small animal that lived in the Bristol Channel region of England, and Italy. In the Bristol Channel, it lived during the Triassic about 205 mya. The deposits in which it is from are complete enough for its ecosystem to be reconstructed in 2012. In the Late Triassic, the regions that Diphydontosaurus lived in were numerous rocky, small caves, that sat on a limestone bed. It is likely that the caves were eroded by possibly acidic rainwater. Diphydontosaurus is very well known from these deposits, potentially because they drowned after a rainstorm or monsoon. Other animals also found in the caves were long sauropodomorph dinosaurs, smaller sphenodontians like Diphydontosaurus, and other groups of varying sizes between the two. In the cavernous system, the small sphenodontians like Diphydontosaurus probably fed on insects. Diphydontosaurus existed from 231‚Äì200 mya in both England and Italy combined.

Early life and career Born in Equatorial Guinea of Bubi descent, Buale moved to Spain, with his parents and brothers, when he was six years old. He had no intention of becoming an actor until one day, in 1995, when casting director Paco Pino discovered him as they both waited in a subway station in Madrid.

There are only two sources mentioning her, both foreign. The Byzantine historian George Akropolites claimed that after the death of Kaloyan, his sister's son Boril 'married his Scythian aunt'.Greek sources of Bulgarian History, Vol. VII, Page 156, Sofia, From this evidence, it is not sure whether the Tsaritsa was really a Cuman, or she belonged to another tribe that could be described as Scythian. As Veselin Ignatov points out, given the strong relations between the Asen dynasty and the Cumans, her Cuman lineage is the most probable possibility, but not the only one.Ignatov, V., 100 Myths in Bulgarian History, Vol. I, Page 200-201, Sofia (–ò–≥–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–≤, –í. 100 –º–∏—Ç–∞ –≤ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è, —Ç–æ–º –Ü, —Å—Ç—Ä. 200-201, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è) She is known in Bulgarian historiography as Kumankata (, \\"the Cuman [woman]\\"). The second source mentioning the Tsaritsa was made by Canon Alberih about 1241. He repeated a story that he had heard from a Flemish priest who claimed to have visited the Bulgarian capital of Tarnovo. The priest claimed that the Tsaritsa fell in love with the captive Latin Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople and while her husband was away, she sent the Emperor a love letter, promising that she would help him escape if he took her with him and crown her his Empress. When Baldwin rejected her, she complained to Kaloyan, claiming that the captive Emperor had tried to convince her to help him run away, proposing to wed and crown her. Kaloyan believed her and one night, while drunk, had Baldwin killed in his presence.Latin Sources of Bulgarian History, Vol. IV, Page 182, Sofia, Most historians distrust this source, since the reasons for Baldwin's death are well known and verified by Byzantine and Latin sources: he was killed along with other captives, both Byzantine and Latin, because Kaloyan was angered by the Byzantines breaking their contract with him and joining the Crusaders. Another reason for the historians' distrust of the story is the time of its arising: almost forty years after the events took place, and it was spread in France, not Bulgaria. As Ignatov points out, Alberih himself started the story by elaborating that he did not deliver confirmed data, so it might be just a rumour without any proof and still more, backed up by no logic, since the Bulgarian Tsaritsa wore the crown of a prospering state, she was wife to the victor over Byzantines, Latins, Serbians, and Hungarians, while Baldwin I was defeated, imprisoned, humiliated. She had nothing to gain by sharing his crown - she had her own, and right then, it was worth far more than his.Ignatov, V., 100 Myths in Bulgarian History, Vol. I, Page 200-201, Sofia (–ò–≥–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–≤, –í. 100 –º–∏—Ç–∞ –≤ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è, —Ç–æ–º –Ü, —Å—Ç—Ä. 203-204, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è) The birth year of the Tsaritsa and the name that she was given at birth are not known, but it seems likely that with a view to her marriage to Kaloyan, she converted to Christianity and adopted the name Anna.Duichev, I., Bulgarian Middle Ages, Page 319, Sofia (–î—É–π—á–µ–≤, –ò. –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–∏–µ, —Å—Ç—Ä. 319, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è) After Kaloyan's death in 1207, she married his nephew and successor Boril of Bulgaria and that fact, combined with the probable Cuman identity of Kaloyan's supposed murderer, Manastur, encouraged many historians, especially those from the end of 19th and the first half of 20th century, to believe that together with Boril, she was part of a conspiracy that took her husband's life.Zlatarsky, V. History of the Bulgarian State through the Middle Ages, Page 260-261, Sofia (–ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, –í. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–∑ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–µ, —Å—Ç—Ä. 260-261, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è) During the last few decades, the idea of the Empress' part in the conspiracy has been accepted with distrust by many historians. Despite the differences in their beliefs about the reasons for Kaloyan's death - a conspiracy of Byzantines and Latins, death by natural reasons - Ivan Duichev, Ivan Bogilov, Genoveva Tzancova-Petkova, and Veselin Ignatov all support the idea that Boril's marriage with the Dowager Tsaritsa was only a way to legalize his coming to the throne. Whatever the truth, to this day there is no evidence connecting the Tsaritsa with Kaloyan's death. Like her wedding to Kaloyan, the date of her wedding to Boril is unknown. His ascension to the throne was supported by her compatriots, the Cumans, but a few years later there was a great Cuman riot against him. There is no concrete evidence in the sources, but it is likely that Boril repudiated the Tsaritsa and sent her to monastery where she became a nun and assumed the name Anisia.Pavlov, P. About the role of the Cumans in Bulgarian military history (1186-1241): in Military-Historical Symposium, 1990, ‚Ññ6, page 14-23 Sofia (–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤, –ü. –ó–∞ —Ä–æ–ª—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –∫—É–º–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –≤ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è (1186-1241): –≤—ä–≤ –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫, 1990, ‚Ññ6, —Å—Ç—Ä. 14-23, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è) Boril then married a niece of the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders. Nothing is known about the Tsaritsa's later life. The historians have controversial minds about whether she had children by any or both her marriages. Zlatarsky supports the idea that the princess whom Boril gave to the Latin Emperor Henry in marriage was the Tsaritsa's daughter by Kaloyan, and Ignatov believes that she gave a son to Kaloyan. Other historians give her a second daughter, this time by Boril, but nothing is verified for certain this far. The Cuman Tsaritsa of Bulgaria is widely portrayed in historical novels, always in negative light. One of the most beloved writers of historical fiction, through her novel The Wonder Worker of Thessalonica Fani Popova-Mutafova shaped the minds of her readers that the Tsaritsa was a beautiful, lustful and horrible woman who was passionately in love with Baldwin and rejected by him, led Kaloyan to have him killed. Then, she fell in love for Boril and together they planned and carried out Kaloyan's murder by the hand of Manastur and got married only 40 days after the Tsar's funeral. The author gives her character the Cuman name Tzelguba and because of the popularity of her books, there are many people who truly believe that it is the Tsaritsa's real name. In the opera Tsar Kaloyan by Pancho Vladigerov, she is given the Christian name Maria.

Efficiency One of the driving forces behind the construction of this solar farm, and SunEdison's presence in North Carolina altogether, is due to a state law passed in 2007 that requires public utilities such as Duke Energy to obtain a minimum of 12.5% of their power from renewable energy by 2021. The farm has a rating of 21.5 megawatts, which translates to 18 megawatts of peak AC power. Every year that the solar farm is in use, it will offset 32 million pounds of carbon dioxide. SunEdison claims that once complete, the power plant will generate enough energy to power more than 2,600 homes. The site uses GPS software to track the sun.Solar farm in Davidson County feeds power grid with renewable energy February 6, 2011 See also *Solar power *Photovoltaics *Solar power in the United States *List of photovoltaic power stations *Renewable energy commercialization References External links *SunEdison *Duke Energy Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2011 Category:Solar power stations in North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures in Davidson County, North Carolina Category:SunEdison ","title":"Davidson County Solar Farm"},{"id":"24743275","text":"The Consortium for Strategic Communication (or CSC) is a think tank at Arizona State University. History The Consortium for Strategic Communicationhttp://csc.asu.edu/ is an initiative of the Hugh Downs School of Human Communication at Arizona State University. It was formed in 2005 to apply communication research to combating terrorism, promoting national security, and engaging in public diplomacy worldwide. It is composed of interdisciplinary scholars at ASU and partner institutions who are interested in applying knowledge of human communication to issues of countering ideological support for terrorism (CIST), diplomacy and public diplomacy. The CSC offers undergraduate and graduate class, as well as, public lectures. COMOPS was the official journal of the Consortium for Strategic Communication (CSC) that provided nonpartisan commentary on current issues in terrorism/counter-terrorism, public diplomacy, and security from a human communication perspective. Each journal or blog post outlined a current issue of interest and analyzes the issue using principles from rhetoric, persuasion, organizational, political, and intercultural communication. Current research Recently, the Consortium of Strategic Communication received a two- year, renewable grant of $2.5 million from the Office of Naval Research for their project, \\"Identifying Terrorist Narratives and Counter-Narratives: Embedding Story Analysts in Expeditionary Units.\\" In 2008, the Consortium of Strategic Communication received a grant from the U. S. Department of Defense to study the relatively new phenomena of self-organizing systems and armies of the future.

It covers an area of 1020 km¬≤ and extends from both sides of Bregalnica, stretching from west-southwest to east- northeast, with a length of 26 km. The bottom of the valley, i.e. its flat portion, covers an area of 115 km¬≤. The lowest point is in the western part, where the Zletovska River flows into the Bregalnica, at an altitude of 290 meters. Going east, the elevation gradually rises up to 330 meters. The difference between the lowest to the highest elevation of the valley is 40 meters. For certain parts of the valley there are specific names. Thus, the middle part is known as Fields of Koƒçani (or Koƒçansko), the southeast part as Viniƒçko, and the west as Zletovsko. The territory around the major villages is named: Orizarsko, Istibanjsko, Zrnovsko, Obleshevsko and others. The valley has fertile soil and plentiful water, which is ideal for growing cereals, especially rice, in these excellent natural conditions. History Koƒçani valley at dawn According to previous tests, come up to scientific findings that the valley emerged by tectonic influences. Crucial importance for today's form and relief structure had tectonic movements that occurred before the middle of Oligocene. At that period the ground came down between two splitting lines, one from the north (Osogovo) and another from the south (Plaƒçkovica). In late Miocene and early Pliocene, the valley was flooded by freshwater lake, which along with other neighboring lakes created the Middle Vardar's Lake. The depth of this pliocene lake was over 500 meters.Koƒçani and the region from prehistory to the present days, Koƒçani Municipality, December 2003 Climate The annual air temperature at average is 13 ¬∞C, which ranks this valley among warm valleys in the country. It is similar to the air temperature at Veles or Strumica valley. Koƒçani valley is rich in thermal springs, especially in the villages of Istibanja, Dolni Podlog, Banja and Krupi≈°te. In the village of Dolni Podlog, near Koƒçani, two drillings of 35 meters and 460 meters are made, with 300 liter/sec. and temperatures between 70-80 ¬∞C.Kocani Geothermal District Heating System Medicinal properties of the thermal water from Koƒçani valley, according to Risto Chanev, are identical with the water in the baths of Negorci, near Gevgelija.

He also served as editor of Der Querschnitt.Brooker, Peter, et al. (eds.) The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Volume III, Europe 1880-1940 Part I, p. 869 (2013) Wedderkop was an assesor in Cologne. He met Alfred Flechtheim in Paris in 1907, who was an art dealer and later founder of Der Querschnitt. In 1912 he wrote a small exhibition guide for the Sonderbund in Cologne. During World War I, Wedderkop was a civilian commissary of the German civilian administration in Brussels. Among others, he met Gottfried Benn and Thea Sternheim and an affair with Yvonne George is said to him during that time. At the beginning of the 1920s, Wedderkop was a member of the advisory committee of the artists' association Das Junge Rheinland. In the series Junge Kunst published by Verlag Klinkhardt and Biermann Leipzig, he published the volumes on Paul Klee (1920) and Marie Laurencin (1921). From 1921 he was an employee of the Der Querschnitt. As editor, Wedderkop succeeded in making Der Querschnitt into the leading German Zeitgeist magazine of the 1920s: open to the artistic avant-garde, such as Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall or Fernand L√©ger, as well as the heroes of boxing, ironically elitist and artistic photos of male and female nude models. In Ernest Hemingway's posthumous memoirs \\"A Moveable Feast\\", Wedderkop is mentioned as a purchaser of his works and described as awfully nice. The fact that Wedderkop was replaced by a chief editor in 1929 by the Ullstein Verlag, and that he was removed from his editor's post in May 1931, is said to have had something to do with Wedderkop's publicist enthusiasm for Benito Mussolini, according to Wilmont Haacke. Wedderkop visited Mussolini on May 5 and October 10, 1930, and on May 28, 1935. He spent most of the time of Nazi Germany in Italy. Wedderkop's book Deutsche Graphik des Westens was placed on the list of harmful and undesirable literature by the Reichsschrifttumkammer of the Reichskulturkammer in 1938. Wedderkop rejected the \\"old literature\\" by Gerhart Hauptmann and Thomas Mann, and represented the demand for social novel. In 1927, he published a corresponding autobiographically colored novel with Adieu Berlin. The book, which plays in the North Sea resort of Kampen, did not receive much attention. Wedderkop's alternative travel books about Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, and Bonn (1928), Paris (1929), London and Rome (1930) and Oberitalien (1931), published by Piper Verlag in the series Was nicht im ‚ÄûBaedeker‚Äú steht were more successful. After 1938, Wedderkop appeared as the translator of the motivational trainer and author Dale Carnegie, later co-authored in later German editions. Wedderkop also translated Et in Arcadia ego by the Italian writer Emilio Cecchi into German.

Civil Procedure, Seventh Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2008, p. 358 Opinion of the Court The case arose from an alleged wrongful discharge of African-American employees from a railroad company and unequal protection from the union. The court ruled that general allegations of discrimination were sufficient to fulfill the Rule 8 requirement of a \\"short plain statement\\" because liberal discovery guidelines allowed the complaint to gain much more specificity before trial. The kind of pleading allowed by Conley was known as \\"notice pleading.\\"Yeazell, p. 358 Conley Presumptions: 1) Plaintiff's allegations are true 2) Facts are construed as most favorable to the plaintiff 3) Cannot dismiss case unless proven beyond a doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts Subsequent developments In 2007, the United States Supreme Court overruled Conley, creating a new, stricter standard of a pleading's required specificity. Under the standard the Court set forth in Conley, a complaint need only state facts which make it \\"conceivable\\" that it could prove its legal claims‚Äîthat is, that a court could only dismiss a claim if it appeared, beyond a doubt, that the plaintiff would be able to prove \\"no set of facts\\" in support of her claim that would entitle her to relief. In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, the court adopted a more strict, \\"plausibility\\" standard, requiring in this case \\"enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.\\" The Twombly reading was upheld in Ashcroft v.

It caters for those interested in all areas of natural history and conservation in Western Australia through a full program of excursions, meetings, workshops and social events. History The inaugural meeting of the club was held on 3 July 1924 under the direction of three scientists, botanist W.M. Carne, entomologist J. Clark and ornithologist Dominic Serventy. From early in its existence it held annual exhibitions in the Perth Town Hall. It adopted a constitution in 1936, revised when the club became incorporated in 1979. Its journal, The Western Australian Naturalist, was first published in 1947. Most regular meetings were held at the Western Australian Museum until 1962 when the club obtained its own premises in Nedlands, a hall that was replaced in 1997 by a library and office in Northbridge, with monthly meetings held at the University of Western Australia. The club also owns a field station at Yunderup, 100 km south of Perth. Publications Members receive a refereed scientific journal, The Western Australian Naturalist, twice a year, as well as monthly newsletters. The club has also published a series of natural history handbooks.

The offensive employed a single infantry brigade as the main attacking force, supported by a bridging unit and a handful of tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Although the offensive met hardly any resistance in its initial stage, achieving tactical surprise, the operation was poorly planned, supported and executed as a result of limited training and combat experience. The offensive established a short-lived bridgehead, evacuated in panic two days after the operation commenced, under tank and mortar fire from the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) deployed north of Glina. The operation was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate command and control methods applied by the Sisak Operational Group in charge of the offensive. It also lacked clear objectives. Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated the offensive, but found that there was very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led Admiral Davor Domazet-Lo≈°o to conclude that the offensive was not formally authorised. The formal investigation did not specifically charge anyone with the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead. Background In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. This was followed by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991. After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under the control of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Milo≈°eviƒá, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the Federal Presidency. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents, and preventing Croatian police from intervening. In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede. In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde - ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. On 8 October, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, and a month later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV). Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, as the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In western Slavonia, the HV managed to push back the JNA at several points, and secure Papuk Mountain in early December in Operation Otkos 10. Order of battle The principal force committed to the offensive, planned by the HV Sisak Operational Group (OG), was the 102nd Infantry Brigade, attached to the Sisak OG by the Zagreb Operational Zone command, as the single combat unit deployed as a reserve in the Sisak OG area of responsibility (AOR). Besides the 102nd Brigade, commanded by Captain Franc Ferenƒçak, the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed an armoured-mechanised unit, attached directly to the Zagreb Operational Zone, into the Sisak OG AOR. The unit consisted of eight tanks and two armoured personnel carriers. The Sisak OG assigned the 10th Brigade of the Croatian TO to support the right flank of the 102nd Infantry Brigade. Protection of the left flank was assigned to the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade, supported by the 2nd Battalion of the 144th Infantry Brigade. To reinforce the 102nd Infantry Bridade and the independent armoured-mechanised unit, ten soldiers from the Glina Battalion were attached to each battalion of the 10th and 102nd brigades; two soldiers were assigned to serve as guides for each tank. In addition, the Glina Battalion was tasked with reconnaissance, harassment of JNA's rear and securing captured infrastructure. Sisak special police were assigned to support the Glina Battalion, and indirectly the main offensive force. The 36th Engineering-Pontoon Battalion was tasked with the Kupa River crossing by the 102nd Infantry Brigade. The Sisak OG was commanded by Major General Bo≈æo Budimir. The Croatian Serb TO and JNA defences immediately west of the city of Sisak and north of Glina were positioned along the right (southern) bank of the Kupa River, largely consisting of the JNA 592nd and the 622nd Mechanised Brigades. On the opposite bank, the HV 100th Infantry Brigade held positions west of Sisak, flanked by the 145th Infantry Brigade to its right, and the 10th brigade of the Croatian TO further to the west. The planned main axis of the Operation Whirlwind extended across the 592nd Mechanised Brigade AOR, commanded by Colonel Bo≈°ko D≈æombiƒá. Timeline A map of Operation Whirlwind The HV 102nd Infantry Brigade arrived at the Sisak OG AOR on 11 December 1992, and was ordered to undertake the offensive on the same evening, at about 20:00, leaving no time for any preparation or reconnaissance. A reconnaissance-sabotage detachment of the HV Glina Battalion and the special police force were ferried across the Kupa River on the night of 11/12 December, capturing the village of Stankovac and preparing to support the 102nd Infantry Brigade at the river crossing. The 36th Engineering-Pontoon Battalion completed a crossing point in the village of ≈†i≈°inec by 4:00 and the lead elements of the 102nd Infantry Brigade crossed the Kupa River a half-hour later. The river crossing was unopposed until 08:00, when the defending force launched a mortar attack against the crossing point. Nonetheless, the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade cleared the river by 09:00 that morning and reached Stankovac. After spending three hours crossing the Kupa River, by 13:00 the independent armoured-mechanised unit was headed for Mala Solina, to the south. However, the unit was intercepted by JNA armour and forced to turn back to Stankovac. To further complicate the situation for the HV, the 10th Brigade did not even start to move south, while the 2nd Battalion of the 102nd Independent Brigade would not cross Kupa before its commander joined the unit at 16:00. The 3rd Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade reached the village of Vrateƒçko on the right (southern) bank of the Kupa River, but was unable to join the force south of Kupa. A bridge separating the battalion from the rest of the brigade remained out of HV's control. By the evening, the 2nd Battalion was ordered to separate from the main axis of the offensive and protect the right flank of the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Brigade--performing the task originally assigned to the 10th Brigade of the Croatian TO. At the same time, the 10th Brigade commanding officer was relieved of duty for failure to advance. Regardless, the unit remained inactive. The HV units that managed to cross the river on 12 December surprised the JNA and reported inflicting considerable casualties. On the night of 12/13 December, the air temperature dropped to , and HV troops sought shelter in Stankovac until the morning--shrinking the bridgehead held by the 102nd Infantry Brigade. In addition, the 36th Engineering-Platoon Battalion removed engineering equipment from the Kupa crossing, leaving behind only four to six boats. The command post of the 102nd Infantry Brigade remained in Farka≈°iƒá, detached from the main offensive force in Stankovac. On 13 December, at approximately 07:00, the independent HV armoured-mechanised unit advanced northwest along the Kupa, towards Graƒçanica. During the advance, one of the tanks was captured and its crew killed after the capture. Nearly simultaneously, the JNA commenced a tank and mortar attack against Stankovac and the river crossing at ≈†i≈°inec. The HV armoured-mechanised unit and the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade panicked, believing the crossing point was lost, and started to fall back to ≈†i≈°inec in disarray, sustaining considerable casualties. Since there was no way to transport the remaining HV armour across the Kupa River, the tanks were destroyed by one of the force's own tanks. That tank was then destroyed with explosives to prevent its capture. As there were too few boats at the river crossing to allow a quick retreat, some of the troops swam across the river, causing several to drown in very cold water. The command post of the brigade fell back to Galdovo, while the troops started to retreat to Zagreb. The entire brigade was back in Zagreb by 15 December. Aftermath While the JNA's casualties are not known, the HV sustained a loss of 18 killed and 18 wounded, as well as a loss of eight tanks, two armoured personnel carriers and seven boats. The 2,011-strong 102nd Infantry Brigade alone suffered 13 dead. Their names were later inscribed on a memorial plaque in ≈†i≈°inec, at the Kupa River crossing point. In the aftermath of the offensive, there were speculations in Croatia that the casualties were much higher, possibly as many as 60 killed and 200 wounded. A Croatian Serb paramilitary unit, \\"≈†iltovi\\", based in Glina, is suspected of killing HV troops taken as prisoners of war during the retreat. In addition, Croatian Serb forces killed 21 civilians in the Jo≈°evica massacre as retribution for the HV offensive. The killing was investigated by SAO Krajina authorities, which concluded that the killings were in revenge for the deaths of 21 Serb paramilitaries in the village of Graƒçenica in Operation Whirlwind. In 2010, Croatian authorities charged six individuals with war crimes committed in the village of Jo≈°evica. The failed offensive was investigated by the HV in 1991 and researched later by retired HV Brigadier Vlado Hodalj. He concluded that the offensive failed because of overall poor planning and preparation, specifically citing the lack of reconnaissance and reserves. Furthermore, Hodalj cited inadequate leadership by the Sisak OG as a cause of the failure, pointing to inaction in respect of the 10th Brigade's failure to advance and improper employment of the 2nd Guards Brigade in an auxiliary role, protecting the flank of an inexperienced brigade that was committed to the offensive with little, if any, training. Finally, the offensive itself had no clear goal. Croatian Admiral Davor Domazet-Lo≈°o also criticised the offensive as an unnecessary, purely tactical and politically counterproductive move, likely unauthorised by appropriate authorities. Hodalj praised the Sisak OG command for managing to keep the operation a secret until it was launched, making sure it would surprise the JNA. The secrecy was reflected in the apparent last- minute rerouting of the 102nd Infantry Brigade to the offensive, although the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed it to Sunja, to the east of Sisak. Still, the Sisak OG failed to prepare detailed river crossing plans, or even issue maps and written brigade-level commands for the crossings--relying on oral commands instead. Likewise, the troops were not equipped to endure the cold weather in the open, limiting their effectiveness. Hodalj concluded that the offensive exceeded needs and capabilities of the Sisak OG. Even though the 1991 HV investigation concluded that the offensive was prepared for ten days and was approved by Zagreb Operational Zone command, there are no documents pertaining to the preparations other than those issued by the Sisak OG itself. Regardless of the poor preparation of the offensive, the 102nd Infantry Brigade was subject to public criticism in Croatia for fleeing the battlefield in the aftermath of Operation Whirlwind.

Jump for Joy is Adderley's reinterpretation, circa 1958, of a Duke Ellington stage musical from 1941.... Hearing Adderley's often thrilling, always well- constructed alto sax improvisations over tunes like the standard 'I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good' is reason enough for the album to exist, and although Russo's orchestral flourishes occasionally threaten to overwhelm the soloist (especially on the closing 'The Tune of the Hickory Stick'), they're always at the very least charming examples of '50s jazz-pop arrangements\\".Mason, S. [ Allmusic Review], accessed 19 October 2009. The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the album a three-star rating, saying: \\"Jump for Joy puts Cannonball with Richard Hayman's strings for the first half, and it's not the happiest of combinations, though the sheer alacrity of Adderrley's sound energises some otherwise tepid writing.

He opened his studio Dror in 2002 in New York, and has since amassed an award-winning portfolio of product, interior, installation and architectural design. His major works include a structural support system named Quadror, the masterplan of Galataport in Istanbul, Turkey, and the Cappellini Peacock chair. His studio partners with top tier companies, developers, and institutions including but not limited to Alessi, Bentley, Tumi, Levi's, Boffi, Louis Vuitton, and Target . Having gained a strong international foothold, Dror's work is in the permanent collections of major museums in North America, Europe and the Middle East, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. With main headquarters located in Chelsea, New York, the Dror studios work on projects of every scale that aim to rethink design typologies, promote well-being, and foster the connection between people and nature. Projects are characterised by their innovation, boundless imagination, and experimental spirit. The firm's first architectural project consisted of a high-end residential masterplan for Nurai, a private island off the coast of Abu Dhabi. Out of profound admiration for the Persian Gulf's carpet making, Dror designed 24 beachfront villas covered by a carpet of grass. The 49 properties sold in 72 hours before construction had even begun, and the project was dubbed the ‚ÄúMost Luxurious in the World‚Äù by Newsweek Magazine.  Early life  During his academic career, he grew interested in and inspired by the work of Isamo Noguchi, Achille Castiglioni, and Buckminster Fuller. At age 25, he moved to New York City and opened his studio. His first commercial product, The Vase of Phases, is a vase that appears to be shattered and then put back together, symbolizing the processes and experiences humans go through which shape them into who they are. Manufactured by Rosenthal, the product went on to become the recipient of the 2006 IF product design award.  Key works   Vase of Phases (2005)  * Brought to life by the German porcelain company Rosenthal, Dror's design for the Vase of Phases now belongs to the permanent collections of the State Museum for Applied Arts in Munich, Eretz Israel Museum in Tel Aviv, and Museum of Arts and Design in New York. Inspired by the fear of breaking beautiful things, the design resembles a snapshot of a vase as it is exploding. It comes in both black and white, and quickly became one of the company's best selling products.  Peacock Chair (2009)  * Dror is perhaps best known for designing the Peacock Chair, which famously appeared as Rihanna‚Äôs throne in her music video for \\"S&M;\\". Manufactured by Italian furniture brand Cappellini, the chair consists of three layers of felt folded and held in place with a simple metal frame. The Peacock Chair is made without using modern upholstery techniques or glues.  Nurai (2008)  * The masterplan for Nurai, a tropical island off of the coast of Abu Dhabi, features twelve water villas that complement twenty-four land villas. Aware that the targeted clientele owned multiple homes across the globe, Dror attempted to distinguish his designs by creating a heightened feeling of privacy and maintaining access to community. This was achieved by covering the roofs of the complex with a singular vegetative carpet, sheltering inhabitants from their neighbors while also providing open space for socialization. Once fully completed in 2014, the project sold for a total of $1 billion.  Havvada (2012)  * Using the dirt excavated to construct a canal between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara in Turkey, Dror envisioned building a man- made island off the coast of Istanbul. Named Havaada, the island conceptualized consists of six dome hills that surround an inverted mound in the center. Dror explores a 3D urban grid, designing a series of domes wrapped by residences. Each dome houses a different activity center, with cable cars and walkways connecting them to each other as well as to the downtown center. The micro-environment aims to address the social, environmental, and economic issues affecting today's contemporary cities.  TUMI (2012)  * In 2012 Dror joined with Tumi to create a collection of travel bags. He designed the world's first expandable carry-on suitcase, which had the ability to double in size, as well as a backpack, travel satchel, dopp kit, and more. The fusion of technology and luxury details proved very successful, and Dror later collaborated with Tumi to redesign their retail experience. The design approach for the flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York City has now been implemented in over 50 locations around the world.  QuaDror (2006)  * Through experimentation in the workshop, Dror discovered a structural support system which he later named QuaDror. This patented proprietary structural technology serves as a foundation for a range of the studio's projects. The interlocking L-shaped pieces are stackable and load-bearing, allowing them to adapt to all sorts of conditions, scales and configurations.  Swarovski (2007)  * One of the many applications of QuaDror was in a partnership with Swarovski for a floor chandelier. The piece consists of the QuaDror framing with a grid of signature swarovski crystal strands. The chandelier can be propped open up to form two parabolas of crystals, and is purposefully designed to stand on the floor rather than hang from the ceiling.  Materialise (2009)  * By collaborating with the Belgian 3D printing innovator, Materialise, Dror was able to manufacture and test the QuaDror structure on another level. The result of the collaboration was a kinetic cube named Volume.MGX, a piece created by 1,200 tiny laser cut QuaDror structures. Once printed, the cube can be expanded to fit a source of light at the center, resulting in a lamp that emits a unique glow.  Brancott Estate (2017)  * Dror designed a sculptural installation for the New Zealand-based Brancott Estate, the pioneer of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc since 1975. The installation adopts the QuaDror modular system to form a geometric shape that reflects the shape of the grapevines. The design is intended to mirror the uniformity of the beautiful Marlborough landscape. To give visitors a piece of the sculpture to take home, Dror also designed a scaled-down version of the installation that could serve as a wine rack for up to six bottles of wine.  Galataport Masterplan (2014)  * The team of Dror and Gensler won a competition to redesign Galataport, a site on the Bosphorus in the heart of Istanbul. The idea is to create the world's first underground cruise-ship terminal. With the help of Miami firm BEA, the team was able to invent a 3.5 meter hydraulic boardwalk and gangway system that hatches open when a ship docks. Above ground, Dror and Gensler created a multi-layered pedestrian neighborhood with a range of mixed-use buildings. This new public space seeks to help connect the city and sea, as well as provide space for bustling activity and newfound waterfront views.  Tron Chair (2010)  * The Tron Chair, designed by Dror and manufactured by Cappellini, is inspired by the Tron: Legacy film. It reflects on the angular terrain of the Disney film, playing with the collision of shapes in the digital world.

Originally called Condor but renamed Heath's Condor for the 1977‚Äì78 Whitbread Round the World Race after Bell's association with Heath's Insurance Co (London). There is no link with former British prime minister Edward Heath of Morning Cloud yachting fame. Condor was then later renamed Condor of Bermuda, as government policy in the UK during the 1970s effectively exiled the financing of such a campaign by making the funding and domiciling of such an endeavour from the home countries a practical impossibility. Condor of Bermuda is a polished mahogany race boat; and is often confused with its successor, Condor (sometimes referred to as Condor II , which was of Kevlar and composite construction, and slightly larger, due to IOR rule changes.

The band is composed of David Ziegler-Voll as the band's lead singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter, guitarist Patrick McMahon, bassist Jacob Chattman, and drummer Marisa Chattman. Lagoon disbanded in 2011. Background In 1996, guitarist and singer-songwriter David Ziegler-Voll was playing in the short- lived Albuquerque, New Mexico band called Outro 60 Seconds, with bassist and high-school friend Michael Hester. A year later, the two moved to Tucson, Arizona, and founded another short-lived band known as The Darlingtons with drummer Mathieu Lopez. After the demise of the Darlingtons, Ziegler-Voll and Lopez founded a band called SassyStarX with bassist Woodie Polk, who was just 18 years old at the time. Formed in 2000, SassyStarX featured some of the same sonic elements which would come comprise the signature Lagoon sound, but with a bit edgier, more punk twist. In 2001, however, Lopex had a falling out with the rest of the band. He decided to quit, going on to play guitar in what would eventually become The Year of Acceleration. He was replaced by Erik Thybony. By the spring of 2003, the band had decided to add a second guitar player. They recruited Patrick McMahon, who had lived next door to David for over a year yet had never met David until the day Ziegler-Voll was moving out. With the addition of McMahon, the band planned to change their name to Subspark, however in June, Thybony decided to leave the band. After a brief hiatus, David, Patrick, and Woodie decided to regroup and form a new band, and decided that Marisa Chattman would take up the role of the band's drummer. Ziegler-Voll decided that it was time to scrap all of the band's previous materials and start anew. They settled on the name Lagoon and began practicing in David's design studio/art gallery across the street from Hotel Congress. During the next two years, Lagoon would play extensively around the Tucson area, gaining respect in the city's burgeoning local indie rock scene, and the admiration of the local press. During this time they would perform live on KXCI radio several times and have a song appear on the Locals Only CD Compilation, Volume III, which was released in 2004. Lagoon released their debut full-length album, Graduation, in 2005. The album was recorded at Loveland Studios by Nathan Sabatino, and mastered at Sonorous Sound in Phoenix by Dave Shirk. Instead of seeking the assistance of a record label, the band self-released the album, selling CD's at shows and utilizing then-new online distribution methods such as iTunes and CD Baby. In support of Graduation, Lagoon toured around the Southwest, including stops in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, California, and Arizona. In 2007, the band released its second album, entitled Dose. This time, Lagoon chose to record the album themselves after weighing the pros and cons. However, they did have some direction from Stuart Kupers of the band Machines of Loving Grace. The album's title was a play on the Spanish word dos, meaning two, and the narcotic references hinted at in the album's resealable foil packaging and the songs themselves. Singer David Ziegler-Voll described the album's thematic direction as, \\"It's all of the things we have to do to medicate (or self-medicate) to get through the day and deal with the problems we face.\\" In the Fall of 2007, the band decided to relocate to Providence, Rhode Island to enable them to play in more urban areas within a much shorter driving distance and expand the band's horizons beyond the Southwest. After performing in the local Providence scene for about a year, the band decided it would be better served moving to the Boston area, and thus in the summer of 2008 the band decided to do so. Additionally during this time period, long-time bassist Woodie Polk decided leave the band, in order to return to school at the University of Arizona back in Tucson. The band soon after acquired the skills of new bassist Jacob Chattman, brother of drummer Marisa Chattman, and formerly of fellow Tucson act My Former Wings. Currently, the band is working on their upcoming third album scheduled for release in 2010. The band has again elected to conduct most of the recording process on their own. Lagoon encourages its fans to follow them via many of the major social networking sites, and also allows fans to subscribe to a period blog which ranges in scope from news and updates about the band, to humorous anecdotes and abstract observations courtesy of band \\"mouth\\" Jacob. Additionally, the band has established a nontraditional distribution method for their releases, and are in the process of starting their own label known as Tornado '72 Records. Lagoon allows fans to download the music in digital format for free from their website. The band generates revenue through nontraditional channels such as allowing fans to become \\"patrons\\" of the group through donations. Having a background in visual communications, David has developed an integral component of the band's image by creating posters, illustrations and the band's website. The band also utilizes the talents of other designers such as Jessica Frease the creator of the Lagoon mascot \\"Seafoam\\". After a more than two-year absence, Lagoon returned to perform in Tucson for the first time on October 24, 2009. Style Described by one reviewer as \\"sentimental pop,\\" Lagoon's sound ranges from sad and atmosphere to sparkling and melodic. Their style has been compared to numerous noteworthy influences, including early R.E.M, but also draws from the realm of modern indie rock. Lagoon makes extensive use of effects pedals to create guitar textures, including the EBow in several songs, and uses tube amps almost exclusively. Unlike many of their contemporaries, Lagoon does not perform with a laptop or utilize backing tracks on stage.

History Colonial era Early picture of Victoria Barracks in 1868, taken from Roma Street Following Queensland's separation from New South Wales in 1859, the new government was faced with a problem: there was no permanent military presence in the new colony. The decision was made to establish a permanent presence at a site known as 'Green Hills'. Construction of the new 'Green Hills Barracks' began in 1864. The original barracks consisted of a guard room, a barracks block and officer's quarters. The first unit to occupy the new barracks was a detachment from the 12th (East Suffolk) Regiment of Foot. Although the barracks expanded in subsequent years to include a military hospital and a magazine, the garrison dwindled due largely to the effects of the Maori Wars. The next, and final British detachment came from the 50th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Foot. Following the departure of British troops, the barracks was occupied by the police from 1870 until 1885. Australia's growing colonial forces led to the barracks being re-occupied by the military. It was at this time that the name 'Victoria Barracks' was adopted, in honour of the reigning sovereign. It served as the headquarters of the Queensland Defence Force. Post- Federation Military police at Victoria Barracks, Brisbane, 1916 Following federation in 1901, control of the site went to the newly formed Australian Army. With the build-up in forces preceding and during the First World War, the barracks experienced its second great period of expansion. It served as a headquarters during the Second World War, although its importance waned with the construction of Enoggera Barracks. Present day Today the site is still occupied by the Army. The Victoria Barracks Museum is located on the site, and contains a large collection of replica and service medals covering the Army's involvement in the Boer War, World War I and World War II.

The company produced licensed toys from Warner Bros., Disney, and Jim Henson's Muppets. Its principal subsidiaries included Dakin Inc. and International Tropic-Cal Inc. The Applause brand survives as part of Kid Brands. History The company was founded as The Wallace Berrie Company in 1966 by Wallace Berrie. In 1979 the company obtained worldwide rights to The Smurfs and released figurines in 1979 at $1.50 each. The figurines became one of the best-selling toys of 1982. That year, the company acquired the Applause division from Knickerbocker Toys, which came with the licenses to Disney, Sesame Street, and Raggedy Ann and Andy. In 1986, the company changed its name to Applause Inc. and released California Raisins merchandise. It would also produce various Batman merchandise, focusing largely on small figures and dolls, from the late 1980s into the early 1990s. In 1992, Applause released the Magic Trolls Babies toy line. Dakin merger From 1991 to 1995, the company built a strong retail business by focusing on its classic entertainment licensed brands with in-store merchandising displays as a platform for entertainment event properties, e.g. The Lion King, The Flintstones, Pocahontas, The Little Mermaid, Star Trek, and Star Wars. Also during this period, one of the most significant events was the company's acquisition of the licensed rights to the very popular Looney Tunes characters. In late 1995 the company acquired Woodland Hills, California company, Dakin Inc., the most widely recognized brand name in stuffed animals. Dakin was founded in 1955 by Richard Dakin as an import business. This acquisition strengthened Applause's generic stuffed animal business to balance out its already strong entertainment license portfolio. Applause created a Strategic Alliances Group to oversee products for food-related and premium- based programs such as from Taco Bell, KFC, Kellogg's, General Mills, and Pillsbury. In 1998 the company produced fast food toys for A Bug's Life, Mulan, Pok√©mon (KFC) and Godzilla. Bankruptcy and acquisition In 2004 CEO Bob Solomon took his own life once it became apparent the company was not going to survive. The company filed for bankruptcy shortly after his death. The Applause name was acquired by Russ Berrie in a bankruptcy auction.

The prize was named after Kalai in recognition of his contributions to bridging these two fields. Selected Contributions In cooperative game theory, the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution reopened the study of bargaining by showing that the long unchallenged Nash solution is not unique. He later axiomatized the Egalitarian solution to bargaining problems and, with Dov Samet, formulated its extension to general (NTU) cooperative games, unifying it with the Shapley (TU) Value. In non cooperative game theory, the Kalai and Lehrer model of rational learning showed that rational players with truth-compatible beliefs eventually learn to play Nash equilibria of repeated games. In particular, in Bayesian equilibria of repeated games all relevant private information eventually becomes common knowledge. Kalai's work on large games showed that the equilibria of Bayesian games with many players are structurally robust, thus large games escape major pitfalls in game-theoretic modeling. Kalai is also known for seminal collaborative research on flow games and totally balanced games; strategic complexity and its implications in economics and political systems; arbitration, strategic delegation and commitments; extensions of Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem in social choice; competitive service speed in queues; and on rational strategic polarization in group decision making.

Because of its light weight, vibration damping, and sustainability, bamboo is slowly starting to be used in bicycle frame production, though the industry is still dominated by aluminium frames.  History  Bamboo bikes were first patented in England by the Bamboo Cycle Company and introduced to the general public on 26 April 1894. A US patent was applied for in 1895, by August Oberg and Andrew Gustafson, and granted in 1896. However, with the development of tougher industrial metals, such as steel and aluminium, large-scale usage of bamboo to build bicycles never happened. Though bicycles are a staple of human transportation, in both rural and urbanised areas, bamboo bicycles are not widely used. However, with the advent of the Green movement, bamboo is being used again, primarily for high- end racing and touring bicycles. Bamboo bikes are entering the market as low cost alternatives to relatively expensive and unsustainable aluminium and metal bikes.  Technical aspects  Several aspects of bamboo are extremely valuable to both cyclists and bicycle manufacturers: high strength-to-weight ratio, vibration control, and sustainable growth. Because of bamboo's tendency to grow straight, it does not exhibit \\"knots\\" and \\"turns\\" in its wood, unlike other types of wood. As a result, bamboo has a higher specific tensile strength than steel, as well as a higher specific compressive strength than concrete. This tendency also allows for excellent vibration control, which, in turn, provides for a smoother ride and increased stability on rough terrain. The bamboo poles can be joined in a number of different ways. The earliest models used metal joints which were then tightened around the bamboo. Another approach is to wrap the joints with resin saturated fibers to make composite lugs around the bamboo frame members. For modernised track bicycles, carbon fibre is used for the remainder of the parts that are not made of bamboo due to its light weight - for example, the fork, because it is difficult to find a perfect piece of bamboo that fits into the fork socket of the frame.  Projects  Bamboo could be used as an alternative to traditional steel and aluminium bikes in many rural areas because of its potential sustainability. A \\"Bamboo Bike Project\\", started by engineers at Columbia University, created a small number of bamboo bikes from 2007 to 2011. This was done with the intention of providing low cost bikes for Africans in rural areas, and stimulating local bike building industries, without major assistance from outside sources. The United Nations and the United States have invested in the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative, which was created by Bernice Dapaah. This business markets itself as addressing climate change, poverty, youth unemployment, rural-urban migration and by creating jobs for women. As of 2015 over 1000 of these bikes had been sold in Ghana, Europe and the United States. As of 2016 few bicycles have also been made in Bangladesh. Bamboo Bicycle Tours bikes In 2014 a Dutch company started organizing tours in Vietnam held on locally build bamboo bicycles. In 2015 the company expanded to Thailand and in 2018 also to Myanmar. The bikes the tourists ride are all created in Thailand by the Dutch entrepreneur Axel Lukassen.  Cost  The most expensive bamboo bikes cost thousands of dollars. Conversely, the bikes sold in Ghana for the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative have been said to cost about $120, which is significantly more expensive than conventional bicycles. The cheapest for adults retail at $350 as of 2018, thus the bikes are retailed specifically for the export market. This variation in cost has two main reasons: the relative wealth of the consumers to whom the bikes are marketed, and the difference in production quality. In the United States, all parts incorporated into the bike are high-end, similar to the parts used in expensive carbon fibre bikes. Modern machines are used to laminate, waterproof, and join the individual bamboo pieces. The Ghanaian bikes, on the other hand, source most parts (e.g. bamboo, chains, bolts, etc.) from low-cost sources.

He saw service during the War of the Austrian Succession. Born into a politically well-connected family, Thomas Grenville rose quickly through the naval ranks to his first commands during the War of the Austrian Succession. A fortunate encounter while in his first command brought him a valuable prize, while political influence ensured he received prime postings. He was to have gone on an independent cruise early in 1747, but the requirements of the service meant that he was instead attached to the fleet in the Atlantic under George Anson. Anson came across a French fleet under the Marquis de la Jonqui√®re, off Cape Finisterre and attacked them in the Battle of Cape Finisterre. He won a decisive victory, but Grenville was among the casualties, having been wounded in the leg, and subsequently dying of his injuries after a few hours. His body was returned to England for burial, and a memorial was raised to his memory by his relative, at Stowe House. Family and early career Thomas Grenville was born on 4 April 1719, the seventh son of the politician Richard Grenville. His older brothers, George and Richard, also became distinguished politicians. George served as Prime Minister between 1763 and 1765. Thomas was brother-in-law to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. He was politically close to both men as all were Cobham Cubs of the Patriot Whig persuasion, a grouping led by his uncle Lord Cobham. Thomas Grenville entered the Royal Navy, and had risen to the rank of lieutenant by 1740, and captain by 1742. He was given command of the 50-gun on 6 April 1742, and while sailing off Cape St. Vincent in March 1743, he captured a Spanish ship sailing from Veracruz to Cadiz with an extremely valuable cargo, valued at ¬£120,000 or ¬£130,000,. In a letter to his brother George, Grenville estimated his share as being probably between ¬£30,000 and ¬£40,000, but it does not seem to have actually amounted to more than half. He was then appointed to the 50-gun and served off the coast of Ireland. Later career and death Column erected to Grenville's memory at Stowe House, by his uncle, Lord Cobham Grenville was moved to the 60-gun in 1746, and was elected as MP for the naval town of Bridport on 12 December 1746. He was ordered on an independent cruise in early 1747, due of the influence of his brother George, who was at this time one of the lords of the admiralty, but at the last moment his orders were changed and Grenville was ordered to join the fleet under George Anson. The change in orders caused annoyance, though Anson wrote to George Grenville to promise that he would detach Thomas as soon as he was able. On 3 May, Anson came across a French squadron, under the command of the Marquis de la Jonqui√®re, off Cape Finisterre and attacked them. In the Battle of Cape Finisterre, Anson won a decisive victory, but Grenville was among the casualties. He had been hit by a large splinter two hours into the engagement, which smashed his left thigh. The leg was at once amputated, but Grenville succumbed to his wounds five hours later. His body was returned to England, where George Lyttelton wrote that the joy of the victory \\"is palled to our family by the loss of poor Captain Grenville, one of the most promising young men in the navy, and who, had he lived, would have been an honour not to his family only, but to his country.\\" Thomas Grenville was buried at the family seat in Wotton Underwood. His uncle, Lord Cobham, raised a column to his memory in the grounds of his house at Stowe. Notes a.

Within the complex itself, key goals are to create research and teaching-lab/classroom spaces appropriate for the research and teaching that characterize science at Brandeis University and to foster connections between disciplines in the sciences through physical connections and the creation of interaction spaces. The construction of the , $154 million science complex, which was made possible by a generous donation from the family of Carl and Ruth Shapiro, houses two floors of biology and chemistry teaching labs and classrooms, three floors devoted to research labs, and an atrium and caf√©. Building Design + Construction Brandeis-Office of Capital Projects Even though science research buildings are energy-intensive, energy conservation was a top priority in the design. A multi-story atrium connects to other buildings within the science complex, serving as a hub for the science community and facilitating collaboration across multiple disciplines. FEATURES: Shapiro Science Center Sustainability Sign ‚Ä¢High-efficiency glass and exterior sunshades on the south facade achieve optimized control of solar heat gain. The air systems operate at various levels of intensity to conserve energy when the building isn‚Äôt fully occupied. The lighting system includes both occupancy sensors and a daylight harvesting system that automatically dims or brightens the lights in a room based on the amount of daylight. The building also has two heat- recovery wheels that draw heat out of the air to help cool the space in the summer and warm it in the winter. ‚Ä¢More than 95 percent of construction and demolition waste was recycled. All salvageable furniture removed from vacant spaces either was reused at Brandeis or donated for reuse elsewhere. Recycling containers are provided in every kitchen, lab, office, and common space to support the Brandeis recycling program. ‚Ä¢Large amounts of glass on the exterior of the building provide ample daylight. All interior spaces have direct or borrowed daylight (except where research requires darkness). Operable windows in nonlab spaces offer occupants natural ventilation. ‚Ä¢Native plantings require no irrigation or maintenance, significantly reducing water consumption. Concrete sidewalks contain a white additive to help reflect sunlight and reduce solar heat gain. Permeable eco-pavers allow water to soak into the ground, and underground retention tanks store rainwater for slow release. ‚Ä¢The flooring tile, carpet, and exterior panels are all made with recycled and recyclable material. Furniture is GREENGUARD-certified. Wood used throughout the project is free of formaldehyde. ‚Ä¢Research labs are designed for maximum flexibility. Open labs along the north and south faces of the building can expand and contract, while a flexible casework system can be easily adjusted as lab requirements change. Mandel Center for Humanities Made possible by a $22.5 million gift from the Cleveland-based Mandel Foundation, the Mandel Center for Humanities bolsters Brandeis University‚Äôs commitment to the humanities and social sciences, and underscores the cultural and intellectual importance of the liberal arts education and the fields of literature, language, and philosophy. Opened in fall 2010, the Mandel Center's mission is to foster original, interdisciplinary courses and offer increased opportunities for students to participate in research that incorporates multifaceted subject matter. The center also organizes special local, national, and international conferences and events. Mandel Center Other Research Facilities Brandeis faculty have also secured external funding for an array of other research facilities. These include: Brandeis Research Facilities * An 800 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer * An electron microscopy (EM) facility, including a 300kV field emission cryo EM * A Fourier transform mass spectrometry facility, equipped for both electrospray and MALDI ionization * X-ray crystallography facilities * Microfluidics fabrication facility * The Ashton Graybiel Spatial Orientation Laboratory * The Mandel Center for the Humanities * The Irving Schneider and Family Building * CLEM- Facility for Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy Research Centers and Institutes Distinguished Faculty and Alumni Faculty Pulitzer Prize Winners: David Hackett Fischer-History Eileen McNamara-American Studies/Journalism Yehudi Wyner-Music (emeritus) National Academy of Sciences members: Carolyn Cohen-Biology David DeRosier-Biology (emeritus) Stanley Deser-Physics (emeritus) Jeff Hall-Biology/Neuroscience (emeritus) Hugh Huxley-Biology (emeritus) Eve Marder-Biology/Neuroscience Chris Miller- Biochemistry/Neuroscience Greg Petsko-Biochemistry/Chemistry (Institute of Medicine) Alfred Redfield-Physics (emeritus) Michael Rosbash- Biology/Neuroscience American Academy of Arts and Sciences: Edgar Brown- Mathematics (emeritus) David Buchsbaum-Mathematics (emeritus) Carolyn Cohen- Biology Saul Cohen-Chemistry (emeritus) David DeRosier-Biology (emeritus) Stanley Deser-Physics (emeritus) David Hackett Fischer-History James Haber- Biology Jeff Hall-Biology/Neuroscience (emeritus) Ray Jackendoff-Language and Linguistics/Psychology (emeritus) Gish Jen-English and American Literature Mickey Keller-History Henry Linschitz-Chemistry Eve Marder- Biology/Neuroscience Irene Pepperberg-Psychology Greg Petsko- Biochemistry/Chemistry Alfred Redfield-Physics (emeritus) Jehuda Reinharz-Near Eastern Judaic Studies Michael Rosbash-Biology/Neuroscience Jonathan Sarna- Cultural Production/Near Eastern Judaic Studies Sam Schweber-Physics (emeritus) Andrew Szent-Gy√∂rgyi-Biology (emeritus) Howard Hughes Medical Investigators: Nikolaus Grigorieff-Biochemistry Dorothee Kern- Biochemistry/Biological Physics Chris Miller-Biochemistry/Neuroscience Michael Rosbash-Biology/Neuroscience MacArthur Fellows: Bernadette Brooten-Medieval and Renaissance Studies/Near Eastern and Judaic Studies/Women and Gender Studies Gina G.

Francis van der Bom, requested that the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul open a hospital in Saginaw. The facility opened after the arrival of four sisters of the Daughters of Charity on August 22, 1874. The original frame building on the east side of Saginaw soon proved inadequate; in 1875 a new building was begun on the site and the hospital incorporated as St. Mary's. Its first patients were principally injured lumbermen. The staff devised a health insurance plan of $5 a year to raise funds. The hospital continued to expand and modernize to care for more patients as well as to provide an increasing variety of medical and educational facilities. In 1928, a new building was dedicated, adding an emergency room, 4 operating rooms, a medical library, and bringing the total of beds to 156. A new facility was opened in 1961, following the demolition of the 1892 building. Flightcare, a medical emergency helicopter transfer service, was based at St. Mary's beginning in 1987.https://www.flightcaremi.com/about The St. Mary's burn unit was opened in 1975. The first open heart surgery in the region was performed at St. Mary's on Sept. 10, 1984.https://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/2014/08/st_marys_of_michigan_hospital_4.html On November 1, 1999, the Daughters of Charity National Health System merged with the Sisters of Saint Joseph to form Ascension Health.

This achievement recognizes the trauma center's dedication to providing optimal care for injured patients. St. Mary's Level II Trauma Program was the first ACS Verified Level II Trauma Center in the region. St. Mary's Trauma team provides care for adult patients, serving the mid-northern counties of Michigan. ‚ÄúWe treat patients who have the most severe life threatening injuries,‚Äù said the former Medical Director of St. Mary's Trauma Center. ‚ÄúOur team of surgeons, physicians, nurses and technicians work with medical specialists from all aspects of care to provide the best possible care for the victim of injury. The teamwork between all members of the trauma team is what allows us to provide quality care to each patient.‚Äù The Verification Program for Hospitals promotes the development of trauma centers in which participants provide not only the hospital resources necessary for trauma care, but also the entire spectrum of care to address the needs of all injured patients. Verified trauma centers must meet the essential criteria that ensure trauma care capability and institutional performance, as outlined by the American College of Surgeons‚Äô Committee on Trauma in its current Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient manual.

The show is often touted as the next generation in destruction television and the show's tagline \\"Girls, Guns and Tanks!\\" has become infamous with the politically correct. Cast Some members of the Tankboy Crew after a live stunt show. Characters L-R, Captain Tankboy, Nuke, Sarge and Humma (on the bottom) The show has six main characters: * Captain Tankboy Charles Knight, a licensed arms dealer and explosives expert, who works on a strict military style 'need to know' policy. * The Sarge Evana Patterson, an ex-model and glamor queen starred for five episodes. After that, a new sarge, known as the Russian Sarge Iana Bikoulova appeared. A blonde Russian girl with attitude. * Krispy Jody Hooker, is the crew engineer who manages to fix anything, anywhere, anytime. * Humma Paul Blenkiron, Nuke Nick Scott and Legs Sarah Bailey form the remainder of the crew. And as always, they end up in all sorts of crazy and unbelievable situations. * Gungirl Tina Knight only appeared in one episode of Tankboy season 1, though she is rumored to return for season 2. Vehicles The main \\"tank\\" used in the show is a Russian BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle, but Tankboy also uses a British Sabre light tank when the need for a small, lightweight tank arises. Other common vehicles used on the show include a 6-wheeled British amphibious army truck, the Stalwart FV622, an International fire engine and an ex-Army Land Rover. Guns The show uses two primary firearms, the M4 carbine and the Heckler & Koch G36. But they also use a number of other military firearms, most of which are owned by the Captain who is also a licensed firearms dealer. Captain Tankboy's weapon of choice is the Glock G19 pistol, but various military firearms dating back as far as World War II have been used on the show. History Koichi Sakamoto and the Alpha Stunts team provided stunt training for Captain Tankboy and the Tankboy Crew in December 2007, just before filming began. Koichi also directed fight scenes for a Tankboy episode, \\"Operation Stuntman\\". The Tankboy Crew performed live stunts and entertainment at such events as the Kumeu Car Show, SmashFest, Big Boys Toys, The Great Lakes Medieval Festival and numerous war re-enactments. Tankboy Season 1 was shot in New Zealand in 2008 and is screening worldwide. The show has become very popular in Russia and Kazakhstan. In January 2011, Team Tankboy ran in the CannonBall Run car rally in Auckland, New Zealand, and won third place. The vehicle they competed in was Tankboy's own ex-US Army Humvee, making it the first time a military Humvee had been used on the CannonBall Run. The Tankboy crew filmed with Dai Henwood in 2009. and with Greg Murphy for the TV series, Crash Course in late 2011/early 2012.

Initially, in AD 1502, it was built as a small thatched chapel, but later, in AD 1506, was made into a more permanent structure. It was rebuilt in 1682 and subsequently refurbished in AD 1729. An Insignia awarded by Rome as the ‚ÄòMother Church‚Äô is seen in this church. This Church is stated to be the oldest Christian church in India, outside of Kerala and visited by devotees from Karwar, Binaga and other villages of Karnataka and Goa. The ancient church was under the control of the Vicar of the diocese of Karwar, facing the city of Goa. The Church is now under the ownership of the Government of Goa but is administered by the Indian Navy who are in possession of the island to build a strategic naval base. History History of the church is dated to 22 August 1502 when Fr Henrique de Coimbra with other eight Franciscans, landed at Anjadipa Island as part of the second Portuguese expedition under the leadership of Pedro Alvares Cabral. A makeshift chapel was built in AD 1502 and first mass in Goa was held there. A permanent church was built at the same location in AD 1506. The present church was re-built in AD 1729. The other landmark on the island is the Chapel of St Francis located near this Church, which has not been refurbished and is mostly in ruins. Restoration The Church of Lady of Springs has been restored and festivals are held here every year, mainly because of the assistance of the people (of both Christian and Hindu community) of Karwar, Sirsi and Binaga. The Parish Priest of St Annes Church at Binaga, Fr Britto D Silva, and the former Parish Priest Fr. Kurien, who earned the sobriquet of \\"Anjedivacho Pisso\\", coordinated efforts to restore the church to some of its past glory. Pilgrimage Until recently, Goan Catholics from all parts of the world have been visiting this \\"Brotas\\" church on pilgrimage for worship. After the Indian Navy took over the island to establish 'Project Sea Bird' (a naval base project), disputes have cropped up on allowing pilgrims to visit the churches here, since the area is now considered a military ‚Äòhigh security‚Äô zone. It is claimed that when the Government of Goa handed over the island in December 1987 to the Indian Navy there was a stipulation that pilgrims would be allowed to visit the Church of Our Lady of Springs and the Chapel of St Francis D‚ÄôAssissi on the island, particularly on feast days on 2 February and 4 October. The issue has remained unresolved although the Navy continues to grant permission on a year-to-year basis. The issue has been raised in the Indian Parliament by MP Rajya Sabha, who demands that devotees should be allowed to celebrate the religious festivals every year on the two Islands. To resolve the situation, it has been suggested that the numbers of pilgrims be controlled, access be restricted to only those who are issued a photo identity card by the Government of Goa, only one group of pilgrims be allowed to visit at a time, and just one mass be held in the Church. Access The Church on Anjadip Island is located , south of Baticala, the ancient kingdom of Garsopa, in present-day Karwar. Karwar is approached by the National Highway NH 17. From Karwar, a causeway leads to the Officers (Sea Bird) gate and then to the historic church. The church is also approachable by boat ride from the Binga beach. In the past, the approach involved a trip of one hour by trawler and then by canoe to the island.

She is noted for her part in establishing the National Art Collections Fund in 1903 to help preserve Britain's artistic heritage. Background Herringham was born in Kent and was the daughter of Thomas Wilde Powell, a wealthy patron of the Arts and Crafts Movement. In 1880 she married the physician Wilmot Herringham, (later Sir Wilmot Herringham) with whom she had two sons. Interests 1900‚Äì1911 Herringham was involved in founding the Society of Painters in Tempera in 1901. It had little impact on academic painters, but influenced Joseph Southall. The members included Mary Sargant Florence and Margaret Gere; the Society flourished to around 1909, and had around 50 members, holding exhibitions in 1901, 1905 and 1909. It merged into a new Mural Decorators' Society in 1912. She had been committed to women's suffrage from 1889. In 1906 she founded the Women's Tribune tabloid before she went to India. The magazine was recreated as Women and Progress by Nora Vynne and it was published until 1914. She also supported the launch in 1909 of the Englishwoman by the Women‚Äôs League of Suffrage Societies. The National Art Collections Fund had a quiet inception in June 1903, when Christiana Herringham recruited Roger Fry, Dugald Sutherland MacColl and Claude Phillips. With the exception of Phillips, who was in bad health, they met on 7 July at 40 Wimpole Street, the Herringham's London home: others invited were John Postle Heseltine, Charles Holroyd, John Bowyer Buchanan Nichols, Robert Clermont Witt and Lord Balcarres. They represented business (Heseltine) and politics (Balcarres) as well as the art world. Balcarres gravitated to the position of chairman of a provisional committee, and Herringham provided some working funds, but there were tensions: between Herringham and her cousin Witt, and over the participation of other women. At the first General Meeting of the Fund in November, Fry moved a protest amendment, seconded by Herringham, aimed at the exclusion of key early founders from the executive committee. Balcarres tried hard to smooth over the schism between Witt and Isidore Spielmann on one side, and Fry, MacColl and Phillips on the other. With these issues barely contained backstage, Heseltine set out to acquire the Rokeby Venus for the National Gallery, London, the purchase that established the Fund in British cultural life. In 1906, the Herringhams made a trip to India. Christiana subsequently became involved in the promotion of Indian art in the UK through her friendship with William Rothenstein. She was also on good terms with Ananda Coomaraswamy, interested in promoting Indian art in the United Kingdom but otherwise rather isolated. Ernest Havell and Rothenstein formed the India Society and Herringham joined the committee, the only female member of it at the time. The Society would often meet at her home at 40 Wimpole Street in London. Her husband became Chair of the India Society committee in 1914. Herringham travelled to India again in 1911, and made copies of the Buddhist cave paintings at Ajanta near Hyderabad, which had deteriorated. Among the visitors who observed her work was William Rothenstein. An exhibition of the copies opened at the Crystal Palace in London in June 1911. Following the formation of the Society, Herringham returned to the Ajanta caves with Rothenstein. She set up a camp with the help of the Nizam of Hyderabad, and with several artists (including Dorothy Larcher) set about copying the frescoes. The Russian-French art historian Victor Goloubew (:fr:Victor Goloubew) and his assistant, the French writer Charles M√ºller (:fr:Charles M√ºller (√©crivain)), participated in the project, but the working relationship was fraught. Later life Herringham, however, had begun to suffer from delusions of pursuit and persecution. In 1914, she returned to the UK and was admitted to mental institutions. She spent the rest of her life in private nursing homes. She died in Sussex in 1929. Translation * Translation of Il libro dell'arte by Cennino Cennini, 1899. Herringham had taken up the cause of the revival of tempera painting, and this translation from Italian of Cennini's 15th century treatise was a replacement for the 1844 translation by Mary Merrifield. It used the edition in Italian by Carlo and Gaetano Milanesi, and the German translation by Albert Ilg; and became the standard version in English for a generation. Legacy Royal Holloway, University of London own a large collection of Herringham's works, which were originally left to Bedford New College, remaining in the College gallery and archive. In literature Her biographer Mary Lago suggests Christiana Herringham may have been the inspiration for Mrs Moore in E. M. Forster's 1924 novel A Passage to India.

As head of the Polish communist secret police (UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa or UB) between 1944 and 1954, he was one of the chief organisers of Stalinist terror in Poland. He also served as a political commissar and was made a Divisional General in Communist Poland. Unlike other individuals responsible for the Stalinist terror in the 1940s and 1950s, Radkiewicz was never held responsible for his crimes, although in 1956, after the Pozna≈Ñ protests and his official \\"self-critique\\", he was removed from his post as Minister of Public Security and made Minister of State Agricultural Farms (PGRs). Early life Radkiewicz was born in the village of Rozmierki in the Slonimsky Uyezd of the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus).Institute for National Remembrance, \\"Wystawa \\"Ludzie UB\\"\\" (Exhibition \\"Men of UB\\"), He was the son of farmer Franciszek and Paulina n√©e Lenczewska. He finished third grade. In 1915, during World War I, together with his family he was evacuated by the retreating Imperial Russian Army to Buzuluk in the Samara Governorate, where he worked on local farms. During the Bolshevik Revolution, he joined the Komsomol. After the Polish- Soviet War, in 1922, his family moved back to their home village, but Stanis≈Çaw soon moved to the Soviet Union where he worked in the Polish Bureau of the Communist Party of Byelorussia. In 1925, he was sent clandestinely by Moscow back into Poland to take charge of the youth section of the illegal Polish Communist Party (KPP). Three years later, he was arrested for activity against the sovereignty and independence of the Polish Republic and sentenced to four years in prison. After being released, he served as a functionary of the KPP. He was arrested again in 1937 and served half a year in prison. In 1938, on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the KPP was disbanded and many of its leaders were executed as part of the Great Purge. Radkiewicz, however, was spared as he enjoyed Stalin's confidence and was in fact put in charge by Stalin of liquidating KPP's party cells. World War II During World War II, he volunteered for the Red Army, but was later transferred and made a political commissar of the Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division and later a Division General. He was also a delegate to the first Polish Sejm under Communist rule. Head of secret police Radkiewicz was made head of the UB secret police in 1944, shortly after the formation of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) \\"Lublin Committee\\" explicitly with Stalin's approval.Norman Davies, \\"God's playground: a history of Poland in two volumes\\", Oxford University Press, 2005, pg. 414, On 31 December 1944, the PKWN was transformed into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland and the UB was renamed Ministry of Public Security of Poland (MBP), although it continued to be known by its UB acronym partly because of the fact that local offices continued under the old name. In the period after 1945, the secret police grew rapidly under Radkiewicz's direction, with twelve thousand agents in April 1945 and twenty-four thousand in December 1945. At its height, in 1953, the organisation had thirty-three thousand agents. Radkiewicz's UB focused its activities on several main areas: * agitation and armed terror, including secret murders, directed at the only legal political opposition to the Communist Party, the Polish People's Party (also known as \\"Polish Peasant Party\\", PSL) (which was forced to merge into the Communist controlled satellite United People's Party (ZSL) in 1949) * tracking down, arresting and executing members of the anti-communist underground organisations, such as Freedom and Independence (WiN), National Armed Forces (NSZ) or other \\"Cursed soldiers\\" and non-violent civilian organisations. * attacking and suppressing the activity of the Catholic Church in Poland, as well as other, non-Catholic, religious organisations. Additionally, the UB played a significant role in organising Operation Vistula.Timothy Snyder, \\"To Resolve the Ukrainian Problem Once and for All: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ukrainians in Poland, 1943-1947\\", Journal of Cold War Studies 1.2 (1999), pp. 86-120 Action against the Polish People's Party In December 1945, Radkiewicz directed a general action against the only legal opposition party in Poland at the time, the PSL. The purpose of the action was to ensure a Communist victory in the upcoming elections and in the Polish people's referendum of 1946. On Radkiewicz's orders, PSL candidates in the elections were harassed and removed from electoral lists, ballots sent to areas of high PSL support were intercepted and never delivered so that voting never took place, PSL town hall meetings were attacked by units of Milicja Obywatelska (MO) and UB and, finally, particularly active members of the party were murdered. Radkiewicz issued an order to his agents in which he instructed them to prepare an action of \\"liquidating\\" members of the PSL which, according to him, opposed Communist rule in Poland and which supposedly supported the anti-Communist underground. The order also stated that these liquidations were to be made to look as the work of the anti-Communist underground, combined with a press campaign directed against \\"anti-government terrorist bandits\\", which would place the blame for the murders on various anti-Communist organisations.Ryszard Terlecki, \\"Miecz i Tarcza Komunizmu. Historia aparatu bezpieczenstwa w Polse, 1944-1990\\" (Sword and Shield of Communism. A history of the Polish security services, 1944-1990), Wydawnictwo Literackie, Krakow, 2007, pg. 62 As a result, between the spring of 1945 and January 1947, at least 140 members of the PSL were murdered by the UB, among them notable figures such as Narcyz Wiatr and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kojder. The leader of the PSL, Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk, in the face of widespread election fraud and growing state terror against his party, fled Poland in April 1946.Hanna Diskin, \\"The seeds of triumph: church and state in Gomu≈Çka's Poland\\", Central European University Press, 2001, pg. 47, Action against the Catholic Church in Poland As early as September 1945, Radkiewicz ordered the organisation of the 5th Department of UB whose task was to \\"counter organisations and groups active against the interests of the (Communist) Party\\". Within the 5th Department, Section V was charged with investigating and building actions against the Catholic Church. Within the section, Sub-Section I was charged with investigating those active in the Catholic Church (including the clergy) while Sub-Section II's focus was to be on the Catholic press and secular Catholic organisations. The head of the 5th Department was Julia Brystiger who, together with Radkiewicz, organized the secret police's operations aimed at the Catholic Church in Poland. In October 1947, Brystiger - who was an interrogator of political prisoners widely known for her sadism and Gestapo-like methods of torture during questioningDevil's Choice By David Dastych \\\\- presented a seminar entitled On the Clergy's Offensive Against Our Task at a conference for secret police chiefs and Radkiewicz was the main discussant. In her presentation, Brystiger stated that the \\"final time of merciless fight with the Church\\" was coming soon and that, in order to win it, the secret services of the Communist Party would need to employ \\"any means necessary\\". Radkiewicz, in his follow up remarks, noted that, \\"The clergy is not like the PSL (The Polish People's Party). With them it won't be as easy as it was with the PSL\\". As a result, in the autumn of 1950 Radkiewicz split Section V of the 5th Department into its own department (also the 5th) whose purpose was exclusively the \\"fight against the clergy\\". The actions against the Catholic Church took several forms, including harassment of priests and nuns, attempts to alienate the Polish church from the Vatican via the use of moles and agent provocateurs, seizure and expropriation of church property, and staging of incidents which were meant to embarrass the Catholic hierarchy in the eyes of the public and Western opinion (for example, planting of weapons in churches). In particularly \\"difficult\\" cases of politically active priests and Catholics who \\"didn't get the message\\", Radkiewicz ordered their elimination from public life, or, if all else failed, murder. Party membership In December 1954, Radkiewicz was removed from the position of Minister of Security,A. Kemp-Welch, \\"Poland under Communism: a Cold War history\\", Cambridge University Press, 2008, pg. 83, and in July 1955 he stepped down from the Political Bureau of the Communist Party. After workers' unrest in Poznan in 1956, several other members of the security services responsible for the Stalinist terror in Poland were put on trial (among others Roman Romkowski, J√≥zef R√≥≈ºa≈Ñski and Anatol Fejgin), but Radkiewicz went unpunished.

Prior to his term as the Manila administrator, he was the governor of White Town from 1742 to 1762. Governorships Born in Madras, India (now Chennai, India) in 1724, Dawsonne Drake was the second son of George Drake (4 December 1696 - 1741), a native of Buckland and descendant of Sir Francis Drake, and his wife, Sophia Bugden. In 1742, Dawsonne Drake joined the British East India Company where he held the position as the clerk. At that time, he also became the governor of White Town, Madras. Because of his faithful service and good connection, he was promoted again and again until he became a member of the Madras Council. On 2 November 1762, he assumed gubernatorial office as the first British governor after the Battle of Manila (1762). He led the Manila Council, assisted by Claud Russell and Samuel Johnson. During his administration in the Philippines, his term was scandalized by bitter quarrels with various military officers, including Major Fell, Capt. Backhouse, and Capt. Brereto. Drake \\"had the difficult tasks of collecting the ransom, promoting trade, and defending the perimeter. It is no wonder he had difficulties, but it is remarkable that he did so badly.\\" Post-governorship Upon his return to Madras in April 1766, he was tried by the Madras Council on criminal charges including extortion from the Chinese community and \\"abusing his authority to extort money from anyone who came into his power.\\" He was found guilty and dismissed from the Council at Fort St. George, India on 2 December 1767. This sentence was later modified, and he was simply limited in his council rank.
