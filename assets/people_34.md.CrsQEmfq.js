He is included in the Lloyd's List Most influential people in the shipping industry. Early life and career Vardinogiannis is of Cretan descent. After graduating from the Athens College preparatory school, he majored in economics at Vassar College in the United States. He is a former car rally champion who owns the private rally team Cyclon Rally Sport, with seven participations (from 1986 to 1992) in the international Acropolis Rally. He was the first Greek driver in Acropolis Rally for five years from 1988 to 1992. He won the Greek Rally title six times (1987 to 1992), driving Lancia Delta with co- driver Kostas Stefanis. Since his retirement from the sport, in 1993, he works in the family business (Vardinogiannis group of companies), which has diverse sectors such as energy, oil refineries, shipping, television broadcasting, publishing and banking. The Vardinogiannis family owns the multi-billion oil refining company Motor Oil Hellas, where he is a member of the board of directors as the executive vice chairman, and also serves shipping company Avin International S.A., and Piraeus Bank. In May 1996, he was married to Mellissa Gromel and now has three sons. He is the principal shareholder of the Cairo-based Vegas Oil and Gas. As owner of Panathinaikos F.C. In the summer of 2000, the President of Panathinaikos, Yiorgos Vardinogiannis, resigned from his duties and sold his share to his nephew Giannis Vardinogiannis, who succeeded him and changed the style of management into the club (while continuing to work for various family companies). In 2005, he was a founding member of the Greek Super League and was elected president in 2007, being credited in his efforts to achieve European league standards in Greece. On 22 April 2008, main shareholder Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50% ‚Äì after 30 years of full ownership ‚Äì through an ‚Ç¨800 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos 10% and the rest shareholders 34%. The Vardinogiannis family finally withdrew from Panathinaikos in 2012. The team had the following successes as an owner of Panathinaikos: * Quarter-finals in Champions League: 2001‚Äì02 * Quarter-finals in Uefa Cup: 2002‚Äì03 * Greek Championship: 2004, 2010 * Greek Cup: 2004, 2010 Political views In February 2015 Vardinogiannis said in a statement to Reuters that the new Prime Minister of Greece Alexis Tsipras had a valid point in attacking the corrupted Greek oligarchs.

The valley is the upper valley of the River Calder. Major tributaries of the Upper Calder include the Walsden Water, which flows through the large village of Walsden to join the Calder at Todmorden; the Hebden Water, which flows through Hebden Dale to join the Calder at Hebden Bridge; Cragg Brook, which flows through Cragg Vale to join the Calder at Mytholmroyd, and the largest, the River Ryburn, which joins the Calder at Sowerby Bridge. The Upper Calder Valley falls entirely within the much larger metropolitan district of Calderdale. The towns of the Upper Calder are situated linearly along the valley, which cuts through the eastern slopes of the Pennines from Portsmouth in the west to Sowerby Bridge, a market town on the outskirts of Halifax, in the east. In popular culture The rugged and steep-sided Upper Calder Valley inspired such literary artists as the poets Ted Hughes (who was born in Mytholmroyd and wrote about Scout Rock), Sylvia Plath (who is buried in Heptonstall, near Hebden Bridge) and the writer Emily Bront√´.

The majority of the prisoners who were detained in the camp were men, captured during and after the military operations at Bradina and Donje Selo and their surrounding areas. Deliƒá was convicted of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions which included the murders, torture, inhuman and cruel treatment of the prisoners as well as the rape of two Serbian women in the camp and sentenced to 20 years by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on 16 November 1998, before his sentence was reduced to 18 years following a second sentencing judgement on 9 October 2001. On 24 June 2008, Deliƒá was granted early release. Background During the ƒåelebiƒái trial, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia established the importance of the Konjic municipality both historically and strategically. Because it lied on the fault line between areas Croats and Serbs considered to be within their spheres of influences, both ethnic groups had a vested geographical interest. More importantly, it was the site of an arms and munitions factory as well as being an important communications link between Mostar and Sarajevo due to its railway line and highway. As Bosnia descended into war, Konjic was not immune to the tension and suspicion among the ethnic groups. On 17 April 1992, Serb representatives from Konjic's Municipal Assembly and Executive Council walked out following the recognition of Bosnia as an independent state. In the meantime, Muslim and Croat officials formed a War Presidency and an interim \\"Crisis Staff\\" to deal with the municipality's administration and defence. By mid-April 1992, Bosnian Serb forces had effectively surrounded the town of Konjic and cut it off from both Sarajevo and Mostar. Muslim and Croat forces began to arrive in the city of Konjic from surrounding villages, while Serb inhabitants moved to Serb-controlled villages. Konjic's defence forces‚Äîwhich at the time consisted of the Territorial Defence Force (TO), the local Croatian Army (HVO) and the Ministry of the Interior (MUP)‚Äîattempted to negotiate with the principal representative of the Serbian people, the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) but these apparent negotiations failed and a military campaign was launched. Beginning in late May 1992, Bosniak and Croat forces attacked and seized control of certain Serb majority villages in the municipality of Konjic. These operations resulted in the detainment of many members of the Serb population. A former JNA facility located on the outskirts of the village of ƒåelebiƒái was chosen as the facility to house the prisoners. The majority of the prisoners were men, captured during military operations in these villages, but also included some women who were housed separately. Detainees at the camp were subjected to murder, torture, sexual violence and otherwise cruel and inhumane treatment. Trial and conviction On 21 March 1996, The ICTY indicted Deliƒá along with Esad Land≈æo, Zdravko Muciƒá and Zejnil Delaliƒá for their roles in the crimes committed against Serbs at the camp. Deliƒá was the deputy commander of the ƒåelebiƒái camp from May 1992 to November 1992. Afterwards, he was the commander until its closure in December 1992, following the departure of Zdravko Muciƒá. Deliƒá was arrested by the authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina on 2 May 1996 and transferred to the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia) on 13 June 1996. Deliƒá, Muciƒá and Delaliƒá were accused of failing to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or to punish those who mistreated the detainees from their superior positions of authority. The ICTY noted the murders of at least 14 detainees and seven specific acts of torture. Additionally, in the case of Deliƒá, he was also charged with direct involvement in four murders, five specific acts of torture, including two rapes and one case of causing great suffering or serious injury. Reporting on the case, BBC News noted that Deliƒá took \\"sadistic pleasure\\" in the abuse of prisoners. On 16 November 1998, the ICTY delivered its verdict on the ƒåelebiƒái case. Deliƒá was found guilty to a part of the charges and sentenced to 20 years in prison on the basis of individual responsibility and hierarchical superiority for: * Violations of the laws and customs of war (Art. 3 ICTY Statute): murder, cruel treatment, torture and pillage; * Serious breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions (Art. 2 ICTY Statute): wilful murder, torture, wilfully causing intense suffering or of inflicting serious bodily injury, and inhumane treatment It was found that he beat one detainee over the course of several days which resulted in his death. He beat a detainee with a number of objects, including shovels and electric wires. He placed severe restrictions on the amount of water which could be drunk by detainees, despite there being no shortage of water available. He also violently raped two women in the camp. Deliƒá's sentence was reduced to 18 years following a second sentencing judgement on 9 October 2001. On 24 June 2008, Deliƒá was granted early release, based on credit given for time served in detention since 2 May 1996.

The kingdom existed from 1881, when Carol I of Romania was proclaimed king, until 1947, when the last king, Michael I of Romania, abdicated and the Parliament proclaimed Romania a republic. Soon after, upon the establishment of the constitution of 13 April 1948, Romania became a popular republic, a regime that lasted until 1989. Members of the former royal family include the daughters of the late, former King Michael of Romania. Some descendants have adopted the surname \\"of Romania\\". There are also descendants of Michael's older half-brother Carol Lambrino (also known as \\"Carol Hohenzollern\\" and \\"Carol Mircea Grigore of Romania\\" or, in Romanian, al Rom√¢niei, on his amended, Romanian birth certificate\\"General\\" Evenimentul Zilei), whose legitimacy was disputed and who were not recognised as royal during the reigns of Ferdinand, Carol II and Michael. King Michael publicly renounced for himself, the former queen, and their five daughters any claim to the titles of \\"Prince/Princess of Hohenzollern\\", styles which were in any case not recognised under German laws since 1919 but had been attributed, along with the Romanian royal titles, to members of the Romanian dynasty in such subsequently-published sources as the Almanach de Gotha and Burke's Guide to the Royal Family.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh (editor).

On the same occasion he asked the Romanian Parliament to abolish the Salic law, should it consider restoring the monarchy.See \\"Line of succession to the Romanian throne\\" By the same act, Michael designated his grandson Nicholas de Roumanie Medforth-Mills as a future member of the deposed royal family and future \\"Prince of Romania\\" with the style of \\"Royal Highness,\\" effective either on his 25th birthday, 1 April 2010, or upon Michael's death, whichever might occur sooner. On 1 August 2015, however, King Michael issued a declaration retracting the style \\"Royal Highness\\" and \\"of Romania\\" previously conferred upon Nicholas, also excluding him from the line of succession to the headship of the dynasty, noting that his successors in that capacity should be persons of \\"principled modesty and morality.\\"The Telegraph. AP. \\"Romania prince stripped of title by former king for lacking 'modest moral principles'\\". 2 August 2015. Retrieved 2 August 2016. Children and consorts of the members of the family who do not bear a royal title are not recognised as members of the former royal family, according to the new rules. Line of Succession  The titles of the members of the Royal House of Romania, as well as the order of succession are determined by the Organic Norms of the Royal House of Romania. Thus, according to them, the current head of the Royal House of Romania is Her Majesty Queen Margareta. The current consort of the head of the Royal House of Romania is Prince Radu. The current successor to the head of the Royal House of Romania is Princess Elena. The members of the Royal House of Romania are as follows: Margareta, Custodian of the Romanian Crown; Prince Radu; Princess Elena; Princess Sofia. The spouses and children of the princesses do not hold royal titles. The order of succession to the head of the Royal House of Romania is based on the principle of primogeniture with male preference, the Organic Norms thus abrogating the willow principle of absolute male primogeniture, excluding women and their descendants. Basically, at present, this is the following: # Princess Elena of Romania; # Elisabeta Karina of Romania; # Princess Sofia of Romania; # Elisabeta Maria of Romania; # Princess Maria of Romania.

Located in Manhattan on the Upper East Side, Nightingale- Bamford is a member of the New York Interschool consortium. Overview Nightingale's Lower School includes grades K-4. Middle School includes grades 5-8, and Upper School includes grades 9-12. Nightingale holds a small size of 560 students, approximately 45 pupils per grade level. The student-faculty ratio is 7:1 and the average class size is that of 10 students for academic and up to 13 for PE and the like. History Frances Nicolau Nightingale and Maya Stevens Bamford founded the school in 1920. NBS was originally named Miss Nightingale's School; officially becoming \\"The Nightingale-Bamford School\\" in 1929. Since 1920, NBS has graduated nearly 3,000 alumnae. As of 2008, the School endowment is at $74.9 million. Faculty Paul Burke has been head of school since July 2012. He succeeded Dorothy Hutcheson, who was head of Nightingale for the prior 20 years. Academics Nightingale features a traditional, rigorous curriculum. Like its contemporaries, the school has a preponderance of required courses until upper school, when electives are increasingly offered. Students have excelled in a variety of these electives as well as many extracurricular activities. For example, in April 2013, a team of five upper school students won first place at Technovation Challenge, the world's largest tech competition for girls. The $10,000 prize was used to develop and market their winning app. The next year, a Nightingale team won first place in the middle school division of the 2014 Technovation Challenge and also sent their upper school team to the finals hosted by Intel. In addition, Nightingale has a debate program, which won second place at States in 2016. Admissions Nightingale's admissions process has received some media attention in the past few years. Financial aid As of the 2008-2009 school year, 32% of the NBS student body received financial assistance with $2.8 million in grants being awarded. Rankings Nightingale is typically ranked among the best all-girls private schools in the United States, and, like many private schools in Manhattan, is ranked as one of the most expensive. Diversity Nightingale-Bamford has a diverse community for an independent school with over 30% of the student body being students of color. The school has a program called Cultural Awareness for Everyone, or informally CAFE. CAFE touches on the basis of not only race, but also class, religion, sexual orientation, gender, and age. To keep diversity at the school a priority, Nightingale recruits actively from an inner-city program called Prep for Prep. Prep for Prep is a leadership development program that offers promising students of color access to a private school education based in New York City. Partner schools Nightingale-Bamford has no official partner or brother school. However, the school has activities with St. David's and Allen- Stevenson (both boys schools) and is a member of Interschool, which organizes programs and activities for eight New York City independent schools: Trinity, Dalton, Collegiate, Brearley, Chapin, Spence, Nightingale-Bamford, and Browning.http://www.facultydiversitysearch.org/ Notable alumnae *Millicent Fenwick, 1928 - politician *Amina Gautier, - author *Isabel Gillies, 1988 - author, actress *Lisa Grunwald, 1977 - novelist *Mandy Grunwald, 1975 - political consultant and media advisor *Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss, 1993 - Fashion designer *Sophie von Haselberg - actress, daughter of Bette Midler *Alexa Ray Joel - model, daughter of Billy Joel and Christy Brinkley *Olivia Palermo, 2004 - Socialite and fashion influencer *Mich√®le Rosier, 1948 - French fashion journalist *Beatriz Stix-Brunell - ballet dancer *Sarah Thompson, 1997 - actress *Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, 1921 - socialite *Elizabeth H.

Spencer's first novel, Fire in the Morning, was published in 1948. She wrote a total of nine novels, seven collections of short stories, a memoir (Landscapes of the Heart, 1998), and a play (For Lease or Sale, 1989). Her novella The Light in the Piazza (1960) was adapted for the screen in 1962 and transformed into a Broadway musical of the same name in 2005. She was a five-time recipient of the O. Henry Award for short fiction. Spencer's themes relate to tension between the individual and the group, and deal with how family or community ties support but also bind the individual's identity. She writes about this as it concerns the inner lives of her female characters, many of whom struggle to establish a fruitful life independent of society's narrow restrictions.  Early life and career  Born in Carrollton, Mississippi, Spencer was valedictorian of her graduating class at J. Z. George High School. She earned her BA at Belhaven College in Jackson, Mississippi and a master's in literature at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee in 1943. Spencer taught at the junior college level at Northwest Mississippi Community College in Senatobia, Mississippi for two years, then accepteda job with the Nashville Tennessean, but she soon returned to teaching, this time at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. In 1953, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and left Mississippi to live in Italy and pursue writing full-time. After her first three novels set in Mississippi, Spencer's career foundered for a while, for she was seen as a \\"Southern woman\\" writer, and not a literary figure. In 1981 she published her collected Stories, with a foreword by Eudora Welty, and her standing was reestablished among critics, who took another look at her contributions.Roberts, T. (1994). SELF AND COMMUNITY IN THE FICTION OF ELIZABETH SPENCER. Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana State UP  Personal life  While in Italy, she met and married John Rusher of Cornwall, England. The couple moved to Montreal, Quebec in 1956, where they remained until moving to Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1986. She taught creative writing at Concordia University in Montreal, and at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill until her retirement. Rusher died in 1998, and Spencer continued to live in her home Chapel Hill until her death on 22 December 2019. Spencer's mother was the great-aunt of United States Senator John McCain.

The sale, depending on the jurisdiction, may be a tax deed sale (whereby the actual property is sold) or a tax lien sale (whereby a lien on the property is sold) Under the tax lien sale process, depending on the jurisdiction, after a specified period of time if the lien is not redeemed, the lienholder may seek legal action which will result in the lienholder either automatically obtaining the property, or forcing a future tax deed sale of the property and possibly obtaining the property as a result. General The governmental entity can be any level of government that can assess and collect property taxes or other governmental debt, such as counties (parishes, in the case of Louisiana), cities, townships (in New England and other jurisdictions), and school districts (in places where they are independent of other governmental jurisdictions, such as in Texas). State law offers the governmental entity a method of collecting its tax without simply having to \\"ding\\" the nonpaying person or business, by (after a specified grace period, whereby the property owner can be charged interest and/or penalties as well as other costs) placing a lien on the property which, if not paid, will result in future cost and ultimately the seizure and selling of the property. In most places in the US, a tax lien takes priority, eclipsing other liens such as mortgages. The requirements to begin the foreclosure process (and to avoid it) must be strictly followed; otherwise, the property owner will lose all rights to the property (or the governmental entity will lose its right to collect the outstanding debt). Common requirements include: *sending a letter by certified or registered mail to any and all owners of record as shown on the entity's records (some jurisdictions require an attempt at personal service), as well as to any person shown as having a mortgage, lien, or \\"other interest\\" in the property, *placing a public notice in a newspaper designated to publish legal notices, *posting notice at the local courthouse or other public place designated for official notices, and/or *posting notice on the property itself in such a place and manner that it is visible to the public (such as the outside of an exterior door, or a sign on the property if it is unimproved). Once the process begins, the property owner can still avoid foreclosure by paying the amount owed plus interest, penalties, and/or other costs or fees. The amounts can end up being quite high once the process is well under way.NPR reported on a woman losing her home in Baltimore in May 2010 because she had missed a water payment of $360; over time her obligation multiplied to over $3,000 after penalties, interest, and other fees were added. Even after foreclosure, in some jurisdictions the owner can still recover the property by paying the amounts owed (plus additional interest/penalties/costs) within a specified time. Alternatively, the owner can file suit to have the sale set aside on grounds that the requirements were not followed (such as proper notice not given). Sales Two main methods are used to capture delinquent real property tax: the tax deed sale and the tax lien sale. Both methods operate using an auction method. Traditionally, the auctions have been live events held at the county courthouse or another designated official location. However, online auctions have increased in usage.Online auctions allow for more sales in less time, as well as allowing bidders from outside the area (such as out-of-state or foreign bidders) to participate. Florida counties, in particular, have embraced Internet auctions in interest. Tax deed sale In a tax deed sale, the property itself is sold. At the sale, the minimum bid is generally the amount of back taxes owed plus interest, as well as costs associated with selling the property. The purchaser making the highest bid for the property takes title. However, the purchaser usually has a very short period (generally 48‚Äì72 hours) to pay the entire amount owed, or else the sale is invalidated. Depending on the jurisdiction, any amount in excess of the minimum bid may or may not be returned to the original property owner, or the owner may forfeit rights to such excess amount if not claimed within a specified period. Also, anyone having an interest in the property (such as a governmental entity having weed liens on the property) may, in some cases, claim the excess. In the event the property is not purchased at auction, title generally reverts to the governmental entity that initiated the sale, which can then offer it for at or even below the original minimum bid (depending on property value and/or interest in the parcel). Title is generally transferred in a tax deed sale through a form of limited warranty or quitclaim deed (sometimes styled as Tax Deed or Sheriff's Deed). In most jurisdictions, this type of deed is generally insufficient to acquire title insurance.A notable exception is Illinois, where a \\"Tax Deed\\" delivers a clean title, as the issuing court removes all clouds on the title in its order directing the issuance of the deed. Therefore, a purchaser would most likely then need to initiate a quiet title action in order to resell the property later. However, the property can be sold from one purchaser to another using a limited warranty or another quitclaim deed, though usually at far less than its market value. Some jurisdictions allow for a post-sale \\"redemption period,\\" whereby the former owner has a specified amount of time to reclaim the property by repaying the amount bid at auction plus interest, penalties, and/or other costs.For example, Texas allows a two year redemption period for homestead or agricultural properties, and a 180-day period for all other properties. The amount to be paid is the amount paid at the sale (which could be more than the original bid), plus 25% of that amount paid at the sale (for homestead and agricultural properties redeemed after the first year, the penalty is 50% of the amount paid), plus deed recording costs. See http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.34.htm Texas Tax Code, Section 34.21(a) (for homestead/agricultural properties) and (e) (for all other properties). As such, purchasers of properties at tax deed sales are cautioned not to make major improvements on the property until after the redemption period has expired, as such improvements would then become the property of the original owner. A tax deed sale may also be used in conjunction with a tax lien sale process, whereby the lienholder (instead of a governmental agency) starts the process toward forcing a public sale of the property.Florida uses tax lien sales at the initial tax delinquency, and the tax deed sale (upon a lienholder's request) to sell the property in order to redeem the lien. In those instances the lienholder's investment (the price of the lien plus any additional costs necessary to start the tax deed sale process, such as required fees and payment of any still-unpaid taxes or buyout of other certificate holders' interests) constitutes the minimum bid; if no other bids are received at the sale then the lienholder will take title to the property subject to redemption periods (if applicable) or any lawsuit to overturn the sale. Pitfalls of tax deed investing Although the possibility of obtaining property at rates far below market values is promising, there are several pitfalls which must be taken into account before investing: *Payment is usually required at purchase or within a very short time afterward (often no more than 24‚Äì72 hours), and certified funds are required (i.e. financing is not allowed). Failure to pay the full amount generally results in the sales of all properties purchased by the investor being cancelled; the investor may also be barred from future sales in that jurisdiction. *Though touted as a means of obtaining property at very low cost, in practice when a property is placed for auction at a tax deed sale, it is usually sold at a higher price than the original minimum bid of the back taxes, accrued interest, and costs of sale. *As stated above, in most jurisdictions properties sold in this manner are conveyed to the highest bidder via \\"tax deed\\" (or similarly-named deed), a form of quitclaim deed. Thus, the holder of the tax deed would then have to file a quiet title action, in order to clear any title defects or obtain a mortgage or title insurance. *Should a property be obtained, it may still be subject to other liens and assessments on the property which are not extinguished at sale. These liens and assessments (and their related interest) can, in some instances, exceed the value of the property itself, making it virtually worthless. *Some states allow a post-closing redemption period, during which time the original owner can redeem the property by paying the amount bid plus interest/penalty and costs. As such, if the purchaser makes improvements on the property and the original owner redeems it within the redemption period, the purchaser may lose those improvements if they are physically attached to the property and cannot be removed. Tax lien sale In a tax lien sale, instead of selling the actual property, the governmental entity sells a lien on the property. The lien is generally for the amount of delinquent taxes, accrued interest, and costs associated with the sale. In the event that more than one investor seeks the same lien, depending on state law the winner will be determined by one of five methods: # Bid Down the Interest. Under this method, the stated rate of return offered by the government is the maximum rate of return allowed. However, investors can accept lower rates of return, including zero percent in some cases. The investor accepting the lowest rate of return is the winner. In the event that more than one investor will accept the same lower rate, the tie may be broken by 1) first bid received, 2) random selection, or 3) rotational method (see below for further discussion of the latter two methods). (States that use this method include Arizona and Floridahttp://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(6).) # Premium. Under this method, the investor willing to pay the highest premium (excess above the lien amount) will be the winner. The premium may earn interest at a different rate than the base lien value (or may not earn interest at all), and in some cases may not be paid back to the investor upon redemption of the lien. (States that include this method include Colorado; Colorado does not pay interest on the premium nor does it return it upon redemption) # Random Selection. Under this method, a bidder will be randomly selected from those offering a bid. Usually, a computer is used to make the selection, but in smaller jurisdictions more rudimentary methods may be used. (States that use this method include NevadaTechnically per the statutes, Nevada is supposed to award the lien to the first buyer making an offer; however, in practice it is sometimes hard to determine who was the first person bidding - especially at live auctions where multiple bidders are shouting interest - and thus the random method is used.) # Rotational Selection. Under this method, the first lien offered for sale will be offered to the investor holding bidder number one, who has the right of first refusal. If bidder number one refuses the lien, bidder number two may then bid. However, bidder number one will not be offered another lien until his number comes up again in the rotation. The next lien will go to the next number in line. Under this method, the investor has virtually no control over which liens s/he will obtain in the bidding, except to take or refuse what is offered. # Bid Down the Ownership. The investor willing to purchase the lien for the lowest percent of encumbrance on the property will be awarded the lien. For example, a bidder may agree to take a lien on only 95% of the property. If the lien is not redeemed, the investor would only receive 95% ownership of the property with the remaining 5% owned by the original owner. In practice, few investors will bid on liens for less than full right to the property or sale proceeds. Therefore, with multiple owners bidding on 100% encumbrance, the process then generally reverts to a tiebreaker method such as random selection. (States that use this method include Iowa) Liens not sold at auction are considered \\"struck\\" (sold) to the jurisdiction conducting the auction. Some jurisdictions allow \\"over the counter\\" purchases of liens not sold at auction, subject to some liens being exempt from sale.For example, Florida allows purchases of liens struck to the various counties; however, per statute certificates for liens of less than $250 on homestead properties cannot be sold, either at the initial auction or over the counter. See http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(4). The investor must wait a specified period of time (commonly referred to as the \\"redemption period\\") before taking action to foreclose on the property.For example, in Florida the period is \\"two years after April 1 of the year of issuance of the tax certificate\\". http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(13). Since Florida counties hold their sales after April 1 (by law, the start date for tax lien certificate sales must be no later than June 1), in Florida the redemption period is roughly 22 months after the date the certificate is sold. During the redemption period, the lien (plus interest and any other fees) may be repaid by the owner or a legal designee of the owner.In many jurisdictions, technically per statute only the actual property owner or a legal designee are legally permitted to redeem the lien. In practice, though, jurisdictions usually do not strictly enforce the statute, desiring to have money in their accounts (and liens paid off to lienholders, thus creating future interest in lien sales) as well as not wanting to upset members of the public who desire to pay debts legally owed. Usually the lien holder is not permitted during this period to contact the property owner (or anyone else having an interest in the property, such as the mortgage holder) to demand payment or threaten foreclosure, or else the lienholder can face sanctions (such as: termination of the lien and loss of money spent, being banned from future sales, and/or criminal charges).For example, see http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Sections 197.432(14). In some jurisdictions,e.g., Arizona and Colorado the lienholder must agree to pay subsequent unpaid property taxes during the redemption period in order to protect his/her interest. If the lienholder does not pay such taxes, a subsequent lienholder would \\"buy out\\" (redeem) the prior lienholder's interest. Other jurisdictions allow the lienholder first right to pay subsequent taxes, but if the lienholder chooses not to do so, a separate lien is offered for sale. Still other jurisdictions do not offer subsequent tax payment priority; each lien is sold separately (and can result in multiple liens on a property held by different lienholders).Florida falls under this category. Once the redemption period is over, the lien holder may initiate foreclosure proceedings. Normally, the cost of the proceedings will include, in addition to statutorily-mandated costs (such as application fees and costs for public notices), buy-outs of other liens and payment of any other unpaid taxes plus accrued interest. During the period between the initiation of proceedings and actual foreclosure, the property owner still has the opportunity to repay the lien with interest plus the costs incurred to foreclose. The foreclosure proceedings, depending on the jurisdiction, may be either: *\\"self-executing\\": after the expiration of the redemption period the lienholder will acquire title to the property, or *\\"non- self-executing\\": after the expiration of the redemption period the entity will conduct a tax deed sale of the property; the payments made by the lienholder constitute the opening bid and, if no other bids are received, the lienholder will acquire title to the property (the lienholder may choose to participate in the sale beyond the opening bid and make additional bids on the property if so desired). In both cases, as with tax deed sales, title to the property will normally be in the form of a quitclaim deed, thus requiring further action to quiet title. If the lienholder does not act within a specified period of time, as defined by state law, the lien is forfeited and the holder loses his investment. This period of time cannot be extended unless the tax lien holder is officially in the process of foreclosing on the property or other legal action (such as bankruptcy) is pending.For example, in Florida a tax lien certificate must be redeemed within 7 years from the date of issuance (which is statutorily defined as the first day of the sale on which the certificate was purchased, even if the certificate was purchased after the first day), unless the lien holder has applied for a tax deed or a legal or administrative proceeding \\"has existed of record\\". http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.482.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.482. A lien issued in error of state law is repaid, but usually at a far lower interest rate than had the lien been valid.For example, in Florida the interest rate on an errant lien is only 8% (unless a lower rate was bid), vs. the 18% maximum rate allowed. http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(11), Popularity of tax lien sales The popularity of tax lien sales is driven, in large part, by the maximum rate of returns offered, which can be far higher than other investments, as well as the guarantee that the governmental entity, if the lien is redeemed, will repay the investor. Examples of such high returns include: *Iowa, which offers a guaranteed 2% per month simple interest return (24% annual return) *Florida, which offers a maximum annual return rate of 18%http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(6). (with a guaranteed minimum 5% return on the original lien investment, regardless of time held and regardless of the original rate bid, except if the rate bid was 0%)http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.472.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.472(2). The 5% minimum applies to the redeemer of the certificate; however, except for the additional $6.25 certificate fee assessed at redemption per Section 197.472(3) which is paid to the county, the balance due is remitted to the lien holder. *Arizona, which offers a maximum annual return rate of 16%http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/42/18053.htm&Title;=42&DocType;=ARS The market in tax liens has been so popular that a number of major banks and hedge funds have invested large amounts of capital in it.http://articles.sun- sentinel.com/2013-05-03/news/fl-inside-florida-tax-lien-market-20130428_1_tax- liens-tax-collector-south-florida Pitfalls of tax lien investing Although the rates of return are promising, there are several pitfalls which must be taken into account before investing: *Some jurisdictions require a large deposit at the outset of the sale, regardless of how many certificates are to be purchased or their value.For example, Miami-Dade County requires a $5,000 deposit, even if a buyer wants to purchase only one certificate for far less. https://www.bidmiamidade.com/main?unique_id=vEfCeDAD5hGrBWl0dGFpSA&use;_this=view_faqs *Payment is usually required at purchase or within a very short time afterward (often no more than 24‚Äì72 hours). Failure to pay the full amount results in all lien certificates purchased by the investor being cancelled, and may result in the investor losing his/her deposit and/or being barred from future sales. *In many states, further actions must be taken to protect the lien holder's rights after purchase of a lien, which require additional costs beyond the original investment (and the costs may or may not be repaid upon redemption). In addition, the actions must be performed within a certain period of time and in strict accordance with legal requirements; failure to comply exactly with such requirements may make the lien worthless and the investment lost. *In \\"bid down the interest\\" jurisdictions, valuable properties are usually bid to the lowest rate possible greater than zero percent.For example, Florida permits the interest rate to be bid down in 0.25% increments to as low as a minuscule 0.25% annual rate of return - though it guarantees a minimum 5% return on investment- while Arizona allows the bid to be bid down in 1% increments to as low as 1% annual rate of return. Similarly, in \\"premium\\" states, valuable properties are bid up above the means of an average investor, and further, depending on the jurisdiction, the premium may not be repaid. *Unlike a certificate of deposit, tax liens are illiquid. They cannot be \\"cashed in\\" (resold to the taxing authority), but must be held until either they are repaid or the holder takes action to foreclose.

The group does outreach nationwide with shelters, rescue groups and members to promote pet adoption, no-kill animal rescue, and spay-and-neuter practices. History The group originated in Arizona in 1971, developing from The Foundation Faith of the Millennium, a religious group formerly known as the Process Church of the Final Judgment. The Foundation church relocated animals from its Arizona ranch to property in Kanab, Utah, in 1984. In 1991, the church was renamed Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, which became a tax-exempt, nonprofit charity, and in 2003 renamed Best Friends Animal Society.(pay-per-view article) Animal sanctuary After the Foundation church moved to its current grounds in 1984, the founders eventually began informally calling it \\"Best Friends\\" until 1991 when it began formally operating as Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, a no-kill shelter located in Southwestern Utah in Angel Canyon (formerly Kanab Canyon) near Kanab. The sanctuary is on with an additional leased from the United States Bureau of Land Management near Zion National Park, the Grand Canyon's North Rim, Bryce Canyon National Park, and Lake Powell. The sanctuary is home to around 1,500 homeless animals. Los Angeles shelter In August 2011, the city of Los Angeles contracted Best Friends to operate and manage its Northeast Valley Shelter, which the city could no longer afford to run. Under the contract, Best Friends was to provide adoptions for shelter animals and spay and neuter services for the community. Magazine The group publishes Best Friends, a bimonthly magazine about animals, animal welfare, news events, and activities at the sanctuary. The magazine, which is distributed free to members, has 200,000 subscribers. Originating as Foundation magazine in 1975 with its interview of Charles Manson referred to as the \\"death\\" issue, the first edition of Best Friends magazine was published in 1993, two years after the religious group became an animal sanctuary. Hurricane Katrina work Best Friends teams entered the hurricane disaster area on September 2, 2005, and stayed eight months in and around New Orleans. Best Friends did not have a significant presence doing animal disaster rescue or recovery work until Katrina. The organization's official role post-Hurricane Katrina was that of a primary animal rescue organization. Also after Katrina, Best Friends helped Pets Alive, an animal shelter in New York state, and rescuing around 800 cats from an institutional hoarding situation in Nevada. Best Friends also assisted local animal rescue groups following the Peruvian earthquakes of 2007. Michael Vick dogs In 2007, Best Friends took in 22 of former NFL quarterback Michael Vick's 47 fighting dogs after petitioning the state of Virginia to save the dogs seized from the Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation. The dogs, once owned by NFL Quarterback Michael Vick, were expected to be euthanized for fear of aggressive behavior. Seven shelters took in the remaining 25 dogs. The court ordered Vick to pay $928,073 in restitution for the ‚Äúpast, present and long-term care of all the dogs.‚Äù The court allocated $5,000 for dogs deemed likely to be adopted, and $18,275 for each of the dogs that went into longer-term or lifetime sanctuary care at Best Friends. In December 2008, Georgia, a former Vick dog, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Best Friends dog trainer John Garcia. The two also appeared on CNN's Larry King Live. Rehabilitation of the Vick dogs appeared in an episode of National Geographic Channel's series DogTown. DogTowns producer, Darcy Dennett, later approached Best Friends about a feature-length documentary on the same story. Released in October 2015, The Champions is a documentary that covers the stories of five dogs and their impact they had had on their adopters and how society looks at pit bulls rescued from fighting cases. The film received the 2015 Zelda Penzel \\"Giving Voice to the Voiceless\\" award at Hamptons International Film Festival. The film also features the work of both Best Friends Animal Society and BAD RAP, an Oakland-based animal welfare rescue group. FilmRise acquired film rights in November 2015. It was released through community screenings and became available digitally in March 2016. Community cat programs In August 2008, Best Friends and PetSmart Charities funded a program called \\"Feral Freedom\\" for free-roaming community cats in Jacksonville, Florida. The program was conceived by Rick Ducharme of First Coast No More Homeless Pets. Similar programs were funded with a grant from PetSmart Charities and implemented by Best Friends in Albuquerque, New Mexico; DeKalb County, Georgia; San Antonio, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; Osceola County, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;\\"City shelter wins $700k grant to save cats\\" , Amy Worden, The Inquirer, August 25, 2014. and other communities.\\"First Coast No More Homeless Pets Annual Report 10.01.12-9.30.13\\" , at p. 9.

It was first published as a long story in the New Yorker in March 1969 and was subsequently revised and published in book form in 1972. It concerns a woman named Laurel, who travels to New Orleans to take care of her father, Judge McKelva, after he has surgery for a detached retina. Judge McKelva fails to recover from this surgery and as he dies slowly in the hospital, Laurel visits and reads to him from Dickens. Her father's second wife, Fay, who is younger than Laurel, is a shrewish outsider from Texas. Her shrill response to the Judge's illness appears to accelerate his demise. Laurel and Fay are thrown together when they return the Judge to his home town of Mount Salus, Mississippi, where he will be buried. There, Laurel is immersed in the good neighborliness of the friends and family she knew before marrying and moving away to Chicago. Fay, though, has always been unwelcome and leaves for a long weekend, leaving Laurel in the big house full of memories. Laurel encounters her mother's memory, her father's life after he lost his first wife, and the complex emotions surrounding her loss, and the wave of memories in which she swims. She comes to a place of understanding that Fay can never share, and she leaves small town Mississippi with the memories she can carry with her.New York Times Summary The book begins with the main character, Laurel Hand, who travels to New Orleans from her home in Chicago to assist her aging father as a family friend and doctor operates on his eye. Laurel's father remains in the hospital for recovery for several months. During this time, Laurel begins to get to know her outsider stepmother better, as she rarely visited her father since the two were married. Fay begins to show her true colors as the Judge's condition worsens. To the distress of all who knew him, the Judge dies after his wife throws a violently emotional fit in the hospital and confesses to cheating and interest in his money. The two women travel back to the Judge's home in Mount Salus, Mississippi for the funeral and are received by close friends of the family. Here, Laurel finds love and friendship in a community which she left after childhood. The warmth of the town clashes with Fay's dissenting and antagonistic personality. The woman from Texas, who claimed to have no family other than the Judge, is soon confronted by her past as her mother, siblings, and other members of her family show up to her house to attend the funeral. Though Laurel confronts Fay as to the reason why she lied, she cannot help but feel anything except pity for the lonely, sullen woman. Directly after her husband's funeral, Fay leaves to go back home to Madrid, Texas with her family. After her distraught and immature stepmother leaves, Laurel finally has time to herself in the house she grew up in with the friends and neighbors she knew since childhood. During the few days she remains, Laurel digs through the past as she goes through her house remembering her deceased parents and the life she had before she left Mount Salus. She rediscovers the life of friendship and love that she left behind so many years ago, along with heartache. Her visit to her hometown and the memories of her parents open up a new insight on life for Laurel. She leaves Mount Salus with a new understanding of life and the factors which influence it the most‚Äîfriends and family. But most prominently, she gains a new understanding and respect for herself. Main characters Laurel Hand Laurel is Judge McKelva's daughter, who is an only child. She is a widow who had been married to a man named Phil Hand. After his death, Laurel returned to her parents‚Äô home because of her mother's sickness, before returning to Chicago, only to be brought back by her father's condition which is where the events in the novel begin. In the story Laurel and Fay have many arguments because of Fay's rude personality. After her father's death, the funeral, and Fay's unexpected vacation, Laurel returns to her childhood home. There, she reminisces about past memories, including those of her parents and her fear of birds before she comes to her epiphany about life. Fay McKelva Fay is Judge McKelva's second wife, and therefore, Laurel's stepmother. Judge McKelva met her at the Southern Bar Association at the old Gulf Coast hotel where Fay had a part-time job at the time. Fay is younger than Laurel. Fay's personality is not pleasant and causes everyone in the story to see her as obnoxious, self-centered, and rude. The other characters in the novel pity her. In the course of the story, we see that Fay is also dishonest, for one in saying that all of her family is dead. This untruth comes to light when they arrive for Clint's funeral. After the funeral, Fay makes a snap decision to return to Texas with her family for a short time before returning at the end of the novel to take possession of her new home. Judge (Clint) McKelva Clint McKelva is Laurel's father. Judge McKelva is treated for an eye illness; he dies after eye surgery. He is a prominent and well-respected widower in Mount Salus, Mississippi. Ten years after the death of his wife, Becky, he marries a younger woman that he met at a Southern Bar Association conference named Wanda Fay. After his death, the home where his daughter and first wife lived out their lives is willed to Wanda Fay, and he leaves money to his daughter, Laurel, who works as a designer in Chicago. Becky McKelva Laurel's mother and Clint's first wife. She died before the events in the story occurred, but through the memories of Laurel, she plays a large role at the end of the story. Setting The Optimist's Daughter begins in New Orleans, Louisiana. The beginning of the novel takes place in a hospital in the bustling city during Mardi Gras. After the Judge passes, the majority of the novel is set in Laurel's childhood home, in her father's hometown of Mount Salus, Mississippi.  Symbolism  The most prominent metaphor in The Optimist's daughter is vision. Welty equates the ability to see with the ability to understand. Both of Laurel's parents suffered from failures of vision. Her mother, Becky McKelva slowly loses her vision as she approaches her death, and her father, Judge McKelva dies while attempting to recover from surgery for a detached retina. Additionally, images of vision persist throughout the novel. It not only contains several characters who suffer from blindess or poor vision but also images of vision or the lack of vision. Laurel is constantly noticing curtains, blinds, glasses, and windows. These remind her or her need to understand her present situation and the lack of understanding she has for her stepmother, Fay. Although not physically blind, Fay has poor vision in that she lacks the maturity to understand as is evidenced by her insensitivity towards others.

The main purpose of the vasculum is to transport plants without crushing them and by maintaining a cool, humid environment. Construction Vascula are cylinders typically made from tinned and sometimes lacquered iron, though wooden examples are known. The box was carried horizontally on a strap so that plant specimens lie flat and lined with moistened cloth. Traditionally, British and American vascula were somewhat flat and valise-like with a single room, while continental examples were more cylindrical and often longer, sometimes with two separate compartments. Access to the interior is through one (sometimes two) large lids in the side, allowing plants to be put in and taken out without bending or distorting them unnecessarily. This is particularly important with wildflowers, which are often fragile. Some early 20th century specimen are made from sheet aluminium rather than tin, but otherwise follow the 19th century pattern. The exterior is usually left rough, or lacquered green. History The roots of the vasculum is lost in time, but may have evolved from the 17th century tin candle-box of similar construction. Linnaeus called it a vasculum dilletanum, from Latin vasculum - small container and dilletanum, referring to J.J. Dillenius, Linnaeus' friend and colleague at Oxford Botanic Garden. With rise of botany as a scientific field the mid 18th century, the vasculum became an indispensable part of the botanist's equipment. Together with the screw-down plant press, the vasculum was popularized in Britain by naturalist William Withering around 1770. The shortened term \\"vasculum\\" appear to have become the common name applied to them around 1830. Being a hallmark of field botany, the vascula were in common use until World War II . With post-war emphasis on systematics rather than alpha taxonomy and new species often collected in far-away places, field botany and the vascula with it went into decline. Aluminium vascula are still made and in use, though zipper bags and clear plastic folders are today cheaper and more common in use.

Limb formation begins in the morphogenetic limb field, as mesenchymal cells from the lateral plate mesoderm proliferate to the point that they cause the ectoderm above to bulge out, forming a limb bud. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) induces the formation of an organizer at the end of the limb bud, called the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), which guides further development and controls cell death. Programmed cell death is necessary to eliminate webbing between digits. The limb field is a region specified by expression of certain Hox genes, a subset of homeotic genes, and T-box transcription factors ‚Äì Tbx5 for forelimb or wing development, and Tbx4 for leg or hindlimb development. Establishment of the forelimb field (but not hindlimb field) requires retinoic acid signaling in the developing trunk of the embryo from which the limb buds emerge. Also, although excess retinoic acid can alter limb patterning by ectopically activating Shh or Meis1/Meis2 expression, genetic studies in mouse that eliminate retinoic acid synthesis have shown that RA is not required for limb patterning. The limb bud remains active throughout much of limb development as it stimulates the creation and positive feedback retention of two signaling regions: the AER and its subsequent creation of the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) with the mesenchymal cells. In addition to the dorsal-ventral axis created by the ectodermal expression of competitive Wnt7a and BMP signals respectively, these AER and ZPA signaling centers are crucial to the proper formation of a limb that is correctly oriented with its corresponding axial polarity in the developing organism. Because these signaling systems reciprocally sustain each other‚Äôs activity, limb development is essentially autonomous after these signaling regions have been established. Limb formation Limb bud Limb formation begins in the morphogenetic limb field. Limb formation results from a series of reciprocal tissue interactions between the mesenchyme of the lateral plate mesoderm and the overlying ectodermally derived epithelial cells. Cells from the lateral plate mesoderm and the myotome migrate to the limb field and proliferate to the point that they cause the ectoderm above to bulge out, forming the limb bud. The lateral plate cells produce the cartilaginous and skeletal portions of the limb while the myotome cells produce the muscle components. The lateral plate mesodermal cells secrete fibroblast growth factors (FGF7 and FGF10) to induce the overlying ectoderm to form an organizer at the end of the limb bud, called the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), which guides further development and controls cell death. The AER secretes further growth factors FGF8 and FGF4 which maintain the FGF10 signal and induce proliferation in the mesoderm. The position of FGF10 expression is regulated by two Wnt signaling pathways: Wnt8c in the hindlimb and Wnt2b in the forelimb. The forelimb and the hindlimb are specified by their position along the anterior/posterior axis and possibly by two transcription factors: Tbx5 and Tbx4, respectively.  Precartilage condensations  The limb's skeletal elements are prefigured by tight aggregates known as cellular condensations of the pre-cartilage mesenchymal cells. Mesenchymal condensation is mediated by extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules. In the process of chondrogenesis, chondrocytes differentiate from the condensations to form cartilage, giving rise to the skeletal primordia. In the development of most vertebrate limbs (though not in some amphibians), the cartilage skeleton is replaced by bone later in development.  Periodicities of the limb pattern  Vertebrate limbs are organized into stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod. The limb is organized into three regions: stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod (in order from proximal to distal). The zeugopod and the autopod contain a number of periodic and quasi-periodic pattern motifs. The zeugopod consists of two parallel elements along the anteroposterior axis and the autopod contains 3-5 (in most cases) elements along the same axis. The digits also have a quasi-periodic arrangement along the proximodistal axis, consisting of tandem chains of skeletal elements. The generation of the basic limb plan during development results from the patterning of the mesenchyme by an interplay of factors that promote precartilage condensation and factors that inhibit it. The development of the basic limb plan is accompanied by the generation of local differences between the elements. For example, the radius and ulna of the forelimb, and the tibia and fibula of the hindlimb of the zeugopod are distinct from one another, as are the different fingers or toes in the autopod. These differences can be treated schematically by considering how they are reflected in each of the limb's three main axes. A general consensus is that the patterning of the limb skeleton involves one or more Turing-type reaction‚Äìdiffusion mechanisms. Evolution and development The evolution of limbs from paired fins has been an area of much focus. A reverse study of limb reduction and limb loss in the development of the snake is another active area of research. It has been shown that there are conserved sequences involved in limb development retained in the genome of the snake. It is thought that these limb-enhancer sequences are conserved since there is overlap between those for limb development and those for phallus development (seen as a third type of appendage). This aspect has also been studied in the mouse, where the usual limb-development signalling components are seen to play roles both in the development of the limbs and of the genital tubercle. The study of limb reduction and limb loss is unravelling the genetic pathways that control limb development. The Turing system has enabled a number of possible outcomes in the evolutionary steps of patterning networks.  Axial patterning and related issues  The developing limb has to align itself in relation to three axes of symmetry. These are the craniocaudal (head to tail), dorsoventral (back to front), and proximodistal (near to far) axes. Many investigations into the development of the limb skeletal pattern have been influenced by the positional information concept proposed by Lewis Wolpert in 1971. In tune with this idea, efforts have been made to identify diffusive signaling molecules (morphogens) that traverse orthogonal axes of developing limbs and determine locations and identities of skeletal elements in a concentration-dependent fashion.  Proximodistal patterning  Hox genes contribute to the specification of the stylopod, zeugopod and autopod. Mutations in Hox genes lead to proximodistal losses or abnormalities. Three different models have been advanced for explaining the patterning of these regions.  Progress zone model  The apical ectodermal ridge (AER) creates and maintains a zone of cell proliferation known as the progress zone. It is thought that cells here gain the positional information they need to travel to their destined position. It was proposed that their positional value was determined by the length of time that the cells were in the progress zone but this has yet to be proved (as of 2001). Proximal structures were proposed to be formed by the first cells to leave the zone and distal ones, by cells that left later. The Progress Zone model was proposed 30 years ago but recent evidence has conflicted with this model. Experimental evidence: * Removing the AER at a later period of development results in less disruption of distal structures than if the AER was removed early in development. * Grafting an early limb bud tip onto a late wing results in duplication of structures, while grafting a late wing bud tip onto an early limb results in a deletion of structures.  Early allocation and progenitor expansion model (or prespecification model)  Cells are specified for each segment in the early limb bud and this population of cells expand out as the limb bud grows. This model is consistent with the following observations. Cell division is seen throughout the limb bud. Cell death occurs within a 200 Œºm zone subjacent to the AER when it is removed; cell death forecloses some patterning. FGF- releasing beads are able to rescue limb development when the AER is removed by preventing this cell death. Experimental evidence: * Labeled cells in different position of an early limb bud were restricted to single segments of the limb. * Limbs lacking expression of required FGF4 & FGF8 showed all structures of the limb and not just the proximal parts. More recently, however, the investigators primarily responsible for both the Progress Zone and Prespecification models have acknowledged that neither of these models accounts adequately for the available experimental data.  Turing-type reaction‚Äìdiffusion model  This model, a reaction‚Äìdiffusion model first proposed in 1979, is based on the self-organizing properties of excitable media described by Alan Turing in 1952. The excitable medium is the limb bud mesenchyme, in which cells interact by positively autoregulatory morphogens such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) and inhibitory signaling pathways involving fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Notch signalling. Proximodistal and craniocaudal axes are not considered to be independently specified, but instead emerge by transitions in the number of parallel elements as the undifferentiated apical zone of the growing limb bud undergoes reshaping. This model only specifies a \\"bare bones\\" pattern. Other factors like sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Hox proteins, primary informational molecules in the other models, are proposed instead to play a fine-tuning role. Experimental evidence: *Limb mesenchymal cells, when dissociated and grown in culture or reintroduced within ectodermal \\"hulls\\" can recapitulate essential aspects of pattern formation, morphogenesis and differentiation. *Peculiarities of the limb skeletal pattern in the mouse Doublefoot mutant are predicted outcomes of a Turing-type mechanism. *Progressive reduction in distal Hox genes in a Gli3-null background results in progressively more severe polydactyly, displaying thinner and densely packed digits, suggesting (with the aid of computer modeling) that the dose of distal Hox genes modulates the period or wavelength of digits specified by a Turing-type mechanism. Craniocaudal patterning  Early signals that define the craniocaudal (anterior-posterior), and proximodistal axes in vertebrate limb development. The discovery, in 1957, of the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) in the limb bud provided a model for understanding the patterning activity by the action of a morphogenic gradient of sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh is recognised as a limb-specific enhancer. Shh is both sufficient and necessary to create the ZPA and specify the craniocaudal pattern in the distal limb (Shh is not necessary for the polarity of the stylopod). Shh is turned on in the posterior through the early expression of Hoxd genes, the expression of Hoxb8, and the expression dHAND. Shh is maintained in the posterior through a feedback loop between the ZPA and the AER. Shh induces the AER to produce FGF4 and FGF8 which maintains the expression of Shh. Digits 3,4 and 5 are specified by a temporal gradient of Shh. Digit 2 is specified by a long-range diffusible form of Shh and Digit 1 does not require Shh. Shh cleaves the Ci/Gli3 transcriptional repressor complex to convert the transcription factor Gli3 to an activator which activates the transcription of HoxD genes along the craniocaudal. Loss of the Gli3 repressor leads to the formation of generic (non-individualized) digits in extra quantities.  Dorsoventral patterning  Dorsoventral patterning is mediated by Wnt7a signals in the overlying ectoderm not the mesoderm. Wnt7a is both necessary and sufficient to dorsalize the limb. Wnt7a also influences the craniocaudal and loss of Wnt7a causes the dorsal side of limbs to become ventral sides and causes missing posterior digits. Replacing Wnt7a signals rescues this defect. Wnt7a is also required to maintain expression of Shh. Wnt-7a also causes Lmx-1, a Lim Homebox gene (and thus a transcription factor), to be expressed. Lmx-1 is involved in dorsalisation of the limb, which was shown by knocking out the Lmx-1 gene in mice. The mice lacking the Lmx-1 produced ventral skin on both sides of their paws. There are other factors thought to control the DV patterning; Engrailed-1 represses the dorsalizing effect of Wnt-7a on the ventral side of the limbs.

She was born in London but lived most of her life in Cambridge, including the last 51 years of her life. She was the first woman botanist to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (21 March 1946, at the age of 67) and the third woman overall. She was the first woman to receive the Gold Medal of the Linnean Society of London (24 May 1948, at the age of 69) for her contributions to botanical science. Her scientific research focused on the monocotyledon group of flowering plants. She also contributed to development of morphological studies in botany during the early part of the 20th century. Her later work concentrated on the topic of philosophy in botany, particularly on the nature of biological research. Biography Agnes Arber was born on 23 February 1879 in London. She was the first child of Henry Robert Robertson, an artist, and Agnes Lucy Turner and had three younger siblings, Donald Struan Robertson (who later became Regius Professor of Greek in the University of Cambridge) Janet Robertson, who later became a portrait painter, and Margaret Robertson (married name Hills), who was a noted suffragist and local politician. Her father gave her regular drawing lessons during her early childhood, which later provided her with the necessary skills to illustrate her scientific publications herself.Hanshaw Thomas, H. (1960) \\"Agnes Arber, 1879‚Äì1960 Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society Vol.6 (Nov 1960) At the age of eight Arber began attending the North London Collegiate School founded and run by Frances Buss, one of the leading proponents for girls' education. Under the direction of the school's science teacher Edith Aitken, Arber discovered a fascination with botany, publishing her first piece of research in 1894 in the school's magazine and later coming first in the school's botany examinations, winning a scholarship.Packer, K. (1997) Notes and records on the Royal Society of London Vol.51, No.1 It was here that Arber first met Ethel Sargant, a plant morphologist who gave regular presentations to the school science club. Sargant would later become her mentor and colleague, having a profound influence on Arber's research interests and methods. In 1897 Arber began studying at University College, London, gaining her BSc in 1899. After gaining an entrance scholarship Arber became a member of Newnham College, Cambridge and took a further degree in Natural Sciences. She gained first class results in every examination at both universities, along with several prizes and medals from University College, London. After finishing her Cambridge degree in 1902 Arber worked in the private laboratory of Ethel Sargant for a year, before returning to University College, London as holder of the Quain Studentship in Biology. She was awarded a Doctorate of Science in 1905. Agnes Arber married paleobotanist Edward Alexander Newell Arber (1870‚Äì1918), in 1909 and moved back to Cambridge, where she would remain for the rest of her life. Her only child Muriel Agnes Arber was born in 1913, became a geologist, and died in 2004. Arber and her husband had many interests in common, and her marriage was described as 'happy'. Arber was awarded a Research Fellowship from Newnham College in 1912 and published her first book Herbals, their origin and evolution in the same year. Her husband Newall Arber died in 1918 following a period of ill health. Arber never remarried, but continued with her research. She studied in the Balfour Laboratory for Women from her marriage until the laboratory's closure in 1927. Arber maintained a small laboratory in a back room of her house from then until she stopped performing bench research in the 1940s and turned to philosophical study. Agnes Arber died on 22 March 1960 at the age of 81. Scientific career Early career Before attending University College, London Arber spent the summer of 1897 working with Ethel Sargant in her private laboratory in Reigate, where Sargant instructed her on microtechniques used to prepare plant specimens for microscopic examination. Arber returned to work in Sargant's laboratory at least once during the summer holidays while she was studying at University College London. Sargant employed Arber between 1902 and 1903 as a research assistant working on seedling structures, during which time in 1903 she published her first paper 'Notes on the anatomy of Macrozamia heteromera' in Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Whilst at University College London Arber conducted research on the gymnosperm group of plants, producing several papers on their morphology and anatomy. The study and philosophy of plant morphology would become the central focus of her later work. Balfour Laboratory, Cambridge In 1909 Arber was granted space in the Balfour Laboratory for Women by Newnham College. This building had been purchased and founded by the two women's colleges of the University in 1884 for the use of their students and researchers (women at this time were not permitted to attend laboratory demonstrations and practical classes). Arber worked in the laboratory until its closure in 1927. Following the award of a Research Fellowship by Newnham College between 1912 and 1913 Arber published her first book in 1912. Herbals, their origin and evolution describes the transformation of printed Herbals between 1470 and 1670. Arber links the emergence and development of botany as a discipline within natural history with the evolution of plant descriptions, classifications and identifications seen in Herbals during this period. Arber was able to consult the large collection of printed Herbals in the library of the Botany School at Cambridge as part of her research for this work. It was largely re-written and expanded for a second edition published in 1938, was published as a third edition in 1986 and is still considered the standard work for the history of Herbals. Arber focused her research on the anatomy and morphology of the monocot group of plants, which she had originally been introduced to by Ethel Sargant. By 1920 she had authored two books and 94 other publications. Her second book Water Plants: A Study of Aquatic Angiosperms was published in 1920. In this book Arber presents a comparative study of aquatic plants by analysing differences in their morphology. Arber also provides interpretations of the general principles she used to create her analysis. Her study was the first to provide a general description and interpretation of aquatic plants.Wylie, R.B (1922) 'Review: Biology of Aquatic Plants' Botanical Gazette, Vol.74, No.2 In 1925 Arber published her third book The Monocotyledons. The Editors of the Cambridge Botanical Handbooks series had asked Ethel Sargant in 1910 to prepare a volume on the monocots for this series. However ill-health and advancing years made it almost impossible for Sargant to complete the book, and in 1918 she suggested Arber to complete the work. The Monocotyledons continues Arber's morphological methods of analysis she presented in Water Plants. She provides a detailed study of the monocot plants from comparing their internal and external anatomy. However her discussion of the general principles she uses in her analysis are more explicit in this volume, as she discusses the methods and philosophy of morphological study. Although comparative anatomical analysis as demonstrated in The Monocotyledons and Water Plants: A Study of Aquatic Angiosperms was central to botanical investigation in the early 20th century, there were distinct differences between British and European researchers concerning the aims of morphological study. Arber addressed this by creating a distinction between \\"pure\\" and \\"applied\\" morphology, with her work focusing on comparative anatomy to investigate questions concerning significant topics such as constructing phylogenies, instead of using traditional views of plant structure. This view was further developed in her later work. Later work After the closure of the Balfour Laboratory Arber set up a small laboratory in a back room of her house to conduct her research, after the resident head of the Botany School Professor Albert Charles Seward claimed there was no space in the School for Arber to continue her research using its facilities. Arber had been introduced to the idea of private research from her time spent with Ethel Sargant in 1902‚Äì1903, and from later comments to members of Girton College Natural Sciences club and in letters to friends she stated she liked working at home due to challenges posed by independent research, despite not originally making the choice herself. After the publication of The Monocotyledons Arber continued her research into this group, concentrating her research into the Gramineae family of plants, especially cereals, grasses and bamboo. This led to the publication of her final book concerning plant morphology, The Gramineae in 1934. In this book Arber described the life cycles, embryology and reproductive and vegetative cycles of cereals, grasses and bamboo using comparative anatomical analysis of these plants. Recognising the importance of these plants to the development of human societies, Arber begins this study with the history of these plants in relation to humans, with \\"the more strictly botanical aspect is treated as developing out of the humansistic\\".Arber, A. (1934) The Gramineae The book was preceded by 10 papers in The Annals of Botany detailing the results of her research. Between 1930 and 1942 Arber conducted research into the structure of flowers, where she investigated the structure of many different forms and used morphological information to interpret other flower structures. Her results were published in 10 review papers spanning this period. In 1937 she published a summary of the morphological ideas which had been discussed concerning floral structure, which was considered an important review article for morphological studies. In January 1942 Arber published her last paper involving original botanical research. All of her subsequent publications were entirely concerned with historical and philosophical topics. Philosophical studies During the Second World War Arber found it difficult to maintain her small laboratory, as supplies were becoming more difficult to obtain. This led to her decision to stop performing laboratory work and to concentrate more on philosophical and historical issues. Arber published work on historical botanists, including a comparison between Nehemiah Grew and Marcello Malpighi in 1942, John Ray in 1943 and Sir Joseph Banks in 1945.Flannery, M 'The Many Sides of Agnes Arber' Arber had been introduced to the work of Goethe while at school and remained fascinated by his ideas about botany. In 1946 she published Goethe's Botany, a translation of Goethe's Metamorphosis of Plants (1790) and Georg Christoph Tobler's (1757‚Äì1812) Die Natur with an introduction and interpretation of the texts. The Natural Philosophy of Plant Form, published in 1950 has been considered the most important of Arber's books. It has been described as \\"a magisterial survey of two thousand years of biological tradition\\". Arber discusses the processes behind forming a concept from research and examines the philosophy of plant morphology. Arber uses this to examine the structure of flowering plants, and proposes the partial-shoot theory of the leaf. According to this theory, each element of the plant is a shoot or a partial shoot. Leaves are partial shoots that show reduced growth capacity. She mentions: ‚Äúthe leaf is a partial-shoot, revealing an inherent urge towards becoming a whole shoot, but never actually attaining this goal, since radial symmetry and the capacity for apical growth suffer inhibition‚Äù.Agnes, A. (1950) 'The Natural Philosophy of Plant Form' The parallelism of leaf and shoot dates back to Goethe, who first described compound leaves as in \\"reality branches, the buds of which cannot develop, since the common stalk is too frail\\". For Arber, compound leaves are clusters of united partial-shoots. Recent developmental genetic evidence has supported aspects of the partial shoot-theory of the leaf, especially in the case of compound leaves.Hofer, et al (2001) 'Genetic Control of Leaf Morphology: A Partial View' Annals of Botany Vol. 88 Her studies on the philosophy of plant morphology led her to take a broader view of the links between science and philosophy. The Mind and the Eye: A Biologist's Standpoint published in 1954 provides an introduction to biological research and develops a methodology for performing this research. Arber describes research as taking place in six stages: the identification of research question or topic; the collection of data through experiments or observation; the interpretation of the data; testing the validity of the interpretation; communicating the results; and considering the research in context. For Arber, the context includes interpreting the result in terms of history and philosophy and covers half of the book. Arber's book is distinctive in that it was written before Thomas Kuhn demonstrated that scientist's views are influenced by the views of others in their field and before Ernst Mayr's criticism of describing the philosophy of biology in the same way as the philosophy of physics. Her final book, The Manifold and the One published in 1957 is concerned with wider philosophical questions. The book is a wide-ranging and syncretic survey, drawing on literary, scientific, religious, mystical and philosophical traditions, incorporating Buddhist, Hindu and Taoist philosophy with European philosophy., in pursuit of a discussion of the mystical experience which Arber defines as \\"that direct and unmediated contemplation which is characterised by a peculiarly intense awareness of a Whole as the Unity of all things\\".Arber, A. (1957). The Manifold and the One, p. 14 Legacy A Blue Plaque was installed on her childhood home (9 Elsworthy Terrace, Primrose Hill, London) in 2018.

Solo Colonists Cosmo Yuki Cosmo Yuki is the male lead of Space Runaway Ideon. Originally a teenager who lived on Solo with his archaeologist father, Cosmo is thrust into the role of mecha pilot when the Buff Clan attacked Solo. He is the pilot of the Ideo-Delta/Sol Conver, and the lead pilot of the Ideon in its combined form. Although he has an occasional fight with Bes, Cosmo is a well-respected member of the Solo Ship crew. With half his friends now dead and the situation gradually becoming bleaker, Cosmo's distraught turns into pure rage and determination, becoming the Ide's physical medium for its grim final purpose. With nothing left to lose, Cosmo conducts a last-ditch attack against the Gando Rowa and the Bairaru Jin, resulting in the destruction of the Ideon, Gando Rawa, Solo Ship, and much of the Buff Clan fleet. Cosmo is reunited in spirit form with Kitty Kitten (a rebel who appears in one of the final episodes) and Kasha at the end of Be Invoked. When Kitty goes with another, Cosmo and Kasha head off together into their new eternity. Bes Jordan An Earth soldier stationed on Solo who becomes the captain of the Solo ship after the Buff Clan attack. Although Bes initially piloted the Ideo-Nova/Sol Vainer, he retires from piloting when it becomes apparent that younger pilots have more success with piloting the Ideon. Although he occasionally quarrels with Cosmo and Sheryl, Bes is well liked and respected as the leader of the Solo Ship. Bes develops a crush on Karala immediately upon meeting her and is quick to support her, even early in the series when she is distrusted by others among the Solo Ship's crew. The two eventually fall in love and Karala becomes pregnant with Bes's child, although it is never born due to her death. In the final battle between the surviving Solo colonists and Buff Clan, Bes remains fighting against invading squads of Buff Clan troops on board the Solo Ship. Though shot in the waist and in the neck, gradually bleeding to death, he remains the only person \\"alive\\" on the ship. Shortly after he dies along with everyone else as the Gando Rowa's incredible power destroys the Solo Ship... He is reunited in spirit form with Karala in the end. Their son, Messiah, leads them and the souls of everyone else to a reborn Earth. Kasha Imhof A teenage girl who was friends with Cosmo on Solo, Kasha quickly becomes involved in the fighting when the Buff Clan launch their attack on Solo. Kasha becomes the main pilot of the Ideo-Buster/Sol- Amber. Although a good pilot, Kasha is quite hot tempered and aggressive which can get her in trouble at times. Like Cosmo, she at times conflicts with the opinions on the adults on the ship. She is also one of the people most critical of Karala early in the series. As Ideon draws to a close, Kasha relinquishes her piloting duties of the Ideo-Buster to Deck so she can remain aboard the Solo Ship and protect Karala. During an intense exchange of fire between the Solo Ship's crew and the Buff Clan, Kasha meets her fate after shrapnel from an explosion tears into her. After the final invocation, Kasha's spirit sees Cosmo reawaken with Kitty Kitten; after Kitty heads with another, Kasha and Cosmo head off together into eternity. Sheryl Formosa A linguistic scholar who had been investigating the Sixth Civilization on the Planet Solo. Sheryl's primary interest is studying the Ide, the mysterious energy source that powers both the Ideon and the Solo Ship. She becomes quite obsessed with it at times, which leads to conflicts between her, Bes, Cosmo and Kasha. Sheryl also conflicts with Karala early in the series. Nonetheless, Sheryl is a valuable crew member who is always willing to put herself in dangerous situations to find the answers to her questions. In the latter part of the series Sheryl befriends Buff Clan defector Gije Zaral, who shares a similar interest in the Ide. The two fall in love, but Gije is killed on the Planet Steckin Star in the second to last episode. This, combined with the murder of her younger sister Lin on the planet Ajian cause Sheryl to spiral into a state of despair and alcoholism followed by psychosis. In order to draw out the full potential of the Ide, Sheryl carries the infant Piper Lou onto the deck of the Solo Ship while the Ideon is fighting off both the Buff Clan and a large comet. Sheryl in grief, \\"invokes\\" the Ide to show its true power by putting Piper Lou in mortal danger, taunting the invisible force if its strength comes from the suffering of the innocent. She receives her answer when the Ideon fires its Wave Leader Gun. The resulting shock wave from the blast kills her instantly, hurling her shattered body into space, though Lou survives the blast. As she dies, Gije pulls Sheryl's spirit out of her body, reuniting them prior to the final cataclysms of Be Invoked. Hatari Naburu A pilot who survives the Buff Clan attack on New Lopia in the second episode and is one of the refugees who boards the Solo ship. Hatari becomes a subordinate and confidante of Bes, even taking control of the Solo ship's operations when Bes became ill. During the final battle with the Buff Clan in Be Invoked, Hatari manages to warp the Solo ship to the Buff Clan's mothership, the Gando Rowa. Sadly enough, he was shot in the side of the head and chest in the crossfire between the colonists and Buff Clan troopers aboard the bridge. Deck Afta A boy who is a friend of Cosmo's and Kasha's on Solo. He's generally seen with Rapappa, a tame two-tailed squirrel perched on his shoulder. Although just a young kid, Deck desires to become a pilot of the Ideon and when Cosmo sees how dedicated he is to it, he allows Deck to become his co-pilot on the Ideo-Delta. As expected for his age, Deck is immature at times but for the most part gets along with everyone though gradually as the series progresses he begins to prove himself as a pilot, establishing himself as a predominant role in controlling the Ideon. Deck is vaporized instantly from the blast resulting in the final battle between the Ideon and the Gando Rowa. He is reunited with the other children at the end of Be Invoked. Strangely, and harshly, enough, Rapappa's spirit form is never seen at the end of the film. Joliver Ira The engineer of the Solo Ship. At first and throughout the series he doesn't put too much trust in Karala, but during the movie Be Invoked he admits to having some love interest towards her. This is further proved after he protected Karala from her father Doba, sustaining a sword wound to the back, and dying later as he assisted the Ideon during the final battle. After the final invocation, Joliver surprisingly ends up with Haruru's subordinate Kilaru in the new universe. Moera Fatima A member of the Solo Ship's crew, who serves as the main pilot for the Ideo Nova for the majority of the series. He is romantically involved with the ship's doctor, Rapoh. He is also seen chastising Fard on several occasions for his wimpy behavior, encouraging him to stand up for himself and become a man. He is eventually killed during a battle against the Buff Clan, and his duties as the pilot of the Ideo Nova are passed on to Gije. Banda Lotta A teenage girl from the planet Solo who becomes one of the civilian refugees aboard the Solo Ship. Lotta's primary role aboard the ship is taking care of the young children along with Lin. Lotta becomes upset with Karala and attempts to kill her since she is of the Buff Clan (in the movie version she kills Karala's servant Mayaya), although in the end she is unable to do it. In the movie Be Invoked Lotta stands a sentry when Harulu Ajiba and her bodyguards, Torolof and Kilarul, board the Solo Ship in a chaotic battle. Lotta kills Torolof with a rocket launcher and is shot to death by Kilarul promptly. She is reunited in spirit form with Lin Formosa at the end of the film. Fard Malaka One of the children on the Solo Ship. He is the most timid of the children and is scolded by Moera for not toughening up. He is killed in the final battle against the Buff Clan - the only time he decides to become brave and face the enemy. He is shot by one of the Buff Clan soldiers. However, it is left to the audience on whether or not he dies before the Solo ship explodes as he can be seen breathing after being shot. Fard is reunited with Ashura and Deck in spirit form at the end of Be Invoked. Ashura Novak One of the young children aboard the Solo Ship. Ashura's parents were killed in the attack on New Lopia. She is the leader of the kids, and is often seen leading Fard and Piper Lou in various activities. She doesn't understand very much the things that happen around her, but is often happy to help with any minor duties on the ship. She is killed in the final battle against the Buff Clan, when a blast of gunfire decapitates her. Piper Lou A baby who is one of the refugees on the Solo Ship. As the youngest member of the Solo Ship crew, Lou is critical to controlling the Ide, which responds with more power to young children like Lou. In fact the Ideon displays greater powers almost every time Lou is brought aboard. The Ide protects Lou and the children for they are of a new generation - representing the general innocence of children. As the series draws to a close and the true nature of the Ide becomes apparent, his survival becomes more critical to those aboard the Solo Ship. In Be Invoked, Lou is nearly killed when Sheryl carries him onto the deck of the Solo Ship, hoping to draw out further power from the Ideon. When the power of a blast from the Wave Leader Gun knocks him and Sheryl off the ship, Sheryl is killed, but Lou is protected by the Ide and returned to the ship. It is revealed that Lou and Karala's unborn child \\"Messiah\\" share a profound empathic connection, triggering enormous outputs of the Ide. Although he is the only character in Ideon to be spared a death sequence, Lou is killed when the Solo Ship is destroyed in the final battle. Lou and Messiah lead the spirits of both races into the reborn universe. Lin Formosa Sheryl's younger sister, who is often seen taking care of the children along with Lotta. She is killed in episode 37 of the series, while being held hostage by the colonists on planet Ajian, led by the unstable Commodore. She is shot dead as a demonstration that her captors are serious about killing the hostages unless the Solo Ship and Ideon are surrendered to the Buff Clan. Her death is avenged by Sheryl, who proceeds to gunning down Commodore. Lin is reunited spiritually with Banda Lotta at the end of Be Invoked. Rapoh Famu The medic of the Solo Ship whose love interest is Moera. Along with Moera, Rapoh acts as a parental figure to the orphaned Fard. She is one of the last to die after being shot by a Buff Clan soldier in the final battle with the Buff Clan in Be Invoked. She's last seen in spirit form, clinging on hysterically to a reluctant Moera as they follow everyone to the reborn universe. Bento Malus The co-pilot for the Ideo-Nova. Bento is killed when the Ideon is hit with the first blast from the Gando Rowa. Tekuno Gyabari The co-pilot for the Ideo-Buster. Tekuno is killed in the final battle when the Ideon is destroyed. Rouri Yuki Cosmo father who is the creator of the Ide's Giant God. He is killed in ep 1 during an collapsed bulldozer. Professor Formosa Sheryl and Lin father and an very great professor to test the Ide's capabilities, He is killed by an Rock, That is the choice when the Solo Colonists evacuated by the dangerous Buff Clan, Buff Clan  Karala Ajiba Karala is the female lead in Space Runaway Ideon. She is the youngest daughter of Doba Ajiba, Supreme Commander of the Buff Clan military. While investigating the Ide, Karala heads down to the planet Solo against orders and becomes stranded there. After her alien origins are discovered she is held captive on the Solo Ship, but her good hearted nature leads her to becoming a regular crew member on the Solo Ship despite her alien origins. Although early in the series the Buff Clan constantly tries to rescue her, she becomes known as a traitor to the Buff Clan for associating with the Earthlings. The one who despises her the most is her own sister, Harulu. Karala and Bes fall in love and near the end of the series Karala becomes pregnant with Bes's child, who is proclaimed 'Messiah' by Cosmo and Kasha. Messiah is seen as the key to controlling the Ide and defending the Solo Ship against the Buff Clan, perhaps as well bringing a possible future peace between both races. However, when Harulu boards the Solo Ship during a battle, she confronts Karala only to then shoot her sister three times in the face. Despite her tragic demise, Karala and Messiah remain as a strange ethereal influence as the carnage between the Buff Clan and Solo Ship rages onwards. Gije Zaral The commander of the initial Buff Clan search expedition that discovered the planet Solo. Gije is a friend and former fiance of Karala's, and hence is gravely concerned with her safety after she heads to the planet Solo. Initially he leads multiple operations to rescue Karala, and is later sent by Harulu to the Buff Clan homeworld to perform further study of the Ide. After failing once again with the Buff Clan military, Gije is enlisted in the Ome Foundation, a private corporation that also seeks to capture the Ideon. After multiple battles in which he fails to defeat the Ideon, Gije is abandoned on the moon, but he sneaks aboard the Solo Ship during a battle. He befriends Sheryl, who shares a similar interest in the Ide, and the two eventually fall in love. Although initially viewed as untrustworthy, Gije eventually becomes an official member of the Solo Ship crew and pilots the Ideo-Nova after the death of its pilot, Moera. Gije is killed in a battle with the Buff Clan on the planet Steckin Star in episode 38 of the television series. In Be Invoked, Gije's spirit pulls Sheryl's spirit from her body after she is killed in her foolish attempt to use Piper Lou to invoke the Ide, allowing for them to spend eternity together. Harulu Ajiba The elder sister of Karala, and daughter of Doba, Supreme Commander of the Buff Clan military. A high-ranking member of the Buff Clan military, Harulu leads the pursuit of the Solo Ship and Ideon for much of the first half of the series. She views her younger sister as a traitor to the Buff Clan and despises her. Harulu's former lover was Daram Zuba and while she doesn't seem to pleased with him in their sole meeting in the series, she mourns his death and even goes as far to have a Buff Clan officer assassinated when she laughs at a video of him. When Harulu discovers that Karala is pregnant with a baby that is the key to controlling the Ide, she personally leads a team into the Solo Ship, where she murders Karala. Her father Doba gives her command of the entire Buff Clan army, but in the battle she is killed by a blast from the Ideon's Wave Leader Gun. Doba Ajiba Supreme Commander of the Buff Clan military. Doba is the father of both Karala and Harulu. Like Harulu, Doba despises Karala for abandoning the Buff Clan and doesn't care whether she lives or dies. Although he is largely absent for most of the TV series (appearing in only 3 episodes), he comes out of the woodwork near the end after his underlings repeatedly fail to defeat the Ideon. Doba commands the Buff Clan forces from his flagship, the Bairal Jin. Intent on not only defeating the Ideon, but also taking complete control of the Buff Clan, Doba conspires with Gindoro Jinmu of the Ome Foundation to overthrow the Buff Clan Emperor, Zuou Habel Gande, when the battle is over. This becomes meaningless however when the Buff Clan home planet is destroyed by a meteor shower. Doba is eventually killed by his own soldiers when he makes it clear that the Ideon must be defeated, even if it results in the death of the majority of the Buff Clan. Oddly enough, Doba is paired up spiritually with Emperor Zuou at the end of Be Invoked. Damido Pechi One of the officers in charge of the initial expedition that results in the discovery of the Planet Solo. Damido is a colleague of Gije's and along with him pursues Karala early in the series. Damido is much more aggressive than Gije and appears to be more concerned with wiping out the enemy than rescuing Karala. He is put out of commission for a while after a battle with the Ideon, but when he returns he takes the opportunity to immediately strike the Ideon again. His battle ends in failure yet again, and he perishes in this battle. In the movie version Damido has a much smaller role and is killed in the initial battle on Solo. After the final invocation, he is paired with Mayuyu. Daram Zuba An officer in the Ome Foundation who was also a former lover of Harulu. Daram assists Harulu after her Dorowa Zan is destroyed in a fight against the Solo Ship. He also leads the pursuit of the Solo Ship on the planet Kyaral, and later to the Earth sphere. Daram betrays Gije by abandoning him on the moon, frustrated with his constant failure to defeat the Ideon. Gije gets his revenge by shooting Daram in the head during a duel with Cosmo on the Earth. In the movie version Daram is not a member of the Ome Foundation, but rather a member of the regular Buff Clan military. In the movie, A Contact, he died alternatively when his ship was blown up by the Ideon swords. Daram is reunited in spirit form with Harulu at the end of Be Invoked. Gindoro Jinmu Leader of the Ome Foundation, a private corporation that conspired with Doba to overthrow the Buff Clan Emperor. Gindoro teams up with Doba at the end of the series after the Ome Foundation fails to defeat the Ideon. After the Emperor's death he remains with Doba for a period of time, but then requests to return to the Buff Clan homeworld, unaware that their home planet was actually destroyed. With the battle escalating, Gindoro tries to flee and argues with Doba, which results in him being killed. His spirit talks to Doba shortly after his death. Zou Habel Gande Grand Emperor of the Buff Clan. For reasons never explained, Doba desired to overthrow him. A very minor character who only appeared in one episode of the original TV series, Zou is killed when meteors destroy the Buff Clan homeworld. Abadede Gurimade The initial commander of the Buff Clan investigation of Logo Dau (Solo) in the initial episodes and the main commander watching over Karala, Mayuyu, Gije and Damido. Has a wife and child who he wishes to return home to. Ultimately is killed on planet Crystal Star, which he was forced to return to in pursuit of the Ideon after a previous expedition lead to the destruction of his entire crew. In the end complained that he merely got a \\"fools death\\" for ironically returning and being killed by the inhabitant creatures on this world.  Guhaba Geba A subordinate of Harulu who was ordered by her to humiliate Karala when she reunited with her sister. He dies piloting a Zigg Mack in episode 14, trying to defeat the Ideon. Doku Jilbal  Rukuku Kil An officer in the Buff Clan military, with loyalties to the Emperor. She is sent to the Earth sphere to defeat the Solo Ship and Ideon after the Ome Foundation fails to do so. As a member of the military, she is rather arrogant towards Daram, but nonetheless allows him to fight under her command. Harulu sends an underling, Kulara Kina to spy on her and when she find an old video of Daram and laughs at it, Harulu has her assassinated. Hannibal Gen Other characters  Kitty Kitten A teenage girl who Cosmo meets on the colony planet of Kyaral. Kitten is responsible for taking care of many of the orphaned children on her planet. She desires for the Solo Ship to leave their planet so the Buff Clan will leave them alone, but decides to help Cosmo and the others in their quest for supplies. She and Cosmo become good friends and Cosmo falls in love with her. Kitten is killed when she is shot by Daram Zuba, who had fled to Kyaral in an escape pod after a battle with the Ideon. In the movie version she dies when she is decapitated in an explosion. Her death greatly traumatizes Cosmo. Marshall Franklin  Commodore The leader of the planet Ajian after it is devastated by the Buff Clan's Light Speed Missiles. Commodore blames the Solo Ship for this occurrence and teams up with Guldabra Dron of the Buff Clan when the Solo Ship returns to Ajian. He tricks Bes and the others when they arrive and takes hostages of all the civilians on the ship; killing Lin when Bes and the others don't immediately surrender. When Bes and the others arrive to rescue the hostages, Sheryl steals Bes's gun and shoots him. Gije puts him out of his misery. Camyula Lanban A female officer in the military base Braziller. She is the woman who calms Cosmo down after a fight with the Buff Clan. Camyula Lanban's personality traits and looks remind Cosmo of his mother. Her death motivates Cosmo's urge to fight. Messiah The hybrid unborn child of Bes Jordan and Karala Ajiba. Messiah's existence is revealed when Karala and Joliver are transported by the Ide to the flagship of her father Doba Aijba; the Bairaru Jin. When she announces that she is pregnant with Bes's child, the series of events that unfold will lead to \\"Be Invoked\\"s tragic ending. Even though in the womb, Messiah demonstrates enormous influence over the Ide such as producing miniature protective fields around his mother and anything within its range, and is capable of communicating with Piper Lou in a manner of telepathy. Such abilities lead to Cosmo and Kasha dubbing the child \\"Messiah\\", as it seems he and Piper Lou could be the trumpcards in manifesting, if not controlling the Ide's true strength. Messiah seems to also represent a possibility of peace between the Terrans and the Buff Clan, but his mother's death at the hands of his aunt prevent his physical birth from ever becoming a reality. After the destruction of the universe, Messiah spiritually leads the survivors of both races onwards to enlightenment, as their naked souls all collectively join to be \\"reborn\\" and witness the creation of a new universe.

She was one of the first four life peers appointed under the Life Peerages Act 1958. She was President of the British Sociological Association from 1959 to 1964.  Early life  Wootton was born Barbara Adam in Cambridge. She had two older brothers. Her father, James Adam (1860‚Äì1907) was a classicist and tutor at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Her mother, Adele Marion, was a fellow of Girton College, Cambridge. Wootton was educated at the Perse School for Girls. She studied Classics and Economics at Girton College, Cambridge from 1915 to 1919, winning the Agnata Butler Prize in 1917. Wootton gained a first class in her final exams, but as a woman she was prevented from appending BA to her name.A. H. Halsey, ‚ÄòWootton , Barbara Frances, Baroness Wootton of Abinger (1897‚Äì1988)‚Äô, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009 accessed 23 Oct 2017  Professional life   Inter- war period  On leaving Cambridge Wootton moved to the London School of Economics to take up a research studentship. In 1920 she took up a fellowship at Girton College. She was appointed Director of Studies and Lecturer in Economics in the college. During this time the board of economics invited her to lecture on economics and the state. She left Girton to take up a post as a research officer at the TUC jointly with the Labour Party Research Department. She worked for the next four years on workers educational issues, such as adult literacy. From 1926 she was principal of Morley College for Working Men and Women in the Yorkshire clothier districts. The following year she returned to London to a promotion as Director of Studies for Tutorials at the University of London. In the 1930s Wootton was a member of the Federal Union and represented the Union in a historic debate against Edgar Hardcastle of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, which was later published as a pamphlet. She served on the Royal Commission investigating workmen's compensation schemes (1938‚Äì44).  Second World War  During the Second World War Wootton considered herself to be a conscientious objector, although she was never liable for military service. She was, however, required, under the Registration for Employment Order 1941, to be interviewed in 1943 by a National Service Officer of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, who deemed her service as an unpaid magistrate to be of sufficient value as not to require direction to any employment. With her agreement, her husband, George Wright, registered as a conscientious objector in 1941, and did farm work and later civil defence work.  Post-war  Wootton served as a chairman of juvenile court magistrates in London for nearly 20 years (1946‚Äì62), and as a lay magistrate (1926‚Äì70).Wootton B. 'Children in trouble', The Observer, 19 August 1965, p. 8. In 1948 she became a professor at Bedford College of the University of London. In 1952 she received a Nuffield Foundation Research Fellowship. In 1952, she transferred within the university to take up a Nuffield Research Fellowship at Bedford College. She did extensive research into the pathological effects of social research and their economic benefits. The findings were published in Wootton's Social Science and Social Pathology in 1959. Wootton was governor of the BBC from 1950 to 1956. She also served on two major post-war Royal Commissions on the press and civil service. In 1968, she was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath.Honorary Graduates 1966 to 1988 University of Bath In 1969 she was made an honorary fellow of Girton College. In 1977 she was made a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH). In 1985 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge. In 1984 she was chosen as one of six women for the BBC 2 series Women of Our Century. She was created a life peer on 8 August 1958 with the title Baroness Wootton of Abinger, of Abinger Common in the County of Surrey, on the advice of Harold Macmillan and was thereby one of the first women to sit in the House of Lords; she also became the first woman to sit on the Woolsack as a Deputy Speaker. She was the chairperson of the Wootton Report. She also supported the Sexual Offences Act 1967 which partially decriminalised male homosexuality. In 1960, she wrote an article for the New Statesman on women's social position in Britain, reviewing and commenting on Joan Barnes's pamphlet \\"A Woman's Place: Wider Horizons\\". Wootton observed that \\"[much] indeed has been accomplished. In nearly every sphere of public activity the sex which constitutes the majority of the population is now at least a visible minority. But almost always a minority ... Contemporary discriminations are of a subtler order ‚Äì and for that reason more difficult to deal with.\\" She conceded that \\"[mathematical] equality of the sexes in public and professional life cannot, of course, be expected\\", but proposed that men and women share more domestic responsibilities: \\"Here then is where the next revolution is needed ... [in] all social classes the role of fathers ... no longer ends with wiping up. In more and more homes father at least occasionally baths the children or takes them out on Saturdays or Sundays ... I can see no reason why we should not travel much further along this road ‚Äì almost, if not quite, as far as the point at which everything that can be shared is shared.\\" Although such a change would necessitate \\"great reorganisations ... in working hours and arrangements in the industrial and professional worlds ... greater social changes than this have happened before.\\" This hope for (nearly) equal sharing of domestic labor is still unrealized in Britain nearly 60 years later. Ethically, she was a supporter of utilitarianism. She supported the Incurable Patients Bill in the 1970s which would have allowed doctor-assisted suicide. Her views on abortion which were pro-life but without any religious basis led her to be removed from her position as vice-president of the British Humanist Association.  Publications  Wootton wrote several books on economic and sociological subjects, including Lament for Economics (1938), End Social Inequality (1941), Freedom Under Planning (1945), Social Science and Social Pathology (1959), Crime and the Criminal Law (1964) and Incomes Policy (1974). In Crime and the Criminal Law she controversially advocated that all crimes ought to be crimes of strict liability (see Elliott, C. & Quinn, F. 2010. Criminal Law. 8th ed. Essex: Pearson Education Ltd). In other words, it was her contention that mens rea ‚Äì the 'guilty mind' ‚Äì should not be taken into account. This would remove the burden from the prosecution of proving intent or recklessness.  Personal life  One of her brothers, Captain Arthur Innes Adam, was killed in France on 16 September 1916 and another brother, Neil Kensington Adam, became a noted chemist. In 1917, she married John \\"Jack\\" Wootton. They had thirty-six hours together as husband and wife, before she saw him off to France. He was wounded during World War I and died weeks after their marriage. In 1935 Wootton married George Wright, a colleague in adult education and London government. Despite Wright's infidelity, the couple remained married until his death from cancer in 1964. The couple had no children. Wootton died in a care home in Surrey on 11 July 1988, aged 91.

He was charged in 1987 and acquitted in 1990. Early life Finta was born in Kolozsv√°r (modern-day Cluj-Napoca, Romania). He studied law at a university in Szeged in the 1930s. In 1935 he enrolled at the Royal Hungarian Military Academy. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Hungarian Gendarmerie on January 1, 1939, and was promoted to the rank of captain on April 5, 1942. Imre Finta was a commander of the Gendarmerie in Szeged, Hungary, during the Second World War. He immigrated to Canada in 1948 and settled in Toronto in 1953, where he bought a restaurant. He later operated a catering business. Finta became a Canadian citizen in 1956. During the late 1970s Finta worked at Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville Ontario. War crimes prosecution He was accused of committing manslaughter, kidnapping, unlawful confinement and robbery in relation to his alleged activities as a police officer assisting the Nazis in the forced deportation of 8,617 Jews from Szeged during the Holocaust. Finta was defended by lawyers Doug Christie and Barbara Kulaszka and was supported by far-right figures such as Ernst Z√ºndel. Finta's defence argued that he had only been following orders and was only responsible for transporting Jews. Finta was acquitted after a six-month jury trial. The acquittal was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1992 and the Supreme Court of Canada in 1993, where he was acquitted the year later. Justice Peter Cory, writing on behalf of the Supreme Court, said \\"Even where the orders are manifestly unlawful, the defence of obedience to superior orders and the peace-officer defence will be available in those circumstances where the accused had no moral choice as to whether to follow the order.\\" The decision brought to an end prosecutions under Canada's nascent war crimes legislation. Thereafter, the government attempted to deal with alleged war criminals by stripping them of their Canadian citizenship and deporting them to the country in which the alleged crime occurred. Holocaust survivor Sabina Citron prevailed in a civil lawsuit for libel against Finta, after Finta called her a liar for saying he had committed war crimes. Death On December 1, 2003, Finta died in his sleep at a nursing home in Toronto, Ontario.

It lies along the A6033 Keighley to Littleborough road in the Walsden Valley, a branch of the Upper Calder Valley, and is south of Todmorden and north of Littleborough. Overview Walsden railway station, on the Leeds-Todmorden-Manchester line, originally opened in 1841 and re-opened 10 September 1990, having been closed for almost 30 years. The canal and A6033 between the former Bird in'th Hand pub and the Bellholme football pitches was also the only place to be bombed in Todmorden during the Blitz; the blasts breached the Rochdale Canal and broke a water main on Rochdale Road. Multiple small craters can still be picked out on both hillsides, one of which contains the Summit Tunnel trans-Pennine railway line, which may have been an alternative target for a raid primarily aimed at the Manchester area; its easterly Yorkshire end is less than ¬º mile away. The road was quickly repaired, the canal was shored up with earth from the former floodplain of Walsden Water (which is why the pitches are above the natural ground level) and the whole bombing incident was hushed up. Walsden was originally administered by Rochdale corporation in the county palatine of Lancashire, hence some of the local historical archives are held by Rochdale MBC. The village sits wholly within West Yorkshire with boundaries to Greater Manchester (south by southwest) and Lancashire (west by northwest) Although Walsden is the common name given to the area it is made up of numerous hamlets (as is commonplace to the region). Warland, Bellhome, Bottomley, Lanebottom, Deanroyd, Bottoms, Allescholes, Birkswood, Ramsden, Henshaw, Hollins and Copprashouse are all part of what is now generally referred to as Walsden. Governance Walsden is a village in the civil parish of Todmorden and the Todmorden ward of Calderdale, a metropolitan borough within the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire in England. Etymology Walsden's name is of Anglo- Saxon origin meaning \\"Valley of Foreigner\\" or \\"Valley of he who is Foreign\\". Foreign refers to the Celtic Britons who lived in West Yorkshire at the time of the Anglo Saxon Petty Kingdoms. Thus, it has the same root as Wales and as Wallonia in Belgium. It has been said in the past that it comes from \\"Wolves' Den\\", this is dismissed as a folk etymology. Sport Walsden has a cricket club that plays in the major Lancashire Leagues.

The cell stains basophilic upon H&E; staining due to the large proportion of rough endoplasmic reticulum in its cytoplasm. Gastric chief cells are generally located deep in the mucosal layer of the stomach lining. Chief cells release the zymogen (enzyme precursor) pepsinogen when stimulated by a variety of factors including cholinergic activity from the vagus nerve and acidic condition in the stomach. Gastrin and secretin may also act as secretagogues. It works in conjunction with the parietal cell, which releases gastric acid, converting the pepsinogen into pepsin. Nomenclature The terms chief cell and zymogenic cell are often used without the word \\"gastric\\" to name this type of cell.

It forms a critical link in the chain of interconnected Himalayan ecosystems, where altitudinal connectivity between the habitat types is important for ecosystem function.

The Himalayas capture moisture from the monsoons that sweep in from the Bay of Bengal, and most of this rainfall is expended in the eastern Himalayas.

Flora The ecoregion hosts a broad range of plant communities, based on its complex topography, differing soils, and variations in rainfall from the drier west to the more humid east. Its location on the south slope of the Himalaya allows the intermingling of plants and animals from the Indomalayan and Palearctic biogeographic realms. The main forest types include Dodonaea scrub, subtropical dry evergreen forests of Olea cuspidata, northern dry mixed deciduous forests, dry Siwalik sal (Shorea robusta) forests, moist mixed deciduous forests, subtropical broadleaf wet hill forests, northern tropical semi-evergreen forests, and northern tropical wet evergreen forests. Fauna Several mammals native to the ecoregion are threatened, including the Bengal tiger, Indian elephant, smooth-coated otter, clouded leopard, gaur, Sumatran serow, Irrawaddy squirrel, and particoloured flying squirrel. The endemic golden langur is distributed in a small range and limited to the broadleaf forest north of the Brahmaputra River. The bird fauna is very rich with more than 340 species. The chestnut-breasted partridge is endemic; the globally threatened white-winged wood duck and five hornbill species are found here. Protected areas Eight protected areas extend into this ecoregion covering , which is about 7% of the ecoregion's area: *in India: Sohagi Barwa Sanctuary and Valmiki National Park; *in Nepal: Bardia National Park, Chitwan National Park, Parsa National Park; *in Bhutan: Royal Manas National Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary.

The similar Carle Tower is situated southeast just above Wandley Gill, Carlesmoor Sighting Tower is a further east and another sighting tower to the north is long since gone having been constructed of wood. The Greygarth Monument is also in the area, commemorating Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. Erection The sighting towers were erected to conduct surveys (the steep-sided valley of Dallowgill was once a proposed reservoir site) and as references for construction of the pipeline over hill and dale toward Harrogate. The pipe begins at the bottom of a small catchments reservoir above Spout Gill Farm and flows to Roundhill Reservoir, where it meets with the dam overflow pipe that runs to Carlesmoor and empties into the River Laver. Reservoirs The reservoirs were built by the Harrogate Water Corporation between 1895 and 1911. The Leeds Corporation explored construction of another reservoir to the north-west in Colsterdale but the proposal was rejected due to concerns over lead and coal mines in the area. The narrow-gauge Colsterdale Waterworks Light Railway built in 1901 as a supply line from Masham to Roundhill Reservoir closed in 1926 and was removed in 1932 (after being used during World War I for troop transport to the Leeds Pals camp at Breary Banks just north of Leighton) but is still evident on the south side of the dale.

History  Miller intended the album to be \\"a more straightforward, singles-based record\\" than its predecessor, Lolita Nation: In a review of the 2017 reissue, PopMatters wrote that the album \\"point[ed] forward towards what would, by 1993, become fashionable under the 'alternative' label. One can hear echoes of Game Theory's trailblazing in many of the bands that enjoyed success in the early '90s, including Belly and, especially, Smashing Pumpkins.\\" After the group was disbanded in 1990, leader Scott Miller went on to form The Loud Family. Game Theory would not release another album until Supercalifragile came out in 2017, four years after Miller's death.  Songs  The title of the song \\"Room For One More, Honey,\\" is a reference to an episode of the American television program The Twilight Zone titled Twenty Two. The album's title has at least a double meaning (referring to both dance steps from the historical period known as the Middle Ages as well as to a person who is \\"two steps\\" from middle age) and comes from an alternating rhyme in the fifth track: > Unfolding their defense in stages > Harshest critics can't refuse > Two steps from the middle ages > Rose details and ruby shoes In 2012, the song \\"Rolling with the Moody Girls\\" was covered by Home Blitz on their EP Frozen Track.

She won 13 battle honours, a record only exceeded by one other ship, and matched by two others.

The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships' complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men for the Captain (D) and his staff.Whitley, p. 99 The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four twin-gun mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II \\"pom-pom\\" AA gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun.Hodges, pp. 13‚Äì25 The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self- defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships;Hodges, pp. 30‚Äì31, 40 Twenty depth charges were the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.English, p. 15 Wartime modifications Heavy losses to German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals' anti-aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace 'X' mount with two QF Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a twin-gun mount. To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified to accept a Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later.Friedman, p. 34; Hodges, pp. 41‚Äì42 To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast was reduced to a short pole mast.Whitley, p. 116 Construction and career Nubian was in home waters for the early part of the Second World War, and saw action with the Home Fleet during the Norwegian Campaign in May 1940. Following this, Nubian joined 14th Destroyer Flotilla at Plymouth, which was led by Captain P J Mack (temporarily flying his pennant in , whilst has own ship, , was undergoing repair). Also in the 14th Destroyer Flotilla were (another of the Tribal class), and (another J-class destroyer). The flotilla left Plymouth for Alexandria on 18 May 1940, in company with 4 K-class destroyers from the 5th Destroyer Flotilla en route for service in the Red Sea; they arrived in Alexandria on 25 May, just two weeks days before hostilities with Italy commenced on 11 June 1940. Nubian saw much action, being involved in the actions at Calabria, in July 1940, Matapan (March 1941), Sfax (April), and finally Crete (May). During the battle of Cape Matapan, she delivered the coup de grace to the , stricken by an aerial torpedo. Nubian off Malta, 1943 During the battle of Crete, on 26 May, Nubian was bombed and had her stern blown off, with the loss of 7 of her crew killed, and another 12 wounded. Despite further attacks, she was able to return to Alexandria under escort, but departed there on 12 June under tow for extensive repairs in Bombay, which were not completed for another 18 months. Nubian returned to the Mediterranean and the 14th Destroyer Flotilla in November 1942, seeing action with them against the convoy on 2 December and off Tripoli in company with Jervis on 20‚Äì21 December. In 1943, she was involved with supporting the landings in Sicily, and at Salerno, before returning to Britain for reassignment to the Arctic. While in the Arctic she conducted convoy escort duty, during which she was involved in at least one direct attack on a U-boat, a cat and mouse hunt which lasted some days. She also tracked at least 11 other U-boats that twice attacked the convoy she was shadowing. During operations conducted in the Arctic, she dispatched back to Norway on two vital operations. These were a strike on the German submarine base at Trondheim Fjord, and a strike on the German battleship at Alton Fjord. At the end of 1944, Nubian was refitted, ready to be dispatched to the Far East in March 1945 as part of the escort force of the 21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron, seeing action in support of the closing operations in Burma.

Harkey Jr. (January 15, 1918 - October 8, 2006) was an author of books, professor of journalism, and editor and publisher of the Pascagoula, Mississippi Chronicle-Star from 1951 to 1963. Harkey was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in 1963 for his anti-segregation editorials during the civil rights crisis surrounding the admission of James Meredith, a black man, to the University of Mississippi at Oxford, Mississippi in 1962. Life Ira Harkey was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, son of a wealthy businessman. He graduated from Tulane University, where he was a brother with the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Tau Lambda chapter), with an undergraduate degree in journalism in 1941 and then served aboard the aircraft carrier USS Hancock (CV-19) in the Pacific theater during World War II. After the war Harkey worked as a reporter for the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper. Harkey purchased the Chronicle-Star in 1949. He immediately began making changes to how the paper wrote about the people who lived in Jackson County, Mississippi. At the time it was newspaper style convention to refer to white men and women with the \\"Mr.\\" or \\"Mrs.\\" honorific but this courtesy was never extended to blacks. Harkey eliminated the honorific entirely. He also eliminated what was then common practice in Southern newspapers to identify the subjects of an article, if they were black, with the term \\"colored\\". Under Harkey's direction a subject's race was only ever mentioned when it was material to the news, such as a physical description of a fugitive. These were subtle but revolutionary changes which inflamed the local community with scandal and controversy. He published many editorials and the Chronicle Star became known as the one paper that would publish opinions opposed to Ross Barnett. In December 1962, he published a series of five articles titled The Oxford Disaster...Price of Defiance by Pascagoula lawyer and state legislator Karl Wiesenburg which showed Barnett had no legal basis for his actions. During the course of his ownership of the Chronicle-Star, Harkey's home was subject to a burning cross on the lawn of his home, and a shot was fired at the Chronicle- Star office.

She has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name Matabele, which in common with the other ships of the Tribal class, was named after an ethnic group of the British Empire. In this case, this was the Anglicisation of the Ndebele people of Zimbabwe. Description The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built abroad and to lend gun support to the existing destroyer flotillas and were thus significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding .Lenton, p. 164 The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load.English, p. 14 They had an overall length of , a beam of Lenton, p. 165 and a draught of .English, p. 12 The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers.

The ships' complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men for the Captain (D) and his staff.Whitley, p. 99 The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four twin-gun mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II \\"pom-pom\\" AA gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun.Hodges, pp. 13‚Äì25 The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships;Hodges, pp. 30‚Äì31, 40 Twenty depth charges were the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.English, p. 15 Wartime modifications Heavy losses to German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals' anti- aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace 'X' mount with two QF Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a twin-gun mount. To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified to accept a Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later.Friedman, p. 34; Hodges, pp. 41‚Äì42 To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast was reduced to a short pole mast.Whitley, p. 116 Construction and career Matabele was ordered on 19 June 1936 under the 1935 Build Programme from the Greenock yards of Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. She was laid down on 1 October 1936 and launched on 6 October 1937. Also launched on this day from Scotts' yard was Matabeles sister, . She was commissioned on 25 January 1939 at a total cost of ¬£343,005, which excluded items supplied by the Admiralty, such as weapons and communications outfits. She was initially assigned to the 2nd Tribal Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, which was renamed the 6th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939. Her early career with the flotilla mostly involved port visits and exercises. On 12 May she escorted the ocean liner through the English Channel. Empress of Australia was carrying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on their Royal Tour to Canada. In June Matabele was assigned to assist in rescue operations for the stricken submarine which had sunk during builder's trials in Liverpool Bay. On her release from these duties, Matabele resumed her Home Fleet programme with the Flotilla. With war looming, she took up her Home Fleet war station in August, and was deployed for interception and anti- submarine patrol in Home waters. World War II On the outbreak of the Second World War, Matabele carried out duties including the interception of German shipping attempting to return to German ports and commerce raiders on passage to attack British shipping in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as patrols to intercept U-boats operating in Home waters. On 25 September she was deployed with sisters and to search for the submarine , which had been badly damaged during a patrol in Heligoland Bight. Having successfully made contact with Spearfish on 26 September, they escorted her back to the UK under the cover of major warships of the Home Fleet. Through October to December, Matabele carried out patrols to intercept German ships on passage for attacks on coastal shipping, as well as heading into the Atlantic Ocean for attacks on convoys or for submarine minelayers. She also carried out screening duties for major Home Fleet warships. In January and February 1940 she was under repair at HMNB Devonport for work which included the replacement of turbine blades, damaged due to excess stress during high speed steaming in inclement weather, and the installation of de-gaussing equipment for protection against magnetic mines. She returned to active service in March, and took part in convoy escorts to and from Norway, as well as sweeps to intercept German warships. Whilst carrying out these duties, Matabele came under heavy air attacks on 13 April, and again on 16 April, but escaped undamaged. On 17 April she escorted the cruisers and to Bod√∏. On 18 April she ran aground on Foksen shoal, but managed to re-float with damage to her structure. Effingham also ran aground, but suffered serious damage. Matabele took off troops and equipment from the stricken cruiser, after which Matabele scuttled Effingam with torpedoes and gunfire. She continued supporting operations off Norway , and then returned to the UK at the end of May for repairs and a refit at Falmouth. This work lasted until July and involved the replacement of her twin 4.7-inch mounting in \\"X\\" position aft with a twin 4 inch HA mounting to improve her defence against air attacks. She returned to active service after post refit trials on 19 August. She continued to serve in Home waters and off Norway. On 22 October she and Somali attacked a convoy off √Öndalsnes and on 23 October she. Somali and Punjabi sank the German weather ship off Stadlandet. Matabele sank a coaster. November and December were spent operating out of Scapa Flow, including forming part of a screen for the search for the German raider which had been reported on passage to attack the Atlantic convoys. In January 1941 she screened minelaying operations off Norway and on 16 January she escorted the battleship , then on passage to the United States carrying Lord Halifax and senior defence personnel, through the North Western Approaches. Further screening of minelaying operations followed. In March she began to escort convoys, but entered refit again in Vickers-Armstrong's Barrow-in-Furness yards on 11 April. This lasted until May and consisted of the removal of the mainmast and the top of the after funnel to improve the arcs of fire for her close range weapons. A Type 286M radar was also fitted. On her departure from Barrow on 5 June to rejoin the fleet, she grounded and sustained major damage to her underwater fittings, including her shaft brackets and propellers. She returned to Barrow for repairs, which lasted until mid August. On 30 August she was deployed with the aircraft carrier , the cruiser and the destroyers Punjabi and Somali on a mission to deliver RAF equipment and personnel to North Russia to support Soviet military operations after the Soviet Union had entered the war. The operation was completed successfully and the ships returned to Scapa Flow on 15 November. Matabele spent October to December on patrol, and screening operations off Norway. Sinking In January 1942 she formed the screen, with Somali, for the cruiser on Convoy PQ 8 from Iceland to Murmansk. The convoy of eight merchant ships plus escorts departed on 11 January, and came under torpedo attack on 17 January one day short of their destination by under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Burkhard Hackl√§nder.Paterson. p. 59The first sunk was the Russian trawler RT-68 Enisej at 6.32am. That evening the merchant ship Harmatis was hit at 6.46pm by a single torpedo and taken in tow by the minesweeper HMS Speedwell, with the Matabele providing escort as the rest of the convoy continued on ahead. U-454 was able to manoeuvre into a suitable position and at 10.21pm fired and hit the Matabele in the stern area with a single torpedo which detonated a magazine, causing the destroyer to sink in less than two minutes at position 69.21N 35.24E. Unable to free their Carley life rafts the surviving crew were forced to jump overboard into the freezing sea, with many being killed when the Matabeles depth charges exploded as the ship sank. The ice-cold sea temperatures then caused further loss of life to such an extent that out of her complement of 238 only two survived of the four that were rescued up by the minesweeper .

His parents were Ethel and Mores Hess, who was a kosher butcher who emigrated from Lithuania and ‚Äì after arriving in the United States ‚Äì worked as an oil delivery man in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Hess worked as a driver for his father's company and ‚Äì after it went bankrupt in 1933 during the Great Depression ‚Äì he reorganized the company. He built an oil terminal in Perth Amboy, New Jersey out of old oil tankers and aggressively underbid his competitors to win Federal oil contracts. He served in World War II, rising to the rank of Major, and serving as the fuel supply officer for General George S. Patton, where he further developed his logistical expertise. Career After the war, using an innovative network of smaller terminals, Hess' success continued. In the late 1950s, he built his first refinery; and in 1960, he opened a chain of gas stations. In the early 1960s he built the world's largest oil refinery at the time on St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands in order to take advantage of federal tax benefits. The refinery was able to secure foreign refiner status (allowing it to circumvent the federal rule that required the use of higher-cost U.S.-flagged vessels when shipping oil to the East Coast) while also receiving subsidies from the United States Department of Energy as a domestic refinery. In 1963, his company, Hess Oil and Chemical, went public. In 1969, using the proceeds from the Hess sale, he acquired the Amerada Petroleum Corporation, one of the largest producers of crude oil in the United States and ‚Äì as part of the purchase ‚Äì merged it with his former company, Hess Oil and Chemical ‚Äì to form the Amerada Hess Corporation. Hess served as chairman and CEO of Amerada Hess until 1995. New York Jets In 1963, he was part of a consortium that bought the New York Jets which included Hess, Sonny Werblin, Philip H. Iselin, Townsend B. Martin and Donald Lillis. His initial investment was $250,000. He bought out his partners: Sonny Werblin in 1968, the heirs of Philip H. Iselin in 1977, Townsend Martin in 1981 and became the sole owner of the club after purchasing the last quarter-share from Helen Dillon, Lillis' daughter, in 1984. The Jets played in Shea Stadium in 1964 after four seasons in the Polo Grounds. In 1984 Hess moved the team to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. When he owned the Jets, he would eat dinner after almost every home game at Lusardi's. Personal life and death In 1947, he married Norma Wilentz who was also Jewish.New Jersey Star Ledger: \\"Norma Wilentz Hess\\" April 22, 2010 Wilentz's father was the former Attorney General David T.

She was laid down on 26 August 1936 and launched on 21 October 1937. She was completed and commissioned on 10 March 1939 and was equipped for use as a Flotilla leader. On ordering, she had been allocated the pennant number G43, but this was changed to F43 before completion. After commissioning she was assigned to the 2nd Tribal Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, and was later transferred to the re-designated 6th Destroyer Flotilla. A period of trials and exercises was interrupted by the sinking of the submarine in Liverpool Bay on 1 June 1939. Tartar was one of the Home Fleet ships sent to the scene of the accident to assist in search and recovery efforts, and formed the Headquarters ship for rescue operations. Further work-up exercises revealed defects, and Tartar was under repair in Devonport Dockyard until the end of July 1939, after which she joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow. During her trials Tartar made at 362.5 RPM with at .March, p. 362 Home Waters: the North Sea On the outbreak of the Second World War, she carried out a number of activities with her flotilla, including screening major warships, intercepting blockade runners and commerce raiders and anti-submarine patrols. On 24 November, she was deployed with other Home Fleet ships to search for the German light battleships and after the sinking of the armed merchant cruiser . By December she was experiencing extensive leaking due to high speed operations in heavy weather conditions. This was a defect common to the Tribal-class destroyers, and Tartar was under repair at the yards of Alexander Stephen and Sons in Govan on the River Clyde until 29 December. January and February 1940 were spent escorting convoys to and from Norway, and screening fleet units. In March, she and escorted the ocean liner through the Western Approaches on her maiden voyage, before moving to Rosyth to carry out convoy escort duties. In April, Tartar escorted convoys HN-24 and HN-25, with breaks to search for German warships operating in the North Sea. She then supported allied operations off Norway, including escorting the damaged cruiser and covering the evacuation of allied troops from √Öndalsnes and Molde. She continued to operate off Norway until the end of May, at which point she returned to Scapa Flow. She was back in the North Sea in early June, escorting the aircraft carrier and the battleship . She also escorted a number of allied evacuation convoys, and carried out another unsuccessful search for Scharnhorst and Gneisenau after the sinking of the aircraft carrier . Tartar then embarked in an anti-submarine patrol with sisters and . On 19 June she rescued survivors from a torpedoed Portuguese merchant vessel, and on 20 June, in company with Mashona, she seized control of the Swedish destroyers and . After intense diplomatic activity they were later returned to Sweden. In the meantime, Tartar became the Leader of the 6th Flotilla whilst her sister was under repair. Tartar herself needed repairs in mid July after sustaining damage to her rudder. On 8 August she was temporarily assigned to Force H whilst providing an escort for ships bound for Gibraltar. On 5 September she was an escort for ships of the 1st Minelaying Squadron during minelaying in the Northern Barrage. A further refit at Devonport followed in October, which included work to repair leaks from the water feeds and the replacement of the twin 4.7 inch gun mounting in \\"X\\" position with twin 4 inch HA mounting to improve anti-aircraft defence. This work lasted until December, when Tartar returned to Scapa Flow as the Leader of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. In January and February 1941 she was used to escort a number of minelaying operations in the North Sea. On 1 March she was one of the destroyers escorting the landing ships of Operation Claymore to the Lofoten Islands, and then provided support for the landing operations.Despatch on raid on military and economic objectives in the Lofoten Islands (Norway) 1941 Mar., by Admiral Sir John C. Tovey, Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet On 3 March she sank the German merchantman at . Whilst carrying out this duty on 4 March, she intercepted the German trawler Krebbs and captured her with a boarding party. An Enigma machine and supporting documents were recovered and later transported to Bletchley Park to assist decryption efforts. In May Tartar was deployed to defend the Atlantic convoys. During these duties, she was present at the sinking of the German battleship . After this, on 28 May Tartar was returning to Scapa Flow with Mashona, when they came under heavy air attack west of Ireland, and Tartars action report states: \\"...It is believed that all attacking aircraft were H.E. 111's.

Arctic Ocean Tartar resumed her duties with the Home Fleet in June 1941, when she was attached to a small force whose aim was to capture a German weather ship to obtain an Enigma coding machine and associated documentation. On 26 June she escorted the cruiser with Bedouin from Scapa Flow to the waters off Jan Mayen Island. On 28 June the task force spotted the and a boarding party from Tartar seized control of the vessel, recovering important documentation. Tartar then sank Lauenburg with gunfire. On 27 July she carried out reconnaissance of Spitsbergen to assess the possibility of using the island as a refuelling base for Russian convoys. Tartar continued to operate in the Arctic Ocean throughout August. On 2 August she destroyed the weather station at Bear Island and evacuated Russian nationals to Murmansk from the island. Tartar accompanied the destroyer while transporting King George VI to Scapa Flow. On 17 August she screened the battleship that was carrying Winston Churchill back from his Atlantic Charter meeting with President Roosevelt. Shortly thereafter, Prince of Wales overtook an eastbound convoy of 73 ships, turned around and passed through the convoy again so that the Prime Minister and the merchant ships could greet each other. When Prince of Wales arrived on the River Clyde, Tartar embarked the Prime Minister and took him to Greenock for his return to London. On 20 August Tartar escorted the troopship and support ship to Spitsbergen to establish a garrison. Having successfully achieved this, she then escorted Empress of Australia to Murmansk, carrying members of the Russian and Norwegian populations of the island. She then underwent a refit, carried out by Green and Silley Weir, Royal Albert Dock, London, which lasted from September until mid-October. The work included removing the original mainmast to improve gunnery arcs, shortening the after funnel, relocating depth charge positions and installing the Type 285 gunnery radar for main armament fire-control. She returned to Scapa Flow after the completion of these works and became the Leader of the 6th Flotilla. January and February 1942 were spent escorting Russian convoys, including convoys PQ 7B, QP 5, PQ 12, PQ 13 and QP 9. On 8 March Tartar screened Home Fleet units carrying out an unsuccessful search for the German battleship . During these operations, she sustained damage to her forward gun mounting due to high-speed operations in rough weather. At the end of March she travelled to Hull for repair and refit at Brigham and Cowan's shipyard until June. From 17 February until 28 April 1942 Tartars captain was Commander R.T. White D.S.O.** (later Captain R.T. White D.S.O.**, 2nd son of Sir Archibald White, Bt. of Wallingwells). Mediterranean Salerno, 9 September 1943 (Operation Avalanche): HMS Tartar puts up an anti-aircraft barrage with her 4.7-inch AA guns to protect the invasion force from attack by enemy aircraft. In August 1942 Tartar was assigned to support Royal Navy operations in the Mediterranean. She took part in Operation Pedestal as part of the escort. The convoy came under air and submarine attacks from 11 August after it was sighted by the . On 12 August Tartar carried out depth charge attacks to drive off the , and together with the destroyer drove off the . After the destroyer was damaged in an air attack, Tartar took her in tow, and attempted to bring her to Gibraltar. On the way she was the target of an unsuccessful attack by the on 13 August, and after that it was decided that attempts to save Foresight were hopeless. Tartar took off Foresights crew, then scuttled her with a torpedo. After the culmination of Operation Pedestal, Tartar sailed to rejoin the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow. On her return in September, she formed part of the escort for Convoy PQ 18 and then Convoy QP 14. In October she returned to the Mediterranean to support Operation Torch, the allied landings in North Africa. During this deployment, from 8 November to 30 November, she screened fleet units and convoys, and carried out anti-submarine patrols. She was then attached to Force Q at Algiers, where she was assigned to intercept enemy supply convoys and escort allied convoys. She carried out these duties into February 1943, despite coming under attack on numerous occasions. On 28 April 1943 Tartar carried out an attack on E-boats near Marrettimo, Algeria, and on 7 May she deployed with other destroyers of the Mediterranean Fleet to blockade the Cape Bon area to intercept craft attempting to evacuate enemy personnel from Tunisia. HMS Foresight sinking after being torpedoed by HMS Tartar. The torpedo has blown away the entire midships section of the ship. In June, she was supporting operations off Pantellaria, and in July was escorting convoys as part of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. On 11 July she rescued some 200 survivors from the hospital ship , which had been sunk by German air attack off the beach head. On 12 July Tartar sank the ammunition ship Baarn, which was on fire after being damaged in air attacks. On 13 July she took the damaged destroyer in tow to Malta, after Eskimo had been damaged by air attacks. In August she supported the Allied invasion of Italy, by covering the landings at Calabria, and later the landings at Salerno. On 19 September Tartar provided gunfire support during a German counter-attack, and subsequently came under attacks from radio-controlled glider bombs She returned to the UK at the end of October and spent the last months of 1943, and January and February 1944, under refit at Devonport. Home waters: the English Channel Battle Ensign of HMS Tartar, carried in her action with German destroyers in the Channel In March and April 1944 she deployed as the Leader of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla with the Plymouth Command to carry out offensive patrols against coastal shipping off the French coast, as well as escorting allied convoys through the English Channel. In May she provided cover with the cruiser for the minelayer , on a minelaying operation off the French coast in preparation for the Allied landings in Normandy. On 6 June she led the 10th Destroyer Flotilla into the English Channel to prevent German interference with the landings or the passage of convoys during Operation Neptune. On 9 June she and the flotilla were in action against German warships. Though the German destroyers and were sunk, Tartar was damaged by return fire. Her galley and bridge were hit and set on fire. Four men were killed and twelve wounded including Commander Jones. Her foremast hung over the side and all of the radar and communications were dead. She returned to Devonport briefly to undergo temporary repairs, before resuming operations in the English Channel. On 7 July she intercepted and engaged minesweepers of the 46th German Flotilla off the Channel Islands and sank the minesweepers M4601 and M4605. On 6 August Bellona, Tartar, and the Canadian destroyers and attacked a convoy off Saint-Nazaire, sinking the minesweepers M263 and M486, the patrol boat V414 and a coastal launch together with four small ships. Far East Tartar underwent another refit from November 1944 until February 1945, after which she was assigned to serve with the Eastern Fleet. In March 1945 she escorted several escort aircraft carriers to Gibraltar and then carried out exercises in the Mediterranean before departing for Trincomalee, where she arrived on 20 April. She was initially deployed with the 10th Destroyer Flotilla as a screen for the ships involved in a sweep of the Andaman and Nicobar areas. She then participated in bombardments of Car Nicobar and Port Blair, as well as covering Operation Dracula, the allied landings at Rangoon. Further deployments included screening duties and attacks on enemy shipping, during which time she came under repeated air attacks, but without damage or casualties. She was then assigned to the planned Operation Zipper, but it was never carried out. She spent the rest of the war on escort and screening duties until the Japanese surrender. She was present at the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. Post war After the end of the war, Tartar sailed for Penang on 7 September 1945 and from there to the UK, where she arrived at Plymouth on 17 November. She was paid off and placed in reserve in early 1946 after having been de-stored. She was used as an Accommodation Ship for Reserve Fleet personnel before being placed on the Disposal List in 1947. Fate Tartar was sold to BISCO for breaking up on 6 January 1948 and arrived at J. Cashmore's yard in Newport, South Wales for demolition on 22 February. She had gained a total of twelve battle honours for her service in the war.

From there riders plunge twisting to the right passing an on-ride camera, which has been removed, and entering an underwater tunnel. The train exits the tunnel entering a 360-degree vertical loop followed by a sidewinder inversion (a half loop that uses a corkscrew at the top to change direction). After riding a small hill, the train enters the first brake run nearly slowing to a complete stop. The second part of the ride begins with a butterfly figure-eight element consisting of sharp twists and turns. The last turn to the right transitions the train into the a double corkscrew only above the water. Immediately following is a small bunny hill with a short dive under the lift hill that turns to the left into the final brake run. After a U-turn, the train returns to the station.

There are 5 stages to heart development. Stages of heart development  Initiation  frame Specification of cardiac precursor cells: The lateral plate mesoderm delaminates to form two layers: the dorsal somatic (parietal) mesoderm and the ventral splanchnic (visceral) mesoderm. The heart precursor cells come from the two regions of the splanchnic mesoderm called the cardiogenic mesoderm. These cells can differentiate into endocardium which lines the heart chamber and valves and the myocardium which forms the musculature of the ventricles and the atria. The heart cells are specified in anterior mesoderm by proteins such as Dickkopf-1, Nodal, and Cerberus secreted by the anterior endoderm. Whether Dickkopf-1 and Nodal act directly on the cardiac mesoderm is the subject of research, but it seems that at least they act indirectly by stimulating the production of additional factors from the anterior endoderm. These early signals are essential for heart formation such that removal of the anterior endoderm blocks heart formation. Anterior endoderm is also sufficient to stimulate heart differientation since it can induce non-cardiogenic mesoderm from more posterior positions in the embryo to form heart. The secretion of Wnt inhibitors (such as Cerberus, Dickkopf and Crescent) by the anterior endoderm also prevents Wnt3a and Wnt8 secreted by the neural tube from inhibiting heart formation. The notochord secretes BMP antagonists (Chordin and Noggin) to prevent formation of cardiac mesoderm in inappropriate places. Other cardiogenic signals such as BMP and FGF activate the expression of cardiac specific transcription factors such as homeodomain protein Nkx2.5. Nkx2.5 activates a number of downstream transcription factors (such as MEF2 and GATA) which activate the expression of cardiac muscle specific proteins. Mutations in Nkx2.5 result in heart development defects and congenital heart malformations.  Step 1: Tube formation  thumb Migration of cardiac precursor cells and fusion of the primordia: The cardiac precursor cells migrate anteriorly towards the midline and fuse into a single heart tube. Fibronectin in the extracellular matrix directs this migration. If this migration event is blocked, cardia bifida results where the two heart primordia remain separated. During fusion, the heart tube is patterned along the anterior/posterior axis for the various regions and chambers of the heart. The surrounding mesocardium degenerates to leave the primitive heart attached only by its arterial and venous ends, which are anatomically fixed to the pharyngeal arches and the septum transversum, respectively. The developing tubular heart then folds ventrally and bulges in five regions along its length: the first one and closest to the arterial end is the truncus arteriosus, then follow the bulbus cordis, the primitive ventricle, the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus. All five embryonic dilatations of the primitive heart develop into the adult structures of the heart.  Step 2: Looping  thumb The heart tube undergoes right-ward looping to change from anterior/posterior polarity to left/right polarity. The detailed mechanism is unknown however the looping requires the asymmetrically localized transcription factor . The direction of asymmetry is established much earlier during embryonic development, possibly by the clockwise rotation of cilia, and leads to sided expression of Pitx2. Looping also depends on heart specific proteins activated by Nkx2.5 such as , , and Xin. thumb Heart chamber formation: The cell fates of the heart chambers are characterized before heart looping but cannot be distinguished until after looping. Hand1 is localized to the left ventricle while Hand2 is localized to the right ventricle.  Step 3: Septal formation  Proper positioning and function of the valves is critical for chamber formation and proper blood flow. The endocardial cushion serves as a makeshift valve until then. Step 3(a): Atrial septation The primitive atrium is divided in two by joining of several structures. From the roof of the primitive atrium descends the septum primum, which grows towards the endocardial cushions within the atrial canal. Right before the septum primum fuses with the endocardial cushions there's a temporary space called the foramen primum. Once they fuse a new opening forms in the middle of the septum primum called the ostium secundum or foramen secundum. To the right of the septum primum and also coming down from the roof of the primitive atrium, descends a semilunar-shaped partition called the septum secundum. The free edges of the septum secundum produce an orifice called foramen ovale, which closes after birth when the septum primum and secundum fuse to each other completing the formation of the atrial septum. The atrial canal is in turn divided into a right and left side by the atrioventricular septum, which originates from the union of the dorsal and ventral endocardial cushion. The right side of the atrial canal will become the tricuspid valve and the left will become the bicuspid valve. Defects in producing the AV septum produces atrioventricular septal defects, including a persistent AV canal and tricuspid atresia. Step 3(b): Ventricular septation The floor at the midline of the primitive ventricle produces the interventricular septum, separating the chamber in two. The IV septum grows upward towards the endocardial cushion. As it grows, a foramen appears, the interventricular foramen, which later is closed by the non-muscular IV septum. Defects in producing the IV septum causes ventricular septal defects, which communicate both ventricles. Step 4: Outflow tract septation The truncus arteriosus and the adjacent bulbus cordis partition by means of cells from the neural crest. Once the cells from the truncal ridge meet with the cells from the bulbar ridge they twist around each other in a spiral orientation as they fuse and form the aorticopulmonary septum. This will end dividing the aorta from the pulmonary trunk. Defects in this process is known as aortopulmonary septal defect, and causes persistent truncus arteriosus, unequal division of the truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries, aortic and pulmonary valve stenosis or tetralogy of fallot. Step 5: Heart valve formation The heart valves are formed. Defects in this process are known as valvular heart disease.

Biography Childhood Aino J√§rnefelt was born in Helsinki, into the strict and disciplined family of General Alexander J√§rnefelt and his wife Elisabeth (n√©e Clodt von J√ºrgensburg) in 1871. She had six older siblings, including the writer Arvid J√§rnefelt, the painter Eero J√§rnefelt and the composer and conductor Armas J√§rnefelt. It was her brother Armas who brought his friend and fellow student, Jean Sibelius, to the family home in the winter of 1889. At the time, the writer Juhani Aho was expressing affection towards Aino, but he did not receive the response he sought.

Aino Sibelius in 1922. 1892‚Äì1930: Early married life From the time of their engagement they had talked of a house of their own in the country, and had looked for a house near Lake Tuusula as early as 1898. However, when her husband's wealthy bachelor uncle died in July 1903, they bought about of land in J√§rvenp√§√§ near Lake Tuusula, and used his share of his uncle's estate to pay the architect Lars Sonck to design their house, which they called Ainola. They moved there in the autumn of 1904, having borrowed a substantial amount of money to buy the land and build the house. Aino's early years in J√§rvenp√§√§ were stressful and difficult, caused partly by financial worries and partly by her husband's drinking and partying lifestyle. She sought to eke out the family budget by creating a vegetable garden from the stony ground near the house. And since they could not afford schooling for the children, Aino taught them at home, a task which she performed very successfully, since they all did well when they later went to school. She spent a period in 1907 convalescing in Hyvink√§√§ Sanatorium. In 1908 her husband had a throat operation and gave up alcohol for almost seven years, and this was the start of Aino's happiest years. Margareta was born in 1908, then Heidi in 1911 (when Aino was 40 years old), and the children all grew up in Ainola ‚Äì the only time they lived elsewhere was during the Finnish Civil War in 1918 when they had to move to Helsinki for a couple of months. 1930‚Äì1957: Later life By the 1930s the children had all left home, and Aino wanted to move to Helsinki, nearer to their children. During the next few years they spent some time in a rented apartment in Helsinki, but in 1941 they moved back to Ainola with their many grandchildren because of the risk of bombing by the Soviet Union.

Biography Born in Aztalan, Wisconsin, Beatty graduated with the United States Naval Academy Class of 1875, and then served at sea in the wooden screw-sloop Tuscarora before receiving his ensign's commission in 1876. After service at sea in a succession of ships ‚Äî Minnesota, Richmond, Despatch, and Tallapoosa ‚Äî between 1878 and 1889, he completed two tours of duty on shore, first in the Library and War Records Office (among the predecessor offices of the present Naval Historical Center) and then participating in the deliberation of the International Marine Conference. In the spring of 1892, Beatty returned to duty afloat, serving briefly in Ranger before being ordered to the monitor Miantonomoh. After torpedo instruction, the young officer ‚Äî by then a lieutenant ‚Äî served in the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius; and spent the next few years alternating between duty ashore at the Naval Academy and afloat, in Monongahela. Reporting to the gunboat Adams in the summer of 1897, he became that ship's executive officer in October and served in that capacity until transferred to the monitor Monterey in March 1898. The following spring, Beatty became the executive officer of gunboat Wheeling. Shore duty at the Washington Navy Yard preceded a tour in charge of the Department of Yards and Docks in the Navy Department from 13 February 1901 to 21 January 1902. Two commands followed in succession: first, the nautical school ship Saratoga and then Gloucester, before he became Commander, Naval Base, Culebra, Puerto Rico, in February 1904, with additional duty commanding Gloucester. After a brief tour first as assistant inspector and later as the inspector of the 9th Light House District, headquartered at Chicago, Illinois, Beatty spent the next decade alternating between ordnance duty ashore and service afloat, commanding in turn the cruisers and and the battleship . His shore duty included a tour as Assistant Superintendent of the Naval Gun Factory, Washington Navy Yard; one in the Bureau of Ordnance as a member of the board on sights; and, ultimately, a stint as Commandant of the Washington Navy Yard and Superintendent of the Naval Gun Factory. While holding the latter post from 1905 to 1907, Beatty was instrumental in the development of an electric range finder. Upon attaining flag rank in the spring of 1912, Beatty became a fleet division commander. Rear Admiral Beatty commanded a succession of Atlantic Fleet divisions ‚Äî 4th, 1st, and 3d ‚Äî in 1913 and 1914. The outbreak of war in Europe in the summer of 1914 found him in command of Division 3, with his flag in . Detached from that duty in December 1914, he took up new duties as Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard and of the Norfolk Naval Station on 4 January 1915. Temporary duty in command of forces engaged in a war game in the spring of 1915 interrupted his tour at Norfolk; but, he soon returned to his duties there and carried them out until June 1916. Reporting to the Chief of Naval Operations for \\"temporary duty in connection with naval districts\\" in October 1916, Beatty served briefly as the Commandant, 5th Naval District, before being switched to the 6th Naval District, at Charleston, South Carolina, in February 1917. He served in that post for the rest of World War I and into 1919. Detached from all active duty in September 1919, he retired on 6 October 1919. Rear Admiral Beatty died at Charleston on 16 March 1926. He was buried at Section 2 of the Arlington National Cemetery, where he rests among other family members. His son, Frank Edmund Beatty, Jr., Vice Admiral, United States Navy, is also buried nearby in the same section. Namesakes Two ships have been named USS Beatty for him.

History  Built- in 1939 as Henry Harbin Senior School, the school has expanded in every decade since its opening. The school was originally two separate schools - girls on the eastern side, boys on the west, separated by a quadrangle in the centre of the main school building. This layout was almost exactly the same as the original building at Kemp-Welch School, which opened in 1938. The school became a mixed school for 12- to 16-year-olds in the 1970s, reverting to an entry age of 11 in September 2013, as part of Poole's re-organisation into a two-tier education system. In the late 1980s the school became a 'technical high school', and its name was officially changed to Poole Technical High School in the early 1990s. It was during this period that the school added a sixth form and introduced an academic express stream, with a particular focus on the teaching of 'triple science' qualifications.OFSTED, Outstanding Providers list 1993-2013 It is one of a small group of partially selective schools that were permitted to retain selection under the provisions of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Redevelopments have included the new main school canteen, an English block, extensions to the Art and Science blocks, and the Merchants' Hall, which includes a canteen for the sixth-form and seminar rooms. At its 2011 OFSTED inspection, the school was graded as 'good'. From September 2013, the school has admitted students in Year 7, taking the total number of students in attendance at PHS to over 1900, making it one of the larger schools in the country. Work completed over summer 2014 focused on extending the life of the newly named \\"Shaftesbury Centre\\". The name of the building was chosen to honour the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, who opened the school in 1939. Before 2017 the school operated a house system, in every house, there were two registration groups per year. The houses were called Jolliffe, Garland, Lester, Masters, Thompson, White, Spurrier and Harbin. In 2017, Spurrier and Harbin, were abolished and Year Eleven pupils were placed in a separate year eleven group. However all elements of the house system were suspended from 2017 apart from for Sports Day activities.

Service Formerly a British customs ship, USS Duc De Lauzun was purchased in October 1782 at Dover, England, and outfitted in Nantes, France. Robert Morris, Agent of Marine, acquired Duc de Lauzun in October 1782 in payment for a debt.USNI Proceedings, (1905), Vol. 31, Issue 2, p. 669. Under the command of Captain John Green Naval Officer Continental Navy. In January 1783 she was dispatched from Philadelphia, Pa., to bring home 72,000 Spanish milled dollars from Havana for the American Government. Clearing Havana 6 March escorted by the Continental ship under the command of Captain John Barry, she sailed for home with her precious cargo. On their passage north the two ships encountered two men-of-war whom they evaded. Under orders to deliver the cargo at all costs Alliance distanced herself from Duc de Lauzun which was laden with the silver, and much needed cargo bound for America causing the two British warships to close on Green's vessel. After consulting, the two captains agreed that Green would abandon most of his cannon, and transfer most of the silver to Alliance. Duc was still too slow, and Barry gave the orders to abandon Duc and sail away with the silver. Courageously Captain Green opened fire with what cannon he had against one of the British vessels, while another was closing quickly. Duc de Lauzon was a transport outfitted with 20 cannon far inferior to Alliance, and the British, and without most of her cannon. Barry witnessing the events, and the fact that Green was one of his closest friends, turned Alliance to come to Duc de Lauzuns assistance. Positioning Alliance between Duc and one of the British warships, Barry delivered a broadside that sent the British into a retreat. Barry, still insistent on following orders, left Green and Duc de Lauzun, still laden with a fortune of much needed goods. With good fortune Duc was able to sail safely up the coast into Philadelphia. Barry lured British vessels away from the entrance of Delaware Bay allowing Green to sail up the Delaware to Philadelphia. Barry publicly questioned his close friend on the accusation of Captain Green's self-interest in the incident due to captain's privilege slowing Duc de Lauzun during the voyage. The cargo on board Duc amounted to a small fortune, worth nearly the same amount as the silver. The cargo, owed to several investors was critical to the economy, and supplied much needed goods to the colonies. Captain Green during the voyage and battle was never to abandon his cargo, and the lives of his men. Captain Green expressed his anger to Barry in a meeting at sea questioned Barry's decision to leave Duc defenseless without cannon, and abandoning his fellow sailors and the much needed cargo. Duc was the first to fire in the battle owing to Captain Green's uncommon valor while Barry was sailing away. Only concern at having to watch Duc de Lauzuns capture led Barry to get involved in the battle. Captain Green was exonerated of any wrongdoing in which his so-called good friend had implied. Captain Green still considered John Paul Jones, Gustavus Cunningham, Peter Hodgekinson, and John Barry his closest friends after the war. The battle was the last of the war. Duc de Lauzun and her crew performed valiantly. The following year Captain Green was chosen by Robert Morris to Captain Empress of China, the first vessel to fly the flag of the United States of America, and sail to China establishing trade between the two countries vital to the growth and prosperity of the nation. In April 1783 the United States government lent Duc de Lauzun to France to carry home French troops.USNI Proceedings, (1905), Vol. 31, Issue 2, p.674. Before, she had one more mission: to carry Benjamin Franklin to France carrying the news of Cornwallis's surrender. The last French forces in America, (Lauzun's Legion and the siege artillery), embarked at Wilmington (Delaware) on 11 May 1783 on the frigates Astr√©e, Dana√©, and Gloire, and the transports Saint James and Duc de Lauzun. Fate On 21 April 1783, Congress instructed Robert Morris to arrange for the sale of Duc De Lauzun when she arrived in France. She was sold there at the end of 1783.Demerliac (1996), p.115, #814.

He was first bishop of Soissons, then a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, and finally archbishop of Sens. Biography Son of the public prosecutor of the parlement of Bourgogne, Languet de Gercy was a prot√©g√© of Jacques B√©nigne Bossuet, who introduced him to Louis XIV and had him named as the chaplain to the princess. At the same time he was the general vicar of the diocese of Autun, which includes the parish of Paray-le-Monial where the saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque is buried. Ordered to investigate the miracles that were said to have occurred at her hand, he wrote a biography of Alacoque in 1729. Furthermore, he was named bishop of Soissons in 1715, and elected member of l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1721. He was also named archbishop of Sens in 1730 and the Conseil d'√âtat (Council of State) in 1747. Languet de Gergy's work on the life of Alacoque was violently attacked by the Jansenites opposed to the catholic devotion of the Sacred Heart. Also defender of the papal bull Unigenitus, he meddled in numerous political-religious controversies, and was equally known for both the content of his pamphlets, and their number. He belonged to the parti des d√©vots opposed to the philosophies of the Age of Enlightenment and fought fiercely against the candidacies of Montesquieu and Voltaire to l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. In addition to his treatises and religious pamphlets, Languet de Gergy was the author of books on the Divine Office, catechism, and of pastoral letters.

It gives its name to the larger Bradshaw electoral ward, which includes Harwood. Historically a part of Lancashire, Bradshaw lies on the southern edge of the West Pennine Moors. History Toponymy The toponymy of Bradshaw is derived from the Old English adjective Brad from which our modern word broad is evolved, and the Old English word sceaga ‚Äì anglicised to shaw ‚Äì a copse. The two elements together mean a broad copse. In early deeds and documents of the 13th Century the name is spelt Bradeshaye and later Bradshaigh. The Manor of Bradshaw Henry Bradshaw held land in the area in 1235, and the Bradshaws were an important Lancashire family in the late 1500s and early 1600s, especially during the movement against the King before the Civil War. John Bradshaw died in 1542 holding the Manor of Bradshaw. In 1694 the Manor and Lordship of Bradshaw was sold by another John Bradshaw to Henry Bradshaw of Marple Hall. The estate later descended to the Isherwood family. Governance Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire from the 12th century until 1974, Bradshaw was a township and chapelry of the ancient parish of Bolton-le-Moors in the Salford Hundred. In 1837, Bradshaw joined with other townships and civil parishes in the area to form the Bolton Poor Law Union and took joint responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law and building a workhouse. In 1866, Bradshaw was given the status of a civil parish in its own right. In 1894, Bradshaw became part of the Bolton Rural District which took responsibility over matters such as planning, council housing, and playgrounds and cemeteries. The Rural District was dissolved in 1898 and its civil parishes were incorporated into various local authorities. As a result, Bradshaw became part of the Turton Urban District. Under the Local Government Act 1972, Turton Urban District was abolished on 1 April 1974 and was divided between two local authorities. The northern part, North Turton, became part of the Borough of Blackburn (which changed to Blackburn with Darwen in 1997) in Lancashire, and the southern part, South Turton (including Bradshaw), became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester. Landmarks Bradshaw War Memorial Bradshaw War Memorial is located within the grounds of St Maxentius' Churchyard. It commemorates the residents of Bradshaw who were killed in the First and Second World Wars. The inscription on one of the panels of the memorial reads: To The Glory Of God And In Memory Of The Men Of Bradshaw Who Died For Their Country In The Great War 1914‚Äì1918. On the base there is a further inscription for the Second World War: Also In Loving Remembrance Of The Men Of This Parish Who Gave Their Lives In The War Of 1939‚Äì1945. Other panels and the base has the names of all those killed in the two world wars. The churchyard also contains seven war graves, six from the First World War and one from the Second World War. Education Bradshaw has two schools: St Maxentius C.of E. Primary School, New Heys Way, and Canon Slade School, Bradshaw Brow. Religious sites Bradshaw is famous for its \\"tower without a church and a church without a tower\\". This refers to St. Maxentius's Church in Bradshaw. This church was originally one of the earliest chapels of ease for Bolton Parish Church. The 16th-century tower is all that is left of the original chapel of ease. The present 1872 church building is near, but separate from the tower.

After graduating from Chilocco, Albert enlisted and served in the United States Marine Corps. Albert's subject matter derives from his own life experiences as well those of neighbors, friends and family. Albert paints in the very unforgiving style considered by most disciples of Native American art as traditional or Bacone style, as established by Southeast tribal artists active at Bacone College. There is no erasing or covering up. His paintings use colors and multiple contour lines to define figures and shapes, as opposed to three-dimensional perspective or shading. He works in tempera and watercolor. He has shown his work at the Five Civilized Tribes Museum, Red Earth, and the Creek Indian Council House and Museum, and the Philbrook Museum of Art. He has also contributed his art work for causes such as the Red Cross and Native American bone marrow recruitment.Lester, Patrick D. The Biographical Directory of Native American Painters.

He composed it while in the employ of Duke Ercole I d'Este in Ferrara, in 1503 or 1504.Sherr, p. 295 It was one of the most famous settings of that psalm of the entire Renaissance, was hugely influential in subsequent settings of the Penitential Psalms, and was itself probably inspired by the recent suffering and execution of the reformer Girolamo Savonarola.Macey, p. 184ff. During the 1490s, the Duke of Ferrara, Ercole I d'Este, kept in close contact with Savonarola, who was also from Ferrara, and supported him in his efforts to reform the Roman Catholic Church. About a dozen letters between the two survive: the Duke sought advice both on spiritual and political matters (for example, his alliance with France).Macey, p. 186 Even after Savonarola's arrest, Duke Ercole attempted to have him freed, but his last letter to the church authorities in Florence, in April 1498, went unanswered. After Savonarola's execution, Ercole, then in his eighties, probably commissioned his newly hired composer, Josquin, to write him a musical testament, very likely for performance during Holy Week of 1504.Lockwood, p. 262. Savonarola's impassioned meditation on sin and repentance, Infelix ego, composed in prison after his torture, and published in Ferrara in mid-1498 shortly after his death, was the probable model for Josquin's setting. It is an extended prayer to the God against whom he believes he has sinned, based closely on Psalm 51, and unified by a boldface- type repetition of the phrase \\"Miserere mei, Deus\\" throughout the text. In keeping with Savonarola's dislike of polyphony and musical display, the Miserere is written in a spare, austere style, much different from the contrapuntal complexity, virtuosity, and ornamentation of works such as the five-part motet Virgo salutiferi, which was probably written around the same time.Macey, Grove The tenor part, which contains the repeating phrase \\"Miserere mei, Deus\\", was likely written to be sung by the Duke himself, who was a trained musician and often sang with the musicians in his chapel.Macey, p. 191 The Miserere is one of Josquin's two \\"motto\\" motets, motets in which repetitions of a phrase are the predominant structural feature (the other is the five-voice Salve Regina of several years before). In the Miserere, the opening words of the first verse \\"Miserere mei, Deus\\", sung to a simple repeated-note motif containing only two pitches (E and F), serves as the motto. This recurs after each of the 19 verses of the psalm. The motto theme begins each time on a different pitch, with the recurrences moving stepwise down the scale from E above middle C to the E an octave below, then back up again to the opening E, and then down stepwise to A fifth below, where the piece ends. In addition, the length of the motto theme is halved once it begins its ascent out of the bass, and has its length returned to normal for the final descent from E to A.Sherr, p. 296 These three journeys of the motto theme's opening note, down, up, and then down again, define the three divisions of the composition: a brief break is usually observed in performance between them. While overall the composition is in the Phrygian mode, the harmonized repetitions enforce tonal variety.Sherr, p. 296. Texturally, the piece is so constructed that the words are always clearly intelligible. Intelligibility of sung text was not always a high priority for composers of the period, and this lack of intelligibility was a specific criticism Savonarola made of polyphonic music. Josquin arranges for the words to be heard by using chordal textures, duets, and by avoiding dense polyphony; and of course after each verse the tenor voice intones alone \\"Miserere mei, Deus\\", as in the Savonarola meditation. As tenor sings these words, the other voices join in one at a time to reinforce the first, \\"an effect analogous to boldface type in a printed text.\\"Macey, p. 189 Josquin's setting of the Miserere was influential not only as a psalm setting, but as an example of how to approach the text of Infelix ego. Later in the 16th century, composers who specifically set the words of Savonarola, such as Adrian Willaert, Cipriano de Rore, and Nicola Vicentino, all of whom wrote motets on Infelix ego, used Josquin's work as a model.Macey, p. 231.

Ordered in 1945, she was built by J. Samuel White at their Isle of Wight shipyard, being launched in 1950 and completed in 1953. She spent the initial years of her service alternating between the Mediterranean Sea and British waters, before undergoing modifications between 1958 and 1959 and again between 1962 and 1964. After further service, including spells in the West Indies and Far East, she was decommissioned in 1969 and sold for scrap in 1971. Construction Dainty was one of eight destroyers ordered on 24 January 1945, with a total of 16 ships ordered for the Royal Navy by the end of February that year. Eight of the 16 Darings were cancelled in December 1945, before they were laid down, but construction of the remaining eight ships continued, while three more were built by Australia. The ship was laid down at J. Samuel White's Cowes, Isle of Wight shipyard on 17 December 1945 and was launched on 16 August 1950 and completed on 26 February 1953. Design Dainty was long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. She had a beam of and a draught of deep load. Displacement was standard and deep load. The ship was of all-welded construction, and aluminium was used for internal bulkheads, in one of the first uses of this material in Royal Navy ships. Two Foster-Wheeler boilers supplied steam at and to two seats of Parsons double-reduction geared steam turbines, which in turn drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a maximum speed of . The machinery was laid out in the unit arrangement, with two machinery spaces, each holding a boiler and turbine, separated by an empty compartment so that a single hit by hostile fire could not completely disable the ship. Dainty was one of four ships of the class that were built with Direct current (DC) electrical equipment, with the other four ships having more modern Alternating Current (AC) electrics. 618 tons of oil fuel were carried, sufficient to give a range of at . The ship was armed with three twin QF 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark VI dual purpose gun mounts, with a close-in anti-aircraft armament of three twin Bofors 40 mm mounts, with two stabilised STAAG mounts and one simpler, non-stabilised Mark V (or \\"Utility\\") mount. Two quintuple mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedoes were carried, while anti-submarine armament consisted of a Squid anti-submarine mortar with 30 charges. thick splinter armour was provided for the bridge, gun turrets and turret rings, while plating protected cable runs. The ship was fitted with a Type 293Q air/surface search radar on the foremast together with a Type 274 navigation radar and a Type 291 air warning radar on the ship's mainmast. A Mark 6 director, incorporating a Type 275 radar, was mounted on the roof of the ship's bridge. Dainty had a crew of 286 officers and other ranks. Service Aft view of Daring-class destroyer HMS Dainty, 22 October 1964 (IWM HU 129784) On commissioning, the four ships with DC electrics, including Dainty, joined the Mediterranean Fleet, forming what would become the 2nd Destroyer Squadron. with the AC electric ships forming what would become the 5th Destroyer Squadron in the Home Fleet. The two squadrons regularly swapped between the Mediterranean and Home Fleets. Dainty was laid up in reserve in December 1955, but briefly returned to active service in February 1956 as part of an exercise to test the arrangements for raising ships from reserve. After returning to reserve in April, she returned to active service with the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean later that year. On 29 April 1957 Dainty delivered emergency supplies, including 2000 blankets and 300 tents along with medical supplies and a team of doctors to the town of Fethiye in Turkey which had been badly damaged by a pair of earthquakes. On 2 April 1958, Dainty collided with the destroyer when coming alongside Solebay at Portsmouth Harbour, with both destroyers being damaged in the collision. Dainty entered refit at Portsmouth on 16 April that year, where her aft set of torpedo tubes was removed, allowing a deckhouse to be added containing additional accommodation, badly needed as the Darings' large crews meant that they were cramped. Dainty was commissioned following the refit on 20 January 1959, when she became part of the 2nd Destroyer Squadron as part of the Home and Mediterranean Fleets.Commissioning Book, HMS Dainty, 1960‚Äì1961, HMSO She was paid off into reserve again, along with the rest of the 2nd Squadron in January 1961. She was refitted again between 1962 and 1964. The remaining set of torpedo tubes was replaced by another deckhouse, while the two STAAG Bofors mounts were replaced by simpler Mark V utility twin Bofors mounts, and the Mark 6 director was replaced by the more modern MRS3 director. These changes greatly reduced the amount of maintenance required. Dainty recommissioned at Portsmouth in April 1965 as a member of the 23rd Escort Squadron following the refit, serving in the Mediterranean and West Indies. She was back in home waters on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1966 when she and sister ship and the German frigates and took part in ceremonies in the North Sea to mark the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Jutland. Another commission in April 1967 saw her serve two years in Home, West Indian and Far East Waters. Fate Dainty was paid off for disposal at Portsmouth on 31 July 1969. Dainty was sold on 1 January 1971 and broken up at Cairnryan.

Mokoli ªi as seen from the shore of Kualoa Beach Park Etymology Mokolii translates from Hawaiian as \\"little lizard.\\" According to Hawaiian mythology, the island is the remains of a giant lizard's or dragon's tail that was chopped off and tossed into the ocean by the goddess Hi ªiaka. The common name of Chinaman's Hat derives from its likeness to the Asian conical hat. Flora and fauna Both wildlife and plants of Mokolii have been affected by the presence of non- native species, in particular the black rat and yellow crazy ant. Although other species of birds previously nested there, the Wedge-tailed shearwater is the only species of bird that nests on Mokolii. 72 species of plants have been identified, the majority of which are invasive non-native species. Native plants thrive in the coastal margins and include ahu awa (Cyperus javanicus), naupaka (Scaevola taccada), and ilima (Sida fallax). Invasive plants which dominate the slopes are Lantana camara, Spanish needles (Bidens alba var. radiata), and christmasberry. The island was designated as a critical habitat for Carter‚Äôs panicgrass (Panicum fauriei var. carteri) by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1983. In 2002, the USFWS initiated a program to eradicate rats from Mokolii.

Written by Dennis Spooner and directed by David Lane, it was first broadcast on ATV Midlands on 30 December 1965. Set in the 2060s, the series follows the exploits of International Rescue, an organisation that uses technologically-advanced rescue vehicles to save human life. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, founder of International Rescue, and his five adult sons, who pilot the organisation's main vehicles: the Thunderbird machines. In \\"The Mighty Atom\\", the Hood attacks atomic irrigation plants in Australia and the Sahara. Plot Some time before the creation of International Rescue, the Hood (voiced by Ray Barrett) is spying on a nuclear-powered irrigation plant in an Australian desert when he is discovered and challenged by a security guard. A gunfight ensues and one of the Hood's bullets hits a gas cylinder, starting a fire that quickly consumes the facility. Unable to shut down the atomic reactor, Controller Wade and his staff are airlifted to safety before the plant is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. The resulting radioactive cloud seems poised to engulf Melbourne but is dispersed by high winds. One year later, the disguised Hood hypnotises delegates at a science conference and steals the \\"Mighty Atom\\" ‚Äì an artificially-intelligent roaming surveillance device that looks like a mouse. Travelling to the Sahara, he uses the Mighty Atom to photograph the interior of a new, automated irrigation plant maintained by Wade and his assistant Collins. He then decides to exploit the situation further by creating a disaster to which the newly-formed International Rescue will respond, giving him an opportunity to use the device to steal the secrets of the Thunderbird machines. To this end, he detonates explosive devices around the plant's reactor, fatally de-stabilising it. With a second nuclear explosion inevitable and rescue by the wind unlikely, Wade realises that the consequences for the region will be devastating. He calls International Rescue for help and Jeff Tracy (voiced by Peter Dyneley) dispatches Scott (voiced by Shane Rimmer) in Thunderbird 1. Lady Penelope (voiced by Sylvia Anderson), who is visiting Tracy Island with Parker (voiced by David Graham) and is eager to accompany the Tracy brothers on a mission, leaves with Virgil and Gordon (voiced by David Holliday and David Graham) in Thunderbird 2 carrying Pod 4. When Thunderbird 2 reaches the North African coast, Gordon launches in Thunderbird 4 and proceeds to the plant's seawater inlet. Thunderbird 2 continues to the plant, where Scott and Virgil don protective suits and enter the reactor room to re-align the control rods and stabilise the reactor. Gordon then destroys the inlet with a torpedo, cutting off the seawater intake at just the right moment to prevent the reactor from exploding. Left alone in Thunderbird 2, Penelope, who is afraid of mice, screams repeatedly when confronted by the Mighty Atom as it prepares to photograph the cockpit. Later, at his temple in Malaysia, the Hood connects the device to a computer to view the stored images ‚Äì which, he is dismayed to find, are all of Penelope's terrified face. In a fit of rage, he destroys the Mighty Atom by smashing it with his fist. Production One of 11 Thunderbirds scripts to be filmed before the running time per-episode was extended from 25 to 50 minutes, \\"The Mighty Atom\\" was originally set almost entirely in the Sahara, with the events in Australia recalled briefly in flashback. To expand the plot, the scriptwriters effectively split the episode in two by prefacing the main action with two new acts, set before International Rescue's founding, which focus on the nuclear explosion in Australia, the resulting fallout and the Hood's theft of the Mighty Atom. Consequently, the first 18 minutes of the completed episode feature none of the regular characters. \\"The Mighty Atom\\" is the only episode of Thunderbirds to feature all of the regular characters and all of the Thunderbirds machines. It also marks the first appearance of Thunderbird 4 in the series. Broadcast and reception The two-part version that was broadcast in some UK regions separates the older footage from the material that was filmed for the episode's expansion. Certain scenes were altered to create this format; these include one of a news conference in Melbourne, which was shortened, and another in which the Tracy brothers play a practical joke on Lady Penelope, which was removed completely. Critical response \\"The Mighty Atom\\" is named the worst episode of Thunderbirds by TV Zone magazine. Commenting that \\"for the first half of the episode we're left wondering where International Rescue is\\", the review also notes the ineptitude of the Hood and criticises the episode's \\"lazy\\" writing, point out that the villain's plans are thwarted by nothing more than Penelope's fear of mice. Tom Fox of Starburst magazine is more positive, arguing that the episode contains \\"plenty of curious aspects\\" to compensate for the Hood's \\"outlandish\\" plans; he gives a rating of three out of five. Chris Bentley, author of The Complete Book of Thunderbirds, describes the episode as \\"surprisingly effective\\" despite International Rescue's absence from most of its first half. He regards the scenes featuring the radioactive cloud as some of the \\"eeriest\\" of the series. Marcus Hearn, author of Thunderbirds: The Vault, considers the \\"sinister\\" music accompanying these scenes to be the episode's most effective element; however, he believes that the appearance of Penelope and Parker \\"clutters\\" the plot. He also argues that Penelope's phobia \\"diminishes\\" her character just as the Hood's ill-conceived plans lead the viewer to suspect that he \\"may not be quite the criminal mastermind his reputation suggests\\". In her 1991 autobiography, Sylvia Anderson wrote that the Mighty Atom itself \\"strains credibility\\" while comparing the nuclear explosion in the episode's first act to the real-life Chernobyl disaster. Michael Park of the website WhatCulture expresses similar thoughts, arguing that the episode essentially \\"predicted\\" Chernobyl: \\"... at the height of the Cold War, this episode will have given a lot of children (and adults) sleepless nights.\\" Media historian Nicholas J. Cull notes that like \\"The Man From MI.5\\" and \\"Atlantic Inferno\\", \\"The Mighty Atom\\" plays on themes of \\"nuclear weapons and wider nuclear fears in general\\". Fred McNamara of the website ScreenRelish considers a scene in which Parker and Kyrano fight over which of them should be allowed to serve drinks to be the fourth-best moment of the entire series: \\"... it's hard for any Thunderbirds fan not to smirk slightly when watching this, and knowing that both Kyrano and Parker had their voices provided by the same actor!\\" References External links  Category:1965 British television episodes Category:Deserts in fiction Category:Melbourne in fiction Category:Television episodes about artificial intelligence Category:Television episodes about nuclear accidents Category:Television episodes about robots Category:Television episodes set in Africa Category:Television episodes set in Australia Category:Thunderbirds (TV series) episodes ","title":"The Mighty Atom (Thunderbirds)"},{"id":"8135293","text":"The Testament of Freedom is a four-movement work for men's chorus and piano composed in 1943 by Randall Thompson. It was premiered on April 13, 1943, by the Virginia Glee Club under the direction of Stephen Tuttle; the composer served as pianist. Thompson later orchestrated the piece, and also produced an arrangement for mixed chorus. The music was published in 1944. History The piece was written for the Virginia Glee Club while Thompson was teaching at the University of Virginia, and was meant to celebrate the bicentennial of the birth of Thomas Jefferson; consequently, the text for the work was taken from Jefferson's writings. Although it was meant as an occasional work, the piece was soon seen as an opportunity to project an uplifting message about the United States in wartime; its premiere was recorded by CBS and quickly broadcast nationwide. It was also transmitted by shortwave radio over the United States Office of War Information (OWI) network to Allied servicemen stationed in Europe. On April 14, 1945, it was performed by Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall as part of a concert in memory of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died two days earlier. The piece continues to be popular and is performed frequently by men's choruses. Style The first of the piece's four movements is similar in style to a hymn; it opens with a five-note instrumental invocation meant to rhythmically spell out the name \\"Thomas Jefferson\\". The melody used in the movement reappears in various forms throughout the rest of the piece. The second movement is slower in nature, and resembles a dirge; numerous writers, including Virgil Thomson, commented on its resemblance to Eastern Orthodox chant. The third movement is a scherzo, while the fourth recapitulates themes heard in the other movements. The work ends with a return of the initial melody and text.

Route and landmarks Hudson Street has two distinct one-way traffic patterns that meet at Abingdon Square, at the street's intersection with Eighth Avenue and Bleecker Street. The southern portion of Hudson Street carries northbound traffic and begins at the intersection of West Broadway and Chambers Street. At Abingdon Square, the traffic is directed onto Eighth Avenue. Meanwhile, the section of Hudson Street north of Abingdon Square runs from 14th Street to Eighth Avenue. At 14th Street, southbound traffic from Ninth Avenue splits off into this street. Just below 14th Street, it is one of the major streets in the Meatpacking District. At Abingdon Square, traffic on Hudson Street goes into Bleecker Street. 60 Hudson Street, the former Western Union headquarters that later was converted into an internet hub, is located between Worth and Thomas Streets in Tribeca. Just to the north, the former New York Mercantile Exchange building is located at the corner of Hudson and Harrison Streets in Tribeca. Other notable buildings on this stretch of Hudson Street include The Church of St. Luke in the Fields and its garden, the White Horse Tavern (notorious for being the bar where poet Dylan Thomas drank and collapsed before he died of alcohol poisoning), and the headquarters of radio station WQHT (\\"Hot 97\\"), which has been the site of several shootings including a gunfight between the entourages of 50 Cent and The Game in 2005.

It premiered on the Fox network on . It was written by Paul Brown, directed by Michael Lange, and featured guest appearances by Steve Railsback, Nicholas Lea, Steven Williams and Sheila Larken. The episode helped explore the series' overarching mythology. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. However, the events of \\"Ascension\\" are a continuation of the plot of the preceding episode, \\"Duane Barry\\". Following the kidnapping of Scully by an unhinged alien abductee Duane Barry (Steve Railsback), Mulder races to track her down. The decision to have the character of Scully abducted was driven by necessity, as Anderson had become pregnant and required time off from production. \\"Ascension\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.6, being watched by 9.2 million households in its initial broadcast, and received positive reviews from critics.  Plot  Upon hearing the voicemail showing Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) kidnapping by Duane Barry, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) heads to her apartment and surveys the crime scene. He meets with Scully's mother, Margaret, who claims to have had a dream about her being taken away. The next morning, Assistant Director Walter Skinner tells Mulder that he is \\"too close\\" to the case to be involved, and orders Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), to escort him home. Meanwhile, Barry speeds down the Blue Ridge Parkway when he is pulled over by a highway patrol officer. When Scully‚Äîlocked in the trunk‚Äîtries to get the officer's attention, Barry kills him. Mulder reviews a video of the traffic stop, and sees that Scully is still alive. Mulder realizes that Barry is heading to a ski resort at Skyland Mountain, the location of Barry's original abduction; he is attempting to follow through with his original plan of having the aliens abduct someone there in his place. Krycek informs the Smoking Man (William B. Davis) of these findings before departing with Mulder. When they arrive, Mulder boards the resort's aerial tramway in the hopes of reaching its peak before Barry. However, Krycek tries to delay Mulder by sabotaging the tramway's journey upward. Mulder manages to complete the journey and witnesses a strange light in the area. Upon finding Barry's car, Mulder sees no trace of Scully except her necklace. He then encounters a joyous Barry, who claims that she was taken by \\"them.\\" When Mulder interrogates Barry, he becomes so enraged that he nearly strangles him, only to stop himself. When he leaves the room, he orders Krycek to not let anyone inside; however, he finds Krycek talking to Barry when he returns. When Skinner arrives moments later, Barry breaks into convulsions and dies. Later, at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Mulder attempts to question the doctor who performed Barry's autopsy; she refuses to provide details since it was performed by the military instead of the FBI, claiming no other doctors were available. Krycek meets with the Smoking Man, and suggests that they kill Mulder. However, the Smoking Man orders that Mulder be left alive, unless they want to risk \\"turning one man's religion into a crusade\\". Mulder and Krycek are ordered to take a polygraph test about Barry's death. A desperate Mulder tries to visit Senator Matheson, a patron of his work, only to be discouraged from doing so by his secretive informant, X (Steven Williams). In Krycek's car, Mulder finds spent cigarettes from the Smoking Man's meeting with Krycek. Realizing his role in Scully's abduction, Mulder submits a report to Skinner accusing Krycek of impeding his investigation and killing Barry. Skinner summons Krycek to his office, only to learn that he has disappeared. Skinner then announces to Mulder that he is officially re-opening the X-Files. Mulder meets with Margaret Scully in a park, and tries to give her Scully's necklace. Margaret returns the necklace to Mulder, asking that he give it to Scully when he finds her. Margaret also says that she had the dream again about losing her daughter; Mulder takes this as a hopeful sign that Scully may still be alive. A mournful Mulder later returns to Skyland Mountain, to the field where Scully was abducted. Seemingly alone without her, he looks up into the stars.Lowry, pp. 173‚Äì174Lovece, pp. 120‚Äì122  Production  The idea to have Scully abducted originated when Gillian Anderson became pregnant in the middle of the first season. While initially upset, those in charge of the show never considered dropping the actress from the show. Ideas such as having Scully give birth to an alien baby were dismissed and ultimately the writers decided to work around the pregnancy by closing the X-Files, separating Mulder and Scully, and eventually having her be abducted. This permitted the producers to have an explanation for Scully's absence (she appears in only two scenes in \\"Ascension\\" and not at all in the next episode, \\"3\\").Lowry, pp. 23‚Äì25 Series creator Chris Carter commented that both the censors and the producers were reluctant on showing Scully in the trunk, but he \\"fought for that image\\" as he considered it conveyed the sense of danger to the character. Carter added the scenes of the experiment were meant to be ambiguous on whether Scully was abducted by aliens, the military, or both. \\"Ascension\\" featured guest appearances from Steve Railsback, Nicholas Lea, Steven Williams and Sheila Larken. David Duchovny provided his own stunts in this episode,Lowry, p. 175 including being dangled in the aerial lift, shot in a single day at Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver, British Columbia. The backdrop for Barry's drive was done in a neighbouring mountain, Mount Seymour.Gradnitzer and Pittson, p. 66 The tagline for this episode is \\"Deny Everything\\", replacing the usual phrase \\"The Truth is Out There.\\"Lovece, p. 120  Broadcast and reception  \\"Ascension\\" premiered on the Fox network on , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.6 with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 9.6 percent of all television-equipped households, and of households watching TV, were tuned in to the episode. A total of households watched this episode during its original airing.Lowry, p. 249 In a retrospective of the second season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated an A, being described as \\"an expertly paced race against time\\". The handling of Anderson's pregnancy was called \\"creative\\", while the re-opening of the X-Files unit and the exposure of Krycek as a villainous character were noted as highlights. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen called \\"Ascension\\" an \\"essential\\" episode, adding that it serves to \\"raise the stakes without losing the core of the show's appeal, and solve a technical problem in the most creatively satisfying way possible\\". Handlen also praised Nicholas Lea's portrayal of agent Alex Krycek, but felt that the character's role as a double agent was revealed too soon in the series. Critical Myth gave this episode 9/10, stating \\"[a]s convoluted and bastardized as that plot thread would become, at this stage of the game, it was one of the best episodes of the series to date.\\" Footnotes Bibliography  *  External links  *\\"Ascension\\" on TheXFiles.com  Category:1994 American television episodes Category:The X-Files (season 2) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Virginia it:Episodi di X-Files (prima stagione)#Omicidi del terzo tipo hu:Gumiember (X-akt√°k) no:Ascension ","title":"Ascension (The X-Files)"},{"id":"8135420","text":"t.A.T.u. in the famous \\"Khuy Voyne!\\" shirts.

He was a talented fielder and a perennial All-Star during the 1940s. Born in Pittsburgh, Miller made his Major League debut with the Cincinnati Reds in 1936 as a 19-year-old. He played in 41 games over 2 seasons with the Reds before being traded to the New York Yankees in 1938 in exchange for Willard Hershberger. Miller never played for the Yankees at the major league level and was subsequently traded to the Boston Bees less than a year later. He became the starting shortstop while in Boston, and established himself as one of the National League's best shortstops during his four seasons there. His first season with Boston was shortened when he fractured his ankle in a collision with Al Simmons. He recovered in 1940 to a career-best .276 for the Bees while leading all NL shortstops in fielding percentage and appearing in the MLB All-Star Game. While his batting average fell over the next two seasons with Boston, he led all shortstops in fielding percentage both years. He was an All-Star in 1941 and was named as a starter in the All-Star Game in 1942. After the 1942 season, he was traded back to the Reds in exchange for Eddie Joost and Nate Andrews. He spent five seasons as the Reds' starting shortstop and earned four more selections to the All-Star Game while with the club. He continued to play solid defense while with Cincinnati, and he led all shortstops in fielding on two further occasions. His final year with the Reds was one of his better seasons as a hitter, as he led the league in doubles and was among the top 10 in home runs and runs batted in. He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for Johnny Wyrostek before the start of the 1948 season. Miller served as the Phillies' shortstop in 1948 but moved to second base in 1949 when he swapped positions with Granny Hamner. After two average seasons with Philadelphia, he was acquired by the St. Louis Cardinals for the 1950 season, his last in the majors. Miller died in 1997 in Lake Worth, Florida.

Mills received her B.A. from the University of Virginia in 1987, where she was Phi Beta Kappa, and her J.D. from Stanford Law School in 1990, where she was elected to Stanford Law Review. She worked as an associate at the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson. While there, she represented school districts seeking to achieve racial integration per Brown v. Board of Education. White House counsel After serving as Deputy General Counsel of the Clinton/Gore Transition Planning Foundation after Clinton's 1992 election, she served as Associate Counsel to the President in the White House from 1993 on. Until the impeachment, she was little known to the public, although she did rise to public attention when a burglar reportedly broke into her car and stole documents relating to the handling of the late Vincent Foster's papers related to the Whitewater controversy, as well as the 1993 federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco.https://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-15/news/mn-24214_1_white-house During the impeachment trial, the BBC reported that she was \\"widely regarded as the shining star of the defense team, and gave an effective presentation on President Clinton's behalf on the second day of defense arguments.\\" Other media outlets also viewed her work quite favorably.

Professor of Law, Washington University in St. Louis: \\"There is no single answer to the question of client identity for government lawyers.\\" Law Professor Patricia Salkin writes in The Urban Lawyer that \\"government lawyers would be well advised to caution their government clients, particularly if the client is believed to be an individual public official, about the uncertainty of the privilege for what may be about to be disclosed\\". Mills' attorney raised this protection in May 2016, as Mills was being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with the investigation of Clinton's private email server.Zapotosky, Matt (May 10, 2016). \\"Clinton aide Cheryl Mills leaves FBI interview briefly after being asked about emails\\".

In 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reiterated that government lawyers may not exercise an attorney-client privilege in an effort to shield information from a grand jury. \\"....government lawyers have a higher, competing duty to act in the public interest. Lindsey, 158 F.3d at 1273; Comment to ABA Model Rule 1.13 (noting that government lawyers may have higher duty to rectify wrongful official acts despite general rule of confidentiality). They take an oath, separate from their bar oath, to uphold the United States Constitution and the laws of this nation (and usually the laws of the state they serve when, as was the case with Bickel, they are state employees). Their compensation comes not from a client whose interests they are sworn to protect from the power of the state, but from the state itself and the public fisc.2 It would be both unseemly and a misuse of public assets to permit a public official to use a taxpayer-provided attorney to conceal from the taxpayers themselves otherwise admissible evidence of financial wrongdoing, official misconduct, or abuse of power. Compare Nixon, 418 U.S. at 713, 94 S.Ct. 3090 (qualified executive privilege applies in the face of a criminal investigation). Therefore, when another government lawyer requires information as part of a criminal investigation, the public lawyer is obligated not to protect his governmental client but to ensure its compliance with the law. ....a government attorney should have no privilege to shield relevant information from the public citizens to whom she owes ultimate allegiance, as represented by the grand jury.\\" On June 18, 2018 U.S. Senators posed questions regarding Miss Mills and her colleague Heather Samuelson within the unprecedented relationships between her government duties and her private practice in light of possible scenario of obstruction of justice to Michael Horowitz and Christopher Wray.https://www.c-span.org/video/?446804-1/doj-inspector-general-fbi- director-testify-clinton-email-probe-report&live;&vod; Horowitz indicated that the decision to delete emails would have been limited to \\"non-work related\\" emails.

She served as the United States' representative on the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC). Shortly after taking office Secretary Clinton asked Mills to lead an interagency consultation of current agriculture and food security efforts. The subsequent strategy became (Feed the Future). The Obama administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years to boost agricultural productivity. Describing the importance of food security Mills said, \\"We are always worried whenever people can't feed themselves. And particularly worried when that actually might translate to destabilization of a country.

First broadcast on the Fox network on , the episode was written by Glen Morgan, James Wong and Chris Ruppenthal, directed by David Nutter, and featured guest appearances by Perrey Reeves and Malcolm Stewart. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. Following on from the abduction of Dana Scully in the previous episode, \\"Ascension\\", \\"3\\" was the first episode of The X-Files not to feature series star Gillian Anderson. The episode earned 9 million households during its first broadcast, and received mixed reviews from both critics and the show's cast and crew. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder is brought in to investigate a series of ritualistic murders in Los Angeles, which he first believes were the work of a cult. However, it turns out that the perpetrators are a group of vampires.  Plot  In Los Angeles, Garrett Lorre, a middle-aged businessman, embarks on a one night stand with an anonymous woman he has met at a corporate party. However, as they are having sex in his hot tub, the woman bites Lorre to drink his blood. Two other men join the woman, helping her kill Lorre by repeatedly stabbing him using hypodermic needles. The following day, before departing for Los Angeles, Fox Mulder stores the missing Dana Scully's FBI badge in an X-File and files it under her name. At the crime scene, Mulder meets with the LAPD detectives investigating the case, explaining that Lorre's murder is the latest in a series of seemingly vampiric serial killings that have spanned two other states. Because the killers write biblical passages in the victims' blood, Mulder believes that they view themselves as an \\"Unholy Trinity\\". Mulder visits a local blood bank where a night watchman has been recently hired. Mulder has him arrested after he is caught drinking blood in the facility's storeroom. During his interrogation, the suspect tells Mulder that he belongs to a trio of vampires who desire immortality; he is known as \\"The Son\\" while the other two, a man and a woman, are called \\"The Father\\" and \\"The Unholy Spirit\\". Mulder does not believe The Son's claims. However, at sunrise, The Son is burned to death when sunlight from the window touches his flesh. Mulder is taken aback, having previously assumed vampires to be purely mythological. During an examination of The Son's body, Mulder discovers a tattoo for Club Tepes, a local vampire club. There, he comes across a young woman named Kristen Kilar who partakes in the consumption of blood. Mulder, having his suspicion aroused, follows Kristen after she and another club patron, David Yung, leave for an erotic liaison; he initially fears that Kristen is targeting Yung, but is beaten by Yung when he catches the agent spying on them. After Mulder leaves, Yung is murdered by the three killers, although the reason is not known. Mulder runs a background check into Kristen, discovering that she formerly lived in Memphis and Portland‚Äîboth the previous locations of earlier murders. Mulder assists the LAPD in searching Kristen's home, where he finds various blood-related paraphernalia. When Kristen arrives later, Mulder is waiting for her. Kristen tells Mulder that she met The Son in Chicago and that they had engaged in \\"blood sports\\" together. Later, Kristen fled The Son as he formed the Unholy Trinity with his accomplices and began their killing spree, following her across the country. Mulder and Kristen soon kiss while The Son, who has returned from the dead, looks on. The next morning, The Son confronts Kristen and tells her that by killing Mulder and drinking the blood of a \\"believer\\", she will become one of them. Kristen approaches Mulder with a knife but instead stabs The Father, who is hiding in the bedroom. The Son attacks Mulder but is subdued. Mulder and Kristen try to escape using a car parked in the garage, but the Unholy Spirit jumps onto the car hood and attacks Mulder after smashing the windscreen. Kristen jumps into the drivers seat and drives into her, impaling her on a wooden peg on the wall. Kristen tricks Mulder into running outside of the house while she goes back inside and pours gasoline around herself and The Son. Kristen lights a match, blowing up the house and taking her own life in order to kill the other vampires. Firefighters and police find four bodies in the wreckage while Mulder stares at Scully's cross necklace.Lowry, pp.176‚Äì177Lovece, pp.123‚Äì125  Production  Howard Gordon was originally supposed to write the seventh episode of the season, but when he became unavailable Glen Morgan and James Wong, who were working on writing the eighth episode of the season, agreed to rewrite a freelance script provided by Chris Ruppenthal. The writers had to do significant edits, but retained the main plot surrounding three vampires.Edwards, p.102Lovece, p.126 Club Tepes, named after Prince Vlad Tepes‚Äîbetter known as Vlad the Impaler, who was the inspiration for Dracula‚Äîwas shot inside a closed-down and redecorated nightclub, with extras recruited from other Vancouver clubs. The location for Kristen's house was the mansion of hockey player Pavel Bure, then the leading name of the Vancouver Canucks. The producers had an agreement for the late filming from all but one of Bure's neighbors, who was absent during the petitioning. Said neighbor later tried to sue Fox, only agreeing to let production continue after receiving an indenization.Gradnitzer and Pittson, p. 67 Perrey Reeves, who played Kristen, was David Duchovny's real-life girlfriend at the time. Speaking of Mulder's possible sexual encounter with Kristen, series creator Chris Carter said, \\"I thought, 'This guy's a monk. Let's let him be a human. Especially in [Scully's] absence, it seemed like a perfect opportunity to do it.\\"Lowry, p.177 Duchovny had previously acted alongside another real-life girlfriend, Maggie Wheeler, in the first season episode \\"Born Again\\".Lovece, p.100 Gillian Anderson is absent from the episode as she was on leave to give birth to her daughter Piper at the time. This episode was the first in which Scully did not appear.Lowry, p.176 Reception The romantic scenes between David Duchovny and his then-girlfriend Perrey Reeves (pictured) were widely criticized. Ratings \\"3\\" premiered on the Fox network on , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.4, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 9.4 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 9 million households.Lowry, p.249 Reviews \\"3\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Sarah Stegall, in The Munchkyn Zone, gave the episode a 5 out of 5 rating. Stegall referred to it as a \\"compelling story\\" with \\"excellent special effects\\". She commended Duchovny's performance, saying he is \\"definitely at the top of his form in this episode\\". While writing about vampire-related television shows for Metacritic, Zeenat Burns described the episode as \\"wretched\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a C, criticizing the fact that it did not explore enough the \\"promising premise\\" of Scully's absence. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also considered that without said premise \\"deserve[d] better than to be background noise for a by-the-numbers erotic thriller\\". Handlen described Mulder and Kristen's \\"tedious romance\\" as \\"all kinds of misguided\\", and felt the episode indulged in \\"lazy writing\\" regarding the over-explored theme of vampires which resulted in \\"terrible dialogue and heavy-handed attempts at mood\\". He still praised David Duchovny's performance and felt the first twenty minutes were \\"endurable trash\\" with a \\"serious USA Up All Night vibe\\". Co-writer Glen Morgan felt doing an episode on vampires was a mistake, and said that they were also criticized for having Mulder fall for Kristen. Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, saying that the script was a lot better than the show and that the episode was weakened when Fox censors had problems with the episode.Edwards, pp.64‚Äì65 Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.Lowry, p.178  See also  *List of vampire television series Footnotes Bibliography    External links  *\\"3\\" on TheXFiles.com  Category:1994 American television episodes Category:Blood in fiction Category:Television episodes set in Los Angeles Category:The X-Files (season 2) episodes Category:Television episodes about vampires Category:Television episodes about murder ","title":"3 (The X-Files)"},{"id":"8135540","text":"Altƒ±nkaya Dam The Altƒ±nkaya Dam is a rock-fill dam for irrigation and hydro power purposes, located on the River Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak, 23 km south of Bafra and 35 km west of Samsun in northern Turkey.

She is known for her discoveries involving RNA, including ground-breaking insights into how ribosomes interact with messenger RNA by complementary base pairing and that introns are spliced by small nuclear ribonucleic proteins (snRNPs), which occur in eukaryotes., iBioMagazine In September, 2018, Steitz won the Lasker-Koshland Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science. The Lasker award is often referred to as the 'American Nobel' because 87 of the former recipients have gone on to win Nobel prizes.  Early life and education  Steitz was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Steitz CV, Yale She grew up in Minnesota in the 1950s and 60s at a time when there were no female role models in molecular biology. She attended the then all-girls Northrop College for high school. In 1963, Steitz received her Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Antioch College, Ohio, where she first became interested in molecular biology at Alex Rich's Massachusetts Institute of Technology laboratory as an Antioch \\"coop\\" intern. After completing her undergraduate degree, Steitz applied to medical school rather than graduate school since she knew of female medical doctors but not women scientists. ASCB Profile: Joan Argetsinger Steitz, June 2006. She was accepted to Harvard Medical School, but having been excited by a summer working as a bench scientist in the laboratory of Joseph Gall at the University of Minnesota, she declined the invitation to Harvard Medical School and instead applied to Harvard's new program in biochemistry and molecular biology. There, she was the first female graduate student to join the laboratory of Nobel Laureate James Watson, with whom she first worked on bacteriophage RNA.Margaret A. Woodbury, \\"Trailblazer Turned Superstar,\\" HHMI Bulletin, Feb. 2006.  Career  Steitz completed postdoctoral research at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) at the University of Cambridge (UK), where she collaborated with Francis Crick, Sydney Brenner, and Mark Bretscher. At the LMB, Steitz focused on the question of how bacteria know where to start the \\"reading frame\\" on mRNA. In the process, Steitz discovered the exact sequences on a mature RNA virus encoding three proteins where the virus mRNA binds bacterial ribosomes to produce proteins. In 1969 she published a seminal paper in Nature showing the nucleotide sequence of the binding start points. In 1970, Steitz joined the faculty at Yale. In 1975, she published a research finding for which she is widely known, demonstrating that ribosomes use complementary base pairing to identify the start site on mRNA.Joan Steitz ‚Äì Biography, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Digital archives In 1980, Steitz in collaboration with Michael Lerner published another critical paper, using immunoprecipitation with human antibodies from patients with autoimmunity to isolate and identify the novel entities snRNPs (pronounced \\"snurps\\") and detect their role in splicing. A snRNP is a specific short length of RNA, around 150 nucleotides long, associated with protein, that is involved in splicing introns out of newly transcribed RNA (pre-mRNA), a component of the spliceosomes. Steitz's paper \\"set the field ahead by light years and heralded the avalanche of small RNAs that have since been discovered to play a role in multiple steps in RNA biosynthesis,\\" noted Susan Berget. Steitz later discovered another kind of snRNP particle, the snoRNP, involved in an important minority of mRNA splicing reactions. Via analysis of the genetic locations of the genes for snoRNPs, she demonstrated conclusively that introns are not \\"junk DNA\\" as they had often been described. Her work helps explain the phenomenon of \\"alternative RNA splicing.\\"Thomas R.

He was a major influence in the development of mathematical statistics as an academic discipline. Born in Waterbury, Connecticut, Carver was educated at the University of Michigan, earning his B.S. degree in 1915, and the next year becoming an instructor in mathematics; he taught statistics in actuarial applications. At the time, the University of Michigan was only the second such institution in the United States to offer this type of course, after the pioneering Iowa State University. Carver was appointed assistant professor at Michigan in 1918, then associate professor (1921) and full professor (1936); during this period the University's program in mathematical statistics and probability underwent significant expansion. In 1930 Carver founded the journal Annals of Mathematical Statistics, which over time became an important periodical in the field. Financial support, however, was lacking in the midst of the Great Depression; in January 1934 Carver undertook financial responsibility for the Annals and maintained the existence of the journal at his own expense. In 1935 he helped to start the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, which in 1938 assumed control over the journal; Samuel S. Wilks succeeded Carver as editor in the same year. The Institute has named its Harry C. Carver Medal after him. With the coming of World War II, Carver devoted his energies to solving problems in aerial navigation, an interest he maintained for the remainder of his life.

When she was very young, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York, and she became involved in acting as a child, performing her first stage role at the age of six. As a child actress, her theatrical parts included title roles in Little Lord Fauntleroy and Editha's Burglar. In the 1890s she was part of a stock company in Milwaukee that was managed by Edwin Thanhouser, whom she married in 1900.Gertrude Homan Thanhouser Biography entry on Thanhouser website , retrieved August 23, 2012 In the spring of 1909, Gertrude moved with her husband to New Rochelle, New York where they established Thanhouser Company as an independent motion picture studio; it was the first to be organized by leaders with strong theatrical training. Gertrude's acting career of fourteen years gave her the stagecraft to be a powerful and creative force in this new venture. She received co-scenario writing credit with brother-in-law, Lloyd Lonergan, for the screen adaptation of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. Behind the scenes, Gertrude was heavily involved in scenario development, creation of mise en sc√®ne and film editing. In 1912, the Thanhousers sold their shares in the company to Charles J. Hite of Mutual Film Corporation for $250,000 and retired from the industry. In August 1914, Hite was killed in an automobile accident. In February 1915, the Mutual board of directors in an extraordinary move lured Edwin and Gertrude out of retirement.Mabel Condon, \\"The Thanhousers are Back on the Job\\" Motography (March 13, 1915): 407. Gertrude immediately resumed her role as supervisor of the scenario department and was credited for writing the scenario for their first \\"new\\" release, Their One Love. She remained active in company affairs including attending a meeting with President Woodrow Wilson in 1916. In the summer of 1916 the death of Thanhouser leading actress Florence LaBadie and the rise of feature films with stars such as Mary Pickford contributed to the decline in popularity of the studio's films. In 1918, the founders retired permanently from the film industry leaving the Thanhouser Film Corporation with a positive bank balance, unlike many others of the era.Thanhouser Films: An Encyclopedia and History, Q.

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., WIOD serves as the Miami affiliate for: ABC News Radio; The Glenn Beck Program, The Rush Limbaugh Show, The Sean Hannity Show, The Schnitt Show and Coast to Coast AM; and syndicated personalities Clyde Lewis and Bill Cunningham. The WIOD studios are located in the Miami suburb of Miramar, while the station transmitter resides in nearby North Bay Village. Besides its main analog transmission, WIOD simulcasts over the HD subchannel of co-owned WBGG-FM, and streams online via iHeartRadio. Usually powered full-time at 5,000 watts, WIOD is one of multiple AM stations in the region that operate with increased power via special temporary authority from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) due to interference from a Cuban radio stations intentionally overriding their signals. History Experimental broadcasts began in the spring of 1925 by Carl Graham Fisher, a Miami Beach developer. The station formally signed on the air on January 19, 1926. Carl Fisher selected WIOD as the call sign, signifying the \\"Wonderful Isle of Dreams\\" to commemorate Collins Island, on which the station's studios and offices were situated. WIOD is Florida's seventh oldest continuously licensed broadcast radio station. From 1959 to 1962, the call letters were changed to WCKR (for Cox-Knight Broadcasting, which also owned television station WCKT, now WSVN). Branded Wacker Radio, it broadcast middle of the road music, but offered Top 40 hits at night, featuring noted South Florida disc jockey Rick Shaw. WIOD also carried NBC Radio's \\"Monitor\\" program on weekends. To accommodate WCKT, a new addition housing television studios was built on Broadcast Key in North Bay Village, Florida. On June 16, 1981, WIOD began operating with 10,000 watts day and night to overcome interference caused by a high-power station in Cuba. This special temporary authority, granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has been renewed on a regular basis since then. On April 6, 2017, WIOD filed an application for an FCC construction permit to move to a new transmitter site, increase day power to 50,000 watts and increase night power to 20,000 watts. It was accepted for filing the following day. But iHeartMedia has not built the new facility yet. WIOD has been a frequent winner in annual Florida Associated Press statewide competitions. WIOD may be best known for its continuous storm coverage, particularly during Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma. WIOD was the radio flagship station of the 2006 NBA champions Miami Heat basketball team from 1996 until 2008. From 1966 until 2001, it was the radio flagship of the Miami Dolphins football team, the longest partnership between a Miami sports team and a radio flagship station. It also was the Florida Panthers' original flagship station from 1993 until 2003. Currently, WIOD is the official broadcast emergency station for the Broward County Commission. From April 2010 to March 2014, WIOD had been simulcast on FM translator W262AN at 100.3 MHz. That frequency is now used by a low-power FM station, WQNB. WIOD is also heard on the WBGG-FM 105.9 HD-2 subchannel. Former Personalities WIOD's former hosts include Larry King, Neil Rogers, Sally Jessy Raphael, Ron Bennington, Mike Reineri, Bill Calder, Alan Burke, Sandy Peyton, Rick and Suds, Hank Goldberg, Ed Berliner, Randi Rhodes, Big Wilson, Chris Baker, Phil Hendrie, Joey Reynolds, Tom Gauger, Dave Lamont, Tom Leykis, Jack Ellery, and Ed Arnold. Former full-time anchors include Mike Woulfe, Lori Shepard, Lauren Pastrana, Patty DeMendoza, Wendi Grossman, Andrew Julian, Ron Hersey, Aron Bender, Randy Lantz, Christina Kautz, and John Levitt. Mike Reineri hosted the last music show on WIOD from 6 to 10 a.m. Monday through Friday from 1974 to 1989, until the station switched to a full time talk format. He was still with WIOD till 1992. Reineri's traffic reporter, Dave Mitchell, hosted the show on Saturday and Sunday mornings in the same time slot. Longtime anchor and News Director Lori Shepard left WIOD in August 2013. Other traffic reporters on WIOD in the 1980s and 1990s and 2003-2007 were Miami radio veterans: Richard Lewis, Joe Brennan, George Sheldon, Teri Griffin and Don Anthony (Dave Agony from the WAXY FM days). Joe Brennan left I-Heart's WIOD in 2018, Don Anthony (aka Don Agony) retired from radio broadcasting in 2009, George Sheldon retired from radio/television broadcasting 1/31/2013 in Asheville, NC, Teri Griffin (retired from broadcasting and has moved out of South Florida), and Trish Anderson (deceased). Since 1989 WIOD has had a news-talk format. Jingles best remembered at WIOD have included: \\"WIOD/Someplace Special,\\" \\"The sunshine machine is coming your way/WIOD\\", \\"Mike Reineri/will get you started and on your way/every morning on WIOD\\", \\"Your Hometown Station/WIOD\\", \\"Go Dolphins! on WIOD\\" \\"The Miami Heat on WIOD/The Game's On Us/WIOD.\\" WIOD primarily used TM Productions jingles during the 1970s, mostly resung from KDKA packages. The station did not have an image song until it had JAM Creative Productions' \\"First of All\\" jingle package resung and customized for them in the mid-1980s. Other JAM jingle series that were reworked to accommodate the six-note WIOD logo include \\"The Spirit of New England,\\" \\"New Day,\\" \\"Superstation\\" and \\"New York Fan\\". WFAN New York's jingle melody is actually modeled after WIOD's jingle melody, and, when WIOD had \\"New York Fan\\" resung for them, the station ordered a custom package, \\"Extra Innings\\", to accompany the \\"New York Fan\\" jingles. All JAM Creative Productions jingle series used by WIOD remain available from the company. Programming Weekdays begin with a morning talk and information drive time show, South Florida's First News with Jimmy Cefalo, followed by Brian Mudd in late mornings. The rest of the weekday schedule is made up of nationally syndicated conservative talk programs, including Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Todd Schnitt, Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis, Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal. Weekends feature Live on Sunday Night, It's Bill Cunningham. WIOD has local news 24 hours a day and traffic reports around the clock every 15 minutes. World and national news is supplied by ABC News Radio. WIOD also has a news and weather sharing agreement with NBC affiliate WTVJ (channel 6). Controversy In June 2007, the all-Democratic county commission in Broward County was on the verge of rejecting WIOD as the official channel for emergency information because of concerns it is also home to Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk show hosts. On his radio show Rush Limbaugh said, \\"They are politicizing the delivery of emergency news, which is non-partisan.\\"\\"Broward County Democrats Risk Floridians' Lives to Protest Rush\\".

Background  Guns with a 4.5 inch calibre have been the standard medium-calibre gun of the Royal Navy for use against surface, aircraft and shore targets since 1938. The current 55-calibre Mark 8 gun replaced the World War II era 45-calibre QF 4.5-inch Mk I ‚Äì V naval guns. Like all British 4.5 inch naval guns, it has a calibre of 4.45 inches (113 mm).Jane's Ammunition Handbook, 1999‚Äì2000 Edition. http://www.janes.com/  Design  A completely new type of 4.5 inch gun with a longer 55-calibre barrel, it was designed in the 1960s for the Royal Navy's new classes of frigates and destroyers. The new weapon, built by Vickers Ltd Armament Division, was developed by the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment using the Ordnance, QF 105 mm L13 of the Abbot self-propelled gun as a starting point (it used electrical primers). The outer shell of the gunhouse is built from glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). The new weapon emphasised reliability and rapid response to fire first round from shutdown state (particularly for defence against missiles) over a high rate of fire, allowing a switch to a lighter, single barrel mounting and ammunition of a one-piece design. The gun system has a combination of electrical and hydraulic components and the full system penetrates up to three deck levels below the weather deck; deep magazine, gun control room and power room, gunbay and the gunhouse. The weapon is semi-automatic and can be operated by a smaller crew than its predecessors. With no personnel in the gunhouse, loading is supported by personnel in the gunbay to load the feed ring and in the deep-magazine to pass ammunition to the gunbay. The captain of the gun in the control room ensures continued weapon readiness and the gun controller in the operations room aims and fires the weapon. The gun has a rate of fire of about 25 rounds per minute and a range of 12 nm (22 km; 27.5 km with the newer High Explosive Extended Range round). The first recipient of the new gun and mount, the Mark 8, was the Iranian frigate Zaal in 1971. The gun entered Royal Navy service in 1973 on the new destroyer Bristol. These guns proved to be less reliable than the older 4.5 inch Mark V gun (redesignated Mark 6 gun mounting) during the Falklands War, being forced to cease fire on several occasions due to faults.Navweaps.com The first major modification to the mounting, the Mod 1, was developed in 1998 in two tranches; replacing the gunhouse with a reduced radar cross section assembly and replacing the hydraulic loading mechanism with an all-electric system.

At the beginning of the Civil War, Cummings used his political influence to be appointed as a special purchasing agent for the War Department. Unfortunately, Cummings wasted much of his $2,000,000 budget, and was discharged for ineptitude and profiteering. After leaving the War Department, Cummings recruited the Nineteenth Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry. In February 1864, Cummings was made Superintendent of Colored Troops for the Department of Arkansas, and was brevetted to the rank of Brigadier General by President Johnson. U.S. President Andrew Johnson appointed Cummings the new Governor of the Territory of Colorado on October 17, 1865, to replace John Evans who resigned following the Sand Creek Massacre. Cummings served as Territorial Governor until April 27, 1867. The 1866 election to replace Cummings (between Alexander Cameron Hunt and George Chilcott) was marked with scandal when it was revealed the votes had been illegally counted in Chilcott's favor.

At age 15 he began his lifelong commitment to painting, studying under LeMoine Fitzgerald and Frank Franz Johnston A.R.C.A. members of Canada's renowned Group of Seven (artists). In 1932 he launched out on his own, but the Great Depression in the 1930s led him to other fields: among them flying as a Bush pilot, radio and theatre, followed by college and a year at the Detroit Art Academy. A Canadian producer asked him to paint a stage set for him, which prompted Broadhurst, a relative of George Broadhurst, New York theatrical producer and founder of New York's famed Broadhurst Theatre, to focus his talents on the theatre and his gift for songwriting. He subsequently wrote over a hundred cowboy songs, including \\"There'll be a New World Beginning from Tonight\\" which became an annual fixture as the rousing finale of the hugely popular Christmas concerts of Malcolm Sargent at London's Royal Albert Hall. In 1940 he appeared singing one of his cowboy songs in the movie Susan and God starring Joan Crawford. He put his creative talents at the service of the Moral Re-Armament movement (MRA) (now known as 'Initiatives of Change ). In 1951 he wrote and co-starred in the Broadway Production of his musical Jotham Valley (http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=391960). The work was filmed in 1952 in England with at least one member of the Broadway cast. Another of his plays, A Cowboys Christmas was produced in many countries, often as part of MRA campaigns. He returned to painting full-time in the 1960s and quickly established a reputation as one of the West's finest artists at his studio in Arivaca, Arizona. His paintings are in galleries and private collections coast to coast as well as Europe and South America. He said: \\"Some say the Cowboy is a vanishing species, but in my book he'll be around as long as the paint stays on the canvas\\". All of the above text was drawn from Cecil Broadhurst's printed brochure describing his life experience and services as an artist in Arivaca, Arizona. Some minor modifications were made by T. John F.

Her parents married the year following her birth. Cyrus was born with supraventricular tachycardia, a condition causing an abnormal resting heart rate. Her birth name, Destiny Hope, expressed her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things. Her parents nicknamed her \\"Smiley\\", which they later shortened to \\"Miley\\", because she often smiled as an infant. In 2008, she legally changed her name to Miley Ray Cyrus; her middle name honors her grandfather, Democratic politician Ronald Ray Cyrus from Kentucky. Cyrus's godmother is entertainer Dolly Parton. Against the advice of her father's record company, Cyrus' parents secretly married on December 28, 1993, a year after her birth. They had two more children together, son Braison and daughter Noah. From previous relationships, her mother has two other children, Brandi and Trace.

Cyrus attended Heritage Elementary School in Williamson County, when her family lived in Thompson's Station, Tennessee. When she was cast in Hannah Montana, the family moved to Los Angeles, where she attended Options for Youth Charter Schools and studied with a private tutor on set. Raised Christian, she was baptized in a Southern Baptist church before moving to Hollywood in 2005. She attended church regularly while growing up and wore a purity ring. In 2001, when Cyrus was eight, she and her family moved to Toronto, Canada, while her father filmed the television series Doc. After Billy Ray took her to see a 2001 Mirvish production of Mamma Mia! at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Cyrus grabbed his arm and told him, \\"This is what I want to do, daddy. I want to be an actress.\\" She began singing and acting lessons at the Armstrong Acting Studio in Toronto. Cyrus' debut acting role was portraying a girl named Kylie in her father's television series Doc. In 2003, Cyrus received credit under her birth name for her role as \\"Young Ruthie\\" in Tim Burton's Big Fish. During this period, she auditioned with Taylor Lautner for the feature film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. Although she was one of two finalists for the role, she chose to appear in Hannah Montana instead. Her mother took on the role of Miley's manager and worked to acquire a team to build her daughter's career. Cyrus signed with Mitchell Gossett, director of the youth division at Cunningham Escott Slevin Doherty. Gossett is often credited with \\"discovering\\" Cyrus and played a key role in her auditioning for Hannah Montana.

Cyrus auditioned for the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana when she was eleven years old. She auditioned for the role of the title character's best friend, but was called to audition for the lead role instead. Despite being denied the part at first because she was too \\"young and small\\" for the role, she was selected later as the lead because of her singing and acting abilities. The series premiered in March 2006 to the largest audience for a Disney Channel program and quickly ranked among the highest-rated series on basic cable. The success of the series led to Cyrus being labeled a \\"teen idol\\". She toured with The Cheetah Girls as Hannah Montana in September 2006, performing songs from the show's first season. Walt Disney Records released a soundtrack credited to Cyrus' character in October of that year. The record was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 chart in the United States; it went on to sell over threemillion copies worldwide. With the release of the soundtrack, Cyrus became the first act within The Walt Disney Company to have deals in television, film, consumer products, and music. Cyrus signed a four-album recording contract with Hollywood Records to distribute her non-Hannah Montana soundtrack music. She released the two-disc album Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus in June 2007. The first disc was credited as the second soundtrack by \\"Hannah Montana\\", while the second disc served as Cyrus' debut studio album.

Cyrus embarked on her highly successful Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007‚Äì08) to promote its release. Ticketmaster officials commented that \\"there [hadn't] been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis\\". The tour's success led to the theatrical release of the 3D concert film Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008). While initially intended to be a limited release, the film's success led to a longer run. left Cyrus and friend Mandy Jiroux began posting videos on the popular website YouTube in February 2008, referring to the clips as \\"The Miley and Mandy Show\\"; the videos garnered a large online following. In April 2008, several images of Cyrus in her underwear and swimsuit were leaked by a teenage hacker who accessed her Gmail account. Further controversy arose when it was reported that Cyrus, then fifteen, had posed topless during a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for Vanity Fair. The New York Times later clarified that although the pictures left the impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bed sheet and was not topless. Cyrus went on to release her second studio album, Breakout (2008), in June of that year. The album earned the highest first-week sales of her career thus far and became her third to top the Billboard 200. Cyrus later starred with John Travolta in the animated film Bolt (2008), her debut as a film actress; she also co-wrote the song \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" (2008) for this film, which she sings as a duet with Travolta. The film was a critical and commercial success earning her a Golden Globe nomination. In March 2009, Cyrus released \\"The Climb\\" (2009) as a single from the soundtrack to the Hannah Montana feature film. It was met with a warm critical and commercial reaction, becoming a crossover hit in both pop and country music formats. The soundtrack, which features the single, went on to become Cyrus' fourth entry to top the Billboard 200; at sixteen, she became the youngest performer in history to have four number one albums on the chart. She released her fourth soundtrack as Hannah Montana in July 2009, which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. Cyrus later launched her first fashion line, Miley Cyrus and Max Azria, through Walmart. It was promoted by the release of \\"Party in the U.S.A.\\" (2009) and the EP The Time of Our Lives (2009). Cyrus said the album was \\"a transitioning album [...] really to introduce people to what I want my next record to sound like and with time I will be able to do that a little more\\". \\"Party in the U.S.A.\\" went on to become one of Cyrus' most successful singles to date, and is considered one of her signature songs. She next embarked on her first world tour, the Wonder World Tour (2009), which was a critical and commercial success. On December 7, 2009, Cyrus performed for Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the British Royal Family at the Royal Variety Performance in Blackpool, Lancashire. Billboard ranked her as the fourth best-selling female artist of 2009. 2010‚Äì2012: Can't Be Tamed and focus on acting Hoping to foster a more mature image, Cyrus starred in the film The Last Song (2010), based on the Nicholas Sparks novel. It garnered a generally negative critical reviews but was a box office hit. Cyrus further attempted to shift her image with the release of her third studio album, Can't Be Tamed (2010). The album featured a more dance-oriented sound than her prior releases and caused a considerable amount of controversy due to its lyrical content and Cyrus' live performances. It sold 106,000 copies in its first week of release and became her first studio album not to top the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. Due to the controversy surrounding the release, the album's second, and final single, \\"Who Owns My Heart\\" was released solely in German territories. Cyrus released her final soundtrack as Hannah Montana that October; it was a commercial failure. Cyrus performs during her Gypsy Heart Tour in left Cyrus was the center of more controversy when a video posted online in December 2010 showed a then eighteen Cyrus smoking salvia with a bong. 2010 ended with her ranking at number thirteen on Forbes Celebrity 100 list.

Cyrus cited her various controversial moments as the reason, claiming she only wanted to travel where she felt \\"the most love\\". Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus officially parted ways with Hollywood Records.

In November 2011, it was announced that Cyrus would voice Mavis in the animated film Hotel Transylvania; but in February 2012 she was removed from the film and replaced by Selena Gomez. At the time, Cyrus attributed her exit to wanting to work on her music, but seven years later in August 2019 she revealed the real reason of her departure because she bought her then-boyfriend Liam Hemsworth a birthday cake that looked like a penis and then licked it. She later made an appearance on the MTV television series Punk'd with Kelly Osbourne and Khlo√© Kardashian. Cyrus starred in the independent film LOL (2012) with Demi Moore. The film had a limited release, and was critically and commercially unsuccessful. She then starred in the comedy film So Undercover, appearing as an FBI agent required to go undercover at a college sorority. Cyrus released a string of live performances known as the Backyard Sessions on YouTube during the spring and summer of 2012; the performances were of classic songs that Cyrus personally liked.

In late 2013 she was declared Artist of the Year by MTV. On January 29, 2014, she played an acoustic concert show on MTV Unplugged, performing songs from Bangerz featuring a guest appearance by Madonna. It became the highest rated MTV Unplugged in the past decade, with over 1.7million streams. Cyrus was also featured in the Marc Jacobs Spring 2014 campaign along with Natalie Westling and Esmerelda Seay Reynolds. She launched her controversial Bangerz Tour (2014) that year, which received a generally positive reactions. Two months into her tour, Cyrus' Alaskan Klee Kai was found mauled to death at her home after fighting with a coyote. The trauma from the incident inspired her to dedicate her life to veganism. Two weeks later, Cyrus suffered an allergic reaction to the antibiotic cephalexin, prescribed to treat a sinus infection, resulting in her hospitalization in Kansas City. Though she rescheduled some of her US tour dates, she resumed the tour two weeks later, beginning with the European leg. While collaborating with The Flaming Lips on their remake of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, With a Little Help from My Fwends, Cyrus began working with Wayne Coyne on her fifth studio album. She claimed that she was taking her time to focus on the music, and that the album would not be released until she felt it was ready. Coyne compared his collaborative material with Cyrus to the catalogs of Pink Floyd and Portishead and described their sound as being \\"a slightly wiser, sadder, more true version\\" of Cyrus' pop music output. Cyrus also worked on the films The Night Before (2015) and A Very Murray Christmas (2015) during this period; both roles were cameos. Reports began to surface in 2015 that Cyrus was working on two albums simultaneously, one of which she hoped to release at no charge. This was confirmed by her manager who claimed she was willing to end her contract with RCA Records if they refused to let her release a free album. Cyrus was the host of the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, making her its first openly pansexual host, and gave a surprise performance of a new song \\"Dooo It!\\" (2015) during the show's finale.

Her first collaboration with Ronson, \\"Nothing Breaks Like a Heart\\" from his 2019 album Late Night Feelings, was released on November 29, 2018. On May 31, 2019, Cyrus tweeted that her seventh studio album would be titled She Is Miley Cyrus and would comprise three six-song EPs, which would be released before the full-length album: She Is Coming on May 31, She Is Here in the summer, and She Is Everything in the fall. She Is Coming debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200 with 36,000 album- equivalent units, while the single \\"Mother's Daughter\\" entered at number 54 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

Cyrus won a 2020 Webby Special Achievement Award. On August 14, 2020, Cyrus released the single \\"Midnight Sky\\" and confirmed the cancellation of the EPs She Is Here and She Is Everything. Artistry Musical style and influences Cyrus has cited Elvis Presley as her biggest inspiration. She has also cited artists such as Madonna, Lana Del Rey, Dolly Parton, Timbaland, Christina Aguilera, Joan Jett, Lil Kim, Shania Twain, Hanson, OneRepublic and Britney Spears as influences. Since the beginning of her music career, Cyrus has been described as being predominantly a pop artist. Her Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus debut studio effort was characterized as sounding similar to her releases as \\"Hannah Montana\\" featuring a pop-rock and bubblegum pop sound. Cyrus hoped that the release of Breakout (2008) would help distance her from this sound; the record featured Cyrus experimenting with various genres. Cyrus co-wrote eight songs for the album, and was quoted as saying: \\"I just hope this record showcases that, more than anything, I'm a writer.\\" The songs on her early releases feature lyrics on the topics of love and relationships. Cyrus possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, although her vocals were once described as alto, with a \\"Nashville twang\\" in both her speaking and singing voice. Her voice has a distinctive raspy sound to it, similar in vein to that of Pink and Amy Winehouse On \\"Party in the U.S.A.\\" (2009), her vocals feature belter refrains, while those on the song \\"Obsessed\\" (2009) are described as \\"husky\\". Releases such as \\"The Climb\\" (2009) and \\"These Four Walls\\" (2008) feature elements of country music and showcase Cyrus' \\"twangy vocals\\". Cyrus experimented with an electropop sound on \\"Fly on the Wall\\" (2008), a genre that she would explore further with the release of Can't Be Tamed (2010), her third studio album. It was initially intended to feature rock music elements prior to its completion, and Cyrus claimed after its release that it could be her final pop album. The album's songs speak of Cyrus' desire to achieve freedom in both her personal life and her career. She began working on Bangerz (2013) during a musical hiatus, and described the record as having a \\"dirty south feel\\" prior to its release. Critics noted the use of hip hop music and synthpop in the album. The album's songs are placed in chronological order telling the story of her failed relationship with Liam Hemsworth. Cyrus described Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) as \\"a little psychedelic, but still in that pop world\\". Stage performances Cyrus has become known for her controversial performances, most notably on her Bangerz Tour (2014) and Milky Milky Milk Tour (2015). Her performance of \\"Party In the U.S.A.\\" at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards sparked a \\"national uproar\\" because of her outfit and her perceived pole dancing. She faced similar controversy following a performance of \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" (2010) on Britain's Got Talent, where she pretended to kiss one of her female dancers onstage. Cyrus defended the performance, feeling she did nothing wrong. Cyrus was the subject of public and media scrutiny following her performance of \\"We Can't Stop\\" (2013) and \\"Blurred Lines\\" (2013) with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Clad in a skin colored latex two-piece, Cyrus touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch. The performance resulted in a media frenzy; one reviewer likened the performance to a \\"bad acid trip\\", while another described it as a \\"trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment\\". Cyrus entered the stage of her Bangerz Tour (2014) by sliding down a slide in the shape of a tongue, gaining media attention during the tour for her costumes and racy performances. Philanthropy Throughout her career, Cyrus has sung on several charity singles such as: \\"Just Stand Up!\\", \\"Send It On\\", \\"Everybody Hurts\\" and \\"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\\". She has visited sick fans in hospitals throughout the years. She is an avid supporter of the City of Hope National Medical Center in California, having attended benefit concerts in 2008, 2009 and 2012. In 2008 and 2009, during her Best of Both Worlds and Wonder World Tours, for every concert ticket sold, she donated one dollar to the organization. Cyrus celebrated her sixteenth birthday at Disneyland by delivering a $1million donation from Disney to Youth Service America. In July 2009, Cyrus performed at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation's 20th annual A Time for Heroes celebrity picnic and donated several items including autographed merchandise, and a script from Hannah Montana for the Ronald McDonald House Auction. Cyrus has supported charities such as the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Entertainment Industry Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, United Service Organizations, Youth Service America and Music for Relief. In February 2010, she donated several items, including the dress she wore to the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, and two tickets to the Hollywood premiere of her movie The Last Song, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Cyrus performing at the Kids Inaugural: We Are the Future concert in 2009 In January 2011, Cyrus met an ailing fan with spina bifida with the charity Kids Wish Network. In April 2011, she appeared in a commercial for the American Red Cross asking people to pledge $10 to help those affected by the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami. That same year, Hilary Duff presented Cyrus with the first ever Global Action Youth Leadership Award at the first Annual Global Action Awards Gala for her support of Blessings in a Backpack, an organization that works to feed hungry children in schools, and her personal Get Ur Good On campaign with the Youth Services of America. Cyrus stated: \\"I want (kids) to do something they love. Not something that seems like a chore because someone tells them that's the right thing to do or what their parents want or what's important to people around them, but what's in their heart.\\" In December 2011, she appeared in a commercial for the charity J/P Haitian Relief Organization, and teamed up with her elder brother Trace Cyrus to design a limited edition T-shirt and hoodie for charity. All proceeds from the sale of these items went to her charity, Get Ur Good On, which supports education for under-privileged children. That month, she performed \\"The Climb\\" at the CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. In 2012, Cyrus released a cover version of Bob Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" featuring Johnzo West for the charity Amnesty International as a part of the album Chimes of Freedom. She also appeared in a commercial for the Rock the Vote campaign, which encouraged young people to make their voices heard by voting in the 2012 federal election. For her twentieth birthday, activists at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) adopted a pig called Nora in her name. Cyrus also supports thirty-nine well-known charities, including: Make-a-Wish Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, To Write Love on Her Arms, NOH8 Campaign, Love Is Louder Than the Pressure to Be Perfect and The Jed Foundation among others. In 2013, Cyrus was named the fourteenth most charitable celebrity of the year by Do Something. She also appeared with Justin Bieber and Pitbull in a television special entitled The Real Change Project: Artists for Education. On July 26, 2014, it was announced that Cyrus would appear alongside Justin Timberlake at an HIV/AIDS charity event in the White House. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Jimmy Fallon announced that Cyrus was the winner of the Video of the Year award for her song \\"Wrecking Ball\\". Instead of accepting the award herself, she invited a twenty-two-year-old homeless man by the name of Jesse collect it on her behalf; she met him at My Friend's Place, an organization that helps homeless youth find shelter, work, health care and education. His acceptance speech encouraged musicians to learn more about homeless youth in Los Angeles at Cyrus's Facebook page. Cyrus then launched a Prizeo campaign to raise funds for the charity; those who made donations were entered into a sweepstake for a chance to meet Cyrus on her Bangerz Tour in Rio de Janeiro that September. Happy Hippie Foundation Cyrus is the founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, which works to \\"fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations\\". Since 2014, the foundation has served nearly 1,500 homeless youth in Los Angeles, reached more than 25,000 LGBTQ youth and their families with resources about gender, and provided social services to transgender individuals, youth in conflict zones, and people affected by crisis situations. Happy Hippie encourages Cyrus's fans to support causes including gender equality, LGBTQ rights and mental health through awareness campaigns and fundraising. On June 15, 2015, Cyrus unleashed the campaign #InstaPride in collaboration with Instagram. The campaign features a series of portraits starring transgender and gender-expansive people, which were posted to her Instagram feed with the hashtags \\"#HappyHippiePresents\\" and \\"#InstaPride\\". It was aimed at encouraging diversity and tolerance by showing these people in a positive light as examples for others who might be struggling to figure themselves out, as well as a reference point for people who didn't know personally anyone in that situation. Cyrus was the one behind the camera for the photoshoot the whole time and even interviewed her 14 subjects to share their personal stories along with their portraits. She decided to predominate the color yellow since she believes it is a happy and non-sexualized color. She said she wanted to bring attention and celebrate people who wouldn't normally find themselves being the stars of a photoshoot or wouldn't find themselves on the cover of a magazine. Following the loss of their Malibu home from the Woolsey Fire, Cyrus and Hemsworth partnered with their community to launch the Malibu Foundation for relief efforts following the 2018 California wildfires. Through the Happy Hippie Foundation, Cyrus and Hemsworth donated $500,000 to the Malibu Foundation. Public image Cyrus on the red carpet at the 38th People's Choice Awards in 2012 In the early years of her career, Cyrus had a generally wholesome image as a teen idol. Her fame increased dramatically following the Vanity Fair photo scandal, and it was reported that photos of Cyrus could be shopped for $2,000 apiece. In the following years, Cyrus' image continued to shift dramatically from her previous teen idol status. Donny Osmond wrote of Cyrus' transition into adulthood: \\"Miley will have to face adulthood..... As she does, she'll want to change her image, and that change will be met with adversity.\\" The release of Can't Be Tamed (2010) saw Cyrus officially attempting to distance herself from her teenage persona, releasing controversial music videos for her songs \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" (2010) and \\"Who Owns My Heart\\" (2010). Her behavior generated considerable controversy throughout 2013 and 2014, although her godmother Dolly Parton stated \\"...the girl can write. The girl can sing. The girl is smart. And she doesn't have to be so drastic. But I will respect her choices. I did it my way, so why can't she do it her way?\\" Cyrus was placed at number seventeen on Forbes list of the most powerful celebrities in 2014, the magazine noting that \\"The last time she made our list was when she was still rolling in Hannah Montana money. Now the pop singer is all grown up and courting controversy at every turn.\\" In August 2014, her life was documented in a comic book called Fame: Miley Cyrus, starting with her 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance to her Disney fame and exploring her childhood in Tennessee. The comic book was written by Michael L. Frizell and drawn by Juan Luis Rinc√≥n and is available in both print and digital formats. In September 2010, Cyrus placed tenth on Billboard magazine's first-ever list of Music's Hottest Minors of 2010 and was ranked twenty-first in 2011 and eighteenth in 2012. In May 2013, Maxim ranked Cyrus first on their Hot 100 of the year. Cyrus was chosen by Time magazine as one of their finalists for Person of the Year in November 2013; she came in third place with 16.3% of the staff vote. In March 2014, Skidmore College in New York began offering a special topics sociology course entitled \\"The Sociology of Miley Cyrus: Race, Class, Gender and Media\\" which was \\"using Miley as a lens through which to explore sociological thinking about identity, entertainment, media and fame\\". In 2015, Cyrus was listed as one of the nine runners-up for The Advocates Person of the Year. Personal life Sexuality and gender Cyrus came out as pansexual to her mother at age 14 and has said: \\"I never want to label myself! I am ready to love anyone that loves me for who I am! I am open.\\" In June 2015, Time magazine reported she is gender fluid. She was quoted as stating she \\"doesn't relate to being boy or girl, and I don't have to have my partner relate to boy or girl.\\" Cyrus stated she is \\"literally open to every single thing that is consenting and doesn't involve an animal and everyone is of age\\". Cyrus is a supporter of the LGBT community. Her song \\"My Heart Beats for Love\\" (2010) was written for one of Cyrus' gay friends, while she has since claimed London is her favorite place to perform due to its extensive gay scene. Cyrus also has an equals sign tattooed on her ring finger in support of same-sex marriage. After her 2018 marriage to a man, Cyrus went on the record to state she still identified as queer. She is the founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, which works to \\"Fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations\\". Cannabis use Cyrus is open about her recreational use of cannabis. She told Rolling Stone in 2013 that it was \\"the best drug on earth\\" and called it, along with MDMA, a \\"happy drug\\". While accepting the Best Video Award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus smoked what appeared to be a joint on stage; this was removed from the delayed broadcast of the show in the United States. In a 2014 interview with W magazine, Cyrus stated \\"I love weed\\" and \\"I just love getting stoned.\\" In a 2017 interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Cyrus revealed that she quit cannabis before the press tour of her album Younger Now so she could be \\"super clear\\" when discussing the record. During a 2018 interview with Andy Cohen, she credited her mother for reintroducing her to cannabis. In 2019, Cyrus sent \\"Nothing Breaks Like a Heart\\" collaborator Mark Ronson a cannabis bouquet from Lowell Herb Co as a tongue-in-cheek Valentine's Day gift. She invested in the cannabis company in August. Prior to undergoing vocal cord surgery in November 2019, and after her post-operative recovery, Cyrus has stated that she has stayed sober from the use of cannabis and alcohol. Relationships Cyrus has stated that she dated singer and actor Nick Jonas from June 2006 to December 2007, claiming they were \\"in love\\" and began dating soon after they first met. Her relationship with Jonas attracted considerable media attention. Cyrus was in a nine-month relationship with model Justin Gaston from 2008 to 2009. While filming The Last Song, Cyrus began an on-again, off-again relationship with her co-star, Liam Hemsworth, in 2009.

On December 23, Cyrus and Hemsworth married in a private wedding ceremony in their home in Nashville, Tennessee. She felt that her marriage \\"[redefined] what it looks like for someone that's a queer person like [herself] to be in a hetero relationship\\" though she was \\"still very sexually attracted to women\\". Cyrus indicated that the ceremony was \\"kind of out of character for [her]\\" because \\"[they have] worn rings forever [and] definitely didn't need it in any way\\". She believed the loss of their home to be the catalyst for getting married, citing that \\"the timing felt right\\" and that \\"no one is promised the next day, or the next, so [she tries] to be 'in the now' as much as possible\\". On August 10, 2019, Cyrus announced their separation. Eleven days later, Hemsworth filed for divorce, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\". To commemorate her divorce from Hemsworth, Cyrus had a note written to her from Yoko Ono tattooed on her left shoulder blade. On January 28, 2020, their divorce had been finalized. Following the announcement of her separation from Hemsworth, she dated Kaitlynn Carter from August to September 2019. In October 2019, Cyrus began dating Australian singer Cody Simpson, a longtime friend. In August 2020, Cyrus announced that she and Simpson had split up. Her announcement coincided with the release of her single \\"Midnight Sky\\", which was inspired by her breakups with Hemsworth, Carter, and Simpson. Religious beliefs Cyrus was raised as a Christian and identified herself as such during her childhood and early adult life. Cyrus includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics of \\"Milky Milky Milk\\" (2015). Diet From 2013 to 2019, Cyrus followed a strict vegan diet.

This passage was said to have been used by Oliver Cromwell and possibly the Rebecca Rioters as an escape route. The passage runs from the Red Lion public house to the parish church. Another public house, called the Greyhound Inn, lies on the Llannon to Hendy road junction. It is unknown which is older, but the road that the Greyhound Inn lies on has a watering fountain which was built to water horses of passing carts. St Non's church The parish church of St Non is a Grade II* listed building. The village has a primary school and aside from the two pubs it lacks any other amenities such as a shop, which closed in the late 1990s. A refurbishment of the Greyhound Inn included the siting of a new village shop on the premises but this closed shortly after it opened.  Present day  The village has grown in recent years with two new small housing estates having been constructed since 1999. The area is now considered more of a commuter village due to its proximity to the M4 in Hendy. The local school recently underwent a large extension programme to cope with the increased demand for schooling from the growing population. There are plans to build another 48 houses in the village.

However, the name is typically reserved for the final battle that occurred on 10 September. The Spaniards had previously attempted to expel the colonists on six occasions, most recently in 1779. 10 September 1798 marked the final Spanish attempt to take over the area. In Belize, the Battle of St. George's Caye is a national public and bank holiday.  Background  The battle took place between an invading force from Mexico, attempting to assert Spanish claims to present-day Belize, and a small force of resident woodcutters called Baymen, who fought for their livelihood assisted by black slaves. After the final two and a half-hour battle, ravaged by sickness, the Spaniards withdrew. The control of a territory including portions of what is now known as Belize was contested by Britain and Spain from as early as the mid-1750s. Although never occupying the territory, Spain considered it part of its Central American territories, which then included portions of present-day Mexico and Guatemala. The British had entered the territory in 1638 to harvest logwood and, later, mahogany. Spain recognized this trade in the Treaty of Paris (signed in 1763Humphreys, Gallant Spirits, pg. 63) but did not end the dispute by ceding interest, delineating boundaries. From 1779 to 1782 the settlement was abandoned, Baymen and their African slaves relocating to Havana, Cuba following a Spanish attack. The Spaniards in the 1500s made constant attempts to control the Yucatan coast that include Belize. In the mid-17th century some British sailors shipwrecked near the coast and they settled there. They were known as the Baymen and these buccaneer adventurers began to cut logwood in Belize and export them to Europe. The Spaniards never gave up claims on the Belize territory. They returned with 32 vessels, manned by 500 seamen and two thousand soldiers to affect the event. The battle started on the 3rd of September 1798 and ended on the 10th of September. This is where the Baymen won the victory over the Spaniards. After this great defeat, the Spaniards never came back again to Belize. Map St. George's Caye in 1764  Treaty of Versailles and the Superintendency  In 1783, hostilities were temporarily halted with signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which conveyed the Baymen rights between the Belize and Hondo rivers; this was extended with the 1786 Convention of London to the Sibun River. Cutting rights were granted to the settlers on condition the settlement be recognized as belonging to Spain; Superintendent Col. Edward Marcus Despard was to administer the terms of the treaty- however, conflicts with inhabitants spurred Despard's resignation. The Treaty of Versailles in 1783 affirmed the boundaries set by the Treaty of Paris to cut logwood and later extended by the Convention of London in 1786. In this treaty, Spain gave permission to the British to cut mahogany and logwood from way down south to the Sibun River. It strongly forbade the British to settle any formal government during the agriculture work. Absolutely no economical activity more than cutting logwood. The Convention of London also specified that in return for the concessions Spain had made, the British were to give up all its other settlements in the region, notably the Mosquito Shore and the island of Roatan. As a result, the inhabitants of these areas had to be evacuated. The British brought them to Belize. There was no longer war between Britain and Spain and they signed the peace Treaty of Versailles on 3 September 1783. Ships The British ships that were sent from Jamaica to assist the baymen were , and . Dobson, N. (1979) On the morning of 10 September, fourteen of the largest Spaniard ships approached and anchored approximately one mile away from HMS Merlin, the leading vessel that was relocated from Jamaica to assist the Baymen, and the other British seacrafts. Captain John Moss, Captain of the Merlin, believed that the Spaniards would wait to attack the following day, however, the attack ensued at 2:30 pm. The conflict launched approximately two hours and a half of action until the Spaniards abruptly cut their cables and departed towards Caye Chapel. The Merlin was unable to chase after them due to the shallow waters.  Prelude  Humphreys relates that in a 1796 visit to the area, Visitador Juan O'Sullivan claimed the British were encroaching on Spanish territory in Mexico by cutting near the Hondo. Upon his return to Spain, hostilities broke out between Great Britain and Spain as a result of the Napoleonic Wars. The Spanish viewed the situation seriously and determined to remove the British. Colonists appealed to Jamaican Lieutenant Governor Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, for assistance. Even though he was in the midst of the Maroon Wars, Balcarres nonetheless sent muskets and ammunition to the settlement and a further shipment arrived on Commander Thomas Dundas' ship in December 1796. But upon his arrival, Dundas noted panic in the settlement and the subsequent dispatching of slaves to cut logwood instead of preparing to defend the settlement. Balcarres then named Major (promoted to Lieutenant Colonel) Thomas Barrow Superintendent of the settlement. Barrow, a seasoned veteran of war according to Humphreys, immediately began whipping the unruly Baymen into shape, and martial law, stopping all activities in the settlement, was declared on 11 February 1797. On 18 March, magistrates Thomas Potts, Thomas Graham and Marshall Bennett all asked Barrow whether there were any incoming messages from Jamaica. Barrow admitted that more help would be on the way soon, to alleviate the fears of the Baymen, but Humphreys calls the actions of Potts and company \\"cowardly\\" and says that even after that reassurance morale was low.  June evacuation meeting  Impatient with the plans to defend the settlement, the Baymen called a public meeting for 1 June 1797. At this meeting, the Baymen voted 65 to 51 to defend the settlement and cooperate with Barrow. This initial support wavered considerably between then and September 1798, as reports came in of the size of the Spanish fleet. Don Arturo O'Neill Tirone, Yucat√°n Governor and Commander of the expedition, had secured: This estimate was severely reduced due to outbreaks of yellow fever and dissent in the Spanish army. Nevertheless, it was enough to frighten the Baymen into posting lookouts near the boundaries of the territory.  Baymen's preparations  's captain in 1798 was John Moss, a strategist on the order of Barrow. By 18 July the fleet had reached Cozumel, leading the settlers to agree to arm their slaves, an act that affected the outcome of the battle due to the slaves' knowledge of warfare. There were still some who were cautious and demanded evacuation, including Potts, but Balcarres ignored them and imposed martial law on 26 July. The Settlement lineup consisted of the following: , two sloops, and , with one 18-pounder gun and 25 men each, and under the command of two merchant captains, Mr. Gelston and Mr. Hosmer, who brought with them some of their crew; , with one short 9 pounder and 25 men; the schooners, and , with six guns and 25 men each, Swinger having four 6-pounder guns and two 4-pounders, and Teazer six 4-pounders; and eight gun- flats, each with one 9-pounder and 16 men. Except for the crews of Towser and Tickler, the rest of the crews consisted of 354 volunteers from the \\"Colonial Troops\\". In addition there were 700 troops ready to deter attack by land.  Battle  From 3 to 5 September, the Spaniards tried to force their way through Montego Caye shoal, blocked by the defenders. The military commanders, Moss and Barrow, differed on where to put their resources for the next phase of the fight: Barrow thought they would go to the land phase, while Moss decided on defending St. George's Caye. Moss arrived in time to stop the Spaniards, setting the stage for 10 September. At 1:00 p.m. that afternoon, the Spaniards and British lined up off St. George's Caye. The Spaniards stormed through the channel, and at 1:30 engaged the British in a two-hour fight which ended in defeat for the confused Spaniards. Moss reported no one killed and the Baymen in good spirits. Barrow was dispatched and arrived in time to see the end of the battle and prevent the slave men from boarding the enemy. The Spaniards were in full retreat by 13 September, and Barrow agreed to send vessels to further push the Spaniards back.  Commemoration  On the 100th anniversary of the battle, the colonial government declared 9 and 10 September a national holiday. It was organized by a Centennial Committee as part of an ethnic and middle-class narrative by Creoles in Belize Town to assert their status as natives and equal partners to the whites in the colony of British Honduras, now Belize. The chief advocates in the Committee were Henry Charles Usher, Wilfred A. Haylock, Benjamin Fairweather, and Absalom Hyde. They held that the Battle represented the heroic contribution of the Baymen and slaves to the colony. In their speeches, they said that had it not been for the Baymen and slaves fighting \\"shoulder to shoulder\\" British Honduras would have ended up being a settlement like Cuba or the Philippines. They argued that while the slaves could have escaped, they stayed and defended the settlement. The Centennial celebrations has been interpreted a means through which the middle-class Creoles sought to gain recognition in the society as \\"true patriots.\\" Today, the event is celebrated as St. George's Caye Day on the 10 of September. It is considered a national and historic event to recognize the efforts of the Baymen and slaves, as ancestors of Belize. In 1998 Belize issued three coins to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battle. These consisted of a cupro-nickel $2, a 0.925 silver $10 and a 0.917 gold $100. The obverse features a three-masted sailing vessel from the national coat-of-arms. The reverse features HMS Merlin and two of the oar- powered flat boats.

Thompson was commissioned by the town of Amherst to write a piece commemorating its bicentennial in 1959. The town was known for its association with Robert Frost, who had lived there for some years. Frost had known Thompson for some time, and admired his music; accordingly, it was decided that the commemorative work would be a setting of some of Frost's poetry. The town suggested \\"The Gift Outright\\"; Thompson, however, feared that the text was inappropriate for the occasion, and asked to be allowed to choose his own texts. In the end, the composer selected seven poems, with which he constructed a seven-movement suite of choral art songs: *\\"The Road Not Taken\\" *\\"The Pasture\\" *\\"Come In\\" *\\"The Telephone\\" *\\"A Girl's Garden\\" *\\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" *\\"Choose Something Like a Star\\" As the male and female choruses rehearsed separately, Thompson structured the work so that they sang together only in three of the seven movements; each of the other four was scored for either male voices or female voices alone.

He was born in Chicago. Career In 1893, Reitz was sold, for $300, by the San Francisco Friscos to the Baltimore Orioles. His five-year tenure at Baltimore included his most notable season, 1894, during which he collected 31 triples. At the time, this tied Dave Orr's mark, set in 1886, for most triples in a single season. Although Chief Wilson surpassed both of them with his 36 triple season in , Reitz and Orr still hold second place for this record. Contributing to Reitz's 31 triples in 1894 were two bases loaded triples he hit in the 3rd and 7th inning on June 4 against the Chicago Colts that led Baltimore to a 12‚Äì4 victory. Reitz's two bases loaded triples in a single game matched a feat achieved by Sam Thompson in 1887. The frequency with which Reitz hit triples in 1894 was marked departure from every other season in his career. Excluding his record-tying season, he averaged under six triples per year. On December 10, 1897, he was traded (with Jack Doyle and Doc Amole) to the Washington Senators in exchange for Doc McJames, Gene DeMontreville, and Dan McGann. After one season in Washington, Reitz was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Dick Padden, Jimmy Slagle, and Jack O'Brien. Reitz played 34 games for Pittsburgh in the 1899 season, and was traded in March 1900, to Milwaukee of the American Association in exchange for a player to be named later. In September 1900, Pittsburgh received Harry Smith to complete the transaction. Reitz was killed in a car accident at the age of 47 in Sacramento, California. This marked the first time that a car accident claimed the life of a major league baseball player, although it would not be until 1924 that an active major-leaguer, Boston Braves shortstop Tony Boeckel, would die in an auto accident.

This revival of The $64,000 Question was produced by Cinelar Associates and distributed by Viacom Enterprises. Originally, Viacom had intended to revive the series with the same title (and top payoff), but when it was announced that rival series Name That Tune would be adding a \\"$100,000 Mystery Tune\\" for the 1976‚Äì77 season, Viacom did not wish for their series to only have the second-biggest payoff and added an end-of-season $64,000 tournament to the format.Steve Beverly's \\"Name That Tune\\" page Further hindering the show was that a planned deal with CBS owned-and-operated stations to carry it in major markets had to be scrapped because of the network-imposed $25,000 winnings limit for game shows (which, at the time, was also extended to syndicated games airing on the O&Os;). While the producers were able to get the Metromedia-owned stations to fill these gaps and the series did well enough to be renewed for a second season, The $128,000 Question proved not to be as popular as its predecessor and it came to an end in 1978.Steve Beverly's \\"Name That Tune\\" page Hosts and announcers Mike Darow hosted the first season with Alan Kalter as announcer, and the series was taped in New York City at CBS's Ed Sullivan Theater. The second season moved production to Don Mills, Toronto, Ontario at Global Television Network's studios. Alex Trebek became host, with model Sylvie Garant as his assistant, and Sandy Hoyt became the announcer. Gameplay As on The $64,000 Question, each contestant was quizzed in a category which was his or her own area of expertise. In the first season, contestants selected categories from a board with several options. Once the contestant chose a category, a cassette tape containing four questions was given to host Darow, who then fed it into an electric typewriter onstage. For each question, Darow read it as the typewriter printed it onto a sheet of paper. After the contestant gave a response, the typewriter printed the correct answer. The first question was worth $64 for a correct answer, and the next three subsequent answers doubled that amount, up to $512. The contestant was given a chance to stop after every question, as answering incorrectly at any point ended the run and he/she was awarded a consolation prize; the value of said prize varied depending on when the incorrect answer was given. If a contestant continued on from $512, the next question was worth $1,000 and play moved across the stage to a podium positioned in front of a television monitor. Game play remained the same as before, with each question displayed on the screen. Once the contestant gave a response, the correct answer was displayed on the screen. If the contestant answered the $1,000 question correctly and elected to play on, a pair of multi-part questions were asked one at a time. Once again, and from this point forward, answering correctly doubled the contestant's money. If both multi- part questions were answered correctly, the contestant ended up with a total of $4,000. If the contestant was still in the game after seven questions had been asked, he/she was placed in an isolation booth onstage. Darow was handed an envelope containing a question with four or more parts, and after the question was asked the contestant was given some time to think before being prompted to answer. Answering each part of the question correctly doubled his/her winnings to $8,000. If the contestant kept going from here, he/she would be brought back on the next program to play for $16,000 with another, more difficult multi-part question. After that, the contestant could potentially face two more questions depending on his/her willingness to press. The first was played for $32,000 and, if the contestant went on, he/she faced one last question. Answering it correctly won the contestant a total of $64,000 and enabled him/her to return at the end of the season for a chance to double that total to $128,000. With the move to Toronto for the second season, the set and format were overhauled. A contestant's field of expertise was chosen prior to the show and revealed on air instead of chosen from the category board. Contestants now stood behind a podium with a numerical readout for the first five questions and the typewriter and television monitor stations were removed, with Trebek reading the questions from a booklet. Players entered the isolation booth following the $2,000 question and if they answered the second-to-last question correctly they received $24,000 cash and a car instead of an all-cash prize. $64,000 Winners ;1976-1977 season: *Robert (Bob) Lipinski - Category: Wines *Don Chu - Category: Big Bands *Dr. Jacqueline (Jackie) Hill - Category: Pro Football *June Bacon-Bercey - Category: John Philip Sousa ;1977-1978 season: *John Crutz - Category: World War I *Barbara Anne Eddy - Category: Shakespeare Consolation prizes If a contestant missed on any question up to the $4,000 question, he/she received $1 as a consolation prize. If the miss came on the $8,000 or $16,000 question, the contestant left with a new automobile. If a contestant answered the $16,000 question correctly but failed to answer either the $32,000 or $64,000 questions correctly, he/she was guaranteed to leave with no less than that amount in cash in season one, and with a car and $8,000 cash in season 2. Tournament play Four contestants won $64,000 during the first season. The semifinals consisted of three rounds of questions for each contestant, and contestants were asked four questions in each round. If the contestant answered all four questions correctly, an additional question was asked. Each correct answer scored one point in round one, two points in round two and three points in round three. After three rounds of questions, the two contestants with the highest scores advanced to the finals, in which the finalists alternated answering questions. The first contestant to answer six questions correctly won $64,000. However, each contender would be given an equal number of questions. If both contestants were tied at six points each, the contestants continued answering questions until the tie was broken. Season two featured two $64,000 winners. The playoff game consisted of four rounds of gameplay. In each of the first four rounds, each contestant was given four questions. Each correct answer scored one point in round one, two points in round two, four points in round three and eight points in round four. After the fourth round, both contestants took turns answering 16-point questions until one contestant achieved a total score of at least 128 points, thereby winning an additional $64,000. Home game A home version of The $128,000 Question was released by Ideal Toy Company in 1977 and followed the first season format, complete with a \\"category tree\\". It was given to all contestants who appeared on the show during that first season. Theme music The theme music was an updated version of the original composition by Norman Leyden and performed by Charles Randolph Grean, the show's musical director during its first season. Grean's group, The Charles Randolph Grean Sounde, recorded the theme and it was released as the B-side of Grean's 1976 single \\"Sentimentale\\" on Ranwood Records (R-1064). The track was a medley of the main theme, the cue heard when the printout tape was given to Darow, the \\"isolation booth\\" theme, a reprise of the main theme, the music heard during the announcement on how to apply to be a contestant, and a second reprise of the main theme ending in a grand crescendo. The Welk Music Group, parent company of Ranwood, currently owns the master tape of Grean's recording of the $128,000 Question theme. WMG has not rereleased the track themselves on CD or licensed it to other labels to appear on compilation albums as of this writing. The second season featured a live orchestra conducted by Guido Basso. Reruns The entire series was rebroadcast on KDOC-TV in Anaheim, California from January 31 to June 7, 1983. Additionally, other local stations aired reruns of The $128,000 Question during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Des Moines business leader John Ruan III came forward in the spring of 2000 and injected the money necessary to take control of the company and restart operations. The airline resumed flights in November 2000 with daily flights from Des Moines to Chicago Midway Airport with the intent of offering flights to Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Cedar Rapids. However, low passenger loads again led to the airline shutting down in February 2001.http://www.radioiowa.com/2001/02/28/accessair-hits-the-ground-again/ Destinations AccessAir provided service to cities such as Los Angeles (via LAX) and New York City (via LaGuardia Airport) from its hub in Des Moines, Iowa from 1998 to 2001. Other cities included Colorado Springs, Colorado, Peoria, Illinois and Moline, Illinois.http://www.departedflights.com, Oct. 31, 1999 Access Air system timetable Access was a point-to-point carrier, meaning flights did not always start or stop in its hub city of Des Moines. Access Air utilized a series of thru-flights to connect its route network. For example, if a passenger wanted to fly Access Air from New York to Los Angeles, they would have to first fly through one or two stops, i.e. Peoria, Moline, Des Moines, and Colorado Springs before reaching Los Angeles. In most cases it would be a quick 25 minute turn-around for fuel and a few passengers before continuing on to the next destination.

The airline's logo was a stylized capital A with a circle around it, similar to \\" @ \\". The aircraft was bare metal with a red stripe along the window line which continued to the rudder (but not the rest of the vertical stabilizer). There was also a black stripe under the red one on the fuselage. The airline's fleet included four 737s registered in the US as N621AC, N623AC, N624AC and N625AC. N621AC and N623AC originally flew under German registration for Lufthansa. After Access Air service, N623AC operated as PK-JGR in Indonesia for Jatayu Airlines.

The species is grown commercially for its pitahaya fruit, but is also an impressive ornamental vine with huge flowers. Most plants grown under the name Hylocereus polyrhizus refer to this species. The latter name is ambiguous and not used. Etymology Named after Costa Rica where it was first discovered. Origin and habitat The species is native to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, although its natural range is hard to determine because it has been cultivated so widely. It occurs in dry or deciduous coastal forests, at elevations of above sea level. Systematics Hylocereus costaricensis is closely related to Hylocereus ocamponis, but lacks the horny stems margins of the latter species. Description *Stem scandent, 1-3 (-10) cm wide, usually very thick; ribs 3 (-4), margins straight to shallowly scallop-lobed; internodes 2-3.5 x 0.1-0.2 cm; often folded, areoles on prominences, bearing dense, short wool and (1-) 3-6 (-9) short, dark spines 2‚Äì4 mm, hairs 2, often bristle-like, soon dropping; epidermis grayish green, +- glaucous in fresh material. *Flowers funnel-shaped, 22‚Äì30 cm long, strongly perfumed, young buds globular; cylindric-ovoid, ca 4 cm long, bracteoles narrow, foliaceous, numerous, imbricate, 1‚Äì2 cm long; receptacle stout, 10‚Äì15 cm, throat obconic, 6 cm in wide at the orifice, bracteoles foliaceous, persistent, particularly imbricating towards the base, green with purple margins; tepals 11‚Äì15 cm, the outer greenish yellow, the inner white; stigma lobes ca. 12, not forked; ovary covered with large, broadly to narrowly triangular, overlapping bracteoles, 0.5‚Äì3 cm. *Fruit broadly ovate to globose, bright magenta, pupla purple; seeds pear-shaped, black, ca 10mm.

With the release of the first game Chicken Invaders in 1999, the games are one of the longest running series of video games developed in Greece. All six main entries in the series have been developed by Prouskas' InterAction Studios, and have been released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, Windows Phone, and Android platforms. The main theme of the games is a battle between a lone combat spacecraft and a technologically advanced race of space-faring chickens, who are intent on subjugating (and later destroying) Earth. The games make heavy use of humor, especially in the form of parodies of Galaxian, Star Wars, Space Invaders and Star Trek.  Games  Main series  Chicken Invaders  Chicken Invaders is the first game of the Chicken Invaders franchise, released on 24 July 1999. It is a fixed shooter, reminiscent of the original Space Invaders (of which the game is a parody of), in which the player controls a lone spacecraft by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at swarms of invading extraterrestrial chickens. The game features both single player and two-player game modes. Known also as the DX Edition, it is a reimagined, 3D version of an earlier, unfinished DOS version made in 1997. Chicken Invaders features weapon power-ups that resemble gift boxes, used by the player to upgrade their weapons. Enemy chickens drop eggs as projectile weapons, which the player needs to avoid. When chickens are defeated, they drop drumsticks, which the player can collect to earn a missile, a special weapon used to clear the screen of enemies. The game features an infinite amount of levels. Each level features 10 waves, and at the end of each level players fight a boss, which must be defeated in order to advance (or warp) to a new system. The gameplay is endless, bringing in wave after wave, until the player has finally lost all of their lives, in which case the game is over. The difficulty increases each time players advance to a new chapter; the enemies move or fall faster, and objects like asteroids will also move faster. Chicken Invaders is the only game in the franchise to not feature \\"holiday editions\\", a trend which would become a staple of the franchise. It is also the only game in the series to be an exclusive Microsoft Windows title, and as such the only game to not have been ported to other platforms.  Chicken Invaders: The Next Wave  Chicken Invaders: The Next Wave (known also as Chicken Invaders 2) is the second game in the main Chicken Invaders series, released on 22 December 2002. The player again takes command of the same lone spacecraft of the previous installment and must eliminate the chicken infestation of the Solar System. The game is considered a major improvement over its predecessor, featuring a variety of unique waves of chickens with different types of enemies and bosses, as well as allowing the player to move their ship in both the horizontal and vertical directions. It is also the first game in the franchise to introduce multiple weapons. The game departs from the \\"endless\\" format, instead featuring a final boss confrontation and an ending. As in the previous entry in the series, The Next Wave can be played by one or two players. The Next Wave features eleven chapters, each one corresponding to a gravitationally rounded object of the Solar System. Players start the campaign moving inwards from Pluto, with the final chapter of the game taking place on the Sun, where players confront the Mother-Hen Ship. Each Chapter consists of 10 waves of attacking hostiles, resulting in a total of 110 different levels. In all the waves, chickens attack the player's ship by dropping eggs, which the player needs to avoid. Players can collect different items to help them in-game, such as new primary weapons which players earn by collecting parcels, and power-ups, which can be used to upgrade the current primary weapon. Weapons can be upgraded up to eleven levels. As in Chicken Invaders, players can collect chicken drumsticks and roasts to receive missiles, powerful weapons that can wipe out an entire wave of enemies. Incentives are given however for not using the missiles, as players may receive special bonuses (e.g. new weapons or extra firepower) if they opt to take on the wave head on. The Next Wave was the first game in the franchise to feature a special version of the game (an edition) based around certain holidays. Chicken Invaders: The Next Wave - Christmas Edition was released on 25 November 2003, and was initially intended to be available during the months leading up to Christmas, however, its popularity caused InterAction studios to release this, and all subsequent Editions as standalone games. The Christmas Edition of The Next Wave replaces game graphics, sounds and music with festive versions and elements related to the Christmas holiday. Both versions of the game received Remastered versions, which were released on 20 December 2011 (the Christmas Edition) and on 26 January 2012 (the regular edition). These versions feature HD graphics, orchestral high-quality music, automatic fire function, progress saving, new languages, etc. The game and its Christmas Edition were initially released for Microsoft Windows, and have since been ported to MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.  Chicken Invaders: Revenge of the Yolk  Chicken Invaders: Revenge of the Yolk (known also as Chicken Invaders 3) is the third game in the Chicken Invaders main series, released on 11 November 2006 as a Christmas Edition, with the regular version releasing on 20 January 2007. The game is similar to The Next Wave in many respects, with the addition of new game mechanics and featuring 4-player cooperative play. It was intended as the final game in a planned Chicken Invaders trilogy, until the release of Ultimate Omelette in 2010. Revenge of the Yolk features a plot and cutscenes, while waves and enemies are more diverse than in the previous entries. The game has 120 waves, in 10 levels across 12 systems in the galaxy. New game mechanics added include unlockable content in the form of additional features which first have to be unlocked by finishing the game, that can either make the game easier or harder, as well as a variety of cosmetic changes. Furthermore, Revenge of the Yolk was the first game to introduce an overheating mechanic, designed to discourage players from holding down the fire button. The game features 30 bonuses, while weapons can be powered up to 12 power levels (the last one being a secret). Revenge of the Yolk is the only game in the franchise to be preceded by an Edition version, with its Christmas Edition being released almost 1,5 month earlier. The game was also the first to spawn an Easter Edition, released on 12 February 2010.  Chicken Invaders: Ultimate Omelette  Cover art for Chicken Invaders: Ultimate Omelette Chicken Invaders: Ultimate Omelette (known also as Chicken Invaders 4) is the fourth main installment in the Chicken Invaders series, released on 29 November 2010 as a demo, with the full version releasing a week later. It is the first game in the series to be released on Valve's Steam platform, and the first to receive an accolade, as it was included in the Adrenaline Vault's Top Casual PC games of 2010. Ultimate Omelette further added game mechanics to the Revenge of the Yolk formula, most notably the ability to rotate the player's ship to face in any direction, depending on the level (instead of constantly facing 'up', as in the previous installments). The game further features a more 'cinematic' camera zooming in or out depending on the action (e.g. boss fights typically have the camera zoomed out to contain all the action). The game features a more intricate plot than its predecessors, new weapons, dockable ship upgrades (Satellites) to deal additional damage to the various enemies and bosses, and in-game currency (Keys), dropped by specific enemies (indicated by a golden halo) during the course of the game, which allow the player to purchase unlockable content.

Reception The Chicken Invaders series has been positively received. CNET gave the first Chicken Invaders 4 out of 5 stars, highlighting the graphics and sound but criticizing the game's lack of features, and repetitive gameplay. CNET also gave The Next Wave 4 out of 5 stars stars, again praising the graphics, but criticizing the lack of a windowed mode. The Next Wave was rated \\"mediocre\\" by GameSpot, criticizing the repetitive gameplay and indistinct enemy bullets. However, the colorful, cartoony graphics where highlighted, as were \\"flashes of understanding of what makes a good shooter\\". Shortly after Ultimate Omelette's release, it was included in Adrenaline Vault's \\"Top Casual PC Games of 2010\\" list. The reviewer described it as \\"the most fun arcade space shooter in a very, very long time\\". The original orchestral soundtrack was also praised as rousing, invigorating, and \\"simply the absolute best\\". Gamezebo gave Ultimate Omellete, a 4 out of 5 stars rating, stating that \\"Chicken Invaders 4 is fantastic for a first-timer to the series\\", but criticizing that \\"for veterans of the games, it will feel a little too samey. The action has improved somewhat over the course of the series, but it‚Äôs still really the same ideas and premise that ran through the other games. Hence, those who are not new to the games may feel that paying full price for this latest release is a little too much.\\" Reception of the fifth game in the series, Cluck of the Dark Side has likewise been favorable. The game currently has \\"Overwhelmingly Positive\\" reviews on the Steam store, and was voted as \\"Greek Game of the Year\\" by Greek media and entertainment website GameWorld.gr users in its annual Game of the Year Awards 2015.

They are based in Ely, Cardiff and they play at Station Road, Wenvoe near Cardiff. History Ely Rangers' origins date back to 1963‚Äì64 at a time when the club did not have enough players to put out a full side, so they joined with Heath Park Rangers. After just one season, a chance meeting with other boys from Ely whilst on holiday at Butlins resulted in the formation of Ely Rangers AFC in 1965. The club joined the Cardiff Combination League and quickly established themselves as a major playing force, in season 1967‚Äì68 they were crowned champions of the first division, and within two seasons in the senior division they won the first of five championships, their further triumphs came in 70‚Äì71, 75‚Äì76, 77‚Äì78 and 78‚Äì79.The club's success was not limited to the league, as they won the Combination Cup on five occasions, the City Supporters Cup four times and the Senior Cup twice. Following this successful period, the club were on the look out for a Ground of their own, so they could further their ambition of South Wales Amateur League status. In 1983 Ely Rangers moved into Station Road Wenvoe, and were accepted into the Amateur League. Success followed, winning the Corinthian Cup and the SWFA Amateur cup twice. Entrance gates to Ely Rangers AFC ground, Station Road In the Amateur League the best finish was runners up, until the 1996‚Äì97 season where Ely Rangers won the First Division Championship under Manager John Boulton. Rangers then had to contest a play-off with old local rivals Caerau Ely, at Ninian Park and won the game 3‚Äì0 in front of 1,300 spectators, to claim their place in the Welsh Football League for season 1997‚Äì98. In the Welsh League, Rangers spent the first three seasons in division three finishing 5th, 5th, and then runners up (drawing only 3 games and winning the rest) and in turn promotion. Division Two was a short stay of only one season finishing 3rd and again gaining promotion. Season 2001‚Äì02, Ely entered into the First Division and finished in eighth position, however, in the last few seasons Ely have finished 15th, and 14th twice. At the end of the 2018-19 season the club were relegated from the Welsh Football League and joined the South Wales Alliance League Premier Division. They were then relegated for a second successive season at the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season, dropping to the First Division for 2020‚Äì21. Club Crest The Ely Rangers AFC crest dates back to the club's formation in the 1960s. The club received a great deal of help in its early days from Barclays Bank (a link that is still alive today) and the 'iron eagle' that forms the basis of the club's crest is directly linked to the old Barclays logo. The club crest is completed by the addition of the club name above the eagle, along with the club's year of formation beneath it. The club's nickname of 'The Griffins' also derives from the crest after the club's eagle symbol was mistaken for that of the griffin mythical creature.

It is one of the very few standing poses in medieval hatha yoga, and remains popular in modern yoga as exercise.  Etymology and origins  Descent of the Ganges\\" at Mahabalipuram appears to show a person in Vrikshasana at top left. 7th century The name comes from the Sanskrit words v·πõk·π£a (‡§µ‡•É‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑) meaning \\"tree\\", and ƒÅsana (‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®) meaning \\"posture\\". A 7th-century stone carving in Mahabalipuram appears to contain a figure standing on one leg, perhaps indicating that a pose similar to vrikshasana was in use at that time.

Description  A modern yoga group practising outdoors From Tadasana, weight is shifted to one leg, for example, starting with the left leg. The entire sole of the foot remains in contact with the floor. The right knee is bent and the right foot placed on the left inner thigh, or in half lotus position. In either foot placement, the hips should be open, with the bent knee pointing towards the side. With the toes of the right foot pointing directly down, the left foot, center of the pelvis, shoulders and head are all vertically aligned. Hands are typically held above the head either pointed directly upwards and unclasped, or clasped together in anjali mudra. The asana is typically held for 20 to 60 seconds, returning to tadasana while exhaling, then repeating standing on the opposite leg. Variations In Bikram Yoga, Tree Pose (called \\"Tadasana\\" in Bikram Yoga) is a slightly different standing posture, with one leg folded in Padmasana and the hands together over the chest in prayer position. It is followed by bending the straight leg into a squatting position (called Toe Stand or \\"Padangustasana\\" in Bikram Yoga) with the heel raised and the thigh resting on the calf and heel, the other leg remaining in (half) Padmasana.

She first worked in Dundee, then held classes in New Jersey for a women's school. She moved to New Orleans not long afterwards to co-own another women's school just before the American Civil War. In 1878, she returned to Glengarry County to teach a private school. In 1879, minister Donald Ross asked Baker to teach at a missionary school in Prince Albert, on behalf of the Presbyterian church. She accepted the offer, and trekked cross-country to arrive at the western territory in 1879. She earned a permanent teaching grant at the mission school in 1880. In 1890, Baker relocated to the Makoce Washte reserves in present-day South Dakota, where she served as chief instructor at a school for Sioux refugees.

The church is known today for the Anchorhold room located on the south side of a church.

Retrieved 25 October 2009.  King's Lynn Minster (St Margaret's Church)  St Margaret's Church St Margaret's Church at night The construction of St Margaret's Church () in 1101 is the point at which King's Lynn first came into existence in terms of how it is now recognised today. Commissioned by the Bishop of Norwich, Herbert de Losinga, at the request of the townspeople 'in honour of the Holy Mary Magdalene and St Margaret and all holy virgins', the church is one of the town's most dominating landmarks.\\"St Margaret's Website History Page\\", St Margaret's Website, 2003 Along with St Nicholas' church in Great Yarmouth, it was granted the honorific title of \\"minster\\" in 2011. The most serious damage to the church occurred in 1741, when a great storm destroyed the spires of St Margaret's church and St Nicholas' Chapel as well as St Margaret's central lantern. Despite generous donations totalling ¬£1,000 from George II and Robert Walpole, the ¬£3,500 required was not raised, and the church was not able to be restored to its former glory. The sixteen misericords date from 1370 to 1377. These predominately feature heads; for instance, S-02 is the head of Edward the Black Prince. The supporters are mainly floral / foliate. The church is a Grade I listed building.  St Nicholas Chapel  St Nicholas Chapel St Nicholas Chapel () was constructed around 1200, during the expansion of Lynn by Bishop William Turbus, the third Bishop of Norwich. The expansion saw not only the construction of the chapel, but also the Tuesday Market Place, which is still the primary marketplace in the town today. Consequently, the chapel quickly became Lynn's second church by a comfortable margin. It was not long before it was so popular that it launched pleas to become an independent parish from St Margaret's Church; in 1426 St Nicholas Chapel had congregations of 1,400 ‚Äì compared to 1,600 at St Margaret's. Despite this, it took until 1627 before the chapel obtained baptismal rights. Due to its rise in popularity, and the fact that the north of Lynn became quite affluent, the chapel was rebuilt between 1380 and 1410 on a much larger scale in the grand perpendicular scale of the time. The church is England's largest chapel of ease, a chapel dependent on a church and serving part of the parish for the convenience of parishioners nearby.\\"King‚Äôs Lynn, St Nicholas Chapel \\", A thousand years of English Churches (visitchurches.org.uk) Angel roof, St Nicholas The church is most distinctive for its tall spire, although it is not the original.

At present it is leased by the Borough Council for hire by the public as a space for music, performances, lectures and entertainments. Shakespeare's Guildhall Trust Interior of St George's Guildhall Theatre  Custom House  Custom house The King's Lynn Custom House () is one of the town's most iconic landmarks. It was designed by architect Henry Bell and built by Sir John Turner in 1683. It was not the first Custom House built for the town ‚Äì originally one was constructed in 1620 on the site where the Hogge Mansion is currently located (currently occupied by Barclay's Bank); however, this was too small and as a result a larger one was needed; St George's Guildhall was used in the intervening years.

This was completed by August 2006 and on 18 October 2006 the grounds were officially opened by the Mayor, Councillor Ann Clery-Fox. The tower itself was featured in the first season of the BBC TV series Restoration for the Eastern region.  South Gate  The South Gates The South Gate () is one of the most recognisable structures in King's Lynn, as most visitors to the town still have to pass through it. Originally constructed in the 14th century, it was rebuilt in the 1450s, much in the form that is seen today. However the ashlar front, which gives the building a much more imposing impression, is merely a facade which was added in 1520; the structure itself is actually bricks and mortar, which given the date of construction makes it one of the oldest surviving brick structures in the country. It is a Grade I listed building. Although the gate has stood largely unaltered since the 1520, it was modified later in the 19th century\\"South Gate \\", King's Lynn & West Norfolk Borough Council Website with the two smaller arches to the side of the main one. Whilst the main arch was used for horse-drawn carriages, the smaller arches were intended for pedestrians ‚Äì mainly the lower class. However, by the end of the 19th century the traffic demands had grown so much that in 1899 London Road was widened, and now the gate only straddles half of the road. Today, traffic still passes through the arch to enter from the south. The structure is situated on London Road, one of the busiest roads in the town, meaning there is a constant stream of traffic through it during the day. Despite this, accidents are unheard of, as the arch can comfortably fit most forms of traffic from articulated lorries to double-decker buses.  Town Hall and Trinity Guildhall  The Town Hall and Trinity Guildhall The town hall of King's Lynn () has existed since the early fifteenth century, between 1422 and 1428,Francis Frith's \\"Around King's Lynn\\" by Barry Pardue, page 41 ‚Äì when the Guildhall of the Holy Trinity was built. It is the most prominent feature of the town hall today with its steep arched roof, large window and chequered patterned exterior. The building was enlarged in 1624, when an extension with the same chequered style was added which now forms the main entrance to the town hall. The guildhall is a Grade I listed building. The arms of Elizabeth I can be seen above the main window on this building. They were removed from St James' Church on 7 August 1624. The arms of Charles II are above them ‚Äì they were added 40 years later.Francis Frith's \\"Around King's Lynn\\" by Barry Pardue, page 43 ‚Äì Corn Exchange Corn Exchange The Grade II listed facade of King's Lynn Corn Exchange, originally built in 1854, is a testimony to the glory of Victorian architecture. The hall itself is a simple brick rectangle with a glazed roof supported by delicate wrought-iron trusses. The building was still used for community events until the mid-1990s, although showing signs of age. A project to restore and enlarge it, as had been done with Cambridge corn exchangehttp://cambridge-live-cornex.runtime- collective.com/ccm/cornex/pages/grand-arcade-information.en in the mid-1980s, was begun with the aim of creating a venue suitable for a wide range of cultural activities. The transformed building was reopened in 1996 after a ¬£4.4million revamp. A brick extension was added at the rear of the building to accommodate staff facilities. Contrary to popular legend, the statue above the magnificent facade is that of Demeter, Greek goddess of the harvest, and not Margaret Thatcher.  The Dukes Head hotel The Dukes Head is reputed to be one of the most haunted buildings in Kings Lynn. It stands on the site of an ancient inn called the Gryffin. There is a grey lady, the man who reputedly shot himself in room 18 during the 18th century, and probably a host of other less spooktacular residents.  Red Mount  Red Mount Sitting in the centre of The Walks, King's Lynn main urban park, lies the Red Mount chapel (). Also known as 'Our Lady's Chapel' it is a remarkable building in that it is completely unique and no other building like it can be found. It was built in the 15th century to contain a relic of the Virgin, but was also used by pilgrims on their way to Walsingham.Francis Frith's \\"Around King's Lynn\\" by Barry Pardue, page 48 ‚Äì . It was built by Robert Corraunce on instructions from the prior of Lynn. The inner core is divided into 3 storeys and there is an additional cross-shaped ashlar building in Ancaster stone on top.Francis Frith's \\"Around King's Lynn\\" by Barry Pardue, page 49 ‚Äì Before the renovation of the Walks, its location in the centre of the park meant it was the target of vandalism ‚Äì particularly graffiti ‚Äì however since rejuvenating the Walks the curious landmark is now open to the public during the day. It is a Grade I listed building. The red mount was the subject of a painting by Thomas Baines.  Library  The Library The King's Lynn library () was funded and opened by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. It is possible that he chose King's Lynn as a site for the library due to its close proximity to the Royal residence in Sandringham in an attempt to get a knighthood ‚Äì however, this is probably a cynical point of view given Carnegie's history of financing libraries across the world, as well as his positive comments regarding King's Lynn and similar towns in his autobiography.\\"Chapter 23\\", Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie It had a brief period of fame in May 2010 following reports in the national press that bouncers had been hired to keep order in the Library following incidences of anti-social behaviour. The ghostly monk who reputedly haunts the cellar is another matter however, at one time, female staff were apparently too scared to enter the area by themselves. The library is built on the site of the Greyfriars monastery, and sits adjacent to the remains of the tower. The library is still in use today and is still the town's primary library, opening Monday to Saturday. It is situated on London Road, the main entrance to the town, opposite one of the entrances to the Walks, the town's main urban park. Old county court house Old county court house The County Court was built in 1861 and closed in the recent years. It is now home to a firm of solicitors.  Theatre Royal  Theatre Royal The Theatre Royal () is situated in St James Street next to the Greyfriars Tower. It is no longer used as a theatre and is now the home of Gala bingo. The present building replaced a previous structure that burnt down in May 1936. The Majestic Cinema The Majestic Cinema One of Kings Lynn's most beautiful buildings. The cinema, situated in Tower Street, was built and run by Ernest,Ralph,Adams in 1927. Mr. Adams worked closely with architects Carnell and White, in its design and construction, buying the contents of the Empire, Leicester Square, London, which following restoration, were installed in the interior of the Majestic. The Majestic officially opened on 23 May 1928; It was later owned by Union and subsequently ABC Cinemas. this year is commemorated in the stained glass window at the front of the building.  Hanseatic Warehouse  Hanseatic Warehouse Located on St Margaret's Lane, the Hanseatic Warehouse () is the only surviving Hansa building in England. It was constructed in 1475 following the Treaty of Utrecht, allowing Hansa to establish a trading depot in Lynn for the first time. It was used as such until 1751, by which time the river had receded. It was then sold to Lynn merchant Edward Everard for ¬£800. He added the Georgian town house at the East side of the building which is now known as St. Margaret's House (and Grade I listed), after the nearby church. In 1971 it was renovated as part of a preservation project and converted into offices by the Norfolk County Council. It is currently used by the council for various functions, including weddings, as it houses Lynn's register office. The building is also known as the Kontor.\\"Lynn and the German Hanse\\", Dr Paul Richards  Hampton Court  Hampton Court Located near to St Margaret's Church, Hampton Court () is a Grade I listed group of buildings forming a quadrangular shape which were built up over a period of 300 years. The South Wing was constructed first, consisting mainly of a 14th-century merchant's hall house and is thus the earliest surviving section. The West Wing was constructed towards the end of the 15th century, probably as a warehouse to better service and extend the business part of the merchants premises. When it was constructed, it was on the edge of the river bank, but by the 17th century the river had receded and the warehouse was converted into a house.  Clifton House  Clifton house tower Clifton House () is a Grade I listed building located at the heart of King's Lynn. A former merchant's house, it retains an amazing series of historic interiors dating from the 13th to the 18th centuries. Features of interest include two tiled floors from the later 13th century (the largest in-situ tiled floors in any secular building in Britain); the 14th-century vaulted undercroft; the five-storey Elizabethan tower and a series of rooms created by the architect Henry Bell in 1700. The house is a privately owned family home, but is open to visitors on a number of occasions during the year.\\"Clifton House, A Medieval Merchants House\\", Clifton House Website  Marriott's Warehouse  Marriott's Warehouse Marriott's Warehouse, was originally an old Tudor Warehouse built on the quayside late in the Elizabethan Era (1533‚Äì1603). Thomas Clayborne funded its construction. It was used to store corn from visiting ships, and is believed to have been constructed with robbed out materials taken from monastic properties confiscated by the crown during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII of England (1491‚Äì1547). Restored in the early 2000s as The Green Quay the building has now reverted to its original name. It is now used as an educational facility, with exhibits about The Wash, The Fens and local heritage on the upper floors, while the ground floor has become a popular restaurant.\\"Marriott's Warehouse Trust\\", Marriott's Warehouse Trust Website St Anne's Fort St Anne's fort Built in 1570. Located in the northwest corner of the town where the Fisher Fleet joined the Ouse, it was the major fortification in Lynn until replaced by defences outside the town in 1839. It was originally just an earthwork platform for cannons, some buildings, a section of wall and a gate giving access to the Fisher Fleet. In 1625 pirate raids on Lynn led to the town petitioning the King for 12 guns for the battery. These were delivered. Even as late as 1778, when the ten guns in the fort were replaced by ten 18-pounders, the battery had no protective parapet. Troops were billeted here for many years. Decommissioned in 1839, it was never more than a coastal battery. Today there are only fragmentary remains of walls and the pilot's office. Until the late 1930s a small square lock-up stood nearby where drunken sailors and townspeople were incarcerated for the night. The Lattice House  Ye Olde Lattice Inn This pub (originally a 15thC town house) situated in Chapel Street, not far from the Tuesday Market Place, uses the name acquired in 1714, when this ancient building first became an inn. Previously, it had been used for centuries by the clerks of the nearby Chapel of St Nicholas. The growth of Lynn, in the 18th century, saw the building of new taverns, as well as the conversion of shops or workshops. The Lattice House is an example of the latter, becoming a public house in 1714. For many years it was called Ye Olde Lattice Inn, until its closure in 1919. It became a public house once again in 1982. The Grampus The Grampus An old hostelry in Pilot street. It ceased to be a public house in 1921 and is now a private residence. The Valiant Sailor The Valiant sailor A 15th-century building in Nelson street. It probably became an inn in the late 1600 but ceased to be licensed in 1925. The well-known artist Walter Dexter lived here until his tragic death in 1958, when he was struck by a motorbike while crossing a road. The Exorcist's house  Exorcist's house This house was attached to St Nicholas's church. The position of Exorcist in olden times was one which a Catholic priest could hold as he progressed up the church career ladder. It has a reputation of being haunted.

It was originally constructed to much controversy in the 1960s, as many people objected to the idea of a traditional market town having its historic centre pulled down and replaced with modern shops. A panoramic view of the Vancouver Shopping District with globe visible in the right foreground Entering the Vancouver Shopping Centre In 2007, the shopping centre was rebranded 'The Vancouver Quarter' with a sign placed at the top of the circular building (currently Costa); it was previously just referred to as the 'Vancouver Shopping Centre', the name Vancouver coming from the explorer Captain George Vancouver, who was born in the town.  Police Station  King's Lynn Police Station The Police Station () is situated next to the Greyfriars Tower, near to the Multi-storey car park.  St. James Street Car Park  St James's car park Completed in 2005, the St. James Street Car Park () is the only multi-storey car park in the town. It was built in conjunction with the redevelopment of the Vancouver Shopping Centre. The car park was described as 'without compare' by Kevin Beresford,\\"Amazing space: Kevin's guide to car parks\\", Daily Telegraph\\"Car park shows off its award\\", Lynn News self-appointed head of the Car Park Appreciation Society, who awarded the car park as the best in Britain ‚Äì claiming it was 'love at first site', citing praise: \\"It is spacious, well-lit and adorned with beautiful red brickwork, complemented by slinky silver vertical aluminium fins that create a rippling wave effect. However, these cosmetic fins are apt to cause problems in high winds. Part of the reason the car park has received such praise for its aesthetics is the commitment by the council to ensure that none of the materials used in construction were downgraded to cheaper alternatives.\\"Best of British\\", Lynn News There are 700 car parking spaces on 4 levels, 4 pay points, two elevators and 3 staircases.  Post Office  The Central Post Office (), found on Baxter's Plain in King's Lynn, closed from public use in late September 2007. Customers wanting to send letters or parcels now have to go to a refurbished section of Lynn's WHSmith branch on Norfolk Street. Incidentally, the oak panels lining the interior walls of this building were taken from the old London bridge. The World War memorial plaque is now located in the Austin fields sorting office.  Industrial buildings   King's Lynn Power Station  King's Lynn Power Station King's Lynn Power Station () is located on Willows Business Park, Saddlebow, King's Lynn. The plant is Gas Fired which is supplied using gas from Transco's National Transmission System. Construction of the power station began in October 1994 and was completed and started producing electricity in December 1997. The owners of the plant, TXU sold the plant to Centrica in October 2001. Although popular belief is that the power station was built on the site of the old Sugar Beet Factory the actual site is slightly south of where the plant was situated.\\"Aerial photograph\\", Google Maps  King's Lynn Docks  The Docks Considered to be as important to England in medieval timesKing's Lynn by Paul Richards, inside front cover ‚Äì . as Liverpool was during the Industrial Revolution, the port at King's Lynn has been fundamental to the town's economy as long as it has existed. Originally, ships docked at the town near the Customs House, down past the quay near St Margaret's Church. However, with the development in ship design during the Industrial Revolution this was no longer adequate, and in the 19th century the larger, more modern docks () were constructed. Whilst the surrounding structures and equipment are now obviously more modern, the docks themselves are still the same today. The white tower, a grain silo,\\"TF6120 : Bentinck Dock at King's Lynn\\", geograph.org.uk seen in the photograph is the tallest structure in King's Lynn and can be seen for miles.  Gaywood   Gaywood Clock  Gaywood clock A war memorial erected by the residents of Gaywood in 1920. It used to be located in the centre of the nearby road until being moved in 1990 to the paved area outside the former Clock Caf√©. Bishop's Terrace Bishop's Terrace Grade II listed 16th-century building tastefully converted into shop units. Many people miss this building on their rush to get somewhere else. Oak beams are on display in many of the shop units.  Gaywood Almshouses  Gaywood Almshouses These almshouses are of 13th-century origin. Until comparatively recent times they were known as Gaywood Hospital. They were destroyed in the Siege of Lynn in 1643, and rebuilt in 1649. The eight almshouses are arranged around a courtyard. They were restored in 1904, with further modernisation in 1965. There is a well-known painting by Sir George Clausen (1852 ‚Äì 1944) of these almshouses from 1881.  Demolished Buildings  The Pilot Cinema The old Pilot Cinema The Pilot cinema on Pilot Street was built by local builder Ben Culey in 1938. It closed in 1983 and the last film shown according to local memory was Gandhi. Since then it has been a roller skating rink, a garden centre and, lastly, Zoots nightclub which was refurbished at a cost of 2 million pounds before it reopened on 15 April 1999. It closed the doors for the final time on Saturday, 26 January 2008. Since then it has been left to become derelict. In April 2014 the old pilot cinema was demolished to make way for a new housing development.  Campbell's Soup Tower (1959‚Äì2012)  Campbell's Soup Tower, on 14 January 2012, the day before its demolition. In a low-rise market town, the vertical addition of the Campbell's Soup Tower () in 1959\\"History of Campbell's \\", Campbell's official website. marked a radical departure from the norm. Due to the flat nature of the Fens the building was visible for miles, much more prominently than any of the other tall buildings, mostly church towers, so it was often referred to as King's Lynn's 'Skyscraper'. The tower was built as part of Campbell's international expansion. King's Lynn was chosen as a site due to the large local agricultural economy. The building was situated on the town's largest commercial/industrial sector, the Hardwick Estate. It was the most noticeable part of the estate when driving past on the A47 southern bypass. The tower was demolished by a controlled explosion on 15 January 2012 to make way for a new Tesco superstore and outlet which opened in October 2013.\\"\\", BBC News The Shambles The Shambles (meat market downstairs and grammar school upstairs) once stood near the site of the Saturday market place until 1914, when it was demolished to enlarge the marketplace. Eugene Arram taught in the grammar school here. There are sealed off underground passages associated with this building that were allegedly used in WW2 as air raid shelters. The shambles pre 1914 Comparison photo of St Margaret's today from the same viewpoint  East Gate  East Gate, probably late 18thc Approximately 200 years prior to the erection of the South Gate, there was another gate, the East Gate, situated on the borders of King's Lynn and Gaywood. The East Gate originally stood near what is now known as Dodman's Bridge, near the College of West Anglia. Also known as St. Catherine's Gate, it was demolished in 1800 because the low arch was a hindrance to traffic. The stone was taken to Hillington Hall and used in the construction of the main gate, while the coat of arms that formerly adorned the East Gate is now above the entrance to Kings Lynn court house. Reffley Temple Reffley Temple today Reffley temple The inscription above the door read: REFFLEY TEMPLE Erected by a Friendly Society AD 1789 Enlarged AD 1841 The Brethren or Sons of Reffley were a secret society of Royalist sympathisers formed in 1650. In 1750‚Äì56 an obelisk dedicated to 'Bacchus and Venus' was erected at the site of a chalybeate spring, the basin of which still exists, although damaged and dry. The Temple was built by the brethren as a rendezvous for social gatherings. In the 1980s the temple was vandalised and pulled down, the obelisk demolished, and the spring dried out. On one side of the obelisk was a curse, stating \\"Whosoever shall remove this or bid its removal, let him die the last of his race\\". The Athenaeum The Athenaeum The Athenaeum was built on Baxter's plain where the old post office now stands. It opened on 16 August 1854 with the aim of uniting the town's literary, artistic and scientific societies under a single roof. Unfortunately it was a commercial failure and a large part of the building was taken over by the government as a post office and telegraph station on 20 January 1883.

It lies along the southeast side of Bald Eagle Creek, and south of the West Branch Susquehanna River, and is the westernmost ridge in its section of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. The ridge line separates the West Branch Susquehanna Valley from the Nippenose and White Deer Hole Valleys, and Bald Eagle Valley from Nittany Valley. Bald Eagle Mountain lies in the central portion of Centre County, the southern portion of Clinton County, the southern portion of Lycoming County, and the ridge line forms part of the border between Blair County and Huntingdon County. It runs from the water gap formed with Brush Mountain by the Little Juniata River at Tyrone, to the bend in the West Branch Susquehanna River just east of Williamsport, a distance of approximately 60 miles (100 km). The Julian and Unionville Pikes are paved roads that cross the ridge near State College, along with and U.S. Route 322 and Interstate 99 which pass through the now enlarged wind gap known as \\"Skytop\\". Most other major road crossings are through gaps, including Interstate 80 which passes through the Curtin Gap east of Milesburg, Pennsylvania. There are water gaps in the ridge formed by Spring Creek in Milesburg and Fishing Creek in Mill Hall (where U.S. Route 220 crosses). U.S. Route 15 crosses south of Williamsport near Bald Eagle Mountain's eastern end. Bald Eagle Ridge is popular with soaring birds and glider pilots ridge soaring along its slopes. This ridge is part of a chain of ridges that stretch south to Tennessee. The Ridge Soaring Gliderport lies at the foot of this ridge between Julian and Unionville. A mature oak and hickory forest covers the Bald Eagle Mountain. It is one of the best sites in the eastern United States for viewing the migration of the golden eagle. Geology of Bald Eagle Mountain Bald Eagle Mountain is in the western part of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains. Brush Mountain, and neighboring Nittany Mountain and Tussey Mountain ridges, are part of the same Paleozoic anticline rock formation consisting of older Ordovicial Bald Eagle Formation sandstone and Juniata Formation Shale, and younger Silurian Tuscarora Formation Quartzite. Geologic cross section along the Little Juniata River During the Appalachian orogeny, these layers folded up with the underlying and overlying layers into the Nittany Arch. The arch was a Himalayan scale mountain that towered above what is now Nittany Valley, where the oldest rock layers from deep within the eroded mountain are now exposed. Younger rocks from the outer layers of the arch are exposed on the West side of the ridge in the Bald Eagle Valley, with the youngest across the valley at the foot of the Allegheny Front. These sedimentary rock layers were tipped almost vertical on the side of the ancient mountain where Bald Eagle Mountain now lies. The Tuscarora Quartzite is more resistant to erosion than Bald Eagle sandstone, and both are more durable than the Juniata Shale sandwiched in- between. Softer rock layers on either side of these eroded, leaving the double crested Bald Eagle Mountain ridge, with a depression between the higher western and slightly lower eastern ridge lines. On the neighboring ridges that formed the opposite slope of the ancient mountain, the same three rock layers are exposed in reverse order, with the oldest rocks near the hinge of the fold. Since the rock layers on these ridges are not vertical, the Tuscarora Formation underlies a much higher crest, and the Bald Eagle Formation creates a series of lower \\"terraces\\" broken by small ravines. The southeast slope of the ridge is underlaid by Juniata Formation sandstone. The northwest slope of the ridge, where the rock layers are near vertical, exposes a series of rock layers, from summit to foot, or older to younger: Clinton Group sandstone and shale, Mifflintown Formation shale and limestone, Bloomsburg Formation shale, siltstone, sandstone, and mudstone, Wills Creek Formation shale, siltstone, limestone, and dolomite, Tonoloway Formation limestone, Keyser Formation limestone, Old Port Formation Shriver chert, Mandata shale, Corriganville chert, New Creek limestone and Ridgeley Member sandstone, and Onondaga Formation calcareous shale. The Bald Eagle sandstone is also laced with pyrite veins, and when exposed to air and water, these minerals produce sulfuric acid, contaminating both surface runoff and groundwater. Construction of Interstate 99 where it crosses Bald Eagle Mountain has been delayed since 2004 by complaints from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection about acidic runoff from pyritic rock excavated from this formation. The planned I-99/I-80 interchange further north in the Nittany Valley at the foot of the ridge was redesigned to avoid excavating contaminated rock from the same formation.

Forests cover almost one-half of the land area and are typically tropical, with the dominant family, Dipterocarpaceae, representing 75% of the stands. The forest also has vines, epiphytes, and climbers. Open grasslands, ranging up to 2.4 m (8 ft) in height, occupy one-fourth of the land area; they are man- made, the aftermath of the slash-and-burn agricultural system, and most contain tropical savanna grasses that are nonnutritious and difficult to eradicate. The diverse flora includes 8,000 species of flowering plants, 1,000 kinds of ferns, and 800 species of orchids. Seventy to eighty percent of non-flying mammals in the Philippines are found nowhere else in the world.Ancient Geological History of the Philippines The Field Museum.org Retrieved January 2, 2007. Common mammals include the wild hog, deer, wild carabao, monkey, civet cat, and various rodents. There are about 196 breeding species of birds, among the more numerous being the megapodes (turkey-like wildfowl), button quail, jungle fowl, peacock pheasant, dove, pigeon, parrot, and hornbill. Reptilian life is represented by 190 species; there are crocodiles and the larger snakes include the python and several varieties of cobra. The fauna on Bohol is almost identical to that on Mindanao, Samar, and Leyte, but not that on nearby Negros.

In late 2013 it was on temporary display at the Prado in Madrid (with the other El Grecos), following a period of cleaning and conservation work there; it was returned to Toledo in 2014. It is one of El Greco's most famous works.M. Lambraki-Plaka, El Greco-The Greek, pp. 43‚Äì44. A document dated July 2, 1577 which refers to this painting is the earliest record of El Greco's presence in Spain. The commission for the painting was secured thanks to El Greco's friendship from Rome with Luis, the son of Diego de Castilla, the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo. De Castilla senior also arranged El Greco's other major commission, on which he worked simultaneously, the paintings for the Toledan church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo.Brown, p. 95 Description The painting shows Christ looking up to Heaven with an expression of serenity; His idealized figure seems segregated from the other people and the violence surrounding him.M. Tazartes, El Greco, p. 100. A figure dressed in black in the background points at Christ accusingly, while two others argue over who will have His garments. A man in green to Christ's left holds Him firmly with a rope and is about to rip off His robe in preparation for his crucifixion. At the lower right, a man in yellow bends over the cross and drills a hole to facilitate the insertion of a nail to be driven through Christ's feet. The radiant face of the Savior is violently juxtaposed to the coarse figures of the executioners, who are amassed around Him creating an impression of disturbance with their movements, their gestures and lances. M. Lambraki- Plaka, El Greco-The Greek, p. 53. Christ is clad in a bright red robe; it is on this red tunic that El Greco concentrated the full expressive force of his art. The purple garment (a metonymic symbol of the divine passion) is spread out in a light fold; only the chromatic couple of yellow and blue in the foreground raises a separate note which approaches, in power, the glorifying hymn of the red. In the left foreground, the three Marys contemplate the scene with distress. Their presence was objected to by the Cathedral authorities, since they are not mentioned as present at this point in the Gospels. Greco probably took this detail, with some others like the rope around Christ's wrists, from the account in the Meditations on the Passion of Jesus Christ by Saint Bonaventure.Brown op. cit. p. 232. The placement of the tormentors higher than the head of Christ also was cited by the commissioners of the Cathedral in the arbitration process over the price. In designing the composition vertically and compactly in the foreground El Greco seems to have been motivated by the desire to show the oppression of Christ by his cruel tormentors. The figure of Christ, robust, tall and tranquil, dominates the center of the composition which is built vertically like a wall. El Greco chose a method of space elimination that is common to middle and late 16th- century Mannerists. According to Wethey, El Greco \\"probably recalled late Byzantine paintings in which the superposition of heads row upon row is employed to suggest a crowd\\". Critical analysis Harold Wethey regards the painting as a \\"masterpiece of extraordinary originality\\". The powerful effect of the painting especially depends upon his original and forceful use of colour. Something of the effect of the grand images of the Saviour in Byzantine art is recalled; by this date the disrobing was a rare subject in Western art.Brown op. cit p. 232. The motif of the crowding round Christ suggests an acquaintance with the works of Northern artists, like Bosch (the best collection of whose works belonged to Philip II); the figure preparing the Cross could be derived from the similar figure bending forward in Raphael's tapestry and cartoon of the Miraculous Draught of Fishes, which he would have known from Rome. This is, however, the last time that there are any hints of specific borrowings. The original altar of gilded wood that El Greco designed for the painting has been destroyed, but his small sculptured group of the Miracle of St. Ildefonso still survives on the lower center of the frame. Arbitration The Munich variant. The Disrobing of Christ was a subject of a dispute between the painter and the representatives of the Cathedral regarding the price of the work; El Greco was forced to have recourse to legal arbitration and eventually received only 350 ducats, when his own appraiser had valued it at 950. He was also supposed to remove some of the figures objected to, which he never did.Brown op. cit. pp. 95‚Äì97. Variants Despite the complaints of the commissioners of the Cathedral the painting was hugely successful; currently, more than 17 versions of the painting are known. Two greatly reduced versions are generally accepted as from the hand of El Greco himself; possibly one may have been an oil sketch study, or, more likely, a studio record of the composition. Other replica versions may also be in whole or part by the master himself.Brown op. cit. pp. 232‚Äì233. A 1581-1586 autograph or studio copy has been in the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon since 1886. A c.1600 variant of the work is in the National Gallery in Oslo, Norway ‚Äî this is attributed to the artist. Another in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich is thought to be an autograph preparatory sketch for the main work. References Sources * Brown, Jonathan (ed.)

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 544. It is situated on a hill close to the larger villages of Bugbrooke, Milton Malsor and Blisworth, with a linked public footpath network. History Sited near Watling Street, the ancient way from the ports of Kent to Wroxeter, Gayton was not recorded in the Domesday Book survey of 1086 but was probably the unnamed settlement in the Hundred of Towcester held by the knight Sigar of Chocques, who came from the village of that name near B√©thune in the north of France. By 1162 it had passed to his relation Robert V of B√©thune, being inherited in turn by his eldest son Robert VI, by his second son William II, by William's eldest son Daniel and then by Daniel's younger brother. This was Robert VII, who in 1242 sold the manor along with virtually all his other English properties to Robert of . In 1248 Robert sold Gayton to Ingram of Fiennes, who in 1270 passed it to Michael of Northampton, a cleric. Sir Philip de Gayton (d.1316), had a daughter named Scholastica de Gayton (d.1354) and she was said to have murdered her husband. She had a sister called Julianna who bore a child known as Mabila. Julianna later met her fate by burning as it was decided that she was a witch. The facts of this tale have become somewhat confused over the centuries but the de Gayton tombs are in the village church. Sir Francis Tanfield (d. 1558), governor of Lord Falkland‚Äôs Colony of Newfoundland, Canada 1623‚Äì25 built the Manor House in the village in the early 17th century and this house has some similarity to Sir Thomas Tresham's at Lyveden New Bield. It is probable that Sir Francis was the son of Clement Tanfield and his wife, Anne, of Gayton. He was born in 1565 and was knighted in July 1603 and, in September, accompanied the new ambassador, Lord Spencer, to the court of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg, now part of southern Germany. The Hughes of Gwerclas family, a Welsh family of native royal blood, resided at the Manor House during the late 18th Century. There were three brickyards in the parish, now all gone and filled in with domestic refuse.  Iron ore quarrying  The parish was also a source of ironstone which was quarried to the south east of the village, either side of the road to Blisworth up to and just beyond the crossroads with the road from Tiffield to Milton Malsor. The quarries began operation in about 1853 and continued to 1921 with possibly a break round about 1900. The quarries began close to the village and worked their way towards Blisworth as the ore was worked out. Quarrying was by hand with the aid of explosives. The ore was taken away by narrow gauge tramways in wagons pulled by horses for most of that time but a steam locomotive and a petrol engined locomotive were used from 1918. For the most part these tramways led to a standard gauge branch railway which ran from north east of the Gayton-Blisworth road to the main line with a junction facing Nether Heyford. This branch was at various times worked by horses or a steam locomotive. However one of the quarries, which operated between 1863 and 1884 had a tramway which led to another railway. This was the line from Blisworth to Towcester which was built in 1866. This line ran parallel to the earlier branch for most of the earlier branch's course and just to the east of it, but the junction with the main line faced Blisworth Station, rather than Heyford. The wagons from this quarry were lowered down the side of the cutting for the ore be loaded into standard gauge wagons. Until 1891 the ore from Gayton was smelted at Nether Heyford Ironworks but after this closed it was taken elsewhere. More modern quarries at Blisworth had a rail connection with the Northampton Towcester line nearer to Blisworth Station. There is one gullet left and there are remains of some tramway bridges. Some of the quarried fields are now at a lower level than the roads. The quarried land has been restored to agriculture for the most part. Governance The village has a Parish Council. The local district council is South Northamptonshire where Gayton is in Harpole and Grange ward together with the villages of Milton Malsor, Rothersthorpe, Harpole and Kislingbury and elects two members. Facilities West Coast Main Line near Gayton There is a church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. The base of the tower and font are Norman though the upper part of the tower 19th century. The church contains six misericords dating from the 14th and 15th century, unusually, some of these have been modified at a later date, possibly by foreign carvers. There are monuments to Sir Philip and Scholastica de Gayton, Sir Francis Tanfield and his wife and also Mabila de Murdak, (14th century). There is also a village hall and primary school, (Gayton Church of England Primary School), one of the smallest in the county with around 60 pupils. It also has two pub-restaurants. The Eykyn Arms is named after Roger Eykyn who live at Gayton House (probably 18th century, demolished 1972). The Queen Victoria nearby also offers accommodation. There is a village green with a children's play area, refurbished in 2007. Gayton is close to the Grand Union Canal (GUC). At Gayton Junction there is a marina and an arm of the GUC goes down to Northampton through a long flight of locks at Rothersthorpe.

A Jewish player who chose not to play on Yom Kippur in 1934 during a heated pennant race, Greenberg had to face a great deal of antisemitism. In 1938 he nearly broke Babe Ruth's 60 home run record by hitting 58 home runs. Like many players of the era, Greenberg had his career interrupted by military service during World War II. Initially, Greenberg was classified as unfit for service due to flat feet. However, upon re-examination, he was cleared. Before Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Congress had released men over age 28. After the attack, Greenberg immediately reenlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. In 1947, Greenberg, as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates and playing his final season, was one of the few ballplayers to give a warm welcome to Brooklyn Dodgers' Jackie Robinson, the majors' first black player in many years. Robinson later said, \\"Class tells. It sticks out all over Mr. Greenberg\\".  Production  Kempner states that the film took 13 years to make. \\"It was all about raising money for the rights to the archival and feature footage. That was so expensive that I had to stop and start about 20 times.\\"http://www.insightnews.com/aesthetics/10810-aviva-kempner-qthe-life- and-times-of-hank-greenbergq After it's theatrical run, The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg was acquired by Cinemax for its Reel Life series.

Early life and education  Wilks was born in Little Elm, Texas and raised on a farm. He studied Industrial Arts at the North Texas State Teachers College in Denton, Texas, obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1926. He received his master's degree in mathematics in 1928 from the University of Texas. He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Iowa under Everett F. Lindquist; his thesis dealt with a problem of statistical measurement in education, and was published in the Journal of Educational Psychology. Career Wilks became an instructor in mathematics at Princeton University in 1933; in 1938 he assumed the editorship of the journal Annals of Mathematical Statistics in place of Harry C. Carver. Wilks assembled an advisory board for the journal that included major figures in statistics and probability, among them Ronald Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, and Egon Pearson. During World War II he was a consultant with the Office of Naval Research. Both during and after the War he had a profound impact on the application of statistical methods to all aspects of military planning. Wilks was named professor of mathematics and director of the Section of Mathematical Statistics at Princeton in 1944, and became chairman of the Division of Mathematics at the university in 1958. Wilks died in 1964 in Princeton. Work in mathematical statistics He was noted for his work on multivariate statistics. He also conducted work on unit-weighted regression, proving the idea that under a wide variety of common conditions, almost all sets of weights will yield composites that are very highly correlated (Wilks, 1938), a result that has been dubbed Wilks's theorem (Ree, Carretta, & Earles, 1998). Another result, also called ‚ÄúWilks' theorem‚Äù occurs in the theory of likelihood ratio tests, where Wilks showed the distribution of log likelihood ratios is asymptotically \\\\chi^2. From the start of his career, Wilks favored a strong focus on practical applications for the increasingly abstract field of mathematical statistics; he also influenced other researchers, notably John Tukey, in a similar direction. Drawing upon the background of his thesis, Wilks worked with the Educational Testing Service in developing the standardized tests like the SAT that have had a profound effect on American education. He also worked with Walter Shewhart on statistical applications in quality control in manufacturing. Wilks's lambda distribution is a probability distribution related to two independent Wishart distributed variables. It is important in multivariate statistics and likelihood-ratio tests. Honors The American Statistical Association named its Wilks Memorial Award in his honor. References * (Reprint on American Statistical Association's Statisticians in History website).

Initially known for her work as Vocalist in the original duo Mouth Music, she has also maintained a highly respected solo career. Although most associated with Celtic and Gaelic music, she performs a wide range of Early Music and Dance, as well as her own compositions. Formative years Musical and cultural training From an early age, MacKenzie took advantage of growing up in a multi-cultural New York environment. Training as a concert pianist from the age of four (teaching by the age of thirteen, and later specialising in Slavic and Impressionist piano music), she also began to teach herself Scottish Gaelic in her teens. Studying French, Russian and Spanish in high school, she went on to study Russian at Connecticut College. Following her time at Connecticut College, MacKenzie worked at the Manhattan record store World Tone Music, where she immersed herself in the \\"exotic modes and unusual rhythms\\" of folk dance from around the world. This led to work with various dance ensembles in the fields of Balkan, Celtic, Renaissance and Baroque music. At around the same time, MacKenzie worked at maritime museums in Mystic, Ct and South Street, Manhattan, which led to her crewing on sailing ships. She became known as a singer of sea shanties and other work songs, gaining insights regarding the interrelation of movement/work-related music and its organic rhythms. Extending her formal musical studies, MacKenzie attended the New England Conservatory of Music, obtaining a degree in ethnomusicology and music history. While studying at the NEC, she also led the institution's Eastern European Music Ensemble and sang in the Conservatory Choir (performing with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops). First traditional music recordings Following her conservatory studies, MacKenzie was, for a short while, a member of the Boston-Irish band St James Gate (vocals, concertina, whistle), featuring on their eponymous album in 1985. She also spent several years touring America as a solo artist and performing puirt a beul with a local Scottish traditional dance band. In 1986 MacKenzie released her first solo album - Shantyman! ‚Äì under the name Talitha Nelson. This album of original maritime songs from around the world featured contributions from Anne Goodwin and Tony Morris. Mouth Music (1988‚Äì1991) Having visited Scotland several times previously to study and make field recordings, MacKenzie left the United States and settled in Edinburgh in 1987. She joined the Scottish folk ensemble Drumalban, led by James MacDonald Reid; also in the group was piper and violin virtuoso Martyn Bennett. While performing at a concert in a village hall in South Uist, MacKenzie was spotted by Martin Swan, an English-born musician and television producer of Scots descent who was filming in the area. The following year, Swan and MacKenzie joined forces as Mouth Music (Scots for puirt a beul, literally, 'instrumental music from the mouth'), drawing on MacKenzie's repertoire of traditional Gaelic songs, including waulking songs, laments and reels. The resulting recordings blended Gaelic word rhythms with electric and acoustic instrumentation (including fiddles and sparse electric guitars), computer samples and a variety of other electronic beats (including hip-hop). MacKenzie sang and handled vocal arrangements, while Swan played the majority of instruments (acoustic, electric and electronic) with further contributions from Martyn Bennett on pipes and fiddle. The duo's debut album Mouth Music reached number one on the Billboard Top World Music Albums chart as well as topping the Music Week chart. The album also picked up a broad set of poll wins and industry recommendations including listings in Folk Roots magazine‚Äôs 'Albums Of the Year', Q‚Äôs 'Recommended Releases of 1990', The Guardian‚Äôs 'Pick Of The Year' and CMJ‚Äôs 'Best Of 1991 (USA)', and was later dubbed as an early Afro-Celtic music project, anticipating the later work of projects like the Afro-Celt Sound System. Q Magazine called it the album \\"surely the most innovative worldly sound of 1990\\" and Entertainment Weekly referred to it as a ‚Äúmagical treat [which] is a reminder that world music means more than just African or Brazilian exotica. It's any style that takes its soul from a particular tradition and its brains from more global sensibilities ‚Äî it's the sound of many cultures chatting to each other... The sources are treated with muscle as well as respect... Mouth Music's combination of intelligence, beauty, and nerve has the power to unite both world-beatniks and mainstream rock fans in mutual exhilaration.‚Äù Mouth Music ran into problems in 1991 and MacKenzie and Swan parted company. Swan continued recording as \\"Mouth Music\\" and MacKenzie toured internationally under her own name, leading workshops in Mouth Music for Dancing. She considers her subsequent solo albums, S√≤las and Spiorad, to be a truer continuation of the Mouth Music project and showcases her recordings from all three of her Gaelic albums on a MySpace site dedicated to the genre Mouth Music (\\"not a band...it's a genre and a way of performing music.\\"). Work with Sedenka In September 1992, MacKenzie set up the a cappella women's group Sedenka. The name comes from a Bulgarian word meaning 'a gathering of women for the purpose of enjoying each other's company while working through the long winter nights' and its purpose was to gather and share songs and dances from around the world in a variety of styles and languages. Sedenka have performed at many Scottish festivals, events and fundraisers (including the Edinburgh Peace Festival) as well as other events including the 2003 International Festival of the Sea and the Thames Festival Sing For Water events in London between 2002 and 2004. Solo career In 1993, MacKenzie released her second solo album S√≤las (Solace) on Riverboat Records, working with producer-arrangers Iain McKinna and Chris Birkett. Containing a mixture of traditional and original Gaelic songs, it included contributions from Sedenka (on the tracks \\"E h√≥ h√¨\\" and \\"Rol hol ill le√≤\\") and performed well in the World Music charts. In 1995, MacKenzie took on a role in the Gaelic play R√©iteach and toured with the production throughout Scotland. Signing a new deal with Shanachie Entertainment Corporation later in 1995, MacKenzie recorded her third solo album Spiorad (Spirit) in France with Chris Birkett producing and co-arranging once again. Another album of both traditional and original music, Spiorad included Celtic and Slavic music and was released in 1996. In 2004, MacKenzie flew to Hollywood to sing with Dessislava Stefanova and the Bulgarian Women's Choir on the soundtrack of the film Troy. She used the proceeds to set up her own record label, Sonas Multimedia, in order to release her music in both CD and digital download format. This also cemented her ongoing production alliance with Chris Birkett and Mick Glossop. In 2007, MacKenzie began to release digital download-only singles via Sonas Multimedia. The first of these was \\"Wind Chases The Sun\\" (released February 10, 2007), which was an original MacKenzie country ballad dealing with the plight of Native-American political prisoner Leonard Peltier. Two more download singles were made available on March 25, 2007. \\"Family Tree\\" (described as a pop single) was another MacKenzie song written as a musical conversation between a father and daughter as they prepared for a summer vacation of research into the family roots. \\"Amazing Grace\\" was a more traditional work ‚Äì a MacKenzie vocal arrangement of the popular hymn, which also featured Rhiannon Giddens (soprano), Miriam Stockley (alto) and Michael Laffan (bass). On April 5, 2007, MacKenzie released a third download single - \\"Unelanvhi Uwetsi\\" - another version of \\"Amazing Grace\\" recorded by the same lineup as the previous one, but this time with words from the Cherokee hymn written by Reverend Samuel Worcester and Elias Boudinot. On April 26, 2007, MacKenzie released another download single, \\"Indian Summer\\" - a fusion of ragtime and old-timey music incorporating elements of country swing, it was an original MacKenzie song recalling her annual pilgrimage to visit her grandparents in the family heartland in West Virginia, celebrating the past and the present. The next day (on April 27, 2007), she released a fifth download single, \\"Wheeling Island Girls\\", another original Old Timey song based on family reminiscences of West Virginian life at the time of the Great Spring Flood of March 1936. On July 22, 2007, MacKenzie released her fourth album Indian Summer, which celebrated the connection between Celtic and American cultures and explored her own roots on both sides of the Atlantic. It combined her own compositions with traditional songs in a variety of mainstream genres, in English, Scottish Gaelic and a number of Native-American languages, drawing on folk-rock, Americana and Native-American music along the way. Rhiannon Giddens (from the African-American jug band Carolina Chocolate Drops) contributed fiddle, banjo, \\"flat-footin'\\" dancing and additional vocals to many tracks. The album contained four of the five download singles released so far (with the exception of \\"Amazing Grace\\"). The Daily Telegraph hailed Indian Summer as a \\"remarkable record (which) packs boundless range, and writing and performance skills to match the scholarly clout\\" while the BBC's Frank Hennessey hailed MacKenzie as \\"one of the great voices of the world... an extraordinary artist\\" during a broadcast of the \\"Celtic Heartbeat\\" programme on BBC Radio Wales. Irish Music Magazine also praised the album, saying \\"the performances are faultless. (MacKenzie) is blessed with a glorious singing voice that's warm and expressive.\\" MacKenzie is currently teaching at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (RCS) and Edinburgh Napier University and is looking forward to further recording projects, including a World Music album Global Sequence and a collection of Batonebi (Georgian Healing) Songs. She recently was invited to perform as a soloist with the Jubilant Community Choir at the Thames Pageant for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee on June 3, 2012. To coincide with this, she is re-releasing her album Spiorad (spirit), with a newly recorded track \\"Spiorad Iain\\", dedicated to her late husband. Discography Albums *Shantyman!

The lead ship of the class was , laid down 16 May 1961 and commissioned 15 June 1963, at Avondale Shipyards, Louisiana. A second and final ship, USS McCloy, was laid down in parallel with Bronstein. This class comprised the second generation of post-World War II destroyer escorts. These ships can be considered developmental vessels as many new systems were installed to test for future use, such as a new hull design, larger bow- mounted AN/SQS-26AX sonar system, and ASW weaponry. This class was a new design from the keel up, incorporating the FRAM improvements, and was specifically designed to operate the DASH drone helicopter. The sonar was later upgraded to the AN/SQS-26AX(R). The top weight of the new ASW equipment and the large bow-mounted sonar made the Bronstein frigates too slow to operate with the ASW task forces for which they had been designed. Thus the US Navy decided against any further procurement of ships of this class. The later s were given a larger power plant and greater speed. Ships Only two ships of this class were built: and .

A sea- going tug was forcefully boarded after an over night chase while the tug's crew tossed bales of cocaine overboard and weapons fire was released the following morning at dawn. One of the tug's crew was wounded by .50 caliber gunfire and was helo'd off. A Coast Guard detachment estimated the amount and an attempt was made to tow the tug to port. The tug had too much damage and sank in the night after several attempts to salvage her. McCloy made many drug busts late in her life, received several citations and was painted with marijuana leaves for each bust. Other notables include involvement in the rescue of the crew of the submarine . One of the last US Navy diesel submarines, it had a battery compartment fire and was abandoned by her crew off the coast of Florida. McCloy ran lifeguard ops and eventually was designated the tow vessel to bring Bonefish to Charleston, South Carolina.

Her family had been among the first whites to settle in the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania. It is believed that she escaped captivity that first night; she was soon recaptured. Frances was held for the night under a rock ledge along Abraham Creek in what is now part of the state park. She spent the rest of her life with the Native Americans. Her brothers found her 59 years later living on an Indian Reservation near Peru, Indiana. Despite the pleadings of her brothers, Frances refused to leave her family. She had been married twice and was the mother of four children. Frances, now called \\"Mocanaquah\\" (meaning \\"Young Bear\\"), lived for the rest of her life in Indiana. She died in 1847 at the age of 74. Her name lives on in Indiana, where the Frances Slocum State Recreational Area and Lost Sister Trail (in the Mississinewa Reservoir and State Forest) are named in her honor. Her final resting place is marked with a monument along the banks of the Mississinewa River in Indiana. Frances Slocum Lake was built to help control flooding in the North Branch Susquehanna River basin in 1968. Frances Slocum State Park was built around the dam and lake. The park became home to 280 families that were displaced by the flood created by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The park was closed to the public and was not reopened until 1974 (when all the families had moved out of their temporary homes). Recreation A frozen Frances Slocum Lake A picnic area at the park Salamanders are a common sight along Lakeshore Trail Hunting and fishing About of Frances Slocum State Park are open to hunting. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are squirrels, rabbits and white-tailed deer. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Frances Slocum Lake is a warm-water fishery. Fisherman can catch crappie, bluegill, walleye, muskellunge, pickerel, and smallmouth and largemouth bass from the shore, fishing pier and from electric or non-powered boats. Gasoline- powered boats are prohibited at Frances Slocum State Park. Camping and picnicking There are 100 campsites at Frances Slocum State Park. 15 are walk-in tent sites and 85 sites can accommodate tents or trailers. The larger sites have electric hook-ups. Each site has a fire ring and picnic table. There is a modern bathhouse with showers, flush toilets and drinking water. There is a large group tenting area that has a 40 tent capacity. It is within walking distance of the main camping area and its bathhouse. The Park made some changes to its registration process in 2008 to accommodate a new camp store for campers. Previously, camper registration was performed at the Contact Station along the road to the campsites. That building is no longer used, and camper registration is performed at the Main Office near the entrance to the Park. Frances Slocum State Park has several picnic areas. There are three pavilions available to rent. The picnic areas have tables, grills and charcoal disposal pits. They also have restrooms, drinking water, and garbage and recycling bins.  Swimming  The swimming pool is open daily from 11:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M, from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day, unless posted otherwise. A fee is charged for pool use. A seasonal snack bar has fast food and beverages. This activity or structure is ADA accessible. Trails Frances Slocum State Park has of hiking trails. * Frances Slocum Trail is in length.

History Uptown Residence \\"Uptown\\" has traditionally been a name given to the area north of Downtown Toronto. As the portion of the city that could be considered to be downtown or midtown has grown, the region has pushed further north along Yonge Street. The first area known as Uptown was centered on Bloor Street around the University of Toronto. In the nineteenth century, this was the northern fringe of the city; when the university was established it was still largely rural. The neighborhood that grew up in this area in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century became known as Uptown. While this name is no longer used, it was preserved in some institutions, such as the Uptown Residences, a condo on the site of the former Uptown Theatre. Most areas north of Bloor have been referred to as Uptown. Today the area most often refers to the northern portion of the old city of Toronto stretching from St. Clair Avenue to Lawrence Avenue. There is no official city of Toronto definition for Uptown, but the Uptown Yonge Business Improvement area stretches from Eglinton to Lawrence, though today, with the amalgamated city, the North York City Centre, along Yonge Street, an area dense with highrises, could best be described as Uptown.

Plot Careful is set in Tolzbad, a fictional mountain town under constant threat of devastating avalanches that can be triggered by any loud noise or even a too-large expression of emotion. The people of Tolzbad suppress their emotions as much as possible, living in constant vigilance against losing self-control. An opening lecture cautions common advice (\\"Think twice!\\", \\"Don't stand so close to the walnut tree!\\"). The greatest ambition of the citizens of Tolzbad is to become good servants for the reclusive Count Knotkers. Johann and Grigorss are brothers and butlers-in-training. Both are beloved of their mother Zenaida, although she hates their brother Franz, whom they do not speak of and who has been exiled to the attic. The ghost of their dead blind father appears to Franz to warn him of impending doom in the family, yet Franz, paralyzed and mute and covered in cobwebs, can do nothing. The ghost complains to Franz that Zenaida never loved him and harboured love for Count Knotkers instead, although forbidden to marry him by the Count's mother. Johann is betrothed to Klara, daughter of Herr Trotta, and although Grigorss harbours secret love for Klara he says nothing. Johann, meanwhile, becomes incestuously attracted to his own mother Zenaida. He spies on her through the walls of the chimney as she undresses and bathes. He then concocts a love potion for her, and as she drifts into sleep he assaults her, kissing and groping her breasts. Horrified at himself, Johann burns off his lips with a hot coal, cuts off his fingers with garden shears, and throws himself off a mountain. Grigorss becomes infuriated when Zenaida reveals that her passion for Count Knotkers has been rekindled since his mother died, so that no obstacles stand in the way of their union. She reveals that the reason she hates Franz but loves her other sons is because Franz reminds her too much of her hated dead husband, but when she conceived Grigorss and Johann she was thinking about the Count. Grigorss challenges the Count to a duel to avenge his father's honour, but Zenaida talks him out of it by finally accepting Franz into the family. However, Klara convinces Grigorss to go through with the duel. Klara has an incestuous love for her father, Herr Trotta, who ignores her, but lavishes attention on her sister Sigleinde. Inspired after viewing the enchained wild mountain girl Gerda, this duel is the first step for Klata to plan her revenge. They duel with daggers, and Grigorss stabs Count Knotkers. He heads home, where Zenaida cares for him after he collapses from exhaustion. However, when she discovers he has killed her beloved Count, she throws him out of the house and hangs herself in the attic in front of Franz. Grigorss is taken by Klara to a mountain cave she once hopefully prepared as a love den for her and her father, she now claims that this can be their new home. On the gondola ride there, Klara tells Grigorss that her father raped her and they must plan his death. Grigorss takes Herr Trotta on a sleigh ride, during which he shoots a pistol to start an avalanche to bury Trotta. All goes according to plan, except that Klara throws herself into the sleigh to die while kissing her father. Alone, Grigorss retreats to the mountain cave. A single teardrop causes another avalanche, which traps him inside, where he freezes to death while hallucinating a happy reunion with his parents. As the film ends, Franz and Sigleinde join together to search the mountains for their lost family members, not realizing they are dead.

They were introduced to geometric design by Duchon. They are an important special case of a polyharmonic spline. Robust Point Matching (RPM) is a common extension and shortly known as the TPS-RPM algorithm. Physical analogy The name thin plate spline refers to a physical analogy involving the bending of a thin sheet of metal. Just as the metal has rigidity, the TPS fit resists bending also, implying a penalty involving the smoothness of the fitted surface. In the physical setting, the deflection is in the z direction, orthogonal to the plane. In order to apply this idea to the problem of coordinate transformation, one interprets the lifting of the plate as a displacement of the x or y coordinates within the plane. In 2D cases, given a set of K corresponding points, the TPS warp is described by 2(K+3) parameters which include 6 global affine motion parameters and 2K coefficients for correspondences of the control points. These parameters are computed by solving a linear system, in other words, TPS has a closed-form solution. Smoothness measure The TPS arises from consideration of the integral of the square of the second derivative‚Äîthis forms its smoothness measure. In the case where x is two dimensional, for interpolation, the TPS fits a mapping function f(x) between corresponding point-sets \\\\\\\\{y_i\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\} that minimizes the following energy function: : E_{\\\\mathrm{tps}}(f) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\|y_i - f(x_i) \\\\|^2 The smoothing variant, correspondingly, uses a tuning parameter \\\\lambda to control the rigidity of the deformation, balancing the aforementioned criterion with the measure of goodness of fit, thus minimizing: : E_{\\\\mathrm{tps},\\\\mathrm{smooth}}(f) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K \\\\|y_i - f(x_i) \\\\|^2 + \\\\lambda \\\\iint\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x_1^2}\\\\right)^2 + 2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x_2^2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\right] \\\\textrm{d} x_1 \\\\, \\\\textrm{d}x_2 For this variational problem, it can be shown that there exists a unique minimizer f . The finite element discretization of this variational problem, the method of elastic maps, is used for data mining and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Radial basis function The thin plate spline has a natural representation in terms of radial basis functions. Given a set of control points \\\\\\\\{c_{i}, i = 1,2, \\\\ldots,K\\\\\\\\}, a radial basis function defines a spatial mapping which maps any location x in space to a new location f(x), represented by : f(x) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^K w_{i}\\\\varphi(\\\\left\\\\x - c_{i}\\\\right\\\\|) where \\\\left\\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\right\\\\denotes the usual Euclidean norm and \\\\\\\\{w_{i}\\\\\\\\} is a set of mapping coefficients. The TPS corresponds to the radial basis kernel \\\\varphi(r) = r^2 \\\\log r. Spline Suppose the points are in 2 dimensions (D = 2). One can use homogeneous coordinates for the point-set where a point y_{i} is represented as a vector (1, y_{ix}, y_{iy}). The unique minimizer f is parameterized by \\\\alpha which consists of two matrices d and c (\\\\alpha = \\\\\\\\{d,c\\\\\\\\}). : f_{tps}(z, \\\\alpha) = f_{tps}(z, d, c) = z\\\\cdot d + \\\\phi(z) \\\\cdot c = z\\\\cdot d + \\\\sum_{i = 1}^K \\\\phi_i(z) c_i where d is a (D+1)\\\\times(D+1) matrix representing the affine transformation (hence z is a 1\\\\times (D+1) vector) and c is a K\\\\times (D+1) warping coefficient matrix representing the non-affine deformation. The kernel function \\\\phi(z) is a 1\\\\times K vector for each point z, where each entry \\\\phi_i(z) = \\\\|z - x_i\\\\|^2 \\\\log \\\\|z - x_i\\\\|. Note that for TPS, the control points \\\\\\\\{c_i\\\\\\\\} are chosen to be the same as the set of points to be warped \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\}, so we already use \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\} in the place of the control points. If one substitutes the solution for f, E_{tps} becomes: : E_{tps}(d,c) = \\\\|Y - Xd - \\\\Phi c\\\\|^2 + \\\\lambda c^T\\\\Phi c where Y and X are just concatenated versions of the point coordinates y_i and x_i, and \\\\Phi is a (K\\\\times K) matrix formed from the \\\\phi (\\\\|x_i - x_j\\\\|). Each row of each newly formed matrix comes from one of the original vectors. The matrix \\\\Phi represents the TPS kernel. Loosely speaking, the TPS kernel contains the information about the point-set's internal structural relationships. When it is combined with the warping coefficients c, a non-rigid warping is generated. A nice property of the TPS is that it can always be decomposed into a global affine and a local non-affine component. Consequently, the TPS smoothness term is solely dependent on the non-affine components. This is a desirable property, especially when compared to other splines, since the global pose parameters included in the affine transformation are not penalized. Applications TPS has been widely used as the non-rigid transformation model in image alignment and shape matching. An additional application is the analysis and comparisons of archaeological findings in 3D and was implemented for triangular meshes in the GigaMesh Software Framework. The thin plate spline has a number of properties which have contributed to its popularity: #It produces smooth surfaces, which are infinitely differentiable. #There are no free parameters that need manual tuning. #It has closed-form solutions for both warping and parameter estimation. #There is a physical explanation for its energy function. However, note that splines already in one dimension can cause severe \\"overshoots\\". In 2D such effects can be much more critical, because TPS are not objective.

Gurney.Banham (1998, 460). It was originally produced in the United States in regional theatre. During the course of the play, a quartet of characters deal with housewife Peggy's obsession with a blank wall in her house, slowly being drawn into a series of theatre clich√©s as the furniture and action on the stage become more and more directed to the supposed fourth wall. Synopsis Peggy has redecorated the living room and her husband, Roger, can't stand it. Peggy's usual exquisite taste was overcome by a mysterious lapse which caused her to redo the room as if it were a stage set. Everything faces one wall, the \\"fourth wall,\\" which she's left bare and which is really the audience. Unable to cope any further, and needing someone to talk to, Roger asks their old, dear friend, Julia, to fly up from New York. Julia agrees that something strange is going on, especially since everyone who enters the room begins to behave as if they were acting in a play, or even a musical when occasionally someone feels the urge to sing a Cole Porter song. Julia, affected by the room, suggests Roger call \\"976-NUTS\\" and have Peggy put away, which would allow the two of them to have the affair they've never before thought about. Roger can't do that and explains that he's got one hope left: Floyd, a local theatre professor. Roger asks Floyd to come over in hopes that he can \\"Doctor\\" Peggy's play and bring it to a close, thus allowing him and Peggy to resume their happily married life. But that doesn't work either as Floyd sees what's going on and is in complete agreement with Peggy. Peggy, following in St. Joan's footsteps at Floyd's urging, decides she must do what she must do and sets out to break the fourth wall in order to connect with her feelings. Roger rushes after her, leaving Julia and Floyd with a final Cole Porter tune. Sources * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre.

He was born in Copenhagen, but lives in Norway. He participated in both the 1960 Winter Olympics and 1964 Winter Olympics. Stille was the only Danish participant in the 1960 Olympics. His 9th place in the 1964 10,000-m was his best result; this is also the best ever result by any Dane in an individual event in the Winter Olympics history. At the end of his career, Stille held the Danish speedskating records at all distances. These were 43.3 for 500 m (Karuizawa, 1963), 2:13.9 for 1,500 m (Bislett, 1964), 4:39.0 for 3,000 m (Bislett, 1964), 7:56.1 for 5,000 m (Innsbruck, 1964), and 16:28.5 for 10,000 m (Bislett, 1964). These records lasted a record 41 years, until Oliver Sundberg skated 42.65 (500 m) and 2:06.51 (1500 m) in Groningen on 19 March 2005. Sundberg also broke Stille's other records.

It was also referred to as \\"Trider G7\\", \\"Unchallengeable Trider G7\\", \\"Tryder G7\\", \\"Bird Attack Tryder G7\\" and \\"Unrivaled Robot Trider G7\\". The story follows sixth-grader Watta Takeo's life as he balances his school life, being the president of a company, and battling a robotic empire from outer space. While a Super Robot series at heart, it depicts a real world take on the genre, such as announcing to nearby citizens that Trider G7 was being activated and as having to consider the monetary expenses of battle. Plot Invincible Robo Trider G7 portrays the attempted invasion by the Robot Empire to take over Earth. Rebelling against this, the scientist Nabalon, who was exiled from the Empire, meets the protagonist Watta's father, and together, they design the transforming robot Trider G7. However, Watta's father dies in an accident, and Watta has no choice but to succeed him at both his job and piloting Trider. As the president of the Takeo General Company, Watta must now fight to ensure everyone's happiness, as well as the condition of the company's funds. Characters Takeo General Company ; : :The second president of the company, called \\"Young President\\" by his subordinates as he is only in the sixth grade. Now that the first president, his father, has died, he is the only person that can utilize Trider G7. He is full of valor despite his age, and when his father died and the company was to be disbanded, he succeeded the presidency and became Trider's pilot. ; : :A manager 64 years of age. Whenever Watta or one of the directors fires any missiles, he immediately begins calculating how much it will cost. ; : :A director, and the only mechanic; he can do everything from repairing Trider to fixing an air conditioner. He pilots the Shuttle and provides support for Watta. He has no wife or children, but he adopts a foster son named Ryuusuke during the anime. ; : :A subsection chief, but he doesn't actually get much work due to the company's structure. He is frivolous, yet also the life of the party, and other characters find it impossible to hate him. ; : :The only woman of the company, an 18-year-old girl in charge of accounting, office work, and making tea. ; : :Watta's father, and the previous president of the company. Deceased by the time the anime begins. ; :Trider G7's designer, and a scientist who defected to Earth from the Robot Empire. Mechanics ; :The titular robot of the series, piloted by Watta Takeo. It stands at 57 meters tall and weighs 777 tons. It hosts a variety of weapons, including the Trider Saber and the Trider Beam Cannon. It is able to transform into six distinct states, each one useful for a different terrain, such as space, land, sky, and water. ; :A support shuttle for the Trider G7 that first appears in episode 27. Kakikouji, Tetsuo, Touhachirou, and Sunabara all pilot it. Its main armament is a pair of missile launchers. Production The narration in the show was performed by Ichirou Nagai, who did the narration for Mobile Suit Gundam. However, in complete contrast to the dark tone of that show's narration, this narration was performed very energetically. Up until now, the series airing on TV Asahi in this timeslot had their soundtracks composed by Takeo Watanabe and Yuushi Matsuyama, but the two were busy working on the soundtrack for the theatrical adaptation of Mobile Suit Gundam, so Kurando Kaya filled in the role. Themes Rather than depicting robots as a military weapon like Mobile Suit Gundam did, the aim of the story was to portray the real world. Trider G7's own unrealistic abilities are explained with scientists that were exiled from the enemy empire, as Trider G7's capabilities are far beyond that of the other Earth-made robots in the show. As with other super robot shows, Invincible Robo Trider G7 is generally a story of Trider G7's battle with the alien Robot Empire, but its main drama derived from the protagonist, Watta, interacting with many normal, working-class citizens and showing the human kindness that they possess. The enemy Robot Empire is never explained to be anything more than \\"strange, mysterious robots bent on taking over Earth\\". Each time the Robot Empire attacks, Trider G7 is launched in order to intercept them, and through various coincidences, the Robot Empire fails again and again while attempting to figure out what Trider G7 exactly is. In the last episode, the Robot Empire finally abandons their quest to take over Earth. This all results in a unique story structure where neither the good guys nor the bad guys have any interaction with the other side. The only real time contact between them occurs is between the protagonists and the exiled scientist Nabalon, who built Trider G7, but the only ones who actually know of Nabalon's true identity are the protagonist Watta, Watta's late father, and Clard, an engineer for the Robot Empire - none of the other major characters ever find out about this. The series ended without a single fight in the final episode, but rather Watta's elementary school graduation ceremony. There were episodes that focus not on the war, but on Watta's school life, such as him having a cavity filled during a physical examination, and him going on a field trip with his class. These scenes hold as much excitement as his battles in Trider G7. Media Invincible Robo Trider G7 aired from February 2, 1980 until January 24, 1981, spanning 50 episodes. It was also broadcast in Italy in 1981 under the name L'Indistruttibile Robot Trider G7. As with most super robot shows of the time, toys of the titular robot were produced. None of them could ever perfectly replicate its unique seven states of transformation, however. A DVD boxset of the series was released in 2005, and an Italian boxset was released in 2012 which contains both the Italian dub and the original Japanese audio. The series has been featured in various installments of the Super Robot Wars franchise of video games as well, including Shin Super Robot Wars and the Super Robot Wars Z metaseries.

History The band is originally from Fenton, Missouri. Singer Mike Leahy met bassist Chris Powers while in school at Parkway South High School. The two played a few punk bands and eventually moved towards rockabilly. They went to a jazz concert and ended up meeting Kevin O'Connor, who became the drummer. The band was officially formed in 1998. While in high school, their singles were played on KDHX. The radio show host Al Swacker spread the word about the band, which helped them get one of their first shows at the Way Out Club in St. Louis. Their first 7\\" inch sold over 1,500 copies. In 1999, their LP I Was a Teenage 7 Shot Screamer sold over 2,000 copies. Both the single and album were released by the band. The LP was eventually reissued by Hepcat Records. Dan Sabella joined the band as guitarist in 2003. In 2006, the band was named the top Garage/Rockabilly band in St. Louis by the Riverfront Times. The band's 2006 album, In Wonderland, features their first recorded song in Spanish. They have toured with The Quakes. In 2011, the band went on a brief hiatus while Leahy tried out for America's Got Talent with his Clownvis Presley act. Side projects and collaborations The 7 Shot Screamers, sans singer Leahy, serve as the back up band for Exene Cervenka, with whom they tour with as the Original Sinners. The original Original Sinners began performing in 2002 with Cervenka. Different musicians made up the band's line-up. Cervenka decided to hire a band, rather than keep a rotating list of musicians who performed when available. In 2000, Cervenka saw the 7 Shot Screamers perform in St. Louis. In early 2005, Cervenka asked the band to take over the role as the Original Sinners. They are the seventh, and longest standing, incarnation of the Original Sinners. While touring with Cervenka, the 7 Shot Screamers, with Leahy, would open the shows and then Leahy would sell merchandise while the rest of the band performed with Cervenka. Leahy has his own side project, Clownvis Presley. Leahy dresses up like Elvis Presley with a clown suit and make up. He performs vaudeville style singing, magic and dancing, often with burlesque and other variety performers. Music style and influences They are often described as glam rock meets rockabilly. The Riverfront Times describes the band as an \\"uncouth and original blend of the Clash, the Stray Cats, and the Pogues.\\" Weekly Alibi described the band as Mike Ness, minus Social Distortion, with \\"psychedelic elements\\" of the Clash. Their single \\"Hooker\\" \\"sounds almost like a demented Big Bopper cover of \\"Johnny B. Goode\\"\\". Punk's reviewers described the 7 Shot Screamers in Wonderland as the Stray Cats meets Richard Hell. Lead singer Mike Leahy cites Morrissey as an influence. His vocals with the 7 Shot Screamers have been compared to Morrissey's, \\"if Morrissey yelled more and refused to stand still on stage.\\" As a child, Leahy was inspired by Axl Rose and Michael Jackson as performers. As he grew up, he found inspiration in the performance style of Iggy Pop.

It was principally designed to store three-dimensional data from 3D scanners. The data storage format supports a relatively simple description of a single object as a list of nominally flat polygons. A variety of properties can be stored, including: color and transparency, surface normals, texture coordinates and data confidence values. The format permits one to have different properties for the front and back of a polygon. There are two versions of the file format, one in ASCII, the other in binary. The Digital Michelangelo Project at Stanford University used the PLY format for an extremely high resolution 3D scan of the Michelangelo \\"David\\" sculpture.  The file format  Files are organised as a header, that specifies the elements of a mesh and their types, followed by the list of elements itself. The elements are usually vertices and faces, but may include other entities such as edges, samples of range maps, and triangle strips. The header of both ASCII and binary files is ASCII text. Only the numerical data that follows the header is different between the two versions. The header always starts with a \\"magic number\\", a line containing ply which identifies the file as a PLY file. The second line indicates which variation of the PLY format this is. It should be one of: format ascii 1.0 format binary_little_endian 1.0 format binary_big_endian 1.0 Future versions of the standard will change the revision number at the end - but 1.0 is the only version currently in use. Comments may be placed in the header by using the word \`comment\` at the start of the line. Everything from there until the end of the line should then be ignored. e.g.: comment This is a comment! The 'element' keyword introduces a description of how some particular data element is stored and how many of them there are. Hence, in a file where there are 12 vertices, each represented as a floating point (X,Y,Z) triple, one would expect to see: element vertex 12 property float x property float y property float z Other 'property' lines might indicate that colours or other data items are stored at each vertex and indicate the data type of that information. Regarding the data type there are two variants, depending on the source of the ply file. The type can be specified with one of char uchar short ushort int uint float double, or one of int8 uint8 int16 uint16 int32 uint32 float32 float64. For an object with ten polygonal faces, one might see: element face 10 property list uchar int vertex_index The word 'list' indicates that the data is a list of values, the first of which is the number of entries in the list (represented as a 'uchar' in this case). In this example each list entry is represented as an 'int'. At the end of the header, there must always be the line: end_header  ASCII or binary format  In the ASCII version of the format, the vertices and faces are each described one to a line with the numbers separated by white space. In the binary version, the data is simply packed closely together at the 'endianness' specified in the header and with the data types given in the 'property' records. For the common \\"property list...\\" representation for polygons, the first number for that element is the number of vertices that the polygon has and the remaining numbers are the indices of those vertices in the preceding vertex list.  History  The PLY format was developed in the mid-90s by Greg Turk and others in the Stanford graphics lab under the direction of Marc Levoy. Its design was inspired by the Wavefront .obj format, but the Obj format lacked extensibility for arbitrary properties and groupings, so the \\"property\\" and \\"element\\" keywords were devised to generalize the notions of vertices, faces, associated data, and other groupings.

Instead a system of levers is used to raise one set of wheels off the ground. The load at the competitor's hands is therefore of the order of 4000 Newtons (i.e. would feel like lifting a 400 kg (881 lb) barbell). The exact load depends not only on the vehicle mass, but the distribution of that mass, which axle (front/rear) is lifted and also the geometry (i.e. lengths etc.) of the lever arrangements. This means that performances from one competition to another cannot be reliably compared. Ross's usual catchphrase during strongman competitions is \\"who's the daddy?!\\".

A home movie is a short amateur film or video typically made just to preserve a visual record of family activities, a vacation, or a special event, and intended for viewing at home by family and friends. Originally, home movies were made on photographic film in formats that usually limited the movie-maker to about three minutes per roll of costly camera film. The vast majority of amateur film formats lacked audio, shooting silent film. The 1970s saw the advent of consumer camcorders that could record an hour or two of video on one relatively inexpensive videocassette which also had audio and did not need to be developed the way film did. This was followed by digital video cameras that recorded to flash memory, and most recently smartphones with video recording capability, made the creation of home movies easier and much more affordable to the average person. The technological boundaries between home-movie-making and professional movie-making are becoming increasingly blurred as prosumer equipment often offers features previously only available on professional equipment. In recent years, clips from home movies have been available to wider audiences through television series such as America's Funniest Home Videos, in Great Britain You've Been Framed! and Internet online video-sharing sites such as YouTube. The popularity of the Internet, and wider availability of high-speed connections has provided new ways of sharing home movies, such as video weblogs (vlogs), and video podcasts. History The development of home movie-making has depended critically on the availability of equipment and media formats (film stock, video tape, etc.) at prices affordable to consumers. The introduction of film formats suitable for amateur hobbyists began early in the history of cinematography. 17.5 mm format The 17.5 mm \\"Birtac\\" format was patented by Birt Acres in 1898. This format split the standard 35 mm film into two strips half as wide and could be loaded into the camera in daylight. Since the film frames were also half the height of 35 mm frames, the Birtac format used only 25% of the amount of film stock used by 35 mm. The camera doubled as a printer and projector, so equipment costs were also reduced. 9.5 mm format In 1922, the French firm Path√© Fr√®res introduced a new film format 9.5 mm wide which put the sprocket holes between the frames instead of along the sides of the film, allowing the images to occupy nearly the entire width. The resulting frames were nearly as large and clear as with the slightly later 16 mm format, which devoted much of its width to the stabilizing perforations. Used both for making home movies and for showing shortened \\"cinema-at-home\\" versions of professionally made feature films, it enjoyed popularity for several decades in Europe, including the UK, but was virtually unknown in the US. Safety film and the 16 mm format Of importance in making motion picture film practical for home use was the manufacturing option of safety film in the 1920s. The nitrate film used by professionals required caution in handling and projection because it is highly flammable. Nitrate film badly stored has been known to spontaneously combust. The 16 mm format, which used only safety film, was introduced by Eastman Kodak in 1923 and became a standard in the non-professional market. Although 16 mm had the advantage that users were not tied to one equipment manufacturer, and there were obvious cost advantages compared to standard 35 mm, the advent of an even smaller and cheaper format ultimately relegated 16 mm to professional users, particularly in the educational market. 8 mm film format and color Bell & Howell Zoomatic camera used by Abraham Zapruder that recorded the assassination of John F. Kennedy.In 1932, Kodak introduced another new format, 8 mm, now called \\"Standard 8\\" or \\"Regular 8\\", which put four frames into the area occupied by one standard 16 mm frame. The film usually came in 16 mm wide \\"Double 8\\" form, which ran through the camera in two passes (one in each direction) and was slit in half after processing. The \\"Straight 8\\" variant came already cut to 8 mm width. In either case, the amount of film stock used per frame was again reduced by 75%. This finally brought home movies within the reach of the average family. The smaller format also made possible smaller and more portable cameras and projectors. The introduction of Kodachrome color reversal film for 16 mm in 1935, and for 8 mm in 1936, facilitated home color cinematography. The availability of reversal film, both black-and-white and Kodachrome, was very important to the economics of home movie-making because it avoided the expense of separate negatives and positive prints. Super 8 and Single-8 film formats The original 8 mm format was largely superseded within a few years of Kodak's 1965 introduction of Super 8 film. The Super 8 format used the same film width as standard 8 mm, but the perforations were smaller, making room for larger frames that yielded a clearer image. In addition, Super 8 film came in cartridges for easier loading into the camera. High-end Super 8 also could be purchased with a magnetic audio track, allowing for synchronized sound home movies. Single-8, a competing product from Fujifilm, was also introduced in 1965. It used the same new format as Super 8 but on a thinner polyester base and in a different type of camera cartridge. Home video-making The introduction of the Beta VCR in 1975 and VHS in 1976 heralded a revolution in the making of home movies. Videocassettes were extremely inexpensive compared to film and they could even be erased. This had the effect of greatly increasing the hours of footage of most family video libraries. It took a few years before consumer video cameras and portable VCRs were introduced, and later combined to create camcorders, but by that time, many consumers already had the playback equipment in their homes. Omnipresence and controversy Portability and small size of digital home movie equipment, such as camera phones and PDAs with video capabilities, has led to the banning of such devices from various places, due to privacy and security concerns. Pornographic movies of celebrities have been rumoured to exist for many years, but the ease of creating home movies on video has resulted in several celebrity sex tapes becoming available to the public, often without the permission of participants. The honeymoon video of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee from 1998 was the first highly publicized example. Portability of digital equipment helps fuel other controversies as well, such as the incident on November 17, 2006 in which comedian Michael Richards got into a racist war of words with an audience member during his comedy club act. Large parts of the incident were captured on the camera phone of another audience member and broadcast widely. Home movies have played important roles in controversial criminal investigations. The prime example is the Zapruder film of the 1963 assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, accidentally captured on Kodachrome film with an 8 mm home movie camera. The film became crucial evidence for the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination. At first, only black-and-white enlargements of individual film frames were published, and the most gruesome frame was withheld. The public did not actually see the images in motion for many years. The first showing on network television occurred in 1975.

He was born in Reading, Berkshire, England to an Anglican family and raised in the Church of England. According to Moravian Bishop E. R. Hasse, Cennick's family was from Bohemia, and left as a result of persecutions following the Battle of White Mountain. In England, his family became Quakers when his grandfather became influenced by George Fox. Early life At age nine, he heard his dying aunt proclaim \\"Last night the Lord stood by me and invited me to drink of the fountain of life freely and I shall stand before the Lord as bold as a lion.\\" The words stayed with him for many years as the focus of his own fear of death and concern for his salvation. Being from a family of humble means, John was compelled, at the age of 13, to leave school and seek an apprenticeship. He made eight trips to London looking for a position and, failing, became somewhat of a dissolute youth, spending what little money he had on plays and gambling, and engaged in lying and petty theft. Of this period in his life, he later said \\"I had forgot Jesus and everlasting ages, loving ungodliness more than goodness and to talk of lies more than righteousness.\\" Conversion > As a youth he delighted in attending dances, playing cards, and going to the > theatre. But in 1735, while walking hastily along Cheapside, London, he > experienced deep convictions of sin. These convictions were strengthened by > his association with pious companions. He was greatly depressed in > mind...[b]ut he did not yet possess true Christian peace. On the contrary, > he went, step by step, down into the dark depths of spiritual > despair.Miller, Josiah, John Cennick (1717-1755) in Singers and Songs of the > Church: Being Biographical Sketches of the Hymn-writers in all the Principal > Collections, with Notes on their Psalms and Hymns, 2nd ed. London: Longmans, > Green, 1869, p.216 At the age of 17, he was suddenly oppressed by a heavy spirit, which he endured for two years, until relief came when he happened into a church. There he heard the words of Psalm : \\"(19)Great are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all! (22b)And he that putteth his trust in God shall not be desolate.\\" He later said that he heard the voice of Christ speaking to him. > My heart danced for joy and my dying soul revived. I heard the voice of > Jesus saying, \\"I am thy salvation\\". I no more groaned under the weight of > sin. The fears of hell were taken away ‚Ä¶ Christ loved me and died for me, I > rejoiced in God my Saviour. His religious conversion was experienced in 1737. Cennick worked for a time as surveyor in Reading. He began reading the writings of George Whitfield, and through a friend at Oxford he met Whitefield, John Wesley, and Charles Wesley. Moravian Church, Gracehill, September 2009 Ministry Cennick joined the nascent Methodist movement. In 1740, he became a teacher at Kingswood, England, on Wesley's recommendation. > On Kingswood Hill, amid the remains of the old Royal Chase, a crowd of > colliers had assembled for a service, but the expected preacher failed to > appear. Cennick was there, and as with one instinct the eyes of all turned > to him, and many voices urged him to step nto the breach. He hesitated; he > reasoned with himself -- he was not prepared! he had never yet preached! nor > was he licensed to do so! But there before him were the people waiting for > the Word; and upon him was the sense of \\"the burden of the Lord.\\" And so, > finally, after earnest prayer, he obeyed the inner voice...and it led him > along the God-appointed path of Evangelism, where his career was so short, > so bright, and so full of blessing.Hasse, Rt. Rev. E. R., Chapter VI: John > Cennick in: The Moravians. London: National Council of Evangelical Free > Churches, 1913. Like Whitfield he differed from Wesley on particular redemption and unconditional election and was obliged to leave. He eventually allied with the Calvinistic Methodists. After Whitefield returned from America, he asked Cennick to join him on preaching tours. In 1745 Cennick went over to the Moravians, and went to Germany to study their doctrines. Baptists visiting London heard him preach and invited him to Dublin in 1747. Around this time he was in the process of joining the Moravians. After differences with his Dublin hosts, he concentrated his attentions on Ulster, where he founded some 220Hutton, J.E., A History of the Moravian Church, 1909 Moravian societies between 1747 and 1752 and helped to establish Evangelicalism in Ireland. A plaque on the wall of the Moravian church in Gracehill, County Antrim, commemorates the arrival in Ballymena on 9 August 1746, of John Cennick, the first Moravian evangelist in mid Antrim. Some of Cennick's first hymns were included with his sermons. His first hymns appeared during his time at Kingswood. In Charles Wesley's diary (July 1739) he wrote, \\"I corrected Mr. Cennick's hymns for the press.\\" Throughout the rest of his short career and life he published several collections of hymns. His son-in-law John Swertner included several of Cennick's hymns in a Moravian collection in 1789. Although he wrote many hymns, Cennick is remembered for: *Be Present at Our Table, Lord *Be with Me, Lord, Where'er I Go *Children of the Heav'nly King *Christ is Our Master, Lord, and God *Hail, Alpha and Omega, Hail *Rise, My Soul, Adore Your Maker *verses of Christians, Dismiss Your Fear *verses of Lo! He comes with clouds descending He spent much time as an itinerant evangelist in England and Ireland, enduring great and often violent opposition. By the time of his early death, he had established over 40 churches. John Cennick died of a fever in London at only 36 years of age, leaving a wife and two children, and is buried at the Moravian cemetery (Sharon‚Äôs Garden) in Chelsea, England. John Julian wrote of Cennick: \\"Some of the stanzas of his hymns are very fine, but the hymns taken as a whole are most unequal. Some excellent centos might be compiled from his various works.\\" Some of Cennick's hymns not published in his lifetime were included in the Moravian Hymn Book (1789), edited by his son-in- law, Johannes Swertner. A number of his hymns are preserved in the Sacred Harp.

Accessed August 30, 2013 He was educated at the Montessori Lyceum Rotterdam (gymnasium beta) and then studied mathematics at Utrecht University, starting in 1969. After an MSc he wrote a PhD thesis, defended in 1976, on recursion theory in higher types, under the supervision of Dirk van Dalen. Bergstra held posts at the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Leiden (1976‚Äì82), and the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam. In 1985 he was appointed Professor of Programming and Software Engineering at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam and, at the same time, Professor of Applied Logic at Utrecht University; such split positions are not uncommon in the Netherlands. These two chairs he continues to hold. He has been an Advisor of the CWI (1985‚Äì2004). In 1989 he worked for a year at Philips Research in Eindhoven as a project leader and, subsequently, continued as a consultant there until 2002. While at Philips he was involved in industrial projects on consumer electronics and medical equipment. He founded CONCUR, the international conference series in Concurrency Theory, by organising the first two conferences in Amsterdam in 1990 and 1991. He is a member of several editorial boards, and is the managing editor of Science of Computer Programming and the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming. In 2004 Jan Bergstra contacted Mark Burgess of the Oslo University College, looking for scientific backing for a proposed one year masters course at the University in system administration. In spite of very different backgrounds, they shared a likeness of mind in their attitudes to science and research. This resulted in them becoming friends and going on to discuss and hone several parts of Promise theory together on mutual visits between Norway and the Netherlands. http://markburgess.org/bio.html He is honorary Professor of Computer Science at Swansea University and a member of Academia Europaea since 2006.  Work   On formal methods  Bergstra's research on computation has focussed on fundamental concepts, mathematical theories and practical tools. His main theoretical research programmes are: * a systematic study of specification methods for abstract data types starting in 1979, with John V. Tucker; * the invention, development and application of process algebras, especially ACP starting in 1984, with Jan Willem Klop, Jos Baeten and others; * Module Algebra starting in 1986, together with Paul Klint and Jan Heering; * Program Algebra starting in 1998, with Marijke Loots. Based in this theoretical research, he has designed various formal methods and tools. In cooperation with Paul Klint and Jan Heering he designed the specification language ASF (in 1984) and the related ToolBus coordination language and system (in 1995). Some of his work has been undertaken in the setting of the ESPRIT programme. For example, the software projects FAST and METEOR funded the beginnings of the development of the process algebra ACP, and the telecommunications project SPECS led to the development of the specification language muCRL. All systems are still in daily use for research purposes, while ASF has been extensively used in the Dutch banking industry.  In academia  Through his research and organisational activities, Bergstra has had considerable influence on computer science in the Netherlands. For example, he has supervised the work of over 40 PhD students, many of whom have become academic computer scientists, 12 at professorial level. He set up the new computer science curriculum at Leiden in 1976, and for cognitive artificial intelligence at Utrecht University in 1989. In 2000 he became the Director of the Teaching Institute of Information Sciences at the University of Amsterdam. In this role he has been responsible for the redesign of all courses when the bachelor- master system of degrees was introduced into the Netherlands. Bergstra became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011.  Publications  Publications, a selection: * J. A. Bergstra, A. Ponse and S. A.

It was designed in the 1930s by Attilio Franco and Dr Piero Crosti. The main difference between it and conventional feedwater heaters widely used on the continent is that the Franco-Crosti boiler uses both exhaust steam and exhaust gases from the firebox. Conventional feedwater heaters only use exhaust steam.  Purpose  The Franco‚ÄìCrosti boiler is a modification of the conventional fire tube boiler design used on most steam locomotives. Unlike conventional boilers the heat remaining in the exhaust gases is used to preheat the water supply for the main boiler using a secondary heat exchange mechanism. This mechanism, known as the feedwater heater is essentially a secondary boiler. The preheated feedwater is fed at full boiler pressure into the main boiler via clack valves. The feedwater heater is not designed to produce steam, instead raising the temperature of the feedwater. This allows the heater to utilize the remaining energy in the exhaust gases effectively.  Design  The typical configuration of a Franco‚ÄìCrosti boiler had a relatively conventional main boiler with one or two secondary feedwater heaters running parallel to the boiler barrel. Where the loading gauge did not allow the feedwater heater to be placed beside the boiler it was mounted beneath. When the locomotive is started, cold water is fed directly into the main boiler which operates normally with the exhaust gases flowing out of the main chimney via the smokebox. Once the boiler is producing steam, the exit from the smokebox into the main chimney is closed and the exhaust gases instead flow through the feedwater heater and exit via the secondary chimney located towards the rear of the locomotive. Water fed into the boiler is now pre-heated in the feedwater heater and enters the boiler at higher than normal temperature.  History   Belgium  The first Franco-Crosti boilered locomotive was built for the Belgian State Railways as No. 2096 in 1932. This massive 0‚Äì6‚Äì2 + 2‚Äì4‚Äì2‚Äì4‚Äì2 + 2‚Äì6‚Äì0 locomotive weighed 248 tons and developed around 3,000 horsepower. It was essentially two Franco-Crosti boilered locomotives joined back-to-back and was one of the most powerful articulated locomotives ever built. During the German occupation of Belgium in the Second World War the locomotive was separated into two 0‚Äì6‚Äì2+2‚Äì6‚Äì2T locomotives. These locomotives were captured by invading Russian troops in 1945 and at least one of them was still in service in Poland in 1955.  Italy  An FS (Italian Railways) class 743 at work at Cremona station, August 1973 The FS steam locomotive 741.120 in Florence Central Station The first Italian Franco‚ÄìCrosti boilered locomotive was a modified Class 671 locomotive built for the Ferrovie dello Stato in 1939. This became the only member of the cab forward Class 672. Following the experimental conversion of 672.001 a new class of Franco‚ÄìCrosti boilered locomotives were built in 1940 and 1941. These were the Class 683, of which five were built as rebuilds of Class 685 locomotives. These were the first Franco‚ÄìCrosti locomotives to also use Caprotti valve gear. These locomotives survived the war and continued in use until the last was withdrawn in 1962. In 1940 the first of the Class 743 class were built. These were entirely new locomotives with two feedwater heaters, one on each side of the boiler. In all 94 of this class were built for FS. In 1952 and 1953, 35 of the Class 625 locomotives were converted to use Franco‚ÄìCrosti boilers with side feedwater heaters. These locomotives became the Class 623. Several survived into the 1970s. Finally in 1954 the last Italian Franco‚ÄìCrosti locomotives were built, the Class 741. Unlike the other Italian classes, these had a single feedwater heater mounted directly below the main boiler. In total 81 of these locomotives were built, again surviving into the 1970s. Currently only a member of Class 741 is still operating: the 741.120. This locomotive is used only for heading historic trains. This Franco‚ÄìCrosti steam locomotive is property of Trenitalia (the Italian national railways company) and assigned to D.R.S. Pistoia (Deposito Rotabili Storici di Pistoia, which means Historic Rolling Stock depot in Pistoia) near Florence ‚Äì Italy and managed by the non-profit association \\"Italvapore\\" Associazione Toscana Treni Storici  West Germany  In 1951 the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) rebuilt two Franco‚ÄìCrosti boilered locomotives with two feedwater heaters located below the main boiler. These were variants of the standard DB class 52 design but were registered as class 42.90 due to the higher axle load. These locomotives were followed in 1954‚Äì58 by the conversion of 31 class 50 locomotives in a 2‚Äì10‚Äì0 tender configuration with single feedwater heater located under the boiler. These thirty locos formed the new class 50.40 and proved quite successful economically but had problems with corrosion. All locomotives were withdrawn by 1967.  Great Britain  9F 92022 in 1964 Ten of the BR Standard Class 9F locomotives, Nos 92020-9, were built with Franco‚ÄìCrosti boilers in 1955. Like the German 50.40 these were 2‚Äì10‚Äì0 tender locomotives with a single feedwater heater under the main boiler. The standard chimney was retained, but was only used for lighting-up and was blanked when running. The final chimney was located on the right-hand (fireman's) side, just forward of the firebox. The Crosti preheaters provided less improvement than had been expected, and were a problem for maintenance, owing to acidic fluegases condensing in the feedwater heater and causing corrosion. All were converted back to a more standard form within a few years, the preheaters remaining in place, but blanked off.  Ireland  In 1951 Oliver Bulleid was the chief mechanical engineer of the C√≥ras Iompair √âireann and was experimenting with new forms of steam locomotive. He converted a 1907 Coey locomotive to use a Franco‚ÄìCrosti boiler similar to the original Italian designs and to burn peat. The locomotive was a poor steamer and eventually was fitted with a forced-draught fan powered by a diesel engine carried on a wagon behind the tender.

He returned to Kenya and was appointed a legal clerk in the colonial government in 1955, having completed a Law degree at Lincoln's Inn in the United Kingdom. This was at the height of the state of Emergency, which had been declared in order to defeat the attempts of Mau Mau freedom fighters to gain independence. After returning to Kenya Njonjo served in the Colonial government where he built a reputation as a diligent lawyer, and therefore was considered to become Attorney General in the Independent Kenya under President Jomo Kenyatta. In 1976, during a period of tense relations between Kenya and Uganda, Njonjo took part in secret negotiations with Israel that proved instrumental in the success of the Israeli military‚Äôs Operation Entebbe. The government of Kenya allowed the Israeli armed forces to use Nairobi airport as a stopover base in the context of the military assault on Entebbe airport that ended a week-long hostage crisis involving Israeli air passengers taken prisoner by a PLFP commando. President Jomo Kenyatta died in 1978, to be succeeded by Moi as Njonjo had anticipated. Charles Njonjo entered into parliament in April 1980 after retiring as attorney general at the age of 60, a post in which he had served for 17 years. He had considered politics for over a decade but hesitated due to lack of a popular base. He was elected MP for Kikuyu unchallenged, after the incumbent MP had resigned his seat the day before Njonjo announced his candidacy. In June 1980 he was selected for a newly created cabinet position by Daniel arap Moi, as minister for home and constitutional affairs, during an expected cabinet reshuffle.

Over a 17-year span, from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, George Heery oversaw an expansion the firm's vision and capabilities. Milestones of that expansion include: * 1965: The firm, in association with the architectural firm of Finch, Alexander, Barnes, Rothschild, and Pascal (FABRAP), designed and managed the construction of the Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium in less than one year. Later the association became known as Heery-FABRAP, which carried out the design and construction management for over 100 major stadiums and arenas, as well as the Central Station for Atlanta's MARTA system. * 1966: The purchase of an interior design firm that became Heery Interiors. * 1967: The formation of Heery Program Management providing construction program management services. * 1969: Heery Graphics is formed. * 1970: The acquisition of the mechanical engineering firm of J. W. Austin, which when added to the firm's existing in- house electrical and structural engineering departments, became Heery Engineering. * 1975: Time, Cost, and Architecture, written by many members of Heery staff, is published and cited by Engineering News Record Magazine as \\"The first definitive work on construction management\\". * 1976: Heery opens offices in London and Frankfurt in addition to offices already existing in Baltimore, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York and Amman, Jordan. * 1978: Heery Energy Consultants is formed. * 1982: Heery Land Planning is formed to provide civil engineering and landscape architecture * 1986: George Heery and the other shareholders at Heery International sold the company to British Insulated Callender's Cables (BICC), a publicly traded British Company, later known as Balfour Beatty. Heery was required by the sale to continue as CEO until March 1989. In October 2017, commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE: CBG) announced a definitive agreement to acquire Heery International, Inc. from Balfour Beatty LLC.  Buildings  * Allen E.

With a height of 2,480 feet (756 m) Hart Side rises above the col separating it from Green Side by 75 feet (23 m). Some guide-book writers have treated Hart Side as a distinct fell, and have devoted a separate chapter to it. The same writers have treated the lower Watermillock Common as part of (or associated with) the fell. Other writers have simply focussed on routes to and between the many individual tops here and throughout Lakeland. Hart Side and Green Side are the two ends of a ridge which is composed of andesite rock, a sequence of lava flows from ancient volcanoes. A lead vein in the Green Side end of the ridge was exploited by the most successful lead mine in the Lake District until it closed in 1962. Topography The east ridge of Stybarrow Dodd falls about to a broad col from which the ground rises again. From this point the combined Hart Side and Green Side ridge has a smooth, rounded, grassy top and winds for some to the north-east. After rising to White Stones, the summit of Green Side (), it loses of height before rising again from a broad, gentle col, but regains only to the summit of Hart Side (). At this point the ridge turns abruptly to the south of east and after losing roughly again it rises to a broad, rounded, unnamed grassy swelling with a height of about . A north-east shoulder of this swelling ends with steeper gradients on all sides and a scattering of broken crags ahead. This shoulder was named Birkett Fell in 1963, but it has just prominence above the ridge it terminates. This ridge of Stybarrow Dodd continues to the east as Watermillock Common after a further drop of over .Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 Explorer map To the north and west of the Hart Side and Green Side ridge, and to the east of Birkett Fell, grassy slopes drop into Deepdale, with an outcrop of rock just beneath the Hart Side summit, called Hart Crag, and the broken crags beneath Birkett Fell. This Deepdale should not be confused with the valley of the same name near Patterdale. These sides of the ridge are drained by Aira Beck into Ullswater. Much steeper crags line the south of Hart Side and the east of Green Side. This is Glencoyne Head, where a corrie glacier formed during the final phase of the last ice age and created these steep cliffs. These slopes drain into Glencoyne and then to Ullswater. To complete the picture, the south side of Green Side also falls steeply and over rocky crags in places into the valley of Stick's Gill (East), which also drains into Ullswater via the Glenridding Beck. Summit The summit of Hart Side is mainly grassy but with a scattering of rocky boulders showing through the grass. Some small cairns have been built on it, and there is another cairn some north of the summit, but the most unusual features are a long east‚Äìwest trench which has been dug a few yards to the south, and a shallow hollow measuring just to the north. The trench was probably dug by prospectors looking for an extension to the vein being mined beneath Green Side, and the hollow may have been the site of some shelter. A vigorous programme of exploration, both underground and on the surface, was begun in 1947 when it was clear that the Greenside Mine could not last much longer, but nothing was found. In Alfred Wainwright's 1955 drawing the trench looks much cleaner and fresher than it is today The view from the summit is restricted both by the higher ridge to the west, and by intervening land to the east which conceals most of Ullswater. There are distant glimpses of Catstye Cam and Helvellyn, a closer view of Great Dodd and Stybarrow Dodd across Deepdale, and even a glimpse of Scafell Pike through the gap between Green Side and Stybarrow Dodd. A much better viewpoint for Ullswater and the east is found at Birkett Fell, where there is a cairn built from stones carried up from the shores of Ullswater by members of the Outward Bound School in Watermillock. The cairn carries a stone plaque with the name of the fell, which was named in honour of Lord Birkett of Ulverston and in recognition of the part played by him in preventing Ullswater from being made into a reservoir. Ascents The whole of the Hart Side and Green Side ridge, of Watermillock Common, and much of Glencoyne is now Open Access land. Several routes lead to the top of Hart Side from the north-east. From the car park at High Row an ascent can be made via Dowthwaitehead and Birkett Fell. From Dockray, or the two car parks on the A5091 road (which serve Aira Force), ascents can be made via Watermillock Common (or the slopes to the south of it) and Birkett Fell. From the south an ascent is possible via the south-east shoulder of Green Side, above the old Greenside lead mine, or a steep, pathless ascent can be made from the old Miners‚Äô Balcony Path around the head of Glencoyne beside Deepdale Slack and between the crags. Hart Side may also be visited as part of a circuit of Deepdale which takes in the three Dodds. Geology A piece of baryte, from the spoil heap outside the Glencoyne entrance to the Greenside Mine The rocks of Hart Side and Green Side are all part of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, formed on the margin of an ancient continent during a period of intense volcanic activity, roughly 450 million years ago in the Ordovician Period. Virtually all the rocks on the fell belong to the Birker Fell Andesite Formation. \\\\- may be viewed on the or on the BGS's iGeology smartphone app This was formed predominantly by eruptions of mobile andesitic lava from shallow-sided volcanoes. These rocks are part of a thick succession of lava sheets found around the western and northern sides of the Lake District. Some microgranite dykes were later intruded into the andesite which now forms the crags of Glencoyne Head. These are of early Devonian age and were probably associated with the later stages of the emplacement of the granite batholith which underlies the Lake District. Also associated with the granite batholith was the creation of mineral veins in parts of the Lake District. The richest known lead vein of all was found crossing the south-east shoulder of Green Side. This, the Greenside Lead Vein runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction and dips steeply to the east at 70¬∞. It was up to 59 feet (18 m) wide in the highest workings of the Greenside Mine, but averaged about 8 feet (2.5 m) wide in deeper workings. The vein contained galena in a mixture of quartz and smashed rock. Galena (lead sulphide) is an ore of lead. The ore from Greenside also yielded 10 oz of silver per ton of lead. Higher levels of the vein also contained quantities of baryte (barium sulphate), although at the time this had no commercial value. Very small amounts of blende (zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) were found in the deeper levels, but never in recoverable quantities. The Greenside Mine worked this vein from some time in the 1700s until reserves were exhausted in 1962. The main entrance was in Glenridding at Lucy's Tongue, but an exploratory level was driven into the cliffs at the top of Glencoyne, from just below the Miners' Balcony Path. In 1955 this was incorporated into an emergency back exit from the mine. Alfred Wainwright found the hole, but thought it was just a cave. Underlying the andesite lavas of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group are the mudstones of the Skiddaw Group of rocks. These were encountered in the lowest workings of the Greenside Mine, some 3,000 feet (914 m) beneath the surface of the fell. The lead vein the miners were following became barren on encountering these rocks. Watermillock Common Watermillock Common (The unenclosed common grazing land of Watermillock parish) is a ridge of high land which rises above Ullswater. It is the end part of one of the long eastern ridges of Stybarrow Dodd, and lies lower than the Hart Side part of the ridge. Topography: This part of the ridge runs roughly north-east for about from the Brown Hills at the foot of Hart Side. The ridge is drained on its northern and eastern sides by Aira Beck, while its south-eastern slopes drain directly into Ullswater. Aira Beck has cut a steep gorge between Watermillock Common and Gowbarrow Fell, which continues the line of high ground further east. Summits and views: The highest point on Watermillock Common is Swineside Knott , a rounded grassy mound but with some rocks protruding, especially on its steep eastern side. Swineside Knott has what has been claimed to be \\"the most sumptuous view\\" of Ullswater; certainly it is the most extensive view, from the head of the lake (and the fells on either side of Patterdale beyond that) to the foot of the lake at Pooley Bridge. Common Fell at is only lower than Swineside Knott, but is more centrally placed on the ridge and so feels more like its natural summit. It consists of a number of rounded grassy mounds. A small cairn has been built on the highest one, but a remarkable glacial erratic boulder is perched on one of the other mounds. Common Fell gives good views to the north and east. Two lower tops at the east end of the ridge are Round How () and Bracken How (), both rounded grassy mounds punctuated with some rock and with small cairns on top. Ascents: Apart from the lower slopes beside Aira Beck, around Dockray and alongside Ullswater, Watermillock Common is Open Access land. Paths across the common begin from the village of Dockray and from the two car parks on the A5091 road. One writer has claimed the ridge top near Common Fell \\"can be more of a wade than a walk\\", but this was not found to be so early in 2014 after an unusually wet winter. Geology: The oldest rocks found on the Watermillock Common ridge occur on the lower south eastern slopes (above Ullswater) where faulting has brought to the present surface an inlier of mudstone from the Tarn Moor Formation, the latest part of the Skiddaw Group. These mudstones were deposited in deep seas about 470 million years ago during the Ordovician period. The remainder of the ridge consists of andesite rocks of the Birker Fell Andesite Formation. These rocks are a succession of sheets of andesite lava flows which came from shallow-sided volcanoes. Here and there the map shows beds of volcaniclastic sandstone or breccia, sedimentary deposits formed from the erosion of the volcanic rocks. Around the summit of Common Fell it shows areas of hyaloclastite, a rock made up of shattered angular fragments and formed by the quenching of lava in water. However, smooth grassy turf covers these rocks from view. Names Hart Side takes its name from the fell side, the two English words signifying the hill side frequented by harts. A hart is a fully mature male red deer, at least five years old. The name of the fell is first recorded by the Ordnance Survey in 1867. Panoramas in earlier 19th century guidebooks label the fell as Glen Coin Fell, which may have been an alternative or an earlier name. Green Side also takes its name from the fell side, the two English words being self-explanatory. Watermillock Common was the unenclosed grazing land of the parish of Watermillock, which was incorporated into Matterdale parish in 1934. It lay outside the enclosed Gowbarrow deer park, the wall of which may be seen crossing the hill on its south side. Birkett Fell, previously marked on Ordnance Survey maps of 1867 and 1920 as Nameless Fell was named in 1963 to commemorate Lord Birkett of Ulverston. In 1962, two days before his death, Lord Birkett made his last speech in the House of Lords in which, with the eloquence for which he was famed, he opposed a provision in the Manchester Corporation Bill which would have allowed Ullswater to be made into a reservoir for that city. As a result, that provision was voted out of the bill, to the great delight of many who loved the Lake District.Wikipedia article: Norman Birkett Image gallery Image:Hart Side and Green Side ridge panorama.jpg|The whole Green Side and Hart Side ridge, with Watermillock Common to the left, seen from Great Dodd Image:On Hart Side - geograph.org.uk - 1775515.jpg|Looking along the ridge from Green Side towards Hart Side Image:Hart Side - summit.JPG|The summit of Hart Side Image:Hart Side summit - trench and ridge.JPG|The prospecting trench on the summit of Hart Side, partly filled with snow, with Green Side and Stybarrow Dodd in the distance Image:Hart Side summit.ogv|Video from the summit Image:Cairn on Birkett Fell.JPG|The cairn on Birkett Fell with Stybarrow Dodd beyond Image:Watermillock Common from Heron Pike.JPG|Watermillock Common seen from Heron Pike Image:Common Fell from N.JPG|Watermillock Common seen from the north, across the valley of Aira Beck Image:Common Fell from Bracken How.JPG|Common Fell on Watermillock Common, seen from Bracken How Image:Erratic on Common Fell.JPG|Glacial erratic boulder on Common Fell Image:Mine opening in Glencoyne.JPG|Emergency exit from the Greenside Mine in Glencoyne References Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Hart Side"},{"id":"8136963","text":"Bohala hedging welcome sign Bohola () is a village, in the barony of Gallen, County Mayo, Ireland located along the N5 national primary road, which gives its name to the parish of Bohola.

It is the official band of Kansas State University.About KSU Band In 2015, the Pride of Wildcat Land was awarded the Sudler Trophy, which honors the nation's top collegiate marching bands. History In 1887 Professor Alexander Brown organized fifteen student- musicians into the first band at the Kansas State Agricultural College. The first involvement with athletics came when the band accompanied the baseball team to a game in 1899. Since then, the Kansas State Marching Band, also known as the \\"Pride of Wildcat Land\\", has grown to more than 410 members. The University band represents the school, the city and community of Manhattan, and the state of Kansas each year at home and across the country at home games, NFL exhibition, bowl games, parades and festivals, and alumni, charity, and community events.KSU Band History The \\"Pride\\" has been invited to many out-of-town venues, appearing before huge audiences, both live and on television. Occasionally the band travels to perform at a Kansas City Chiefs' home game. They have also performed on three occasions at Texas Stadium for Dallas Cowboys home games and twice at Denver Broncos home games. The K-State band performed at the 1974 NFL ProBowl and in the 1977 Texas State Fair. In May 1980, the K-State band performed at Wembley Stadium and Hyde Park in London, England. In more recent years, the \\"Pride of Wildcat Land\\" has accompanied the K-State football team to multiple bowl appearances, including: * Independence Bowl * Copper Bowl * Holiday Bowl (three times) * Cotton Bowl Classic (three times) * Fiesta Bowl (three times) * Alamo Bowl * Insight.com Bowl * Texas Bowl (two times) * Pinstripe Bowl * Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl * Liberty Bowl * Cactus Bowl A memorable performance venue every year for many decades is known as K-State Band Day. Now attracting approximately 2000 high school and middle school students converging each year on Manhattan, the day- long event includes a morning parade through the center of town, and a massed band performance at half time of that afternoon's home football game at Bill Snyder Family Stadium. On September 15, 1984 the K-State Band Day was recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records. In conjunction with that year's Band Day, sixty-seven school bands joined the K-State Band on the field, creating a 3,144 piece marching band, which put them in the book as the world's largest marching band. In 2017, Director Frank Tracz initiated a new attraction for high school students called the All Star Band. This band consists of high school students from area high schools who are recognized as the best from their school. The high school band puts a show together to perform at halftime. After their show they are joined by the members of the Pride of Wildcatland and perform a show with all members on the field, and then playing traditions songs such as the Fight Song and Wabash Cannonball with the All Star Band members. In 2017 this day was combined with alumni band day, and band alumni of all ages joined the high school and college marching members, totaling almost 600 people on the field. These alumni band members joined the K-State and All Star bands for the playing of the Fight Song and Wabash Cannonball. Membership Membership in the \\"Pride of Wildcat Land\\" is open to all Kansas State students, regardless of major. Some members receive scholarship aid for their participation in the band. Membership to the marching band is earned every year on an audition basis the week prior to the start of classes. Auditions occur in two parts, musicianship and marching. Members are expected to not only have pristine marching technique but also have their entire pregame memorized prior to their audition. Band members come from schools throughout the state and across the nation, and their educational goals are as diverse as their backgrounds. Students representing every college on campus, and nearly every curriculum, work many hours a week in rehearsal during the marching season.KSU Band Membership The marching band does not only consist of the musicians holding the instruments. Also part of the band are the Wildcat Twirlers, Color Guard, and Classy Cats dance team. These positions are audition only on a yearly basis. The members of these three groups practice with the marching band and are just as much part of the band as the musicians. Songs of Kansas State University Fight song The 2006 KSU Marching Band marching in block band to \\"Wildcat Victory\\"Wildcat Victory is the official fight song of Kansas State University. It was originally written, verse and chorus, by music department student Harry Erickson in 1927, but over time became known to K-State fans with the chorus section on its own. The band presents Wildcat Victory in various forms throughout athletic events, from a short excerpt of the introduction to a full version, complete with singing. Fight, you K-State Wildcats For Alma Mater fight-fight-fight! Glory in the combat For the purple and the white. Faithful to our colors We shall ever be, Fighting ever fighting for a Wildcat victory! Go State! K-State Fight Song & Alma Mater Alma Mater The KSU Alma Mater was officially selected as the result of a campus-wide competition in 1888. The original work, composed by H.W. Jones ('88), was four stanzas long, including the chorus. Following a school name change, the song was altered by removing the letters KSAC (Kansas State Agricultural College), replacing them with KSU. The length of the piece was also shortened to two stanzas. I know a spot that I love full well, 'Tis not in forest nor yet in dell; Ever it holds me with magic spell, I think of thee, Alma Mater. KSU, we'll carry thy banner high. KSU, long, long may thy colors fly. Loyal to thee, thy children will swell the cry. Hail, hail, hail, Alma Mater. Others In October, 1928, John Philip Sousa was to make an appearance at K-State. A petition, signed by most of the student body, was presented to Sousa on October 10, requesting that he compose a Kansas State Agricultural College march. Sousa delivered the piano arrangement of Kansas Wildcat March to the Music Department in the spring of 1931. It is now an integral part of the pregame show at every football game, and is normally one of the selections you will hear the \\"Pride\\" playing in parades that they march in. The Wabash Cannonball (arranged by Joel Leach) is known as a second fight song for K-State. Wabash Cannonball was first performed for an athletic event at K-State on December 16, 1968. It was the only selection in the band's repertoire that evening for a home basketball game at Ahearn Fieldhouse. Just three nights prior, arsonists had set fire to Nichols Hall, at that time the home of the Music Department, destroying all of the departments assets, including the sheet music. The band director at that time, Phil Hewett, just happened to have taken this one piece home from the library that very night to do some work on the arrangement, thus making it the only selection to survive the fire. Since then, the Wabash Cannonball has come to represent the survival of the underdog in the hearts and minds of all true K-State fans, and has earned a secure place in the KSUMB's history and traditions. During their opening show of the 2015 season, The Pride of Wildcatland fell under unfortunate circumstances when a mis-aligned formation was mistakenly taken as a malicious jab at rival Kansas. Dr. Frank Tracz, director of bands at K-State, claims the incident as \\"friendly rivalry banter.\\" References External links * Category:Big 12 Conference marching bands Category:Kansas State Wildcats Category:Musical groups from Kansas Category:Musical groups established in 1887 Category:1887 establishments in Kansas ","title":"Kansas State University Marching Band"},{"id":"8136992","text":"Charles Robert Williams (August 1, 1877 ‚Äì October 17, 1957) was an American football coach and college athletics administrator.

He attended the University of Virginia, where he was an end on the football team. Coaching career South Carolina Graduating in 1902, Williams served as the Gamecocks' mentor for two seasons, 1902 and 1903, achieving 6‚Äì1 and 8‚Äì2 records. In 1902, he oversaw an upset of the rival Clemson Tigers, who were coached by John Heisman. This was the only game lost by the Tigers that year. Davidson From 1904 to 1905 he coached at Davidson, where he compiled a 9‚Äì4‚Äì1 record. Clemson Williams came to Clemson in 1906. The Tigers went undefeated with a 4‚Äì0‚Äì3 record, with wins over Georgia, Auburn, Tennessee, and the John Heisman-coached Georgia Tech team. Clemson's first forward pass took place on November 29, 1906, during the game with Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Left End Powell Lykes, dropped back to kick, but lobbed a 30-yard pass to George Warren instead. Clemson won, 10‚Äì0. VPI Williams left for VPI for the 1907 season, leading them to a 7‚Äì2 record. Returns to Clemson Williams then returned to Clemson in 1909. The 1909 season was notable for the resumption of the Clemson-Carolina rivalry after a five-year gap, caused by a near riot in October 1902. The Tigers enjoyed a 6‚Äì3 season under Williams' guidance and defeated the Gamecocks, 6‚Äì0, in Columbia on November 4. Williams was replaced by Frank Dobson in 1910 who had a three-year run at the school, the first coach to actually have a signed contract. With Dobson's departure after the 1912 season, Williams returned for the second time to the Clemson head coaching position. He, too, would serve for three years, 1913‚Äì1915. The Tigers produced records of 4‚Äì4 in 1913, 5‚Äì3‚Äì1 in 1914, and 2‚Äì4‚Äì2 in 1915. In the 41 games that Williams coached in five seasons, he went 21‚Äì14‚Äì6, for a .585 winning percentage. Between the years of 1915 and 1926, Williams practiced law in Roanoke, Virginia, and was the city's mayor. He returned to coach Clemson for the final five games of the 1926 season.

Its collection of around 4000 volumes and 78 manuscripts from the 16th to 19th century is founded on the personal collection of Robert Leighton (1611‚Äì1684), Minister at Newbattle, Principal of Edinburgh University, Bishop of Dunblane and Archbishop of Glasgow. Robert Leighton's personal collection consisted of 1,400 books and the Leighton Library was built to host the books which had been left to Dunblane Cathedral. Early History of the Building Archbishop Robert Leighton died on June the 25th, 1684, in London. His will written on the 17th of February 1683, left a small token to his sister and her son, Saphira and Edward Lightmaker of Broadhurst. They jointly became executors to Robert's will and carried out his wishes to have his books bequeathed to Dunblane Cathedral. Edward wrote to the Bishop of Dunblane on the 8th of July to inform him that the books were ready to be transported by sea and that a sum of ¬£100 had been put aside for the building of a chamber to house the books. Archbishop Leighton had died with very little money so the cost of the building came directly from his nephew, Edward wrote to the Bishop that the Archbishop had thought to repurpose the stone from the Bishop's ruined house and the wall around the church. The library was completed in 1687, with Dr James Fall the Principal of the University of Glasgow coming to inspect the building erected in his friends memory. The total cost of the works was ¬£162 2s. 6d. sterling which included the payment for more land for the foundations of the building and was paid for by the Lightmakers.The History of Dunblane, Alexander B Barty, 1994, The Lightmakers also donated a sum of ¬£200 to provide a salary for the Librarian and also to go towards the upkeep of the library. The oldest book in Leighton's collection was a copy of Herbert's Exquisitio which is dated 1504, other books of interest include the works Justin Martyr, Walton's Biblia Polyglotta in six volumes and the works of St Augustine. There have been donations of books to the library over the years, shortly after it opened it received a large donation from James Turner of Dunblane. In the early 18th century another large donation came from Thomas Hislop, these included several 17th century books, other donors include Dr David Laing and George Paton.  Public Subscription Library  The trustees of the Leighton Library voted to offer the service of a public subscription to the library on the 31st of October 1734. The first to pay for the service were two of the trustees, Sir James Campbell and Sir Hugh Paterson, with each of them giving ¬£3. Although the readership contained small numbers, the high quality of the collection meant that there was constant support from the gentry, professionals and the clergy. It was in the 19th century that the library had a rise in numbers, this was due to the mineral wells that had been discovered on the Cromlix Estate in 1813. During the period where the wells had many visitors the trustees offered a temporary membership to the library for 2s. 6d. a fortnight. By 1831 the subscription to the library had risen to 10s. 6d. for full members. Dunblane was over-shadowed by Bridge of Allan for its water and the library struggled to keep its readers, by 1843 the subscription to the library had fallen to 5s.  Bibiotheca Leightoniana  The two-storey building consists of one apartment which is entered from a stone staircase, beneath the apartment are two vaults which have previously been used as a plasterer's store and at a later point as a painter's store. The library is lit by three windows, two to the west of the building and one to the south, it is a wood lined library with sixteen bookcases lining the walls and low presses for books stand in the centre of the room. The fore-stair into the building had originally run from east to west but at the start of the 19th century it was changed to run north to south. During the period of 1842-1870, the library was briefly opened for general reading, and was then closed from the mid 1850s. At the beginning of the 20th century the building had fallen into neglect and was affected by damp and, during World War II, an air-raid shelter was constructed within its vaults. During the 1950s and 1980s renovation, repair, and cataloguing was carried out, and the library was officially re-opened in May 1990. The library's collection has grown from 1,400 books to 4,500 books. The library was given listed status as of the 5th of October 1971, and is a category A listed building.

His father was the Russian-born emigre Baron Plato von Ustinov (1840‚Äì1918). His son was the actor Sir Peter Ustinov. Early life Ustinov was born Jonah Freiherr von Ustinow in Jaffa, Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire, the son of Plato von Ustinov, a former Russian officer and naturalised citizen of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, who had married Magdalena Hall, then living in Jaffa, the daughter of the Ethiopian court-lady Katharina Hall, also known as Welette-Iyesus and her husband Moritz Hall, a Jewish-born convert to Protestantism, cannon-caster of Tewodros II of Ethiopia and missionary of in Ethiopia, and later in Jaffa.https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Von_Ustinow-2https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/portrait/show/113963https://geneee.org/jona/von+ustinov?lang=enhttps://www.ancestry.com/search/?name=Jona_Ustinov&birth;=1892&death;=1962Wolbert G.C.

Magdalena and Plato von Ustinov (sometimes transcribed as \\"Ustinow\\") had five children, of whom Jona/Jonah was the eldest.Cf. Holtz, \\"Hall, Moritz\\", in: Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: 3 vols., Siegbert Uhlig (ed.), Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2002, 2005, 2007, Vol. 2 / D ‚Äì Ha (2005), article: 'Hall, Moritz'. . There is a family photo, which shows Magdalena von Ustinov (n√©e Hall) with her husband and their children, including Jona/Jonah, who disliked his forename so much that he chose the nickname \\"Klop\\" (\\"Bedbug\\" in Russian), by which he was known to his friends and relatives for the rest of his life. Ustinov went to school in Jaffa, where ‚Äì until 1900 ‚Äì his father hosted the school of the Protestant Immanuel congregation in his H√¥tel du Parc, later in D√ºsseldorf, and Yverdon. He studied at Grenoble University in France and worked at University of Berlin before moving to London. This peripatetic life engendered in Ustinov a cosmopolitan attitude that made him averse to any kind of nationalism. Beginning career In World War I, Ustinov was conscripted into the German Army and served in the Army Air Service unit Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie) 250. He was awarded the W√ºrttembergian Military Merit Order for his services.Cf. \\"Jona von Ustinow\\", in: Frontflieger. His brother Peter von Ustinow joined the same unit and was killed in action on 13 July 1917. After the war Ustinov worked for Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau, the first German news agency, in Amsterdam. On 17 July 1920 he married the painter Nadia Benois, daughter of Leon Benois. The Ustinovs returned to London, where Klop became a press officer for the German Embassy. Their son Peter was born on 16 April 1921. Due to his political opinions, Ustinov got into difficulties with the new Nazi government almost immediately. In 1935, the conflict culminated when Ustinov refused to prove that he was not of Jewish descent (\\"Ariernachweis\\"). As a result, he lost his job and chose to become a British citizen, thus avoiding internment or deportation later, during the war.http://www.signalshed.com/newsletters/En53.pdf Later career Meanwhile, he had begun working for the British intelligence service MI5 https://www.letemps.ch/culture/lagent-u35-netait-klop-ustinov-pere-celebre- acteurhttps://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/491067/Klop-Britain-s- Most-Ingenious-Spy-by-Peter-Day- reviewhttps://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/klophttps://books.google.com/books?id=wIzIAgAAQBAJ&pg;=PT18&lpg;=PT18&dq;=U35+Ustinov&hl;=enGuy Liddell#Wartime diarieshttps://books.google.com/books/about/Klop.html?id=UIHcAwAAQBAJhttps://books.google.com/books?id=M84O5pYh3rcC&pg;=PA196&lpg;=PA196&dq;=U35+Ustinov&hl;=en and hosted secret meetings of senior British officials and German generals at his home on the fourth floor of 34 Redcliffe Gardens, Kensington, London.https://www.google.com/maps/place/34+Redcliffe+Gardens,+Kensington,+London+SW10+9HA,+UK/@51.4853266,-0.1866379,19z/?hl=enhttps://www.ornaverum.org/family/waddell- robin/ustinov.htmlhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074q5h Notable among these guests were the diplomat Robert Vansittart and Winston Churchill (then out of power).

Former MI5 officer Peter Wright said it was \\"priceless intelligence, possibly the most important human-source intelligence Britain received in the prewar period\\".Peter Wright, Spycatcher, 1987, p. 87 He also tried to convince the British government to adopt a more robust attitude towards Nazi Germany. Seven months before the occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, he was able to acquire the German plans.

Norman came to life in five TV spots, on billboards, banners on downtown street lamps, yard signs and via guerilla advertising. The campaign succeeded in changing public opinion and sparked an international controversy and led to an announcement by James Dobson, head of Focus on the Family, that he had a dog named Sherman, who barks, because God intended for dogs to bark. Dobson explained that, if Sherman ever felt tempted to moo, he would take steps to cure himself of this unnatural behavior.

The roller coaster was built in 1940 and operated until is permanent closure in 2000. In 2006, after the lift motor and part of its electronics were gutted, Flyer Comet was demolished. The tracks were then reclaimed by the park. Flyer Comet was located next to the amusement park, Whalom Park, which operated until 2000. The ride consisted of a wooden wheel with stop buttons built into its outer rim. The main building was located underneath the ride and passengers would sit on benches inside of the building. The outside of the building was covered in glass to hide the rollers so they could be easily discovered. The wait at Flyer Comet would last anywhere from 2-3 minutes to three hours. History When the 1923 Shooting Star roller coaster was destroyed in 1938 by a hurricane, Whalom staff hired the National Amusement Device Company and designer Vernon Keenan to create a new coaster for the park. Many parts from the Shooting Star were used to construct the ride, which was then called the Comet. The ride was Whalom Park‚Äôs third roller coaster since the park opened in 1893, and no new coasters ever replaced it or were added to the park. Whalom Park was bought by Global Developments in 2001. They started clearing the land on October 10, 2006; the roller coaster was dismantled on Oct. 18. The area is currently being redeveloped into Emerald Estates. Themes The entrance to the ride was decorated with shooting stars/comets. The Black Hole tunnel was added over a hilly portion of the track in 1990, and was meant to add to the space theme of the ride.

Accessed on 20 December 2017 The Scottish map firm John Bartholomew and Son is credited with popularizing the colored contour line technique, and their color scheme has become conventional: dark greens at low elevations, progressing through yellows and others, to browns and then grays and white at the highest elevations.

Matthew Fontaine Maury published this map in 1853 in Explanations and Sailing Directions to Accompany the Wind and Current Charts.\\"NOAA Ocean Explorer: First bathymetric map printed Application The Moon with hypsometric tints of red for the highest points and purple for the lowest.There are two primary types of hypsometric tinting: discrete and continuous. Maps with discrete hypsometric tinting have a distinct, uniform color between each of the contours, which give them a stepped appearance. The historical bathymetric map shown at the right is an example of discrete hypsometric tinting. In a map with continuous hypsometric tinting, there is a gradual shift from one tint to another, which presents a smoother appearance. This is often accomplished using data from a digital elevation model (DEM). Each pixel in the DEM is assigned a color which corresponds to the exact elevation at that location, so it is more precise than discrete hypsometric tinting. The colorful image of the moon has continuous hypsometric tinting. A typical color scheme progresses from dark greens for lower elevations, up through yellows/browns and on to grays and white at the highest elevations.Buckley, Alileen.

It was discovered by Grigory Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory in 1925, and later named after Polish‚ÄìSoviet writer Wanda Wasilewska. The asteroid has a rotation period of 28.8 hours.  Discovery  Wanda was discovered on its first recorded observation on 16 August 1925, by Soviet astronomer Grigory Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. Three nights later, it was independently discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory on 19 August 1925. The Minor Planet Center only recognizes the first discoverer.  Orbit and classification  Wanda is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2‚Äì3.6 AU once every 4 years and 11 months (1,802 days; semi-major axis of 2.90 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.25 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg Observatory, just three nights after its official discovery at Simeiz.  Physical characteristics  Wanda has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS photometric survey.  Rotation period  Three rotational lightcurves of Wanda have been obtained from photometric observations by astronomers Eric Barbotin (2004), Donald Pray (2004), Richard Binzel (1984), respectively (). The consolidated lightcurve analysis gave a longer-than average rotation period of 28.8 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.14 and 0.41 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Wanda measures between 40.47 and 48.85 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo between 0.0279 and 0.0446. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0415 and a diameter of 40.41 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.04.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Polish‚ÄìSoviet novelist Wanda Wasilewska (1905‚Äì1964), also known by her Russian name Vanda Lvovna Vasilevskaya. Another interpretation of the asteroid's name is derived from mythology and ancient Polish annals, and refers to the legendary daughter of Krak, Wanda, who founded the city of Krak√≥w ().

He lived during the 6th century BCE in what are now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India. According to traditional accounts, at the time of Gautama Buddha's birth, he predicted his future destination as an enlightened teacher. Life Kaundinya was a brahmin who first came to prominence as a youth due to his mastery of the Vedas and was later appointed as a royal court scholar of King Suddhodana of the Sakyas in Kapilavastu. There Kaundinya was the only scholar who unequivocally predicted upon the birth of Prince Siddhartha that the prince would become an enlightened Buddha, and vowed to become his disciple. Kaundinya and four colleagues followed Siddhartha in six years of ascetic practice, but abandoned him in disgust after Siddhartha gave up the practice of self-mortification. Upon enlightenment, Siddhartha gave his first dharma talk to Kaundinya's group. Kaundinya was the first to comprehend the teaching and thus became the first bhikkhu and arahat. Kaundinya was aware as the foremost of the five initial disciples of the Buddha and later travelled around India spreading the dharma. Among his notable converts was his nephew Pu·πá·πáa, who the Buddha acknowledged as the foremost preacher of the dharma. In his final years, he retreated to the Himalayas and predeceased the Buddha. Kaundinya's previous rebirths are described in many accounts in Buddhist literature. These accounts show that he had vowed in previous existences to be the first to comprehend the dharma when it was to be proclaimed by an enlightened Buddha. They also document that the seeds of his relationship with Gautama Buddha as the first arahant were sown in previous existences in which they had crossed paths.  Early years  Kaundinya was born before the time of Siddhartha to a wealthy Brahmin family in a town named in Donavatthu, near Kapilavastu, and was known by his family name. When he was growing up, he mastered the three Vedas at a young age and excelled in the science of physiognomy (lakhana-manta). Kaundinya became a young vishwakarma Brahmin scholar in Kapilavastu in the Sakya kingdom of King Suddhodana. He was one among the group of scholars who were invited to the royal court to predict the destiny of Crown Prince Siddhartha at his naming ceremony. Siddhartha was the first child born to Suddhodana and Queen Maya in twenty years of marriage and much interest surrounded the infant from royal society and the public alike. All the other scholars raised two fingers and offered a twofold prediction: That Siddhartha would either become a Chakravarti (supreme king) or would renounce the world and become a supreme religious leader. Kaundinya was the only one that explicitly predicted that Siddhartha would renounce the world to become a Buddha, raising one finger and stating his prediction. Kaundinya thereafter vowed that he would follow when Siddhartha became an ascetic to learn from the future Buddha's findings. In the meantime, Suddhodana attempted to foil Kaundinya's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom. Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that he could find. However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects. Suddhodana agreed, but attempted to present a sanitised image of human existence by ordering beggars, old people and sick people to be kept from the streets. Despite this, Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world. Renouncement and Arahantship The five ascetics meet Siddhartha. When Siddhartha was aged 29, he renounced the world to become a sama·πáa (ascetic). Kaundinya, along with Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mahanama and Assaji, variously described as four of the other scholars who had read Siddhartha's future or the sons of those scholars, followed him into the ascetic life, with the approval of Suddhodana, who was worried about Siddhartha's safety. They were known as \\"the group of five\\" or \\"the group of five fortunate ones\\". After Siddhartha had mastered all the teachings of Alara Kalama and then Uddaka Ramaputta, he left and began practicing self mortification along with Kaundinya and his four colleagues at Uruvela. Kaundinya and his colleagues attended to Siddhartha in the hope that he would become enlightened through self-mortification. These involved self-deprivation of food and water, and exposing themselves to the elements to near-death for six years, at which point Siddhartha rejected self-mortification. Kaundinya and his colleagues became disillusioned, believing Siddhartha to have become a glutton and moved away to Sarnath near Varanasi to continue their practices. After Siddhartha became the enlightened Gautama Buddha, he sought to find his former teachers Arada Kalama and Udraka Ramaputra in order to teach them. Realising that they had died, the Buddha decided to find Kaundinya and his colleagues to share his teachings. Kaundinya and his companions were skeptical of Gautama Buddha after his abandonment of asceticism, and initially refused to acknowledge his presence, except to offer a seat on the ground. However, the ascetics were soon won over when they sensed that the Buddha had changed since they left him. The Buddha preached the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which deals with the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, the core pillars of Buddhist teaching regarding the intrinsic suffering of existence and how to deal with it. Kaundinya reached the sotƒÅpanna stage of arahathood upon hearing this, becoming the first human to comprehend the teachings. The Buddha acknowledged this by remarking \\"annasi vata bho Kondanno (meaning \\"you have realised, Kondanna\\"). Five days later, hearing the subsequent Anattalakkhana Sutta regarding anatta, Kaundinya gained full arahantship. Kaundinya thus became first arahat. Having realised arahanthood, he requested the Buddha for permission to retire from the world, which was granted with the words \\"ehi bhikkhu\\". Kaundinya thus became the first bhikkhu (monk) in the Buddha's dispensation, known as the sangha. Later, the assembly at Jetavana declared him to be the foremost among the first bhikkhus and the disciples of long standing.  After enlightenment  Following the emergence of the sangha, Kaundinya and the other monks travelled with the Buddha by foot through the Gangetic plains area of what is now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to spread the dharma. Kaundinya helped to convert many followers to the Buddha's teaching, the foremost being his nephew Punna, born to his sister Mantani. This occurred while the Buddha was at Rajagaha, where he had immediately gone after first communicating his Realisation in order to honour his promise to show his teachings to King Bimbisara. In the meantime, Kaundinya returned to his home town of Kapilavastu and ordained Punna. Punna attained arahantship and 500 of his clansmen become monks. Punna was later acknowledged by the Buddha as the foremost of the disciples in preaching skills. As one of the senior monks of Gautama Buddha, some of Kaundinya's writings and discourses to other monks are recorded in the literature. A poem consisting of sixteen verses in the Theragatha is attributed to him. The first of these is said to have been recited by Sacca in praise of Kaundinya, after Kaundinya had preached the Four Noble Truths to Sacca. In other verses, Kaundinya is shown admonishing monks who had fallen into ways contrary to Buddhist teaching. Kaundinya also acknowledged his own struggles against Mara, the demon who attempted to prevent the enlightenment of the Buddha. Kaundinya was also praised in the Udana by the Buddha, who observed his deliverance from the destructiveness of craving. After a period within the sangha, Kaundinya retired to the Himalayas for the last twelve years of his life. This is attributed to two reasons in Buddhist literature. The first reason was that Kaundinya considered his presence to be a source of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief disciples of The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Kaundinya lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Kaundinya behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Kaundinya, so he decided to solve the problem by absenting himself. The other reason to which Kaundinya's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public. According to the Samyutta Nikaya, Kaundinya retired to the banks of the Mandakini Lake in the Chaddanta forest, said to be the abode of the paccekabuddhas. It was said that the 8000 elephants in the forest took turns to catering for his needs. Kaundinya only left once, to farewell Gautama Buddha. Kaundinya kissed the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to pass away the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed with the help of the elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.  Previous and future rebirths  In line with the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth, the previous existences of Kaundinya are described in Buddhist texts. They repeatedly show a theme of Kaundinya having displayed religious inclinations in previous rebirths, many of which involve experiences with previous rebirths of the Buddha and his other leading disciplines. This is a common theme among the leading disciples, all of whom had many encounters with the future Gautama Buddha in previous lives, and is consistent with the Buddhist concepts of cause and effect and karma. In Pali language Theravada literature, Kaundinya is said to have begun striving for enlightenment in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, the 13th Buddha. The son of a wealthy householder at Hamsavati, Kaundinya saw the monk who was the first disciple of Padmuttara Buddha. Kaundinya's previous rebirth bestowed on the Buddha and the sangha and wished that he was to be the first disciple of a future Buddha. Padumuttara is said to have prophesied the fulfilment of this in the era of Gautama Buddha, 1000 aeons into the future. After the passing of Padmuttara Buddha, Kaundinya constructed a jewelled chamber inside the cetiya in which the relics were stored and also made an offering of jewel festoons. The Apadana offers a variant on this reincarnation. It states that Kaundinya was the first person to offer a meal to Padumuttara and became a deva in the Tusita world. It further says and that during the time of Vipassƒ´ Buddha, Kaundinya was a householder named Mahakala who offered the Buddha the first fruits of his field in their nine stages of production. The Mahavastu gives another account explaining the origin of Kaundinya's vow to attain arahanthood in his final rebirth. This account asserts that he was a potter at Rajagaha in a previous existence. A Paccekabuddha who was suffering from biliousness sought shelter in the potter's hut and was cured. In time, several more Paccekabuddhas came to visit the hut to inquire about their colleagues health status. The potter asked which of them had realised the dharma first, to which the patient answered in the affirmative. Thereupon the potter made his vow. Despite the differences in the accounts, all of them agree on his words when announcing his vow: Numerous previous rebirths in which Kaundinya and Gautama Buddha crossed paths are also noted in Pali literature. The Mahavastu cites a previous birth in which Kaundinya was a seafaring merchant who had lost all his wealth after a mid-ocean shipwreck. Kaundinya then went in search of the king of Kosala, who had a widely known reputation for philanthropy. However, the Kosalan monarch had left his kingdom and surrendered his kingdom to the neighbouring Kasi king. The king of Kosala had done so to avert bloodshed, since the Kasi king had threatened to invade. Nevertheless, the Kasi king wanted to capture the Kosalan king and decreed a large reward for it. The Kosalan king (Gautama Buddha in a previous rebirth) tied himself and asked the merchant to deliver him to Kasi so that the merchant would no longer be in poverty. However, when the Kasi king heard this, he withdrew his army and restored the Kosalan monarchy. The Kosalan king subsequently bestowed wealth on the merchant. Gautama Buddha cited this occurrence to illustrate how the ties between living beings extended into their previous existences. In another rebirth described in the Mahavastu, Kaundinya and his four colleagues who were to become the first bhikkhus were seafaring merchants under the command of the future Gautama Buddha. The future Buddha sacrificed himself to save them from an ocean death. The Divyavadana describes two further rebirths of Kaundinya. In one he was a bird named Uccangama. In another, he was a tigress and Gautama Buddha another tiger. The future Buddha sacrificed his own life by offering himself as meat to the hungry tigress so that it would not eat its own cubs. The \\"Five Hundred Disciples\\" (eighth) chapter of the Mahayana Lotus Sutra predicts that in the future he will become a Buddha named Universal Brightness. Legacy A hand-balancing asana in modern yoga as exercise, Koundinyasana, was named for him. It is recorded in the 20th century among the asanas taught by Pattabhi Jois in Mysore in his Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga and B. K. S. Iyengar in his 1966 book Light on Yoga.

Its buildings‚Äîa sanctuary with chapel (1949) and an education wing (1962) designed by Finnish-American architects Eliel Saarinen and Eero Saarinen‚Äîhave been internationally recognized, most recently in 2009 as National Historic Landmark by the U.S Department of the Interior. The congregation was established in 1911 as part of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, but left in the 1970s as part of a dispute that led to the formation of the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, which in turn was among the founding denominations of the ELCA. The Rev. Eva Jensen currently serves as interim lead pastor, with the Rev. Erik Haaland as associate pastor. The congregation is also served by its cantors, the Rev. Robert Buckley Farlee and the Rev. Martin A. Seltz. Structures The church sanctuary Inside the nave, facing the front The International Style worship building was designed by the firm Saarinen and Saarinen, a father and son partnership of Eliel Saarinen (1873‚Äì1950) and Eero Saarinen (1910‚Äì1961), the project was Eliel Saarinen's last completed building. The sculptured stone panels were designed by William M. McVey (1922‚Äì1976). It was dedicated in 1949, and was acknowledged as an architectural masterpiece from the day it opened. As an early, outstanding example of modern religious architecture in the United States, it was widely published in the architectural, popular, and religious press, and provided inspiration for countless modern churches that were to be built in the 1950s and 1960s. Noted conductor Osmo V√§nsk√§ said of the church that \\"It's a good place to play. The acoustics are good for music‚Äîfor chamber music‚Äîand it's a good place for the audience to listen. It's a place not only for the congregation but also a venue for concerts.\\" The congregation opted to go with the design after finding that their plans for a traditional Gothic Revival building would be too costly. In 1946 a new pastor, Reverend William A. Buege, contacted the elder Saarinen, then the president of the Cranbrook Academy of Art, and convinced him to take the commission. Saarinen had designed the pioneering First Christian Church in Columbus, Indiana in 1941 and used it as a model. It was Eliel Saarinen's last building; he died the following year. Upon the church's opening, Saarinen noted \\"if a building is honest, the architecture is religious.\\" The 1962 education building An addition, the education building (connected by an arcade and interior hallways) was designed under the supervision of Eero Saarinen by his former employee Glen Paulsen, and completed in 1962. By coincidence it was also Eero's last completed project; he died the year before. The addition is organized around a courtyard and was carefully designed to complement and complete their earlier worship building. In 1977, the building was the eighth recipient of the American Institute of Architects Twenty-five Year Award, one of only two places of worship to have been so honored. Notably, it was chosen for this award ahead of Mies van der Rohe's iconic Farnsworth House, though both buildings were eligible in the same year. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The entire building was named a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service by the Secretary of the Interior on January 16, 2009.Kempthorne designates 9 new historic landmarksRochelle Olson, Landmark church takes its place in history , Star Tribune, January 17, 2009, Accessed January 19, 2009.

Early life  Brigham became interested in music from a very early age. He played the saxophone in the school band from 4th to 9th grades, His first major influences were seeing Ricky Nelson on \\"The Adventures of Ozzie And Harriet\\" and The Beatles first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964. He didn't start playing guitar until autumn of 1966. He took lessons, and watched how other people played, whether live or on TV, and he listened to a lot of different music.  Clinic   Beginnings  At the end of his junior year in high school, Brigham moved with his family to Paris, and from 1969 to 1970 attended The American School of Paris. It was in Paris that Brigham met Phil Steele, then known as Phil Trainer. He was a 22- or 23-year- old bass player and vocalist, and he \\"raided\\" Philip's high school rock band, taking Phil on guitar, Gerry Murphy on drums, and flute player Chris Hayward. Steele had previously played in Japan and Italy and knew British keyboard player Alan Reeves, then 25 or 26, because Reeves had played in a band called Clinic in both countries, and Phil Steele did some Clinic gigs in Italy. They put together a five-piece band, and because they were British-American, and had some music industry connections, they immediately got signed to a production company, and subsequently were signed to EMI in France.  The Road to Salina  After signing with EMI France, Reeves' fashion model wife, Albane Navizet, took a bit part in a French film by director Georges Lautner called Road to Salina. Lautner already had French pop singer Christophe on board for a few songs, and some orchestral stuff, but wanted some rock music for his film. He originally wanted Pink Floyd, then popular in Europe though virtually unknown in the U.S., but they were not available, so Clinic got a demo tape together and Albane gave it to Georges Lautner. He liked what he heard. By mostly luck, Clinic were in the right place at the right time, and got the nod to work on the soundtrack. Since the songs were being written individually by Steele, Reeves, or Brigham, or in some combination, they decided to say that all songs were Brigham-Reeves-Steele, to avoid arguments over which songs got shown to the film people.  Early recordings  Some of the seven songs used in the film were written before they saw the sections of film the director wanted music for, but luckily they fit. In a few cases, such as for example \\"The Chase\\", they were brand new compositions and really was a collaborative effort between the writers. They were very young when they got the chance to write music for Road to Salina, mostly in their late teens, or early 20s, and young, as in the band had not been together very long. By the time they got to do their own album, Now We're Even (recorded in 1971, released in 1972 in France), they had more of a style, similar to Santana on instruments meeting Crosby, Stills and Nash on vocals. When they were either writing new tunes specifically for the movie, or trying to find songs that fit from songs various Clinic members had written before, they were still trying to find a sound.  Forming a sound  Phil Steele was more of a pop guy, influenced by The Hollies, or The Turtles or The Zombies. Alan Reeves had learned jazz piano by his father's side when he was a boy, and had become quite the Hammond organ player, √† la Jon Lord from Deep Purple, or Keith Emerson of The Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Chris Hayward had studied classical music for flute and recorder. Gerry Murphy was a jazz fan but was also the kind of guy that turned everybody on to The Band. Phil Brigham was coming at music like a singer-songwriter, like Donovan or James Taylor or Neil Young, although since Clinic, other musicians think of him more as a rock lead guitarist. Bringing all of those influences together was exciting for the young band, but it took them a long time to figure out how it might all fit.  The Chase  \\"The Chase\\" was put together initially as a jam thing that they wrote specifically for Road to Salina, as opposed to some of the other tunes in that film that were written before it, and they just happened to fit. Phil Brigham started playing \\"The Chase\\" by spontaneously playing the guitar riff that opens the tune. Alan Reeves played some rock/classical organ on top of it. At one point, they go to another section with four sustained chords which Alan Reeves came up with, just to get some relief from the repetitiveness of the riff.  Scoring a movie  Brigham was a senior in high school when Clinic did the soundtrack, and he never saw the totally completed film until later. They would be shown say 1:03 minute's worth of film, and told \\"put some music of such-and-such type here\\". When the movie came out, even at age 19, Phil was a little embarrassed at how bad the quality of the production was. The movie was neither a commercial or critical success, but Brigham, Reeves & Trainer all did receive royalties, as the three songwriters from 1972 to 1988. So, while Road to Salina is admittedly \\"low budget\\", Phil Brigham feels that if he never took part in it, he would never have gotten a writing credit years later for the Quentin Tarantino film, Kill Bill Volume 2.  Back in the United States  After Clinic, Brigham came to Boston, Massachusetts to go to the Berklee College of Music. He went on to play in scores of bands, duos, and so forth in the local Boston area. In 1981, along with his then-wife Anne English, he co-wrote and recorded a song that made Boston FM-radio Station WCOZ Best of the Boston Beat Volume 2 album. The duo got some nibbles from A&M; Records, but ultimately were passed over.  Television Scoring  Brigham has enjoyed some success with original instrumentals placed on television between 1990 and the present: an NBC Sunday night made-for-TV movie called Condition Critical and an ABC Sunday night movie, I Saw What You Did, starring Rosanna Arquette. Also Jerry Springer, Ricki Lake, 20/20, Nickelodeon's The Adventures of Pete & Pete and Lifetime's Intimate Portrait, with Stefanie Powers.  Kill Bill  At first Brigham had no idea \\"The Chase\\", from his time with Clinic scoring Road to Salina, was going to be in a Tarantino film. When he found out, he was guessing that Tarantino saw Road to Salina and remembered the parts of it that are kind of impressive, the desert cinematography, for example. In Road to Salina, they play \\"The Chase\\" for the first time in a scene not unlike the way \\"The Chase\\" is used in Kill Bill Volume 2, with a car speeding across the desert on its way somewhere. Phil later discovered more about how \\"The Chase\\" music got in Kill Bill Volume 2. \\"It turns out that Julie Dreyfus, who plays Sofie Fatale in Kill Bill, knew that Quentin Tarantino was looking for music, and her father, Francis Dreyfus had the rights to quite a lot of soundtrack music, including Road to Salina. The soundtrack called \\"La Route De Salina\\" was re- released, on CD by Dreyfus Records in 2003. Curiously, there's at least one Clinic song, \\"Come On Come On\\" that's in the movie, but not on the LP, and vice versa. A song called \\"Jacqueline\\" is on the LP but not in the movie.\\" - Philip Brigham, March 22, 2005  References  External links * Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian rock singers Category:Canadian male singers Category:Canadian rock guitarists Category:Canadian male guitarists ","title":"Philip Brigham"},{"id":"8137339","text":"Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor by William Halsall (1882) Francis Eaton was born ca. 1596 in Bristol, England, and died in the autumn of 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony. He, with his wife and son, were passengers on the historic 1620 voyage of the Mayflower. His signature appears on the Mayflower Compact.Johnson, pp. 138-140Stratton, p. 286  Early life in England  Francis Eaton was baptised on 11 September 1596 at St. Thomas' Church in Bristol, England.Johnson, p. 138Pilgrim Hall Museum Francis Eaton Francis was a son of John Eaton and his wife Dorothy (Smith). He had younger siblings who were born after him ‚Äì including Jane in 1598/99, Samuel in 1600 and Welthian in 1602, but all siblings died of a possible devastating illness in March 1603 which may have spread through the whole family. He was the only child of this family known to survive until adulthood. A genealogical profile of Francis Eaton, (a collaboration of Plimoth Plantation and New England Historic Genealogical Society accessed 2013) Eaton had become a house carpenter in Bristol by about age nineteen (c.1615) and was living in a tenement in the parish of St. Phillips, Bristol. Bristol records subsequent to 1615 do not list Francis Eaton, who may have left England for Holland, as Bradford lists him on the Mayflower passenger list section for Leiden congregation members. Probably about 1618 or 1619 in England, Francis Eaton married a woman named Sarah (surname unknown). There is no record in Bristol of his first marriage or of the birth of his son Samuel there, indicating the family may have lived elsewhere in England prior to boarding the Mayflower.  Mayflower  Francis Eaton, his wife Sarah, with newborn son Samuel came on the Mayflower with William Bradford writing that Samuel \\"came over a sucking child.\\" Bradford noted this family at that time: \\"Francis Eaton, and Sarah, his wife, and Samuell, their son, a young child.\\"Stratton, p. 406. Francis Eaton was a carpenter by trade and Banks believes that he was the Mayflower ship's carpenter, being in the employ of the Merchant Adventurers, financial supporters of the Mayflower venture.Charles Edward Banks, The second English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers, (Baltimore MD.,: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2005,) p. 52. Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on 6/16 September 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the first ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Stratton, p. 413. On 9/19 November 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. And after several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on 11/21 November. After arrival at Cape Cod, Francis Eaton was one of the men who signed the Mayflower Compact.Stratton, pp. 411-413.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document pp. 7-19.  In Plymouth Colony  William Bradford's observation on this family in his later years: \\"\\"Stratton, p. 285.(Bradford (Ford) 2:400, 410) In the 1623 Division of Land, Francis received four acres of land ‚Äì one acre for himself, one for his deceased first wife Sarah, one for his son Samuel and one for his second wife Dorothy.Stratton, p. 416.Johnson, p. 139 In 1626 Francis Eaton was one of twenty-seven Purchasers involved with the colony joint-stock company which afterwards was turned over to the control of senior colony members. That group was called Undertakers, and was made up of such as William Bradford, Myles Standish and Isaac Allerton initially who were later joined by Edward Winslow, William Brewster, John Howland, John Alden, Thomas Prence and others from London, former Merchant Adventurers. His name appears as \\"Franc Eaton\\" on the agreement dated 26 October 1626.Stratton, pp. 27, 28, 36, 419-420. In the 1627 Division of Cattle, Francis and Christian Eaton, with children Samuel and Rachel, received several animals ‚Äì a cow and two goats. The family had the tenth lot and were listed as \\"ffancis Eaton, wife Christian Eaton, Samuell Eaton, Rahell Eaton.\\"Stratton, p. 425. In 1631, apparently due to some severe financial problems, Eaton began selling off much of his landholdings ‚Äì selling four acres of land north of town \\"between the land of Capt. Myles Standish on the south side and one acre due unto Henry Sampson on the north side.\\" On 25 June 1631 records state he sold a cow calf to Edward Winslow and noted terms of interest on the sale. On 30 December 1631 Francis Eaton sold twenty acres of land to William Brewster and then sold another ten acre parcel to Brewster in the same area. About a week later, on 8 January 1631/2, he sold his home to Winslow relatives of Edward Winslow ‚Äì Kenelm, a brother, and Josiah, possibly his son. On the tax rolls of 1633, Francis Eaton was taxed at the lowest tax rate, indicating a very low personal income. On that list, his name appears as \\"France Eaton.\\"Stratton, pp. 427-428  Family  Francis Eaton married: * Sarah Morton Day married in England ca. 1618-1619. She died the first winter in the \\"general sickness.\\" Burial place unknown.

Son of Francis and Sarah Eaton: Samuel Eaton, born c. early 1620, came as, per Bradford, \\"a sucking child\\" on the Mayflower. He was apprenticed at age sixteen to John Cooke, who himself was a Mayflower passenger at age twelve, with his term of service to begin in October 1636. After his marriage, he moved north to Duxbury sometime in 1646 and moved to Middleboro about 1670, where he died about 1684. He married: * Elizabeth ______, married before 10 March 1646.

She married Joseph Ramsdell (or Ramsden) in 1645 and had at least one son. * Benjamin Eaton, born in March 1628 and died in Plympton on 16 January 1711/12. He married Sarah Hoskins on 4 December 1660 and had at least four children. * A third child was of unknown name or gender, and was listed by Bradford as just \\"an idiot\\" and was still alive in 1651.  Francis Eaton death, estate and burial  Francis Eaton died in the autumn of 1633, possibly as the result of an epidemic that spread through the colony that year and also claimed the lives of fellow Mayflower passengers Peter Browne and Samuel Fuller. By the time of his death his was a freeman.Stratton, p. 74 On 26 November 1633, the Plymouth Court proclaimed \\"‚Ä¶Francis Eaton, carpenter, late of Plymouth, deceased, died indebted far more than the estate‚Ä¶\\" Thomas Prence and John Doane were involved in the estate process with the probate inventory being drawn up the same day by James Hurst, Francis Cooke and Phineas Pratt, revealing how meager his estate was due to Eaton's dire financial situation.Johnson, pp. 139-140 Prior to his death, due apparently to his shortage of finances, Eaton had sold off all his lands and house. At his death what was left of his estate was only his livestock, household goods and carpentry tools, the total of which only made up 1/3 of the value of his total debts. But Christian, his widow, apparently was not held liable for his debts by the Court which proclaimed that \\"‚Ä¶ the widow be freed and acquitted from any claim or demand of all or any his creditors whatsoever.\\" Francis Eaton was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony.Utah Mayflower  Burial of the wives of Francis Eaton  The burial place of his first wife Sarah is unknown, but most likely her burial was in an unmarked grave on Coles Hill, the first Pilgrim burial location, as with so many others who died the first winter of 1621. The reason for the unmarked graves was so that the Native Americans would not know how decimated their numbers were, with so many deaths. She is memorialized on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb (Sarcophagus) on Coles Hill in Plymouth with: \\"Sarah, first wife of Francis Eaton.\\" The burial places of his second and third wives, Dorothy and Christian, are unknown.

He played a significant role during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He was one of the captive Mughal princes shot dead at one of the gates of Old Delhi, which gate thereafter came to be known as \\"Khooni Darwaza\\" (\\"bloody gate\\" or \\"murder gate\\"). Early life Mirza Mughal was the fifth son of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the 19th and last Mughal emperor. His mother, Sharif-ul-Mahal Sayyidini, came from an aristocratic Sayyid family that claimed descent from Muhammad. Following the death in 1856 of his elder step-brother Mirza Fakhru, Mirza Mughal became the eldest surviving legitimately born son of Bahadur Shah Zafar. However, the British refused to recognize anybody as heir to the throne of Delhi, and indicated that the monarchy would be abolished following Zafar's death. War of 1857 In May 1857, sepoys in the service of the East India Company rebelled against their British officers and streamed into Delhi. They made straight for the palace, apprised the Emperor of their grievances against their British superiors, affirmed their allegiance to him, and sought sanctuary and leadership. A few days later, after taking stock of the situation, Mirza Mughal and some of his half-brothers petitioned their father to be appointed in charge of the rebel troops. Their plea was initially refused but later granted, and Mirza Mughal, as the senior-most legitimate prince, was designated commander-in-chief. Though the emperor seems to have opposed the cold-blooded killing of the European prisoners, the princes also seem to have been involved in the act. Mirza Mughal had absolutely no training or experience for his new office. However, he energetically sought to organize the troops, make arrangements for their billeting and provisioning, and bring a semblance of order to the edgy city. His inexperience soon became apparent, and he was upstaged a few weeks later by the arrival of a large force of mutineers from Bareilly, led by Bakht Khan, formerly an Indian officer (Subedar) in the service of the East India Company. Bakht Khan had earned a reputation as an artillery officer during the Afghan wars. Shortly after his arrival, the emperor appointed Bakht Khan commander-in-chief and left Mirza Mughal in charge of supplies. A few weeks later, following another reshuffle of offices, Mirza Mughal was given charge of administering the city of Delhi. Capture By the middle of September 1857, the disorganized rebellion had run its course as far as the city of Delhi was concerned. British forces had reclaimed control of the areas surrounding Delhi and were massed on the ridge overlooking the city for a final assault on the city, which was being rapidly abandoned by its citizens, who fled mainly to their villages in the countryside. As the British took control of the city, Emperor Bahadur Shah II (aged 82) left the Red Fort and took refuge in Humayun‚Äôs Tomb, which at that time lay outside Delhi. With him were Mirza Mughal and two other princes (another son, Mirza Khizr Sultan, and a grandson, Mirza Abu Bakr). Their whereabouts was reported by spies to Major Hodson, who sent them a message saying that the party had no hope of escape and should surrender. They refused to surrender. The next morning, Hodson went to the tomb with one hundred Indian sowars (cavalrymen) and demanded the unconditional surrender of the Emperor and princes. The situation became known to people of nearby villages, and a substantial crowd gathered, many of whom were equipped with whatever arms (farm-knives, sickles and axes) they normally kept. Resistance at this point was never the plan of the Emperor, who had come to the tomb of his illustrious forebear to pray and grieve, and perhaps in the hope that the sanctity of the tomb would provide a sanctuary for himself and his surviving family. Hodson sent two Indian aides (Rajab Ali and Ilahe Bakhsh) into the garden tomb to negotiate with the Emperor. Bahadur Shah sent a response to Hodson offering the surrender of his immediate party on condition that his life would be spared. Hodson explicitly agreed to this. Agreement being reached, the Emperor, trusting to the word of Hodson as a British officer, emerged from the tomb and exchanged greetings in person with Hodson. Finding the old man extremely frail with exertion, Hodson told the Emperor to rest under a shady tree and accept refreshments. The Emperor was then sent back to Delhi, carried in a palanquin with an escort of Sikh sowars from Hodson's Horse. Meanwhile, the remaining ninety troopers collected the arms of the motley crowd of villagers, jihadis and courtiers, who surrendered their weaponry without dissent at the bidding of their Emperor. Death Shortly afterwards, with the Emperor secured but clearly in no condition to be transported to the city, Hodson set out for the city with a small party of troopers. Riding on horses, they soon caught up with the party carrying the princes. As they approached the gates of the city, Hodson found that a crowd of townsmen had gathered in the expectation of witnessing the return of the Emperor and the princes. Also, a crowd of curious villagers and armed civilians had followed in the wake of the Princes as they travelled the few miles to the gates of Delhi. Khooni Darwaza were Mirza Mughal was killed. It has been suggested that Hodson lost his nerve upon beholding the armed crowds or that he wanted to take revenge for the involvement of the princes in the killing of the unarmed prisoners. Others have suggested that the presence of the crowds suggested to him that this was a suitable arena in which to send out a clear message to the Indians and demonstrate the power and ruthlessness of the British. Yet others have suggested that Hodson had made the agreement with the old Emperor in bad faith and that he had never intended to keep his word. In all events, the idea that breaching a solemn agreement (guaranteeing only life), which he had made minutes before, upon his word of honour as a British army officer, to an old man much respected by these crowds, would serve to blacken the reputation of the British rather than enhance it, was clearly beyond Hodson's ken. At the city gate, Hodson ordered the three princes to get off the cart. They were then stripped of their upper garments. The bare-chested princes were lined up in clear sight of the crowd. Hodson then took out his gun and himself shot the three unarmed and half-naked princes at point-blank range. After killing the princes, Hodson personally stripped their bodies of jewellery, being the signet rings, turquoise arm- bands and bejewelled swords worn by the three princes. He pocketed these valuables as trophies of war, although they had been obtained by killing disarmed prisoners of war under dubious circumstances. The bodies of the three princes were thrown back into the bullock-cart, taken to a kotwali (police- station) within the city, thrown on the ground in front of that building and left exposed there to be seen by all. The gate near which the executions were performed became known as Khooni Darwaza meaning \\"Bloody Gate\\" or \\"Murder Gate.\\" References Bibliography *William Dalrymple, The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty: Delhi, 1857 published by Penguin, 2006, Category:1817 births Category:1857 deaths Category:Mughal princes Category:People from Delhi Category:Revolutionaries of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Category:People executed by British India Category:Executed Indian people Category:People executed by the British military by firearm Category:People executed by India by firearm Category:Timurid dynasty ","title":"Mirza Mughal"},{"id":"8137404","text":"The Autov√≠a A-76 is a proposed initial upgrade of the N-120, a highway in northern Spain.

Quarterback Tracy Ham drove Edmonton from their own 32 yard line to the Winnipeg 16. After a procedure penalty, Ham's pass was intercepted by Greg Battle at the 1 yard line and returned to the Edmonton 43. Bomber quarterback Tom Burgess led his team to the Edmonton 14 yard line, but could not score the touchdown, as his pass was nearly intercepted by Brett \\"The Toaster\\" Williams. Trevor Kennard kicked a 14-yard field goal. Edmonton's Blake Marshall fumbled on the Eskimo 45. The Bombers scored a touchdown on this drive, moving to the 11 where Burgess hit Lee Hull on an end-zone pattern. At the end of the quarter Winnipeg running back Robert Mimbs fumbled, giving Edmonton possession on their own 43 yard line. They were unable to benefit from this opportunity and scored a 56-yard single on Ray Macoritti's punt. Neither offence was able to mount a sustained drive until the end of the quarter, when Ham got the Eskimos to the Bomber 37 yard line. They had to settle for a Macoritti field goal on the last play of the half, making the halftime score 10-4. Early in the second half, Greg Battle made his second interception and returned it 34 yards for a touchdown. Edmonton's offence could not move the ball and had to punt. Burgess completed a 55-yard pass to Perry Tuttle who was tackled on the Edmonton 5. Two plays later Tuttle made a fingertip shoestring catch at the goal line for the touchdown. Edmonton's next series came to a halt when Eskimo receiver Craig Ellis fumbled after a pass reception and Ken Hailey recovered. The Bombers were unable to advance and punted. Edmonton punt returner Henry \\"The Gizmo\\" Williams was stripped of the ball at the Edmonton 18 yard line and Bombers' Tyrone Jones recovered. On the next play Burgess completed a pass to fullback Warren Hudson who dodged several tackles to score. Winnipeg were close to scoring again when Edmonton was called for pass interference at their four-yard line. Warren Hudson ran in the touchdown at the end of the quarter. Tracy Ham was able to get his team moving to start the fourth quarter, driving to the Winnipeg 20 yard line. His pass into the end zone was tipped by Less Browne but caught by Larry Willis for the touchdown. Later, Ham was sacked by James \\"Wild\\" West for a safety. Burgess put together another drive, including a pass to Ken Winey at the Edmonton 6, which resulted in a Trevor Kennerd field goal. On the next sequence Ham completed a 30-yard pass and run to Willis who then fumbled and Winnipeg safety Dave Bovell recovered. Danny McManus, coming off the bench, hit Rick House with a 56-yard pass and run for a touchdown.  Trivia  Winnipeg's 28 points in the third quarter is a Grey Cup record for points in one quarter. This was only the third time (and the most recent, as of 2017) a team scored 50 or more points in a Grey Cup Game, the others being the 11th Grey Cup and the 44th Grey Cup. Edmonton coach Joe Faragalli said, notwithstanding the lopsided score, \\"Never at one time did we feel that this was the end of the game. We were going to make a comeback\\". This was the last game broadcast by the CFL's league-run syndication broadcast service, the Canadian Football Network, which started in 1987 and was shut down after this game. All CFL playoff and Grey Cup games would be exclusively broadcast on CBC Television starting the next year, continuing until 2007, when TSN gained exclusive broadcast rights to all CFL games, including the Grey Cup. Until the 107th Grey Cup in 2019, this was Winnipeg's most recent major sports title (the Winnipeg Goldeyes 1994, 2012, 2016 and 2017 Championship wins notwithstanding). Following the Ottawa Redblacks' championship in 2016, Winnipeg held the second-longest championship drought in modern CFL history at 28 seasons. 1990 CFL Playoffs West Division * Semi-final (November 11 at Edmonton, Alberta) Edmonton Eskimos 43‚Äì27 Saskatchewan Roughriders * Final (November 18 at Calgary, Alberta) Edmonton Eskimos 43‚Äì23 Calgary Stampeders East Division * Semi-final (November 11 at Toronto, Ontario) Toronto Argonauts 34‚Äì25 Ottawa Rough Riders * Final (November 18 at Winnipeg, Manitoba) Winnipeg Blue Bombers 20‚Äì17 Toronto Argonauts References  CFL Video, \\"Bombers' Blitz; CFL '90\\" Grey Cup Category:Grey Cup Category:Grey Cups hosted in Vancouver Category:1990 in British Columbia Category:Winnipeg Blue Bombers Category:Edmonton Eskimos Category:1990s in Vancouver Category:1990 in Canadian television Category:November 1990 sports events in Canada ","title":"78th Grey Cup"},{"id":"8137469","title":"Laufen District"},{"id":"8137481","text":"Asociaci√≥n Atl√©tica Estudiantes (usually known as Estudiantes de R√≠o Cuarto) is a sports club located in the city of R√≠o Cuarto, C√≥rdoba Province (Argentina).

Description Acer mandshuricum is a slender deciduous tree that reaches a height of up to 30 meters tall but is usually smaller.Xu, T.-z., Chen, Y., de Jong, P. C., & Oterdoom, H. J. Flora of China: Aceraceae (draft) van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia. It is a trifoliate maple related to such other species as three-flower maple (Acer triflorum) and paperbark maple (Acer griseum) but has smooth, gray bark dissimilar to the exfoliating bark of either. The leaves have a 7‚Äì10 cm petiole and three leaflets; the leaflets are short-stalked, oblong, 5‚Äì10 cm (2-4 inches) long and 1.5‚Äì3 cm broad, with serrated margins, the central leaflet the same size as or slightly larger than the two side leaflets. It leafs out early in the spring and the deep green leaves are contrast with its red petioles throughout the growing season. The flowers are yellowish-green, produced in corymbs of three to five together. The hard, horizontally-spreading samaras are 3-3.5 cm long and 1 cm broad.Bean, W. J. (1970). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles, 8th ed.  Cultivation  The species was first introduced to cultivation in 1904, when trees were planted at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in Britain. It has not proved very successful in cultivation in Britain, as its adaptation to a continental climate results in its early leafing and being damaged by late frosts in spring there; the largest recorded specimen is 8 metres tall (Tree Register of the British Isles). Although it is rarely seen in cultivation outside of arboreta, its narrow habit makes it suitable for small gardens and, like its relatives, it has spectacular fall colour that includes pink and orange tones. Best growth occurs in full sun to partial shade and in acid to neutral soil that is moist but well-drained.ONLA Plant Selection Committee . In the United States, mature specimens can be seen at Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts USA, including one 70-year-old specimen that has reached a size of approximately 13 m (40 ft) tall and 8 m (25 ft) wide.

Based on the 1981 novel of the same name by James Clavell, it features a large cast headlined by Pierce Brosnan as business tycoon Ian Dunross and was directed by Gary Nelson. Due to time restrictions, several of the many subplots from the book were removed. This was NBC's second miniseries adaptation of a Clavell novel, the first being 1980's highly successful Sh≈çgun. Both take place in the same fictional universe with Noble House featuring connections to Sh≈çgun and another Clavell work, Tai-Pan. For the miniseries, the timeframe of the novel was changed; Clavell's original novel takes place in the early 1960s, but the miniseries was updated to the 1980s. The building prominently displayed and used as Struan's is Jardine House. Synopsis Despite its impressive history and its reputation, the international trading company Struan's (the Noble House of the title) is in trouble. Overextended by the previous management, new Tai-Pan Ian Dunross (Pierce Brosnan) has had to issue public stock to improve the company's financial standing. Even this, however, has not given him the capital he needs. As a result, he is courting a private investor, American billionaire Linc Bartlett (Ben Masters). Bartlett decides secretly to back Dunross' arch enemy, Quillian Gornt (John Rhys-Davies), who will stop at nothing to destroy Struan's. When Dunross realises that Gornt is suddenly strong enough to ruin the Noble House, he must urgently forge new alliances or reshape ancient ones. He romances Bartlett's second-in-command, Casey Tcholok (Deborah Raffin). A subplot involves the missing half of an ancient coin. Whoever possesses it may ask any favor of the Tai-Pan. Half the coin is acquired by crime lord Four Finger Wu (Khigh Dhiegh), who aims to ask the Tai- Pan to help him smuggle opium. Wu and Bartlett are killed in a natural disaster. Wu's son redeems his father's stolen half-coin for a highly paid position in Noble House. Dunross gains access to the Bank of China, whose funding allows him to foil Gornt's scheme. Tcholok becomes head of Bartlett's company, allying the organization with Struan's. Differences from the novel Many of the subplots from the novel were left out of the miniseries to simplify the plot. A significant story arc involving KGB espionage in Hong Kong was deleted as the mini-series aired near the close of the Cold War. A further story line involving visiting UK Members of Parliament was removed, as was another involving a former prisoner of war, which provided a link to Clavell's novel King Rat'. In the miniseries, Tip Tok-Toh was changed from a mysterious, unofficial contact of the Bank of China to a good friend of Dunross who often appeared at parties. Several subplots involving Ian Dunross' family were removed. In the novel, Dunross is married and his wife, eldest daughter, sister, and two brothers-in-law (his wife's brother and his sister's husband) are involved in significant subplots while his youngest daughter, son and a cousin also appear in minor roles. In the mini-series, Dunross is a widower and no family members are mentioned. The bank runs depicted in the mini-series are significantly smaller in scope and significance than those depicted in the novel. Finally, in the novel, Struan's is bailed out by the fictional First Central Bank of New York. Although First Central and its vice- president, Dave Murtagh, a significant character in the novel, are mentioned in the mini-series, they play no role in bailing out the Noble House. The Bank of China assumes this role in return for Dunross arranging the release of captured Chinese police mole, Brian Kwok. The romance between Dunross and Tcholok is not present in the book as in the novel Dunross is a much older man than the one portrayed by Brosnan.

This was his first role after Remington Steele. Clavell said of the adaptation: Clavell said that production of the mini series was rushed. NBC did not offer to make it until September 1986, and wanted it within 14 months. He said: The budget was $20 million. Filming took place in Hong Kong and North Carolina. Reception Broadcast in competition with the 1988 Winter Olympics on ABC, the ratings for the program were generally disappointing. The first installment was the 16th most watched prime time television show of the week (27 rating). The last three installments fell into the next week of Nielsen ratings, and the second installment was 22nd (15.9 rating/24 percent audience share), overshadowed by Olympics coverage.Carmody, John (24 February 1988).

It takes place the fourth Monday in November.  History  Historical research indicates that the Zibelem√§rit originated in the 1850s with marmettes, farmer's wives from around Murten, coming to Bern at around St. Martin's Day to sell their produce; however, a persistent local legend holds that the Zibelem√§rit is a much older festivity. According to this legend, the Bernese awarded the people from the nearby city of Fribourg the right to sell onions in the city in reward for their aid after a fire destroyed much of Bern in 1405.  Description  As the name indicates, it is mainly onions that are sold on the Zibelem√§rit. Bernese farmers, who are proud of their decorative onion tresses and onion wreaths, also sell other onion products on the market, including Zwiebelkuchen (onion pie), onion soup and onion sausages. Decorative chains of sugar onions are also popular with children. The Zibelem√§rit opens very early in the day, at around 03:00 to 04:00. Later in the morning, the narrow alleys are usually packed tight with people, which is what the Bernese call the Gstungg.

The Augusta family, named after 254 Augusta, can be considered a sub-family of the Flora-complex. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.6 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,189 days; semi-major axis of 2.2 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Heidelberg Observatory in November 1916. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at the Yerkes Observatory in November 1932, or more than 7 years after its official discovery observation at Simeiz.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Irish telescope maker Sir Howard Grubb (1844‚Äì1931), whose company Grubb Parson and Co., Newcastle upon Tyne, England, manufactured the 40-inch reflector of the discovering Simeiz Observatory. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  Grubba is a common, stony S-type asteroid in both the Tholen and SMASS classification, which also agrees with the overall spectral type for the Florian asteroids.  Rotation period  In August 2013, a rotational lightcurve of Grubba was obtained from photometric observations by Andrea Ferrero at the Bigmuskie Observatory in Italy. Lightcurve analysis gave a longer than average rotation period of 46.30 hours with a brightness variation of 0.24 magnitude (). The result supersedes observations by French amateur astronomers Laurent Bernasconi (>12 hours) and Ren√© Roy (>20 hours), as well as by astronomers at the University of Arizona (18 hours) in Tucson, United States (). While not being a slow rotator, its period is significantly longer than that for most asteroids, which rotate every 2 to 20 hours once around their axis.  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Grubba measures between 10.920 and 13.03 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.171 and 0.2416. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts an albedo of 0.133, and derives a diameter of 14.64 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.98.

Biography  Born in Berlin in 1926, H√∂hne was educated there until he was called to fight during the last months of the Second World War. After the war, he studied journalism in Munich and went on to work for various newspapers as a freelance reporter. In 1955, he was hired by the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, where he joined the foreign staff of the magazine and eventually took charge of the Anglo-American department. Heinz's efforts covered Nazi history. His work is entitled The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS. (Der Orden unter dem Totenkopf: Die Geschichte der SS). This work first appeared in 1967, and other works subsequently followed, such as his 1971 study of the Soviet Union's spy network entitled Codeword: Direktor. In 1976, H√∂hne went on to write Canaris, an interpretation of Hitler's spymaster, who was in charge of the Abwehr.Heinz H√∂hne, The Order of the Death's Head (New York: Penguin Books, 1971).

Another work from H√∂hne is Krieg im Dunkeln (1985), which examines the centuries-old relationship between Russian and German intelligence. After his retirement, Heinz H√∂hne worked on a history of the Third Reich, the first volume of which, Gebt mir vier Jahre Zeit, appeared in 1996. His book The General Was a Spy: The Truth about General Gehlen and his spy ring received a less than glowing review from a CIA analyst.

Oxford University Press, 1993. Travers gives Poppins the accent and vocabulary of a real London nanny: cockney base notes overlaid with a strangled gentility.\\"What Saving Mr Banks tells us about the original Mary Poppins\\". The Guardian. Retrieved 17 May 2017. Julie Andrews, who played the character in the 1964 film adaptation, won the Academy Award for Best Actress. British film magazine Empire included Poppins (as played by Andrews) in their 2011 list of 100 greatest movie characters. Acclaimed for her performance as Poppins in the 2018 sequel, Emily Blunt received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy. Description of character A quintessential English nanny, Mary Poppins is a slightly stern but caring woman, who uses magic and self-control to take care of the Banks children. She is usually identifiable by her sensible hat and parrot umbrella, which she brings with her wherever she goes on outings, she also has the power to teleport to a place she wants. She is kind towards the children, but can be firm when needed. She is \\"practically perfect in every way\\". In the film version, she is a young woman, with an air of grace and elegance about her. Author P. L. Travers was very firm about Mary Poppins' appearance in the novel's illustrations, working closely with illustrator Mary Shepard to create an image of the character. Eventually they based Mary Poppins' appearance on that of a Dutch doll: tall and bony, with short black hair, large blue eyes, a snub nose, and a prim, pursed mouth. Travers originally objected to the casting of Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, claiming that Andrews was too attractive for the role; however, upon meeting Andrews in person for the first time, Travers allegedly examined the actress for a few moments before conceding, \\"Well, you've the nose for it.\\"Lawson, Valerie. \\"The Americanization of Mary\\". Mary Poppins, She Wrote: The Life of P. L. Travers. 1st ed. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2006. 216. Print. Books Mary Poppins as imagined by the illustrator of the book series, Mary Shepard, for the first volume Mary Poppins in Travers' books is strict and no-nonsense, asserting her unusual brand of discipline over the four (later five) Banks children in her charge. Mary is very vain and is always admiring herself in the mirror and other reflections. She constantly lectures the children for their \\"bad\\" behaviour, especially when they point out the magical things she does, for she constantly denies she is anything but a prim and proper lady. Mary only shows her gentler side around her friends, among them the Matchman (Bert), Mrs. Corry, and Nellie-Rubina. Mary has many relatives, each with their own supernatural or otherwise eccentric nature, at least one of whom appears in each book. She appears to be well known to every sort of magical entity (sorcerers, talking animals, etc.) that appear in the books, some of whom love her dearly and others who are quite terrified of her. Some characters, most notably an impudent jackdaw seen in the first two books, call her \\"The Great Exception\\", meaning, among other things, that she is the only human being who has retained the magical secrets infants possess (such as the power to communicate with animals) until they grow up and forget about them. Some of her adventures occur in London, others in strange realms, which later writers might identify as magical dimensions. In literary terms, she might be described as a character who exists in every conceivable fantasy genre (gothic, mythic, urban, etc.) at once: there are many strange people and phenomena in the world, but only Mary Poppins is familiar with them all. In the first book, Poppins arrives at Number Seventeen Cherry Tree Lane, London, home of the Banks family, with her travelling carpet bag, having been blown in by the east wind. She departs when she opens her umbrella, and the west wind carries her away. Films Mary Poppins in the Disney film, as portrayed by Julie Andrews, is also fairly stern but at the same time more gentle, cheerful, and nurturing of the two Banks children, of whom she is in charge. Mary also has a friendship with Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a jack-of-all-trades, who is quite at home with Mary's brand of magic. She also is less vain and selfish (although there are a couple of references to her vanity when she replaces a dingy wall mirror with a more elegant one and sings a duet with her reflection), and far more sympathetic towards the two children than the nanny in the original stories. Emily Blunt portrayed Mary Poppins in the sequel Mary Poppins Returns. Stage musical In both the West End and Broadway versions of the stage musical, the Mary Poppins character is more deliberately mysterious than in the movie version. She is slightly stricter with the children (who are also naughtier than their book and movie counterparts), but only because she wants them to become the best they can be. Mary in the stage version is also more aware of Bert's feelings towards her. Development Mary Poppins first appeared in the short story 'Mary Poppins and the Match Man' in 1926 and in several early bits and pieces of the first novel. P. L. Travers later changed the story of the character's origins, stating that it appeared fully formed in her mind in 1934.

Additions Neil Gaiman's short story \\"The Problem of Susan\\" mentions a work published after P. L. Travers's death, Mary Poppins Brings in the Dawn, in which Mary Poppins was Jesus's nanny.\\"Saving Mary Poppins\\". Salon. Retrieved 27 February 2018 Mary Poppins appears in Alan Moore's third League of Extraordinary Gentlemen graphic novel, Black Dossier, when it returns to Margaret Cavendish's Blazing World. She later reappears in Century: 2009 and defeats the Antichrist created by Oliver Haddo. In this appearance, she and other characters hint that she may be a personification of God. In a sequence celebrating British children's literature during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games, a group of over thirty Mary Poppinses with umbrellas descended en masse to fight and defeat the nightmares (the villains Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil, and Lord Voldemort) haunting children's dreams. The sequence is called \\"Second to the right and straight on till morning\\". Terry Pratchett's Susan Sto Helit character parodies Mary Poppins in various ways, most explicitly in the novel Hogfather. In The Simpsons season 8 episode \\"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious\\", Marge hires a new housekeeper for the family named Shary Bobbins (voiced by Maggie Roswell), who, though she attempts to help the Simpsons become better people, is ultimately driven to alcoholism. Andy Weir's Cheshire Crossing depicts Miss Mary Poppins in 1910, prior to her employment to the Banks family, as she works as a tutor for Dr. Ernest Rutherford of Cheshire Crossing and is put in charge of Alice Liddell and Wendy Darling alongside her former student Dorothy Gale. Upon travelling to the land of Oz, Poppins is identified as a witch by the Wicked Witch of the West and melted with a bucket of water, before being reformed by Rutherford with a teaspoon of table sugar. In the 2017 physical graphic novel version of Cheshire Crossing, Poppins is renamed Gwendolyn Poole due to restrictions from P. L. Travers' estate, although she retains the Poppins name in the Tapas webcomic version. In the audio play adaptation, Poppins (as Poole) is voiced by Rebecca Soler. Natalie Schafer (as Lovey Howell) plays a Mary Poppins-like character named Mary Poppedin in a dream sequence of the Gilligan's Island episode \\"And Then There Were None\\". In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Star-Lord compares Yondu to Mary Poppins at the climax, leading to him (who does not know the character) proudly proclaiming \\"I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!\\" as he saves Star-Lord from dying in the vacuum of space.

She began as a feminist painter in New York City but is best known for her connection with the NEA Four, with whom she was denied funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, and for her work with the Women's One World Cafe. Her plays explore sexuality, body images and the female mind. She is the recipient of several awards including the Lambda Book Award and an Obie Award. She is a professor of art and design as well as theater and drama at the University of Michigan School of Art & Design.  Biography  Born in Saginaw, Michigan, Hughes graduated from Kalamazoo College in 1977 and moved to New York City two years later to become a feminist painter. She worked as a waitress to support herself but felt unfulfilled, later writing: \\"Why had I moved to New York City to live in an even crummier apartment and do the same things that I was doing in Kalamazoo?\\" She saw a poster promoting a \\"Double X-rated Christmas party\\" to be held in the basement of a Catholic church. There she found lesbian women stripping, kissing booths, and a highly sexual atmosphere. She eagerly attended many such parties, became involved with the group and began doing theater with them because \\"that's what they were doing\\". Hughes' first performance at the Women's One World Cafe (Wow Cafe) in the early 1980s was a piece called \\"My Life as a Glamour Don't\\", about various fashion mistakes. She followed this up with \\"Shrimp in a Basket\\" and then her breakthrough Well of Horniness (1983). At the WOW Cafe, Hughes felt that she was able to \\"tell the stories she so desperately wanted to be told as a child.\\" Hughes wrote, directed and performed in Dress Suits to Hire (1987).Holly Hughes: Polymorphous Perversity and the Lesbian Scientist, interview with Rebecca Schneider, TDR, Vol. 33, No. 1 (Spring, 1989), pp. 171‚Äì83 Critic Stephen Holden commented, in reviewing the play, \\"While Ms. Hughes's more poetic writing recalls Sam Shepard, the campy B-movie side of her sensibility shows her to be equally in tune with John Waters's movies and Charles Busch's drag extravaganzas.\\" Focusing on the subjects of sexuality, masturbation and Jesus, her plays usually explore issues that she confronted as a young woman in college. In 1990 Hughes earned national attention as one of the so-called NEA Four, artists whose funding from the National Endowment for the Arts (\\"NEA\\") was vetoed. In 1996, Hughes released perhaps her most famous and influential performances: Clit Notes. In this piece, Hughes performs several roles: herself at different ages, her mother, and various lovers that she has had. Hughes uses her writing to explore herself and to understand the events that have shaped her life, often using her writing to escape from elements that she perceives as repressive. In 1998, Hughes co- edited an anthology of queer solo performance with David Roman called O Solo Homo:The New Queer Performance, which included her own Clit Notes. A review by Don Shewey in The Advocate noted the cultural and sexual diversity of contributors. In February 2017 Hughes organized a D.I.Y. style cabaret-style series of performance events protesting newly elected Donald Trump's presidency entitled \\"Not My President's Day.\\" These events which were organized by participants in over sixty cities including Ann Arbor, Brno, Czech Republic, Chicago, Brooklyn, Gateshead, United Kingdom, and San Jose raised funds for organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the A.C.L.U. She \\"worked with artists across the globe to build a loose network of over 35 Presidents Day events spanning the U.S., Britain and Italy. Most of the events used some variant on the names \\"Not My President's Day\\" or \\"Bad and Nasty\\" (derived from President Trump's reference to \\"bad hombres\\" and his description of Hillary Clinton as a \\"nasty woman\\" during the presidential debates).\\" Hughes works as a professor at the University of Michigan School of Art & Design. In 2010, she received a Guggenheim Fellowship.

The story deals with one member of the superpowered team Youngblood found murdered and the subsequent trial of one of her teammates for the crime. Mark Thompson of Checker Publishing Group perceives Judgment Day in an introduction for the trade paperback as a spiritual followup to Moore's earlier work Watchmen for DC Comics, in that \\"if superheroes can commit murder, they can certainly be charged for the crime. And that raises the question: what happens during the trial?\\". The main narrative is accompanied by short interludes featuring various characters throughout the history of the Awesome Comics universe, most of which act as analogues for famous literary characters (Sir Edward Conqueror for George Edward Challenger, Bram the Bezerk for Conan the Barbarian, Zantar for Tarzan, etc.). Moore would fully utilize the concept of a shared universe of literary characters in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with Kevin O'Neill and elements of his treatment of Glory were carried over into his America's Best Comics series Promethea. The series includes satire on the darkening of the superhero comics industry in the late 1980s to early 1990s, with allusions to Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (Alan Moore has made no secret of his dislike for Miller's work). Like his work on Supreme, Alan Moore used Judgment Day to reject the violent, deconstructive clich√©s of 1990s comics inadvertently caused by his own work on Watchmen, Batman: The Killing Joke and Saga of the Swamp Thing and uphold the values of classic superhero comics. The series deals with a metacommentary of the notion of retcons to super-hero histories as Alan Moore himself creates a new backstory for the characters of Awesome Comics, to replace the shared universe they left when Rob Liefeld left Image several years earlier. Plot In 1997, Mick Tombs/Knightsabre returns to Youngblood H.Q., drunk and depressed. He intends to make sexual propositions to Leeana Creel/Riptide at her quarters, but passes out. The next morning, members of Youngblood find Riptide's body, beaten to death in her room, and Knightsabre appears to be the only logical suspect, though he has no memory of it and swears he's innocent. Afraid of media scrutiny over Riptide's suspected murder, Shaft, Badrock and Vogue consult Savage Dragon and Supreme for help, and are told that Knightsabre's trial will take place on Supreme's floating citadel. Toby King is hired as defense for Knightsabre. During the lengthy trial, after analyzing the memory banks of cybernetic Youngblood member Diehard, King proposes that a mythical book, which Riptide possessed months before her death, was responsible for the events, piecing together many statements about the lengthy history of the book, which was created by Hermes, the god associated with language, who gave it to Glory's mother, who subsequently buried it in Earth during its creation. The book alters reality when somebody writes upon it, and it has been acquired by many powerful figures over centuries, including the creature who would become Youngblood's Troll and puritan immortal serial killer Deliverance Drue. Drue was defeated when Wild West-era superhero Kid Thunder literally crossed Drue out of existence, with Drue swearing a curse on Thunder's descendants. During a recess, Mr. Graves, administrator for Youngblood, reveals that Knightsabre is his son and that he is disbanding Youngblood due to the media circulation regarding the trial. King reveals in the trial that Leanna Creel was the daughter of 1950s superhero Storybook Smith (a descendant of Deliverance Drue) who used the magic book to great lengths to fight crime and gain fame, before the book's robbery and Smith's disappearance. One of Supreme's robot clones enters the trial, having found the book in the home of Marcus Langston/Sentinel, the founder and leader of Team Youngblood. The book eventually came into the hands of Langston after its theft from Storybook Smith, and Langston used it to refashion his life so he became Sentinel and superheroes subsequently became more violent and morally questionable. Prior to her death, Riptide recognised the book and stole it from Sentinel during a Youngblood barbecue at his home. Sentinel deduced that Riptide had stolen it and went to her quarters to retrieve it, killing her during a fight and manipulating the evidence to make Knightsabre look guilty When this is revealed to the court, Sentinel reacts violently, attempting to retrieve the book, but it falls off the citadel and is lost. Sentinel is imprisoned for murdering Riptide and it is learned that he is a descendant of Kid Thunder, whose kin Deliverance Drue swore a curse against before his defeat. As Youngblood disbands, the Allied Supermen of America (an analogue for the Justice League of America) are inspired by the event to reform, as the magical book finds itself in the hands of a homeless young woman.

Born in Woodstock, Oxfordshire Freer was a newspaper reporter who emigrated to Manitoba, Canada in 1888 from Bristol and became a farmer, settling south of Winnipeg, in the Brandon Hills district. Less than two years after the Lumi√®re Brothers exhibited the first film in France, Freer became the first Canadian filmmaker. He made films about the Canadian prairies, especially themes of farming and railways, which were shown as early as 1897. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company noticed Freer's films and began to tour them throughout the United Kingdom in an effort to promote immigration to Canada. Ten Years in Manitoba was shown through the British Isles in 1898. The tour was so successful that a second tour of Freer's films took place in 1902. The second tour was sponsored by Sir Clifford Sifton, Canadian Minister of the Interior, who was eager to promote immigration to the Canadian west, especially those from English speaking countries. The second trip was not as successful a recruiting device because people had heard that Freer had downplayed Manitoba's mosquito problem and cold winters. This ended his film career and he later worked for the Winnipeg Free Press and died in Winnipeg in 1933.

Born in London, England, he moved to Ibiza in the 1980s, following employment there in the tourism sector. His life in Ibiza was the inspiration for his literary work. Life Ibiza Butts first visited Ibiza on holiday in 1983. His first job there was as a holiday rep in 1986. He managed the Gala Nights open-air club, now commonly known as The Zoo Project, before opening his first business, the Plastik record shop in San Antonio West End. The business evolved into the Plastik Party Bar and Club, now situated on Avenue Doctor Fleming in San Antonio. Published works * Is Harry on the Boat (1997) Butts founded Tuesday Morning Publishing to publish his own novel Is Harry On the Boat? in 1997, and sold 20,000 copies from his garage. It was then taken on by Orion Publishing in 2000, with a second edition in 2001. The book went on to make six-figure sales and be developed as a film and television series. *Is Harry Still on the Boat (2003) This sequel to Is Harry on the Boat was published by Orion in 2003. *A Bus Could Run You Over (2004) Butts's third novel, drew upon his experiences working as a holiday rep in Ibiza.

Television and film Colin then changed his focus to script-writing, being in part mentored by Paul Abbott and beginning by writing six episodes for the final series of Sky One's football-based drama: Dream Team. His first book, Is Harry on the Boat, was adapted for film with Danny Dyer in his first lead role. The project was facilitated by the introduction of then 15-year-old Lily Allen, who was working for Butts at his Plastik venue in Ibiza. Allen read the book and showed it to her mother, the film producer Alison Owen of Ruby Films. After the film release, Owen developed a TV series from the book, through her Rapido TV company. This was first screened on Sky One in 2002/3. White Island By 2011, Colin had completed a screenplay based upon his third novel, A Bus Could Run you Over. The script was taken up by Fulwell 73 Productions and released as the film White Island in 2016. Filming took place in both the UK and Ibiza, and the film was made for a reported ¬£1,500,000 budget.

It is a deciduous tree that reaches a height of about but is usually smaller.Xu, T.-z., Chen, Y., de Jong, P. C., & Oterdoom, H. J. Flora of China: Aceraceae (draft) It is a trifoliate maple related to such other species as Manchurian Maple (Acer mandshuricum) and Paperbark Maple (Acer griseum). It has yellowish-brown exfoliating bark that peels in woody scales rather than papery pieces like Acer griseum. The leaves have a petiole and three leaflets; the leaflets are long and broad, with serrated margins, the central leaflet the same size as or slightly larger than the two side leaflets. The flowers are yellow, produced in small corymbs of three small flowers each, hence the name. The samaras are long and 1.3‚Äì2 cm broad, hairy, the nutlet with a woody shell. Even more than its relatives, three-flower maple has spectacular fall colour that may include brilliant orange, scarlet, purple and gold. It is one of the few trees to develop good fall colour in shade. Cultivation The species was first introduced to cultivation in 1923. Although common in maple collections, it is rarely seen in cultivation outside of arboreta. It grows at a slow to moderate rate and prefers moist, well drained soil; growth is often shrub-like in cultivation. It is relatively tolerant of drought and clay compared to its close relatives. It does not tolerate wet or over-compacted soil. Propagation is similar to that required for Acer griseum and the number of viable seeds is likewise very small. In Great Britain, the largest specimens are up to tall, and trunk diameter (Tree Register of the British Isles). It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

SR 29 was originally designated on a path from Jeffersonville to Irwinton and Milledgeville before being shifted to its current path. It was then extended to its southern terminus. Route description SR 29 begins at an intersection with US 1/SR 4 in the unincorporated community of South Thompson, which is about south-southeast of the central part of Vidalia in Toombs County. At its southern terminus, it is concurrent with SR 15, which is concurrent with US 1/SR 4 south of this point. SR 15/SR 29 head northwest and curve to the north-northwest and enter Vidalia. In town, they curve to the northeast and intersect US 280/SR 30\\\\. The four highways travel concurrent to the northwest, intersect SR 130, and then curve to the west-southwest. Then, they enter Montgomery County right before leaving town. They travel north of Rocky Creek Golf Club and enter Higgston, where they meet the northern terminus of SR 135\\\\.

At this time, an unnumbered road was established on the current path of SR 29 from Dublin north-northwest to Irwinton. By the end of September 1921, the portion from Jeffersonville to Irwinton was shifted eastward onto the previously unnumbered road. In January 1932, the highway was extended east-northeast on US 80/SR 15/SR 26 to North Dublin and then southeast to US 1/SR 4 in South Thompson. About five years later, the path of SR 29 in the Vidalia area was slightly shifted westward, onto a concurrency with US 280/SR 30 from Vidalia to Higgston. In 1942, the entire length of SR 29 had a \\"completed hard surface\\". Between January 1945 and November 1946, US 319 was designated on the path of SR 29 from North Dublin and Dublin. Between February 1948 and April 1949, US 441 was designated on it from Dublin to Milledgeville. Between July 1957 and June 1960, the path of SR 15 was shifted eastward, off of the North Dublin‚ÄìDublin segment, to travel concurrently with SR 29 from South Thompson to Soperton. Its former path, on SR 29, was redesignated as SR 31. Between June 1963 and January 1966, US 441/SR 29 was indicated to enter Milledgeville on Wayne Street. SR 29 ended at the intersection with SR 22/SR 24 (Hancock Street). US 441 turned left and continued to the west-southwest on SR 22/SR 24. In 1971, the path of SR 29 in Milledgeville was shifted west a few blocks, off of US 441 (Wayne Street north of Franklin Street) and onto Franklin Street west-southwest to Clarke Street and then north-northwest on Clarke Street to US 441 and the northern terminus of SR 49. In 1985, the path of US 441 in Milledgeville, on Wayne Street north of Franklin Street, and on Hancock Street, was shifted southwestward, onto SR 29 (Franklin and Clarke streets). In 1989, the path of US 441/SR 29 in Milledgeville was shifted westward, onto a bypass of the city. The former path of SR 29 was redesignated as US 441 Bus. and a northern extension of SR 243.

History of Canadian nationality law thumb|200px|leftCome to Stay, printed in 1880 in the Canadian Illustrated News, refers to immigration to the \\"Dominion\\". In 1828, during the Great Migration of Canada, Britain passed the Act to Regulate the Carrying of Passengers in Merchant Vessels, the country's first legislative recognition of its responsibility over the safety and well-being of immigrants leaving the British Isles. The Act limited the number of passengers who could be carried on a ship regulated the amount of space allocated to them; and required that passengers be supplied with adequate sustenance on the voyage. The 1828 Act is now recognized as the foundation of British colonial emigration legislation.\\"Right of Passage.\\" Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience. Library and Archives Canada. 2006. Canadian citizenship was originally created under the Immigration Act, 1910, to designate those British subjects who were domiciled in Canada, while all other British subjects required permission to land. A separate status of 'Canadian national' was created under the Canadian Nationals Act, 1921, which defined such British subjects as being Canadian citizens, as well as their wives and children (fathered by such citizens) who had not yet landed in Canada. Following the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, the monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution. As result, Canadians‚Äîjust as all others living among the Commonwealth realms‚Äîwere known as subjects of the Crown, while the term \\"British subject\\" would continue to be used in legal documents. Canada was the second nation among what was then the British Commonwealth to establish its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act, 1946, taking effect on 1 January 1947. To acquire Canadian citizenship from then forward, one would generally have to either be a British subject on or before the Act took effect; an 'Indian' or 'Eskimo'; or had to have been admitted to Canada as landed immigrants before the Act took effect. A British subject at that time was anyone from the UK or its colonies (Commonwealth countries). Acquisition and loss of British subject status before 1947 was determined by United Kingdom law (see History of British nationality law). On February 15, 1977, Canada removed restrictions on dual citizenship. Many of the provisions to acquire or lose Canadian citizenship that existed under the 1946 legislation were repealed. Canadian citizens are in general no longer subject to involuntary loss of citizenship, barring revocation on the grounds of immigration fraud or criminality. The term \\"Canadians of convenience\\" was popularized by Canadian politician Garth Turner in 2006 in conjunction with the evacuation of Canadian citizens from Lebanon during the 2006 Israel‚ÄìLebanon conflict. It refers to people with multiple citizenship who immigrated to Canada, met the residency requirement to obtain citizenship, obtained Canadian citizenship, and moved back to their original home country while maintaining their Canadian citizenship, with those who support the term claiming they do so as a safety net. Regional history Atlantic Region L'Anse aux Meadows on the island of Newfoundland, site of a Norsemen colony. There are a number of reports of contact made before Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents. The case of Viking contact is supported by the remains of a Viking settlement in L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, although there is no direct proof this was the place Icelandic Norseman Leifur Eir√≠ksson referred to as Vinland around the year 1000. The presence of Basque cod fishermen and whalers, just a few years after Columbus, has also been cited, with at least nine fishing outposts having been established on Labrador and Newfoundland. The largest of these settlements was the Red Bay station, with an estimated 900 people. Basque whalers may have begun fishing the Grand Banks as early as the 15th century. The next European explorer acknowledged as landing in what is now Canada was John Cabot, who landed somewhere on the coast of North America (probably Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island) in 1497 and claimed it for King Henry VII of England. Portuguese and Spanish explorers also visited Canada, but it was the French who first began to explore further inland and set up colonies, beginning with Jacques Cartier in 1534. Under Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons, the first French settlement was made in 1604 in the region of New France known as Acadie on Isle Sainte-Croix (which now belongs to Maine) in the Bay of Fundy. That winter was particularly long and harsh and about half of the settlers that had accompanied Sieur de Mons died of scurvy. The following year they decided to move to a better sheltered area, establishing a new settlement at Port-Royal. In 1608, Samuel de Champlain, established a settlement at Donnacona; it would later grow to become Quebec City. The French claimed Canada as their own and 6,000 settlers arrived, settling along the St. Lawrence and in the Maritimes. Britain also had a presence in Newfoundland and, with the advent of settlements, claimed the south of Nova Scotia as well as the areas around the Hudson Bay. The first contact with the Europeans was disastrous for the first peoples. Explorers and traders brought European diseases, such as smallpox, which killed off entire villages. Relations varied between the settlers and the Natives. The French befriended the Huron peoples and entered into a mutually beneficial trading relationship with them. The Iroquois, however, became dedicated opponents of the French and warfare between the two was unrelenting, especially as the British armed the Iroquois in an effort to weaken the French. Quebec Map of New France made by Samuel de Champlain on 1612 After Samuel de Champlain's founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of New France. While the coastal communities were based upon the cod fishery, the economy of the interior revolved around beaver fur, which was popular in Europe. French voyageurs would travel into the hinterlands and trade with the natives. The voyageurs ranged throughout what is today Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba trading guns, gunpowder, textiles and other European manufacturing goods with the natives for furs. The fur trade encouraged only a small population, however, as minimal labour was required. Encouraging settlement was always difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1760 New France had a population of only some 70,000. New France had other problems besides low immigration. The French government had little interest or ability in supporting its colony and it was mostly left to its own devices. The economy was primitive and much of the population was involved in little more than subsistence agriculture. The colonists also engaged in a long-running series of wars with the Iroquois. Ontario √âtienne Br√ªl√© explored Ontario from 1610 to 1612. In 1615, Samuel de Champlain visited Lake Huron, after which French missionaries established outposts in the region.  Prairie provinces  York Factory In the 18th to 19th century, the only immigration western Canada or Rupert's Land saw was early French Canadian North West Company fur traders from eastern Canada, and the Scots, English Adventurers and Explorers representing the Hudson's Bay Company who arrived via Hudson Bay. Canada became a nation in 1867, Rupert's Land became absorbed into the North-West Territories. To encourage British Columbia to join the confederation, a transcontinental railway was proposed. The railway companies felt it was not feasible to lay track over land where there was no settlement. The fur trading era was declining; as the buffalo population disappeared, so too did the nomadic buffalo hunters, which presented a possibility to increase agricultural settlement. Agricultural possibilities were first expounded by Henry Youle Hind. The Dominion government with the guidance of Clifford Sifton, Minister of the Interior in charge of immigration, (1896-1905)Impressions: 250 Years of Printing in the Lives of Canadians , URL accessed 26 November 2006 enacted Canada's homesteading act, the Dominion Lands Act, in 1872. An extensive advertising campaign throughout western Europe and Scandinavia brought in a huge wave of immigrants to \\"The Last, Best West\\". (In 1763 Catherine the Great issues Manifesto inviting foreigners to settle in Russia,Impressions: The NDSU Libraries: Germans From Russia , URL accessed 26 November 2006 and in 1862 the United States enacted a Homestead Act inviting immigration to America.)Imp Homestead Act of 1862, URL accessed 26 November 2006 Ethnic or religious groups seeking asylum or independence no longer traveled to Russia or the United States where lands were taken or homestead acts were canceled. The Red River Colony population of Manitoba allowed it to become a province in 1870. In the 1880s less than 1000 non-Aboriginal people resided out west. The government's immigration policy was a huge success, the North-West Territories grew to a population of 56,446 in 1881 and almost doubled to 98,967 in 1891, and exponentially jumped to 211,649 by 1901.Home Page ‚Äì Town of Davidson, URL accessed 26 November 2006 Ethnic Bloc SettlementsSaskatchewan Gen Web Project ‚Äì SGW ‚Äì Saskatchewan Genealogy Roots, URL accessed 26 November 2006 dotted the prairies, as language groupings settled together on soil types of the Canadian western prairie similar to agricultural land of their homeland. In this way immigration was successful; new settlements could grow because of common communication and learned agricultural methods. Canada's CPR transcontinental railway was finished in 1885. Immigration briefly ceased to the West during the North West Rebellion of 1885. Various investors and companies were involved in the sale of railway (and some non railway) lands. Sifton himself may have been involved as an investor in some of these ventures.First Nation Land Surrenders on the Prairies 1896‚Äì1911 Peggy Martin-McGuire, Ch 2, Land and Colonization Companies, Indian Claims Commission, URL accessed January 11, 2007. Populations of Saskatchewan and Alberta were eligible for provincial status in 1905. Immigration continued to increase through to the roaring twenties. A mass exodus affected the prairies during the dirty thirties depression years and the prairies have never again regained the impetus of the immigration wave seen in the early 20th century.  British Columbia  Until the railway, immigration to British Columbia was either via sea, or ‚Äì once the gold rushes were under way ‚Äì via overland travel from California and other parts of the US, as there was no usable route westward beyond the Rockies, and travel on the Prairies and across the Canadian Shield was still water-borne. BC's very small early non-native population was dominantly French-Canadian and Metis fur-company employees, their British (largely Scottish) administrators and bosses, and a population of Kanakas (Hawaiians) in the company's employ, as well as members of various Iroquoian peoples, also in the service of the fur company. The non-local native population of the British Pacific was in the 150‚Äì300 range until the advent of the Fraser Gold Rush in 1857, when Victoria's population swelled to 30,000 in four weeks and towns of 10,000 and more appeared at hitherto-remote locations on the Mainland, at Yale, Port Douglas, and Lillooet (then called Cayoosh Flat). This wave of settlement was near-entirely from California, and was approximately one-third each American, Chinese and various Europeans and others; nearly all had been in California for many years, including the early Canadians and Maritimers who made the journey north to the new Gold Colony, as British Columbia was often called. One group of about 60, called the Overlanders of '62, did make the journey from Canada via Rupert's Land during the Cariboo Gold Rush, though they were the exception to the rule. An earlier attempt to move some of the settlers of the Selkirk Colony ended in disaster at Dalles des Morts, near present-day Revelstoke. Early immigration to British Columbia was from all nations, largely via California, and included Germans, Scandinavians, Maritimers, Australians, Poles, Italians, French, Belgians and others, as well as Chinese and Americans who were the largest groups to arrive in the years around the time of the founding of the Mainland Colony in 1858. Most of the early Americans left in the early 1860s because of the US Civil War as well as in pursuit of other gold rushes in Idaho, Colorado and Nevada, though Americans remained a major component in the settler population ever since. During the 1860s, in conjunction with the Cariboo Gold Rush and agitation to join Canada, more and more Canadians (including the Overlanders, who became influential) arrived and became a force in the local polity, which hitherto had been dominated by Britons favouring separate rule, and helped contribute towards the agenda for annexation with Canada. After the opening of the CPR, a new wave of immigration led not just to the creation of Vancouver and other newer urban settlements, but also to the settlement of numerous regions in the Interior, especially the Okanagan, Boundary, Shuswap, and Kootenays. A similar wave of settlement and development accompanied the opening of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (today the CNR) through the Central Interior, which was also the impetus for the creation of the city of Prince George and the port of Prince Rupert. Head tax and Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 The first immigrants from China to Canada came from California to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in British Columbia, beginning in 1858; immigrants directly from China did not arrive until 1859. The Chinese were a significant part of nearly all the British Columbia gold rushes and most towns in BC had large Chinese populations, often a third of the total or more. Chinese labourers were hired to help with the construction of the Cariboo Wagon Road and Alexandra Bridge as well as the Douglas Road and other routes. Chinese miners, merchants and ranchers enjoyed full rights to mineral tenure and land alienation and in some areas became the mainstay of the local economy for decades. Chinese, for instance, owned 60% of the land in the Lillooet Land District in the 1870s and 1880s and held the majority of working claims on the Fraser River and in other areas. The next wave of immigrants from China were labourers brought in to help build the C.P.R. transcontinental railway but many defected to the goldfields of the Cariboo and other mining districts. In the year the railway was completed the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 was enacted, and a head tax was levied to control the ongoing influx of labour, although immigration continued as corporate interests in BC preferred to hire the cheaper labour made available to them by Chinese labour contractors; Chinese labour was brought in by the Dunsmuir coal interests used to break the back of strikers at Cumberland in the Comox Valley, which then became one of BC's largest Chinatowns as white workers formerly resident there had been displaced by armed force. Sikhs aboard the Komagata Maru in Vancouver's Burrard Inlet, 1914 Indian immigration and Continuous Journey Regulation of 1908 The Canadian government's first attempt to restrict immigration from India was to pass an order-in-council on January 8, 1908, that prohibited immigration of persons who \\"in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior\\" did not \\"come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a continuous journey and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality.\\" In practice this applied only to ships that began their voyage in India, as the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in Japan or Hawaii. These regulations came at a time when Canada was accepting massive numbers of immigrants (over 400,000 in 1913 alone - a figure that remains unsurpassed to this day), almost all of whom came from Europe. Though Gurdit Singh, was apparently aware of regulations when he chartered the Komagata Maru in January 1914,Johnston, Hugh J.M., The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar. (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1979), p. 26 he continued with his purported goal of challenging these exclusion laws in order to have a better life. The Komagata Maru, a Japanese steamship that sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai, China; Yokohama, Japan; and then to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 1914, carried 376 passengers from Punjab, India. The passengers were not allowed to land in Canada and the ship was forced to return to India. The passengers consisted of 340 Sikhs, 24 Muslims, and 12 Hindus, all British subjects. This was one of several incidents in the early 20th century involving exclusion laws in Canada and the United States designed to keep out immigrants of Asian origin.  Early European settlements   Scandinavian colonists and settlement  Scandinavians were a strong contingent of the original arrivals from California and distinguished themselves in the establishment of the early timber industry and especially in the foundations of the commercial fishery. Semi-utopian and religious Scandinavian colonies arrived at certain places ‚Äì Cape Scott and Holberg, British Columbia and nearby areas for the Danes, Sointula and Websters Corners for the Finns, and Bella Coola and locations nearby, such as Tallheo. All originally socialist or Christian attempts at new societies, these wound up breaking up though the populations such as the Norwegians at Bella Coola continued on in the fishery, building and running canneries (of which Tallheo was one). German colonists and settlement German colonists, like the Scandinavians, were among the earliest to arrive from California and established themselves beyond mining in areas such as ranching and construction and specialized trades. Until World War I, Vancouver was a major centre of German investment and social life and German was commonly heard on the city's streets and bars. They remained the largest non- British group in the province until eclipsed in that capacity by the Chinese in the 1980s. Doukhobor settlement and communities The Doukhobor people were assisted in their immigration by Count Leo Tolstoy who admired them for their collectarian lifestyle and beliefs and ardent pacifism and freedom from materialism. Originally settled in Saskatchewan, and restive of the government's desire to send their children to public school and other matters, they migrated en masse to British Columbia to settle in the West Kootenay and Boundary regions.  Waves of migration   The Great Migration  The Great Migration of Canada (also known as the Great Migration from Britain) was a period of high immigration to Canada from 1815 to 1850, involving over 800,000 immigrants chiefly from the British Isles. Unlike the later 19th century/early 20th century when organized immigration schemes brought in much of the new immigrants to Canada, this period of immigration was demand driven based on the need for infrastructure labour in the burgeoning colonies, filling new rural settlements and poor conditions in some source places, such the Highland Clearances in Scotland and later, the Great Famine of Ireland. Though Europe was in an overall sense becoming richer through the Industrial Revolution, steep population growth made the relative number of jobs low, and overcrowded conditions forcing many to look to North America for economic success. Immigration to the West Attempts to form permanent settlement colonies west of the Great Lakes were beset by difficulty and isolation until the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the second of the two Riel Rebellions. Despite the railway making the region more accessible, there were fear that a tide of settlers from the United States might overrun British territory. In 1896, Minister of the Interior Clifford Sifton launched a program of settlement with offices and advertising in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. This began a major wave of railway-based immigration which created the farms, towns and cities of the Prairie provinces. Third wave (1890‚Äì1920) and fourth wave (1940s‚Äì1960s) The government promoted cheap wheat lands in the Prairies. 1898 The third wave of immigration to Canada coming mostly from continental Europe peaked prior to World War I, between 1911 and 1913 (over 400,000 in 1912), many from Eastern or Southern Europe. The fourth wave came from Europe after the Second World War, peaking at 282,000 in 1957. Many were from Italy and Portugal. Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia was an influential port for European immigration; it received 471,940 Italians between 1928 until it ceased operations in 1971, making Italians the third largest ethnic group to immigrate to Canada during that time period. Together, they made Canada a more multi-ethnic country with substantial non- British or non-French European elements. For example, Ukrainian Canadians accounted for the largest Ukrainian population outside Ukraine and Russia. The Church of England took up the role of introducing British values to farmers newly arrived on the prairies. In practice, they clung to their traditional religious affiliations.David Smith, Instilling British Values in the Prairie Provinces\\", Prairie Forum 6#2 (1981): pp. 129‚Äì41. Periods of low immigration have also occurred: international movement was very difficult during the world wars, and there was a lack of jobs \\"pulling\\" workers out of Canada during the Great Depression in Canada. Canadianization was a high priority for new arrivals lacking a British cultural background.Kent Fedorowich, \\"Restocking the British World: Empire Migration and Anglo-Canadian Relations, 1919‚Äì30,\\" Britain and the World (Aug 2016) 9#2 pp 236-269, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.3366/brw.2016.0239 open access Immigrants from Britain were given highest priority.Janice Cavell, \\"The Imperial Race and the Immigration Sieve: The Canadian Debate on Assisted British Migration and Empire Settlement, 1900‚Äì30\\", Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 34#3 (2006): pp. 345‚Äì67. There was no special effort to attract Francophone immigrants. In terms of economic opportunity, Canada was most attractive to farmers headed to the Prairies, who typically came from eastern and central Europe. Immigrants from Britain preferred urban life.Kurt Korneski, \\"Britishness, Canadianness, Class, and Race: Winnipeg and the British World, 1880s‚Äì1910s\\", Journal of Canadian Studies 41#2 (2007): pp. 161‚Äì84. Fifth wave (1970s‚Äìpresent) Fifth wave Canadian children celebrating Canada Day, Vancouver, 1 July 1999 Immigration since the 1970s has overwhelmingly been of visible minorities from the developing world. This was largely influenced in 1976 when the Immigration Act was revised and this continued to be official government policy. During the Mulroney government, immigration levels were increased. By the late 1980s, the fifth wave of immigration has maintained with slight fluctuations since (225,000‚Äì275,000 annually). Currently, most immigrants come from South Asia, China and the Caribbean and this trend is expected to continue. History of immigration legislations The following is the chronology of Canadian immigration and citizenship laws. *Naturalization Act (May 22, 1868 - December 22 31, 1946). All Canadians born inside and outside Canada, were subject to the crown or \\"British Subjects\\". *Canadian Citizenship Act (January 1, 1947). This act legitimized and acknowledged Canadian citizenship. *Citizenship Act (February 15, 1977). This act recognized dual citizenship and abolished \\"special treatment\\" to the British subjects. *Bill C-14: An Act to amend the Citizenship Act with clauses for Adopted Children (December 23, 2007). An act which provided that adopted children will automatically acquire Canadian citizenship without going through the application for permanent resident stage. *Bill C-37: An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (April 17, 2009). An act intended to limit the citizenship privilege to first generation only and gave the opportunity to Canadian citizens to re-acquire their citizenship, hence, repealing provisions from former legislation. *Bill C-24: Strengthening the Canadian Citizenship Act (Royal Assent: June 19, 2014; Came into force: June 11, 2015). \\"The Act contains a range of legislative amendments to further improve the citizenship program.\\" *Bill C-6: An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (Royal Assent: June 19, 2017; Came into force: October 11, 2017). This act will give \\"stateless\\" person an opportunity to be granted with Canadian citizenship which \\"statelessness\\" is considered as a legal ground for granting such privilege. This is only one of the many changes included in this new amendment of the Citizenship Act.

He was called \\"Harry\\" Pilsbry then, and developed an early fascination with the limited variety of mollusks he was able to find. He attended the University of Iowa, and received the Bachelor of Science degree there in 1882, but did not immediately find employment in his field of interest. Instead, Henry Pilsbry worked for publishing firms and newspapers for the next several years, but devoted most of his spare time to the study of mollusks. In 1887, he found employment in New York City as a proofreader, but soon met George Washington Tryon, the resident expert on mollusks at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and architect and author of the ongoing multi-volume Manual of Concology. This meeting led, within a few months, to Tryon's hiring Pilsbry as an assistant. He was, no doubt, impressed by the young man's talents as a proofreader, considerable expertise in technical illustration, and especially by his undeniable enthusiasm for the study of mollusks and substantial knowledge of the subject. Less than three months after Pilsbry began his new job, George Tryon died and his new assistant, only 25 years old, perhaps to the surprise of some, inherited the titles of \\"Conservator of the Conchology Section\\" and \\"Editor\\" of the Manual of Conchology. Henry Augustus Pilsbry between 1900-1910. Pilsbry soon proved capable of prodigious efforts, and his scientific output was remarkable. During the next five years he produced hundreds of detailed pages of the Manual of Conchology, preparing many of the plates himself, and founded The Nautilus, an influential journal of malacology which has survived into the 21st century. He also married during this period, to Adeline Avery. His college, the University of Iowa, honored him with a Doctor of Science degree in 1899 (and he later received two other honorary doctorates: University of Pennsylvania, 1940, and Temple University, 1941). In 1929 he participated in the Pinchot South Sea Expedition. Pilsbry was the first president of the American Malacological Union (Society) founded in 1931. For almost all of the next 57 years of his long life, Henry Pilsbry spent his hours writing scientific papers, over 3,000 of them, mostly while at the Academy of Natural Sciences. Most of his longest papers were published by the Academy. The shorter ones could usually be found in The Nautilus. The large majority of his work carried only his name, although there were sometimes joint or junior authors, some of whom were more patron than scientist. It is notable that Pilsbry did not always confine himself to the several areas of study with which he was already closely associated, but rather would sometimes stray into other fields of science, from geology and paleontology to the taxonomy of brachiopods.Pilsbry H. A. (1897). \\"Geology of the Mussel-bearing Clays of Fish-House, New Jersey\\". Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 48: 567-570.Pilsbry H. A. In: Wenner H. E.

Catalogue of the Marine Mollusks of Japan, with Descriptions of New Species, and Notes on Others Collected by Frederick Stearns. Detroit: F. Stearns. 196 p. [includes 30 species of modern brachiopods]. His field work provided a steady supply of new specimens for study, dissection, and illustration, and a seemingly endless array of new species to name. Pilsbry named 5680 organisms;Florence A. Ruhoff (1973), Bibliography and Zoological Taxa of Paul Bartsch, Biographical Sketch by Harald A. Rehder, Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, Number 143 a full list was published in a 218-page volume. Pilsbry performed extensive amounts of field work, and was clearly an expert in dealing with the outdoors, no matter the conditions. He collected mollusks over virtually the entire United States, and in an atlas of countries: Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Cocos Islands, Cuba, Galapagos Islands, Guatemala, Marquesas Islands, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and other locations as well. His intellectual reach extended even further, through joint efforts with other workers: especially notably Africa with Joseph Bequaert and the Japanese region with Yoichiro Hirase. Pilsbry suffered a heart attack in late 1957 while working at the Philadelphia Academy. He seemed to recover from this serious occurrence, but died at his winter home in Florida, about a month and a half later, from a similar event. Henry Augustus Pilsbry is buried in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, at St. Asaph's Church. A species of Cuban dwarf boa, Tropidophis pilsbryi, is named in his honor.Beolens, B.; Watkins, M.; Grayson, M.

It was discovered on 19 July 1925, by Soviet astronomer Vladimir Albitsky at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The asteroid was named for Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky. The X- or C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.636 hours.  Orbit and classification  Mussorgskia is a non- family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 3 months (1,567 days; semi-major axis of 2.64 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 10¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Simeiz in May 1916. The body's observation arc begins as at Heidelberg Observatory in April 1920, or more than 5 years prior to its official discovery observation at Simeiz.  Physical characteristics  Mussorgskia has been characterized as a common X-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS photometric survey. It is also characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid in the SDSS-MFB (Masi Foglia Binzel) taxonomy.  Rotation period  In May 2002, two rotational lightcurves of Mussorgskia were obtained from photometric observations by Stephen Brincat at the Flarestar Observatory in Malta and by French amateur astronomer Ren√© Roy. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 5.519 and 5.6362 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 and 0.21 magnitude, respectively (). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts a period of 5.636 hours and a brightness variation between 0.2 and 0.21 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Mussorgskia measures between 17.54 and 30.323 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1010 and 0.23. CALL assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and consequently calculates a larger diameter of 36.78 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.9.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Russian composer (1839‚Äì1881). The official was published by the Minor Planet Center in November 1952 ().

The California State Normal School was a teaching college system founded on May 2, 1862, eventually evolving into San Jos√© State University in San Jose and the University of California, Los Angeles in Los Angeles. History The school was created when the State of California took over a normal school that educated San Francisco teachers in association with that city's high school system. This school was founded in 1857 and was generally known as either the San Francisco Normal School or Minns Evening Normal School. Although the California legislative act founding the school referred to the institution as the \\"Normal School of the State of California,\\" the institution was commonly referred to as the California State Normal School. The 1870 Act that moved the school to San Jose formalized the California State Normal School name. However sometimes it was referred to as San Jose State Normal School or State Normal School at San Jose. In 1871, the school moved to Washington Square Park at Fourth and San Carlos Streets in San Jose, where San Jos√© State University is still located. The original building at Washington Square Park was completed in 1872 but burned down on February 10, 1880. It was replaced by a second building in 1881, depicted in the lithograph at right. In 1881, a southern branch campus was announced in Los Angeles, which in 1919 became part of the newly established southern branch of the University of California. In 1887, the California legislature changed the name of the two normal schools, dropping the word \\"California\\" and designating them simply as \\"State Normal Schools.\\" By the end of the 19th century, the State Normal School in San Jose was graduating roughly 130 teachers a year and was \\"one of the best known normal schools in the West.\\" The original campus later became San Jose State University, the founding institution of the California State University system.  Other campuses  Other State Normal Schools were established in Chico in 1887, San Diego in 1897, and elsewhere throughout the state of California. With the exception of the Los Angeles campus, the system of State Normal Schools would later become the California State University system. In 1919, the California State Legislature established the southern branch of the University of California and in so doing, transferred the campus of the State Normal School at Los Angeles to the new university branch. Students at the State Normal School became students of the new southern branch, which over time evolved into what is today the UCLA Department of Education. In 1921 the California State Legislature decreed that the remaining State Normal Schools would be known as State Teachers Colleges and that the original campus would be known as the State Teachers College at San Jose. In 1935, the State Teachers Colleges became the California State Colleges, administered from the State Department of Education in Sacramento. The new San Jose State College was no longer limited to educating teachers and later evolved into San Jos√© State University.  Athletics  After 1887 the official name of the San Jose campus was the \\"State Normal School at San Jose.\\" The school's athletic teams initially played under the \\"Normal\\" identity as indicated in the 1910 football team photo on this page, but they gradually shifted to the State Normal School identity, as evidenced by images of the SNS football and basketball squads from this era. Despite the SNS identity, the school continued to be referred to as the \\"California State Normal School, San Jose\\" in official publications like the 1919 school bulletin pictured on this page. Historical archives in the Martin Luther King, Jr. Library on the San Jose State campus include a number of pieces of State Normal School memorabilia, including a \\"SNS\\" pennant.

Its shape is round or a flattened sphere with no stalk, and it at least across when mature. The exterior is white or tan. Unlike giant puffballs, which are smooth, the western giant puffball is covered with plaques or large pointed warts. The interior is first firm and white, then yellow and slimy, and finally powdery. Reproduction Unlike most puffballs the western giant puffball reproduces in three stages asexually. Smaller western giant puffballs usually clump of the epididymal covering of the parent. Cooking The western giant puffball is edible when completely white inside. (Those that have even traces of yellow or green can cause upset stomachs.) It does not wash well, so trimming most of the dirt off is best. Washing with water makes it too soggy to saute. It is seasoned the same way as the giant puffball. It is good cubed and cooked in soup, breaded and deep-fried, steamed, sauteed, or simmered like other mushrooms. The western giant puffball, like the giant puffball, does not dehydrate well but can be cooked (to prevent it from becoming mush) and then frozen. After it thaws it should be cooked again. With the texture of tofu or marshmallows it is similar to the giant puffball. Like many other foodstuffs (and many puffballs), not all of them taste the same.

People from Taiwan are frustrated by the political rivalry which is the cause of confusion in people's national identity, both inside and outside Taiwan. According to government figures, over 95% of Taiwan's population of 23.4 million consists of Taiwanese people of Han Chinese descent, while 2.3% are Austronesian Taiwanese aborigines. The category of Han Taiwanese consists of the three main groups: Hoklo, Hakka, and mainland Chinese. The identity of whether a person from Taiwan is 'Taiwanese', or Chinese, is more of a political question.  Identity from a historic perspective   Ming and Qing Empire  In addition to the Taiwanese aborigines, who settled on Taiwan starting around 3000 BC, most of the 23 million people in Taiwan are descendants of immigrants from Fujian and identify themselves as Hoklo whilst 15% are descendants of Hakka from Guangdong (Canton) and also Fujian. The ancestors of these people were laborers that crossed the Taiwan Strait during the late Ming and early Qing period (after 1624) in order to work on plantations for the Dutch. It is believed that some of these male laborers married aborigine women, creating a new small ethnic group of mixed people. In 1683, the Qing Empire, which controlled China, conquered Taiwan. The Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895.  Empire of Japan  Japan took control of Taiwan when China, then under the control of the Qing Dynasty since its conquest in 1683, lost the First Sino-Japanese War. Before the advent of Japanese to Taiwan, in 1895 it was a plase of a short-lived Republic of Formosa, often claimed now in Taiwan to be \\"the first republic in Asia\\". The Japanese rule of Taiwan lasted from 1895 until 1945, when Japan was defeated by the allied forces at the end of World War II. Taiwanese perceptions of the Japanese are significantly more favorable than perceptions in other parts of East Asia, partly because during its 50 years (1895-1945) of Japanese rule Japan developed Taiwan's economy and raised the standard of living for most Taiwanese citizens, building up Taiwan as a supply base for the Japanese main islands. Later Taiwanese also adopted Japanese names and practice Shinto, while the schools instilled a sense of \\"Japanese spirit\\" in students. By the time World War II began, many ethnic Taiwanese were proficient in both Japanese and Hokkien, while keeping their unique identity. Many Taiwanese were conscripted by the Japanese army to aid in their military campaigns against China. Many Taiwanese units, alongside the regular Japanese army, took part in some of the most noteworthy campaigns of that time against China, including the Nanking Massacre. Towards the last decade of the Japanese rule, the occupation force started a systematic campaign of to instill the to assimilate ethnic Taiwanese into imperial subjects of the Japanese empire. This process was stopped when Japan was defeated at the end of World War II, ending efforts on the part of the Japanese forces to integrate Taiwan, as with Okinawa and Hokkaid≈ç, into the Japanese empire. During this last decade, Taiwanese were encouraged to adopt Japanese names. Many older generation Taiwanese have fond memories of the Japanese rule in comparison to the later KMT occupation.  Republic of China  Non-Kuomintang Taiwanese politician Wu San-lien (2L) and his supporters celebrate his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first-ever Taipei City mayoral election held in January 1951. Taipei is the capital of the Republic of China (Taiwan) since December 1949. After the Republic of China relocated its capital to Taipei in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek intended to eventually return to Mainland China and retake control of it. In order to do this, the KMT attempted to \\"sinicize\\" the Taiwanese people. KMT's Taiwan Garrison Commander Chen Yi stated that after 50 years of Japanese rule, \\"Taiwanese customs, thought, and language would have to gradually return to that of the Chinese people\\". The KMT believed that a centrally controlled curriculum would forge a unified national sentiment in Taiwan. They also believed education would help build a martial spirit and stimulate enough military, economic, political, and cultural strength not only to survive, but also to recover the mainland. However, the Korean War in 1950, during which the PRC fought United States soldiers, changed this situation. It indeed pushed the US to conclude a mutual security treaty with the ROC since they did not want the Communists to take over the island. Thus protected by the US, the people on Taiwan continued developing their own identity, separate from mainland China. In 1979, diplomatic relationships between the US and the ROC broke down, and more and more governments started to view the PRC as the sole government of China. Thus, the ROC's political focus gradually shifted its attention from mainland China to the island of Taiwan, and many citizens started to consider themselves as part of a nation, separate from mainland China. The first transition of power from the KMT occurred in 2000 when Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party won the presidential election. His efforts favoring Taiwan independence included advocacy of One Country on Each Side; referendums on Cross-Strait relations, transitional justice, and United Nations membership for Taiwan; along with the abolishment of the National Unification Council. In recent years, there has been a trend, known as Taiwanization, to emphasize the importance of Taiwan's culture rather than to regard Taiwanese as solely an appendage of China. The movement stems from the continued hostility displayed by the People's Republic of China towards Taiwan independence and the memory of the Chinese-controlled Kuomintang occupation. This involves the teaching of history of Taiwan, geography, and culture from a Taiwan-centric perspective, as well as promoting languages locally established in Taiwan, including Taiwanese, Hakka and aboriginal languages. The place of Taiwanese identity (Âè∞ÁÅ£‰∫∫) in relation to the Chinese identity (ËèØ‰∫∫) has been a matter of intense debate. While pro-unification Taiwanese (Êµ∑Â§ñËèØ‰∫∫) prefer to think of the Taiwanese identity as a subset of the Chinese national identity, and instead describe the Taiwanese identity as a component of the Chinese diaspora (Êµ∑Â§ñËèØ‰∫∫ or ËèØË£î), pro-independence Taiwanese place the Taiwanese identity outside the Chinese national identity, and instead describe the Taiwanese identity as (Êµ∑Â§ñÂè∞ÁÅ£‰∫∫ or Âè∞Ë£î). While the concept of Taiwanese identity was originally limited to Taiwan independence movement supporters, it is now endorsed by some supporters of Cross-Strait unification on Taiwan in a rejection of a monolithic officially sponsored Han Chinese identity in favor of one rooted in a unique, Taiwan-centric culture. A new term, known as \\"Republic of China People\\" (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúã‰∫∫) is used to resolve the national identity crisis (pertaining to the diverse ethnic groups living in Taiwan, as well as Penghu, Kinmen and other minor islands, as well as overseas Taiwanese/Chinese who are still holding the Republic of China citizenship). It appeared particularly during the 2011 celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China.  Taiwanese opinion  Polls conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in 2001 found that 70% of Taiwanese would support a name change of the country to Taiwan if the island could no longer be referred to as the Republic of China. In recent years, especially after the 1990s, there has been a growth in the number of people identifying themselves as Taiwanese. In polls conducted by the National Chengchi University back in 1991, only 13.6% of respondents identified themselves as Taiwanese. This figure rose to 45.7% in 2004. In contrast, the number of respondents that identified themselves as Chinese was 43.9% in 1991 and fell to just 6.3% in 2004. Half of respondents responded with dual-identity, both Chinese and Taiwanese, and the statistic has remained steady with just a slight decline from 49.7% in 1992 to 45.4% in 2004. The Academia Sinica conducted a survey between 1992 and 2004 to further explore the identity issue by asking questions such as whether people would support independence if it wouldn't result in war, and whether Taiwan should unite with China if there were no political, economic or social differences between the two sides. Results showed that a third of respondents maintained \\"double-identities\\" over the years whilst a similar number of respondents were \\"Taiwanese nationalists\\" (those that would never support unification with China even if there were no differences with China). This number doubled as a result of provocation from the PRC in the 1996 missile crisis. There has been a sharp decline in \\"Chinese nationalist\\" (those that would support unification with China if the social conditions were the same as Taiwan) from 40% to 15%. The opinion of Taiwanese continues to change, reflecting the problem of national identity which is easily affected by political, social and economic circumstances. In a poll dated June 2009, 52.1% of Taiwan's population consider themselves to be only Taiwanese while 39.2% consider themselves to be both Taiwanese and Chinese and only 4.4% consider themselves to be Chinese only.. In a poll dated 2016 about 78% see themselves as Taiwanese only, 20% as both and only 2% see themselves as Chinese only. According to Election Study Center, National Chengchi University, the 2019 Trend of Taiwanese Core Political Attitude states that 56.9% of Taiwan's population consider themselves to be only Taiwanese while 36.5% consider themselves to be both Taiwanese and Chinese and only 3.6% consider themselves to be Chinese only..  Different perspectives of history  During the period of Martial Law, when the Kuomintang (KMT) was the only authorised party to govern Taiwan, the KMT government has \\"modified\\" Taiwan's history from a Greater China perspective and lump the pre-existing Hoklo and Hakka with the Mainlanders as Chinese, who came to Taiwan and forced aboriginal communities into the mountains. The early Hoklo and Hakka who arrived in Taiwan have intermarried with lowland aborigines in Taiwan. Also, due to several government factions that ruled Taiwan prior to Japanese rule, many lowland aborigines were forcefully assimilated, and it was in their incentives to pass as Hoklo. Within the Taiwanese Han Hoklo community itself, differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with aboriginals took place, with most pure Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Aboriginal admixture, which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan.Brown 2004. pp. 156-7. Plains aboriginals who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated by the historian Melissa J. Brown between \\"short-route\\" and \\"long-route\\".Brown 2004. p. 162. The ethnic identity of assimilated Plains Aboriginals in the immediate vicinity of Tainan was still known since a pure Hoklo Taiwanese girl was warned by her mother to stay away from them.Brown 2004. p. 157. The insulting name \\"fan\\" was used against Plains Aborigines by the Taiwanese, and the Hoklo Taiwanese speech was forced upon Aborigines like the Pazeh.http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/06/15/2003592824 Hoklo Taiwanese has replaced Pazeh and driven it to near extinction.http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/06/26/2003415773 Aboriginal status has been requested by Plains Aboriginals.http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/07/15/2003595134 The deep-rooted hostility between Taiwanese aborigines and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal communities' effective KMT networks contribute to Aboriginal skepticism against the DPP and the Aboriginals tendency to vote for the KMT. But since 2016, Aboriginals started to vote for the DPP instead of the KMT.  Relationship between Taiwanese identity and Chinese identity  Supporters of Taiwan Independence recognize themselves to be Taiwanese only and reject the designation \\"Zhongguoren ‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫\\" (Chinese national or Chinese). In particular, they have emphasized that, politically and legally, they are not Chinese. A portion of Taiwanese feel that the country's official name Republic of China has legally imposed upon them the identity of Chinese national, and therefore are discontent to a certain degree, thus wishing to seek Taiwan Independence. However, the majority of the supporters of Taiwan independence do not deny themselves as \\"huaren ËèØ‰∫∫\\" (ethnic Chinese) or \\"huayi ËèØË£î\\" (person of Chinese descent), meaning that they seek more of a political and legal separation from the Chinese national identity, rather than one based on a cultural or ancestral separation. This forms part of the Taiwanese nationalism ideology. Before the 1990s, more than half of Taiwanese population recognized themselves as \\"Zhongguoren ‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫' (Chinese national or Chinese) or \\"both Taiwanese and Chinese\\". However, with the increasing exchange of information between mainland China and Taiwan, particularly with the rise of the Chinese internet, which has inclined more in favor of the People's Republic of China, the Taiwanese have strengthened the Taiwan localization movement as a response and rejection of the unification propaganda war from the People's Republic of China. Thus, by 2008, the proportion identifying themselves as Chinese has dropped while the proportion identifying as \\"Taiwanese but not Chinese\\" has increased. Since the term \\"China\\" has become identified with the People's Republic of China, Taiwanese who hate Chinese nationalism do not recognize themselves as Chinese nationals. The negative image of the Fenqing (angry youth) from the People's Republic of China on the internet who have pursued aggressive Chinese nationalism, and their threats to freedom, human rights, and democracy in Taiwan are the main reasons many Taiwanese do not identify themselves as Chinese nationals or Chinese. In response, Taiwanese Fenqing or angry youth have resorted to pursuing aggressive Taiwanese nationalism in retaliation against the Fenqing from the PRC on the internet.TVBSÊ∞ëÊÑèË™øÊü•‰∏≠ÂøÉ, polls from TVBS In a 2009 Global Views Monthly(ÈÅ†Ë¶ãÈõúË™å) poll, Taiwanese who recognized themselves as \\"Chinese national\\" (Zhongguoren ‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫) constitute 46%, \\"Huaren ËèØ‰∫∫\\" (ethnic Chinese) or \\"Zhonghua minzu\\" (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÊóè; Chinese race) constitute 70%. In a poll conducted by TVBS in 2008, given the choice of only one between the two identities (and not both), \\"Taiwanese\\" or \\"Chinese\\", 68% chose Taiwanese, while only 18% chose Chinese. Many Taiwanese wish to change the state's official name from the \\"Republic of China\\" to the \\"Republic of Taiwan\\", in order to separate the identity and conceptual link between the two sides of the strait. However, this viewpoint has been strongly opposed by supporters of Chinese nationalism from the Pan-Blue Coalition.

Act 1 Part 1 Ryushi Age: 16 Hair: Blond Eyes: Blue Spirit Stones: Sky blue - Ryushi's spirit stones are capable of manipulating particles in the air to create varying amounts of force. In the beginning of the story, he has little to no control over his stones, and their use results in large amounts of destruction and total drainage of his energy. As the story progresses, however, he becomes capable of controlling his power. Weapon of choice: Sword Ryushi lived at Osaka Stud, a ranch for breeding wyverns all of his life with his twin sister Kia.\\\\\\\\. He was dissatisfied with his life, as he would like to travel outside of his home and see the world. He is jealous of his older brother Takami, who got to travel with their father Banto on his excursions into the outside world. In one such excursion, Banto returned with a young girl named Elani, who he claims was very important making Ryushi promise to protect her with his life. One day, Osaka Stud was attacked by the Jachyra, agents of King Macaan. The stud was destroyed, but Ryushi is able to escape with Kia and Elani on one of the wyverns. As they escape, Ryushi sees his father murdered by a strange masked man among the king's agents. Ryushi is very loyal to his promise to his father, and he will go to any length to protect Elani. He also tends to be very depressed about his inability to control his stones. He can be very headstrong and constantly craves vengeance for what has happened to his family although his desire for justice is not like that of his twin sister, Kia. Kia Age: 16 Hair: Red Eyes: Green Spirit Stones: Red - Kia's Spirit Stones control the earth. She is capable of forming barriers and large structures, but her most common use for them is creating a golem from the earth around her to attack enemies. Weapon of choice: Bo staff Kia is Ryushi's twin sister. She lived with her family in Osaka Stud, as did Ryushi. Kia often fought Ryushi in training battles, wherein Ryushi was always bested because he couldn't control his Spirit Stones which often left him drained of energy. Kia seemed to be rather popular with the boys in the area, although one reason for this may be that there is little mention of any young females in the village outside of Kia. Ty had a crush on her for many years, and although she did not take it seriously, she enjoyed getting the attention. When Osaka Stud was destroyed, it changed her immensely, and she became cold and unfeeling towards everyone, including Ryushi and Elani. The only thing she really wants is revenge against the Royalists, to the point where she will even endanger those she once cared about and she will even push herself to the limit to get revenge. Takami Age: 18 Hair: Black Spirit Stones: Yellow/Green - Takami's Spirit Stones enable him to manipulate heat and flame however he wishes, much like his younger brother's ability to manipulate pure energy. Weapon of choice: Nodachi The eldest child of Banto and elder brother to Kia and Ryushi. Known for his greed and lust for power throughout the story, he often resorts to fighting dirty and cheating in order to obtain it. During their life at Osaka Stud, Takami often calls Ryushi \\"little brother\\", knowing full well the annoyance using such a nickname causes. He comes into conflict with the twins several times before gathering the strength to regain his honor before his siblings. In later books, it was revealed that he had actually betrayed his family and sided with King Macaan. Takami was also responsible for murdering his father, Banto during the attack on Osaka Stud. Banto Father of Ryushi, Kia, and Takami. Unknown to his children, he is the founder of Parakka, a secret rebel group against King Macaan. He sets the events of the story in motion by taking responsibility for the young Resonant, Elani, and bringing her to Osaka Stud for safekeeping. The promise he extracts from Ryushi, to protect Elani with his life, becomes a driving force in his son's life after the destruction of Osaka Stud. Ty Banto's Pilot, and a young member of the Pilots' Guild, he uses his spirit stones to fuel and power large machines and vehicles. His romantic feelings for Kia lead him to sacrifice his own safety so that she, Ryushi and Elani can escape the attack on Osaka Stud. Later, when he and Kia are reunited, he becomes a symbol to her of the innocence she lost in the attack and subsequent battles. Elani A mysterious young girl who is brought home with Banto after one of his business trips to Tusami City. She refers to Ryushi and Kia as her \\"cousins\\" and Banto as her \\"uncle\\", despite being of no actual blood-relation to any of them. It is later revealed that she is a powerful Resonant, and the king is desperately hunting for her. Part 2 Tatterdemalion Leader of the Jachyra, and personal servant/confidant of Princess Aurin. Like all Jachyra, he serves the King in show, but is loyal to the princess' will. Part 3 Hochi Parakkan and close friend of Banto. He owns a wyvern stud in Tusami City and is the first person Elani, Ryushi and Kia meet after they've escaped the destruction of Osaka Stud. He is also the only character who does not possess any spirit stones (other than Elani, who, as a resonant, was unable to receive them). Gerdi Age: 15 Hair: Green Spirit Stones: White (with black \\"tiger stripes\\") - As with all Noman, Gerdi's spirit-stones revolve around illusion and misdirection. Specifically, Gerdi is able to craft illusions, fooling the minds of others by making them see who he wants them to see in place of his real self. Weapons of choice: Crossbow and short sword Gerdi is a Noman child who was taken in by Hochi after being caught attempting to steal from a storehouse in Tusami City. Younger than Ryushi and Kia, Gerdi is a very playful individual, always one to make jokes even in serious situations, mostly at Hochi's expense due to his baldness and stocky build. Despite the number of jokes he makes toward the man in Broken Sky, Gerdi holds a deep respect for the man. After meeting her, he becomes something of an \\"older brother\\" figure to Elani. Part 4 King Macaan Age: Unknown Hair: White Spirit Stones: King Macaan's spirit stones are arguably the most powerful possessed by any individual in Broken Sky. It is unclear as to how many spirit stones Macaan has, but he has the power to create his own illusory reality, which he is able to alter completely by will alone. Weapon of choice: Sword Ruthless leader of the Dominions. After losing his parents and wife to a vicious illness, he has become obsessed with his last remaining family member, his daughter Aurin, and literally desires to give her the world on a platter. At the end of the series, Macaan is revealed to be one of the enigmatic Deliverers, but is also revealed to have abused the power by implanting spirit stones within himself, giving him the vast power he commands. While his daughter Aurin wears a Trigger Stone around her neck which allows her to control the arachnid Keriag race, Macaan possesses a second, implanted directly in his forehead, which allows him to control both the Keriags in addition to the Jachyra. Princess Aurin Daughter of Macaan and merciless ruler of Kirin Taq. Often described as being very attractive. Raised in seclusion, she is quickly charmed by the passionate convictions and indefatigable attitude of Ryushi, and grants him special privileges when he is her prisoner; he uses this to get close to her and steal the heartstone of the Keriags. Tochaa Kirin man who took in Elani during her time in Kirin Taq. Was killed by a Kerriag during a raid Parakka were conducting on one of Macaan's heavily guarded areas. He died in Hochi's arms and Hochi, distraught that he had been saved by a man whom he'd considered an enemy spent the next year or so in a dark mood. Moracq An elderly Kirin who lives with Tochaa. Possibly related. Part 5 Calica A young woman who is a member of the council on Parakka. Her parents were killed by Maccan's troops. Her spirit stones allow her to sense the past or future by touching objects to view their histories, making her a valuable spy. Has romantic feelings for Ryushi, but is at first unable to express them. She is Princess Aurin's \\"splitling\\" (effectively a spiritual doppelganger), and as a result, the only other person who can wear the heartstone and thus, control the Keriags. Otomo A member of the council of Parakka, of equal rank with Calica. Ogara Jin A Parakkan teacher who takes Ryushi and Kia to the Keiko mines. Part 6 Part 7 Whist A mysterious young man with a shadowy past, he first meets Parakka operatives during the foray into Os Dakar prison. He fights by flinging razor-discs, and keeps a pet dog, Blink, who can teleport instantly from place to place and take Whist along for the ride. Blink is a Flicker Dog, and it is hinted at that Whist's spirit stones are able to tame Blink and other animals. Whist is untrustworthy and scheming and willing to betray anyone for the right price. Part 8 Kettin Leader of the Fallen Sun tribe on the plateau prison of Os Dakar. Part 9 Act 2 Part 1 Jaan A young half-breed boy who is often shunned because of his obviously biracial (Dominion-born and Kirin) heritage. He has a special gift for speaking to the Koth Taraan and befriends a young Koth Taraan - whom he names Iriqi, after an old family pet - finding in him the first person he's ever known who (like him) is neither Dominion-folk nor Kirin. His weapon of choice is a pair of dagnas; foot-long serrated blades which are mounted to his forearms by way of a set of wooden sheaths which allow him to retract and extend them at will. Peliqua Jaan's older half-sister, a flighty and giddy girl on the surface, but a brave warrior within. Always concerned for her little brother, the only family she has left, she defends him fiercely from those who would mock him, and often tries to cheer him up. She wears her red hair in distinctive cornrow braids, and fights with a manriki-gusari; a long chain with weights attached to the ends. Part 2 Iriqi The Koth Taraan who chooses to observe and aid Parakka. He forms a strong friendship with Jaan. Part 3 Act 3 Part 1 Mi'atte A slave working in a desert mine with amnesia. Revealed to be Kia, who has gone missing for several months. Jedda Leader of a tribe in the deserts. Develops romantic feelings for Kia and the two later get together at the end of the novel. Li'ain Mysterious woman who helps rescue Kia. She claims to be a \\"Fetch\\", a person whose spirit stones allow her to displace matter, thus allowing teleportation. Later revealed to be Aurin. Chiro A Breed; essentially a vat-grown cyborg used as a servile workforce for the Machinists. Breed have a ruthless devotion to carrying out orders given by the highest ranking machinist, and they are completely logical in thinking, leaving no room for emotions.

The Harrisburg and Potomac Railroad was built in the 1870s from Lemoyne to Shippensburg. It was later linked to Harrisburg via the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Bridge, and became part of the Reading Company via leases and mergers. At Lurgan tower, just southwest of Shippensburg, Reading ownership ended and the Western Maryland Railway Lurgan Subdivision began, continuing the rail connection to that railroad's Hagerstown classification yard. A connection was subsequently built in Shippensburg between the PRR line and the RDG line to allow for interchange coal traffic. Conrail took over both companies in 1976. The PRR line was abandoned from Shippensburg to Carlisle, a portion that saw much street-running and -crossing, as this was the segment that was never significantly improved by the Cumberland Valley Railroad. The existing Cumbo connection was used to create the new hybrid line. The branch was assigned to Norfolk Southern in the 1999 breakup of Conrail.

The study analyzed factors to denote the effectiveness of state institutions, population well-being,elite conflicts and found that partial democracies with low involvement in international trade and with high infant mortality are most prone to revolutions. One of the members of the task force resigned on January 20, 2017 in protest of the Trump administration. Project history The project began as an unclassified study that was commissioned to a group of academics (particularly active was the Center for Global Policy at George Mason University) by the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Intelligence in response to a request from senior U.S. policy makers. The State Failure Problem Set dataset and spreadsheets were originally prepared in 1994 by researchers at the Center for International Development and Conflict Management (CIDCM) at the University of Maryland under the direction of Ted Robert Gurr and subject to the review of the State Failure Task Force. The Problem Set was subsequently reviewed, revised, and updated on an annual basis through 1999 under the direction of Ted Gurr and, beginning in 1999, Monty G. Marshall at CIDCM. In January 2001, a major review and revision of the Problem Set coding guidelines and dataset, under the direction of Monty G. Marshall, was concluded that substantially altered the case identifications and case parameters recorded in the Problem Set. Methodology The PITF first identified over 100 \\"problem cases\\" in the world from 1955 to 2011.Jack Goldstone, \\"Towards a Fourth Generation of Revolutionary Theory\\", Annual Review of Political Science 4, 2001:139‚Äì87 Four distinct types of state failure events are included in the dataset: revolutionary wars, ethnic wars, adverse regime changes, and genocides and politicides. The Problem Set data includes the following information on each case: country, month and year of onset, month and year of ending (unless ongoing as of December 31 of the current update year), type of case, and annual codes on magnitude variables. The basic structure of the data is the \\"case-year,\\" that is, there is a separate case-entry for each additional year of a multi-year episode. Only the first annual record for each event contains a brief narrative description of the event. The goal was to find factors associated with major political conflicts. Over 400 cases were analyzed, both for global and regional data sets. The common variables listed in each data version are as follows: * COUNTRY - Full alpha country name * SCODE - 3-letter alpha country code * CCODE - 3-number numeric Singer country code * YEAR - 4-number numeric year * MOBEGIN - 2-number numeric month denoting event beginning * YRBEGIN - 4-number numeric year denoting event beginning * MOEND - 2-number numeric month denoting event ending (99=ongoing) * YREND - 4-number numeric year denoting event ending (9999=ongoing) * PTYPE - 1-number numeric event type (1=ETH; 2=REV; 3=REG; 4=GEN) * DESC - Brief alpha text description identifying specific event (only included with first case-year in multi-year episodes) Revolutionary and Ethnic Wars Revolutionary wars are episodes of violent conflict between governments and politically organized groups (political challengers) that seek to overthrow the central government, to replace its leaders, or to seize power in one region. Conflicts must include substantial use of violence by one or both parties to qualify as \\"wars.\\" Ethnic wars are episodes of violent conflict between governments and national, ethnic, religious, or other communal minorities (ethnic challengers) in which the challengers seek major changes in their status. Most ethnic wars since 1955 have been guerrilla or civil wars in which the challengers have sought independence or regional autonomy. A few, like the events in South Africa's black townships in 1976-77, involve large-scale demonstrations and riots aimed at sweeping political reform that were violently suppressed by police and military. Rioting and warfare between rival communal groups is not coded as ethnic warfare unless it involves conflict over political power or government policy. Additional variables specific to the Ethnic and Revolutionary War episodes are as follows: * MAGFIGHT - Scaled number of rebel combatants or activists (range 0-4; 9=missing) * MAGFATAL - Scaled annual number of fatalities related to fighting (range 0-4; 9=missing) * MAGAREA - Scaled portion of country affected by fighting (range 0-4; 9=missing) * AVEMAG - Average of the three magnitude scores (range 0-4.0; 9=missing) Adverse Regime Change Adverse Regime Changes are defined by the State Failure Task Force as major, adverse shifts in patterns of governance, including * major and abrupt shifts away from more open, electoral systems to more closed, authoritarian systems; * revolutionary changes in political elites and the mode of governance; * contested dissolution of federated states or secession of a substantial area of a state by extrajudicial means; and * complete or near-total collapse of central state authority and the ability to govern. Abrupt transitions from more authoritarian rule to more open, institutionalized governance systems, defined by the State Failure Task Force as \\"democratic transitions,\\" are not considered state failures in this sense and, thus, are not included. Additional variables specific to the Adverse Regime Change episodes are as follows: * MAGFAIL - Scaled failure of state authority (range 1-4; 9=missing) * MAGCOL - Scaled collapse of democratic institutions (range 1-4; 9=missing) * MAGVIOL - Scaled violence associated with regime transition (range 1-4; 9=missing) * MAGAVE - Average of the three magnitude scores (range 1-4.0; 9=missing) * POLITYX - Type of regime change Genocides and Politicides Genocide and politicide events involve the promotion, execution, and/or implied consent of sustained policies by governing elites or their agents or in the case of civil war, either of the contending authorities that result in the deaths of a substantial portion of a communal group or politicized non communal group. In genocides the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal (ethnolinguistic, religious) characteristics. In politicides, by contrast, groups are defined primarily in terms of their political opposition to the regime and dominant groups. Genocide and politicide are distinguished from state repression and terror. In cases of state terror authorities arrest, persecute or execute a few members of a group in ways designed to terrorize the majority of the group into passivity or acquiescence. In the case of genocide and politicide authorities physically exterminate enough (not necessarily all) members of a target group so that it can no longer pose any conceivable threat to their rule or interests. Additional variables specific to the Genocide/Politicide episodes are as follows: * DEATHMAG - Scaled annual number of deaths (range 0-5.0) Findings Fairly consistent findings were produced, suggesting that there are three statistically significant variables most often associated with political upheavals: * regime type: a U-shaped relationship was found between regime type and political unrest: partial democracies were at high risk, whereas both democracies and autocracies were relatively stable. * international trade: Having a high portion of gross national product (GNP) tied to international trade was positively related to stability. The explanation given was that in partial democracies are states in which there are more instances of conflict, reform, and concessions; often seen as weakness (see: political opportunity theory, States and Social Revolutions, waves of democracy and waves of revolutions). Being heavily involved in international trade requires respect for the rule of law and low levels of corruption. Countries that do not participate heavily in international trade likely see groups distorting trade and other economic activity for their benefit, making internal conflicts more likely. * infant mortality. Lower infant mortality, were generally more stable was also positively associated with stability. This is explained as the infant mortality measures for standard of living; therefore countries with low infant mortality rate have more efficient welfare and justice systems. Thus partial democracies with low involvement in international trade and with high infant mortality are most prone to revolutions. Quantitative models developed during the study would have accurately predicted over 85% of major state crises events occurring in 1990‚Äì1997. However while the models can predict state crises, they cannot predict their magnitude and eventual outcome. There are four versions of the Political Instability (State Failure) Problem Set data; each are downloadable from the PITF Problem Set page in Microsoft Excel format. This format was chosen because it is readily importable to most spreadsheet and statistical software applications. The four versions are as follows: * PITF Ethnic Wars 2004.XLS (76 episodes/719 case-years) * PITF Revolutionary Wars 2004.XLS (64 episodes/472 case-years) * PITF Adverse Regimes Changes 2004.XLS (112 episodes/284 case-years) * PITF GenoPoliticides 2004.XLS (41 episodes/268 case-years) Ethnic Wars 80 cases; 16 ongoing Revolutionary Wars 65 cases; 4 ongoing Adverse Regime Changes 115 cases; 2 ongoing Genocide/Politicides 41 cases; 1 ongoing Average magnitude over all years: 2.4 Genocides/politicides occurred most frequently in 1975 and 1978. Frequency of occurrence increased beginning in 1962 until 1980, when frequency dropped slightly. The frequency of genocides/politicides plateaued from 1980 to 1987. In 1988 the world saw a slight increase of genocides/politicides, which then quickly turned into a steady decrease in events through 2011. An example of a typical event: Uganda, 1980-1986. Average magnitude: 3.3.

He was born in Kingston, Ontario.William Edwin Beckel - Obituary Career 1960s and 1970s Beckel, a zoologist, was an early proponent of the use of television as a teaching medium. In 1964 he became the first dean of the University of Toronto-affiliated Scarborough College, which led an experiment in teaching half the courses using TV-only lectures.http://www.newsandevents.utoronto.ca/bios/02/history14.htm Beckel was president of the University of Lethbridge from 1971 to 1979. During Beckel's tenure, the university implemented Management Arts, Native American studies and expanded cooperative education. Under Dean Russell Leskiw, the education program became one of the best in Canada. A highlight during Beckel's presidency was the provincial government's approval of the Centre for the Arts, a building that allowed for the creation of U of L's art collection. Like many Ontario universities at the time, Carleton was in financial trouble when Beckel took the helm in 1979. That year it was running a $1.5-million deficit. 1980s‚Äì1990s Beckel oversaw several controversial faculty buyouts, and in 1980, the school had to dip into academic scholarship funds to help cover its debts. Beckel's efforts during the 1980s eventually pulled Carleton out of the red and into a building period that resulted in a new student residence, a new library, a Life Sciences Research Building, an Art Gallery,a Social Sciences Research Building, a Day Care Centre and the beginning of a new engineering complex. Unlike Carleton's rival universities, most of whom were raising admissions standards to compete for better students, Beckel decided to keep Carleton open to high-school graduates with averages as low as 60 per cent on the premise that \\"every student should have the right to fail.\\"https://carleton.ca/cu/aboutus/years/s3.html The benefit of this philosophy was that first year enrollment increased bringing with it increased tuition revenue that more than offset the impact of a lower retention rate. This egalitarian philosophy combined with tough financial controls resulted in a strong financial position for the university and made it \\"rare chance\\" university. For many students, Carleton offered a rare chance at a university education. (Beckel's critics were the first to coin Carleton's pejorative nickname \\"Last Chance U.\\") On July 1, 1989, the same year he received an honorary degree of Legum Doctoris from Carleton,https://carleton.ca/senate/honorarydegreesawarded.htm Beckel was succeeded as president by Robin Hugh Farquhar.

Early life Beddome was born in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, England, the son of Baptist minister John Beddome and Rachel Brandon. The family later moved to Bristol, where Beddome was apprenticed to a surgeon. At the end of his apprenticeship, he decided instead to pursue theological education with the intention of becoming a Christian minister. He studied initially under Bernard Foskett at the Baptist college in Bristol, where he became friends with John Ash. He later moved to complete his education at Moorfields Academy in London. He was baptized at the Baptist church in Prescott Street, Goodman's Fields, in 1739.  Career  In 1740 he became the pastor of the Baptist church in Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, and was ordained in 1743. He continued in this ministry for fifty-five years. He became well known as a preacher. John Rippon commented that, \\"though his voice was low, his delivery was forcible and demanded attention.\\" He was a leading figure in the Midland Baptist Association.  Personal  He married Elizabeth Boswell (1732-1784), daughter of a deacon in the church in Bourton, on 11 December 1749. They had three sons, John, Benjamin and Foskett. In 1770, Beddome received an M.A. degree from Providence College, Rhode Island. He died in Bourton aged 78, and was buried in the graveyard of the Baptist church. Works Beddome was a prolific hymn writer, composing more than 800 during his lifetime. These were written to be sung after his Sunday sermon each week, relating to the message he preached. were not originally intended for publication, he allowed 13 of them to be included in the Bristol Baptist Collection of Ash & Evans, and 36 in Rippon's Selection. In 1818, a posthumous collection of 830 of his hymns was published as Hymns Adapted to Public Worship or Family Devotion. A number of Beddome's hymns are also included in the Sacred Harp. Robert Hall wrote: > The man of taste will be gratified with the beauty and original turns of > thought which many of them exhibit, while the experimental Christian will > often perceive the most secret movements of his soul strikingly delineated, > and sentiments portrayed which will find their echo in every heart. In 1752, Beddome wrote A Scriptural Exposition of the Baptist Catechism, by Way of Question and Answer, which was reprinted in 1776. Three volumes of his sermons were printed posthumously.

The highway connects the Florida state line, south of Clyattville with Wrightsville, via Valdosta, Douglas, and Dublin. SR 31 formerly had a segment from Homerville to Pearson, but it was later decommissioned. The highway was then incrementally extended in both directions from its resulting Pearson‚ÄìDouglas segment to its current path. Route description Florida to Douglas SR 31 begins at the Florida state line south-southeast of Clyattville, in Lowndes County, where the roadway continues as State Road 145. Almost immediately, it crosses over the Withlacoochee River. The highway curves to the northwest and back to the north and passes Oris Blackburn Memorial Park. It begins to curve to the northeast and enters Clyattville, where it meets the western terminus of SR 376 (Clyattville‚ÄìLake Park Road). The highway continues to the northeast and has an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75). Approximately later, it skirts along the southeastern edge of Valdosta Regional Airport. At the intersection with Madison Highway, it turns to the right and becomes known as Inner Perimeter Road, part of an eastern bypass of most of the city. At South Patterson Street, US 41/SR 7 begin a concurrency to the northeast. This intersection also marks the southern terminus of US 41 Bus./SR 7 Bus. The next main intersection is SR 94 (New Statenville Highway). Then, it begins to curve to the north and enters the eastern city limits of Valdosta. Right after a slight bend to the north- northwest is an intersection with US 84/US 221/SR 38 (East Hill Avenue). At this intersection, US 221 joins the concurrency. After a curve to the northwest, the four highways intersect East Park Avenue. Here, US 221/SR 31 split off to the northeast and then leaves the city. The two highways travel through rural areas of the county, traveling southeast of Moody Air Force Base, and enter Lanier County. They continue to the northeast and gradually curve to the north-northeast. Along the eastern shore of Milltown Bay, they begin a northward routing and meet the western terminus of SR 31 Conn. (Murray Boulevard). Approximately later, they enter Lakeland. After a curve to the north-northwest, where SR 135 (South Mill Street) joins the concurrency, they enter the main part of town, where they intersect US 129/SR 11/SR 37/SR 122 (West Main Street). Here, both concurrencies merge and head to the east- northeast. Immediately, SR 135 departs to the north-northwest on North Carter Street. At Oak Street, SR 135 Byp. joins the concurrency. At North College Street, SR 135 Byp. leaves the concurrency to the north-northwest. This intersection also marks the eastern terminus of SR 11 Byp. The other six highways continue to the east-northeast, crossing over Big Creek before leaving town. Then, they cross over the Alapaha River. After that, US 221/SR 31/SR 122 depart the concurrency to the north-northeast. Just under later, SR 122 splits off, and US 221/SR 31 continue to the north-northeast, intersect SR 168, cut across the northwestern corner of Clinch County, and enter Atkinson County. A little over later, SR 64 joins the concurrency. The three highways continue to the north-northeast and intersect US 441/SR 89\\\\. At this intersection, SR 89 reaches its northern terminus, and US 441 joins the concurrency. In fact, US 441 is concurrent for over half of SR 31's total length. The concurrency continues into Pearson. There, they intersect US 82/SR 520 (Albany Avenue). At this intersection, SR 64 turns right onto US 82/SR 520\\\\. The other three highways continue to the north-northeast through rural areas of the county. Then, they curve to the north-northwest and enter Coffee County. Immediately, they curve to the north and cross the Satilla River. Then, they pass Pine Forests Memorial Gardens and enter Douglas. Douglas to Wrightsville They travel along the eastern edge of Douglas Municipal Airport. Farther to the north is an intersection with SR 135/SR 206 (Bowens Mill Road). At this intersection, SR 206 reaches its eastern terminus, and US 221 departs the concurrency. Farther to the north, they intersect SR 158 (Baker Highway). In the main part of town is an intersection with SR 32\\\\. On the northern edge of town is an intersection with SR 206 Conn. (North Connector Road). US 441/SR 31 curve to the northwest and enter Broxton, where SR 268 briefly joins the concurrency. After they leave town, they continue to the northwest and have a short concurrency with SR 107, a few miles south of Jacksonville. At the end of the concurrency, US 319 joins the concurrency. The three highways cross over the Ocmulgee River on the J.H. Millhollin Memorial Bridge, into Telfair County. Then, they curve to the north-northeast. When the concurrency enters Jacksonville, they intersect SR 117\\\\. Just before entering McRae, they meet the northern terminus of SR 149 Conn. Then, they enter town and intersect SR 132 on the southern edge of the city limits. Approximately later, US 280/SR 30 join the concurrency. In the central part of town is an intersection with US 23/US 341/SR 27\\\\. The five highways curve to the northeast and cross over the Little Ocmulgee River into Wheeler County. On the southeastern edge of Little Ocmulgee State Park, US 319/US 441/SR 31 depart to the north-northwest and skirt along the eastern edge of the park. They cut across a tiny part of Dodge County before entering Laurens County. The concurrent highways have an intersection with SR 46/SR 126\\\\. Northeast of Rentz, they have a second intersection with SR 117, which joins the concurrency. They curve to the north-northeast, pass Oconee Fall Line Technical College, and enter Dublin. Immediately is an interchange with I-16 (Jim Gillis Historic Savannah Parkway) and pass the Dublin‚ÄìLaurens County Recreation Center. At the southern terminus of US 441 Byp., SR 117 departs the concurrency. At Joiner Street is the northern terminus of SR 257\\\\. In the central part of town, at an intersection with Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive, the three highways turn to the left onto South Monroe Street. Then, they intersect US 80/SR 19/SR 26 (Bellevue Avenue). At this intersection, the two concurrencies merge to the northeast. At Jefferson Street, US 441 departs to the north-northwest, concurrent with SR 29, which joins the concurrency. Also, SR 19 leaves the concurrency The five highways cross over the Oconee River on the Herschel Lovett Bridge, into East Dublin. In the city, US 319/SR 31 depart to the northeast. They travel through rural areas of the county, have a short section along the Laurens‚ÄìJohnson county line, and enter Johnson County proper. The concurrency enters Wrightsville and curve to the east to an intersection with SR 15/SR 57/SR 78 (Marcus Street). At this intersection, SR 31 reaches its northern terminus, while US 319 continues to the east, concurrent with SR 78. National Highway System The following portions of SR 31 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: * From just north of I-75, south of Valdosta, to the northern end of the US 41/SR 7 concurrency in the northeast part of Valdosta * The entire length of the US 441 concurrency, from just south-southwest of Pearson to Dublin History SR 31 was established at least as early as 1919, from SR 38 in Homerville north-northwest to Pearson, and then on current path to SR 32 in Douglas. At this time, part of SR 26 was established in the Dublin area, and part of SR 30 was established in the northeastern part of the McRae area. By the end of September 1921, the Homerville‚ÄìPearson segment was decommissioned. SR 15 was extended on SR 26 from Dublin east-northeast to North Dublin, and then north-northeast to Wrightsville. Between October 1929 and June 1930, the southern terminus of SR 31 was extended southwest to US 84/SR 38 east- northeast of Valdosta. Between November 1930 and January 1932, the southern terminus was shifted west-southwest, into Valdosta. US 280 was designated on SR 30 in the McRae area. In January 1932, the northern terminus of SR 31 was extended to McRae. In early 1935, the northern terminus was extended again, to SR 117 south-southwest of Dublin. At the end of 1939, the southern terminus was extended south-southwest to the Florida state line south-southwest of Valdosta. In 1942, the entire path of SR 31 that existed at the time, and what would eventually be designated as part of it, SR 171 in the Dublin area and SR 15 from Dublin to Wrightsville, had a \\"completed hard surface\\". Between January 1945 and November 1946, US 319 was designated on SR 31, from south- southeast of Jacksonville to south-southwest of Dublin; SR 117, from south- southwest of Dublin to that city; US 80/SR 26/SR 29, from Dublin to North Dublin; and SR 15, from North Dublin to Wrightsville. Between February 1948 and April 1949, US 441 was designated on SR 31 from south-southwest of Pearson to Dublin. Between July 1957 and June 1960, the northern terminus of SR 31 was extended north-northeast on US 319/US 441 to Dublin, truncating SR 117; east- northeast on US 80/US 319/SR 26/SR 29 to North Dublin; and on US 319 to Wrightsville, since SR 15 was shifted eastward. In 1989, SR 822 was established from just south of the CSX railroad tracks in Dublin north- northwest to US 80/US 319/SR 26/SR 29/SR 31 (Bellevue Avenue). An unnumbered road was proposed from US 319/US 441/SR 31 (Telfair Street/Jefferson Street) and SR 19 (also part of Jefferson Street) east-northeast to the southern terminus of SR 822. In 1992, the path of SR 31 in Dublin was shifted east- southeastward, off of US 319/US 441/SR 19 and US 80/US 319/SR 26/SR 29, and onto the unnumbered road and replaced SR 822. In 1994, part of Inner Perimeter Road was established from US 41/SR 7 southeast of Valdosta to US 221/SR 31 in the northeast part of the city. In 2006, this road was extended southwest to SR 31\\\\. SR 31 and US 41/SR 7 were shifted out of downtown, and onto it. US 221 was also rerouted in the eastern part of the city, onto US 41/SR 7/SR 31 as it currently does. Major intersections Special routes Lakeland connector route (1965‚Äì1980) State Route 31 Connector (SR 31 Conn.) was a short connector route of SR 31 that existed entirely within the city limits of Lakeland. Between June 1963 and January 1966, it was established on US 129/SR 11/SR 37/SR 122 (Main Avenue), from where SR 122 (Main Street) split off of Main Avenue, east-southeast to US 221/SR 31/SR 135 (Mill Street). Between January 1974 and the beginning of 1981, it was decommissioned. Lakeland connector route State Route 31 Connector (SR 31 Conn.) is a connector route that exists entirely within the southeastern part of Lanier County. It is located just south of Lakeland and is known as Murray Boulevard for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with US 221/SR 31 (Lakeland Highway). It travels due east to meet its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 135 (College Street). SR 31 Conn. is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Between January 1998 and January 2010, it was established on its current path. Douglas spur route State Route 31 Spur (SR 31 Spur) was a short-lived spur route of SR 31 that existed entirely within the city limits of Douglas. Between June 1963 and January 1966, it was established from SR 135 north and east-northeast to US 221/US 441/SR 31. In 1968, it was decommissioned.

The D√©clic Images trademark was born in 1999. As early as 2002, the company produced nearly half of all new Japanese anime published in France. The newly published series are often rich in episodes and their release dates come in quick succession. The main goal of the company is to offer popular series that are accessible to all, containing at least 26 episodes. In order to ensure good sales, D√©clic Images decided to produce both recent titles (Love Hina, Fruits Basket, etc.) and anime classics such as Heidi or Masters of the Universe. A commercial war began in 2002 against Kaze animation and Dybex, D√©clic Images' competitors in the anime market. This was despite the fact that both of the companies' products were distributed by D√©clic Images' parent company, Manga Distribution. In order to guarantee its preeminence in the market, D√©clic Images decided to offer Japanese copyright holders unprecedented licence- acquisition offers. Other publishers had the choice between offering equally interesting prices, falling back on less prestigious titles or hoping to find undiscovered talent. At the height of Japanese anime sales in 2005, D√©clic Images's sales reached 5.24 million euro. It sold its products in supermarkets, over the Internet and in specialised shops, and in 2004 launched a large marketing campaign that included TV ads. Despite this presence on the market, D√©clic Images was in need of a coup, as each product generated only a small profit and Manga Distribution handled its supermarket presence badly. In 2005 everything changed for the young company. After solid growth between 2002 and 2005, with a dozen titles being released per year, the company released Goldorak in August 2005. It was later revealed that D√©clic Images did not hold the rights to the title. After extensive judicial travails, a French appeals court confirmed in 2009 a judgment of 4.8 million euro in damages against the company. Several matters remain in the courts, including the matter of a 2006 release of Captain Future without proper licensing rights. D√©clic Images has since gone through a number of restructurings and recovery proceedings, and currently seems to be in the impossibility of finding new licensing opportunities, nowadays only relying on re-releases of their current library of titles, having lost the confidence of Japanese distributors and producers, leaving sequels and remakes of anime series that they have licensed (such as Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid and Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing) unlicensed. Their last license before they stopped licensing anime titles was Gakuen Alice. Black Lagoon, Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage, and X were relicensed by Kaz√© in 2012, and the company also licensed Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail. Full Metal Panic! and Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu were relicensed by Dybex in 2014, and the company also licensed Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid. Anime Over the years D√©clic Images has distributed a number of popular anime series, movies, and OVAs in their network. D√©clic Images would either distribute the series through TV or at times become the publisher of the series in France. *Ai Yori Aoshi (TV) : Distributor *Ai Yori Aoshi ~Enishi~ (TV) : Distributor *Alps no Sh≈çjo Heidi (TV) : Distributor *Astro Boy [1980] (TV) : Distributor *Attacker You!

Scott (born March 15, 1946 in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California) is an American funk/rock guitarist and founding member of the successful 1970s funk band War. Biography Scott grew up in Compton, California. He began playing bass at a very young age under the guidance of his cousin, Jack Nelson, and in 1961 began playing guitar. A year later, he formed a group called the Creators with Harold Brown, and together they played at high school dances, car club parties and small nightclubs in southern California. Scott was influenced by blues artists T.J. Summerville, Howlin Wolf, Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed and Wayne Bennett. He frequented the local blues clubs in South Los Angeles to study professionals such as Lowell Fulson, Johnny Guitar Watson and T-Bone Walker. Howard graduated from Compton High School in 1964 where he was on the school's dance band and cross country team. He toured with The Drifters for a short time until he was drafted into the United States Army in 1966. Upon his return, he formed his second group, The Night Shift, with Harold Brown. In 1969, the Night Shift was performing at the Rag Doll club in North Hollywood , when Eric Burdon and Lee Oskar stopped in to hear them play. Lee Oskar went to the stage to join in on a jam, and the next day Eric Burdon, Lee Oskar, Charles Miller, Papa Dee Allen, Lonnie Jordan and Peter Rosen joined Scott and Brown to form the band War. Scott contributed lyrics, music and co- produced some of War‚Äôs greatest hits, such as \\"Cisco Kid\\", \\"Slipping into Darkness\\" and \\"Why Can‚Äôt We Be Friends?\\". He was also the frontman and leader of the group. Scott and other members eventually left the original band in the 1990s, losing the right to use the band's name.

Prices of vodka, wine and beer were raised, and their sales were restricted in amount and time of day. People who were caught drunk at work or in public were prosecuted. The reform had an effect on alcoholism in the country, as evident from statistics showing some fall in criminality and rise in life expectancy, but economically it was a serious blow to the state budget (a loss of approximately 100 billion rubles to the exchequer according to Alexander Yakovlev) after alcohol production migrated to the black market economy.

The highway runs generally in a southwest to northeast direction from NY 8 in the hamlet of Mount Upton to north of the village of Ilion, where it ends at NY 5\\\\. NY 51 intersects several primary routes including, a short overlap with NY 23 in the village of Morris, a overlap with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Winfield, and NY 5S in Illion. NY 51 is a two-lane highway its entire length. In the 1920s, a segment of modern NY 51 between West Burlington and West Winfield was designated as part of NY 44, a route that extended from Sidney to Utica. At the time, this was the only substantial segment of modern NY 51 to have a route number even though all of modern NY 51 south of Ilion was state-maintained. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the section of NY 44 from West Burlington to West Winfield became part of the new NY 51, which utilized all of its modern routing from Mount Upton to Ilion upon assignment. NY 51 was extended across the Mohawk River to NY 5 in North Ilion in the mid-1960s. Route description  Mount Upton to Burlington Flats  NY 51 begins at an intersection with NY 8 and Chenango County Route 37 (CR 37) in the hamlet of Mount Upton (in the town of Guilford). NY 51 proceeds east through Mount Upton as a two-lane continuation of CR 37, passing multiple residences in Mount Upton. Just after, the route crosses the Unadilla River and leave Chenango County for Otsego County. Now in the town of Butternuts, reaching a junction with the southern terminus of CR 18, NY 51 winds northeast through town a two- lane rural roadway through the town. reference markers on NY 51 in Otsego County between Morris and New Lisbon The route starts paralleling Butternut Creek through town, entering the hamlet of Copes Corners, where NY 51 junctions with CR 3\\\\. The route passes west of Copes Corners Park, soon passing the Gilbertsville-Mount Upton Central School just north of the hamlet. NY 51 winds north along Butternut Creek, soon gaining the moniker of Marion Avenue as it reaches the village of Gilbertsville. The route becomes a two- lane residential street through Gilbertsville, reaching a junction with Cliff Street, where it turns northeast through the village. The route soon junctions with Reservoir Road, which marks the northern end of Gilbertsville and access to Butternuts Cemetery. Back in the town of Butternuts, NY 51 drops the Marion Avenue moniker and continues north through the rural regions north of Gilbertsville along Butternut Creek. NY 51 begins to stretch further and further away from Butternut Creek, soon crossing into the town of Morris.and begins to pass more residences as it winds northeast. Climbing several hills, NY 51 eventually enters the village of Morris, where almost immediately, it reaches a junction with NY 23\\\\. NY 23 and NY 51 become concurrent at this junction, crossing over a tributary of Butternut Creek and entering the village center. Now known as Main Street, NY 23 and NY 51 pass multiple businesses before reaching the junction with Broad Street, where NY 23 turns east onto Broad and NY 51 continues east on Main. After Hargrave Street, NY 51 leaves the village of Morris and returns to the namesake town. NY 51 southbound from NY 80 in West Burlington NY 51 continues through Morris, reaching a junction with the southern terminus of CR 49 in the rural hamlet of Elm Grove. Passing north of a mobile home park, the route begins to bend northward and enters the town of New Lisbon, where it junctions with the western terminus of CR 12, which connects to the namesake hamlet. Continuing north through New Lisbon, NY 51 remains the main two-lane rural road through the town, reaching a junction with Harrington Road, where it turns northeast into the hamlet of Garrattsville. In the center of the residential hamlet, NY 51 junctions with CR 16, where the routes exchange rights-of-way. NY 51 turns northward on the alignment used by CR 16 while CR 16 heads northeast on the alignment used by NY 51. After a curve near High Street, NY 51 leaves Garrattsville, reaching the eastern terminus of CR 17, soon crossing into the town of Burlington. The route remains rural through Burlington, passing some residences in the hamlet of West Burlington, before reaching a junction with NY 80 east of Robinson Corners. NY 80 and NY 51 become concurrent and proceed northeast through the town of Burlington as a two-lane rural roadway. The short concurrency reaches the hamlet of Barrett Corners, where NY 51 turns northward while NY 80 turns east. Continuing north through Burlington, NY 51 reaches the hamlet of Chapinville, where it turns eastward for a short distance at Arnold Road. Crossing a small creek, the route soon turns northward at Gardner Road, reaching the hamlet of Burlington Flats.  Burlington Flats to Herkimer  At Burlington Flats, NY 51 turns northeast at Washburn Road, crossing two junctions with CR 19\\\\. After CR 19, the route retains its rural nature through Burlington, soon reaching the hamlet of West Exeter. In the middle of the hamlet, NY 51 reaches a junction with the western terminus of CR 22\\\\. Just north of West Exeter, the route soon reaches CR 23, where the route begins a northwestern stretch through the town of Plainfield. The route crosses the Skaneateles Turnpike at-grade as NY 51 bypasses the hamlet of Plainfield. After a gradual curve, the route soon turns northwest and crosses the Herkimer County line just north of a junction with CR 21. Now in the town of Winfield, NY 51 crosses a junction with Truax and Forks Road (unsigned CR 162). The route crosses through the hamlet of Woods Corners before entering the village of West Winfield. Now known as South Street, NY 51 soon reaches the Unadilla River, reaching the center of West Winfield. Several blocks north of the river, NY 51 reaches a junction with US 20 (West Main Street). NY 51 and US 20 become concurrent along East Main Street, crossing north of Winfield Memorial Town Park, soon leaving the village. NY 51 and US 20 continue east through the town of Winfield, crossing through the hamlet of Hitching Corner and soon into the hamlet of East Winfield. NY 51 approaching the junction with NY 5 in Herkimer At the eastern end of East Whitfield, NY 51 turns north off of US 20, continuing north through the rural parts of Winfield. Crossing a former railroad line, the route bypasses Cedarville Station, which is connected via a junction with Chepachet Road (CR 75). Crossing the Unadilla River for the third time since Mount Upton, the route turns northward past the hamlet of Chepachet before crossing into the town of Columbia and soon into the town of Litchfield. In Litchfield, NY 51 reaches the intersection with Jordanville Road (CR 18), where it turns westward and soon reaches the junction with Wall Street (CR 79), where it turns northward once again. Continuing north along a brook, NY 51 continues through Litchfield, passing through Illion Gorge before turning northeast along Steele Creek. NY 51 runs north of the Illion Reservoir No. 2 and crosses into the town of German Flatts, soon reaching the hamlet of South Ilion, where it meets a junction with CR 51\\\\. A couple blocks to the north, NY 51 turns north and enters the village of Ilion, where the route gains the moniker of Otsego Street. Becoming the main north-south street through Ilion, the route turns northeast at a junction with John Street. Otsego Street becomes the main commercial street through the village, changing names to Central Avenue at a junction with Clark Street. After the name change, NY 51 enters an interchange with NY 5S and then crosses the Mohawk River into the town of Herkimer, where NY 51 enters an interchange with NY 5\\\\. This junction marks the northern terminus of NY 51, just south of the New York State Thruway (I-90). History In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 23, an unsigned legislative route extending from Ilion to the North Country via West Winfield and Utica. The route began at Route 6 (later NY 5S and now Clark Street) in Ilion and followed what is now NY 51 southwest to West Winfield. At the center of the village, Route 23 continued west toward Utica on modern U.S. Route 20. In 1912, Route 23 was truncated to begin at the western village line of West Winfield while the portion of the route east of that point became Route 23-a. The change was reverted on March 1, 1921, moving the start of Route 23 back to Ilion. In the mid-1920s, the segment of modern NY 51 between West Burlington and West Winfield was designated as part of NY 44, a route that extended south from West Burlington to Sidney and north from West Winfield to Utica. At the time, this was the only substantial segment of what is now NY 51 to have a route number even though all of modern NY 51 south of Ilion was state-maintained. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, most of NY 44 became part of NY 8\\\\. The section from West Burlington to West Winfield, however, became part of the new NY 51, which utilized all of its modern routing from Mount Upton to Ilion upon assignment. It was extended across the Mohawk River to NY 5 in North Ilion in the mid-1960s. On May 2, 2019, the bridge over the Erie Canal, Mohawk River and railroad that connects NY 5S and NY 5 was closed to traffic. The NYSDOT stated that a large amount of superstructure rehabilitation projects needed to be done. Along with repairing the substructure, bridge joints and bearings are to be replaced. The bridge was built in 1968 and carries more than 13,000 vehicles each day. Traffic was detoured to use NY 28 to cross the river. The bridge reopened to traffic on August 31, 2019.

It is a trifoliate maple, related to such other species as threeflower maple (Acer triflorum) and paperbark maple (Acer griseum) but has dark gray to blackish bark dissimilar to the exfoliating bark of either. The leaves have a petiole and three leaflets; the leaflets are oblong, long and broad, with dense, soft pubescence and smooth margins. The hard, horizontally spreading samaras are long and broad, and have the same parthenocarpic tendencies as those of A. griseum.  Taxonomy  The Chinese populations are sometimes treated as a separate subspecies A. maximowiczianum subsp. megalocarpum (Rehder) A.E.Murray, but this is not recognised as distinct by the Flora of China. Many older texts refer to the species under its synonym A. nikoense Maxim., but as Maximowicz had also cited the name Negundo nikoense Miq. in synonymy, his new name had to be regarded as the same as that under the ICBN. Miquel pointed out that his Negundo nikoense was actually a different plant to the maple Maximowicz had intended to describe, and therefore gave the Nikko Maple a new name, honouring Maximowicz in the process.Clarke, D.

It is the city's oldest residential neighbourhood and has the largest proportion of heritage-designated homes.  Geography  The West End, located on Kamloops' South Shore (i.e., south of the Thompson River), is generally considered to be the area of Kamloops bounded to the East by 2nd Avenue, to the West by Summit Drive, to the North by Victoria Street West and to the South by Columbia Street. The neighbourhood is not necessarily regarded as the western end of Kamloops itself (the Brocklehurst area of the North Shore lies further to the West), but rather as the western end of the downtown area. Almost the entire West End is zoned residentially and is not home to more than a few businesses.  Topography  thumb thumb The West End is relatively one of the lowest areas of Kamloops, located far below Aberdeen Hills, but the neighbourhood itself is very hilly. Nicola Street West and Clarke Street slope considerably to the west of Lee Road, while Battle Street Hill carries the central and northern portions of the neighbourhood significantly upward toward the College Heights area below Thompson Rivers University. Also notable are the large number of tall, broad deciduous trees planted in yards and along boulevards in the neighbourhood. These contribute to making the West End one of the greenest and shadiest areas of the city.  History and Heritage  thumb thumb During Kamloops' evolution in the 19th century, the West End was the main site of residential settlement in the growing town. The name of Nicola Wagon Road in the neighbourhood bears witness to the fact that the West End was the first concentration of inhabitation in what would become one of British Columbia's most spread-out cities. thumb The West End was home to many of Kamloops' most prominent early citizens, as demonstrated by the size and grandeur of many of the homes. While a number of more modern houses have encroached upon the neighbourhood's elegant atmosphere, wood-panelled and stucco homes remain the norm.  Additional  The neighbourhood is located close to a number of significant Kamloops buildings, including the Old Courthouse, Sacred Heart Cathedral, St. Andrew's on the Square, Stuart Wood Elementary School (the city's first school), the Kamloops Museum and Archives and St. Ann's Academy.

Plot Rob Hanisey (Tyron Leitso) is an unsuccessful writer who has been dumped by his girlfriend Anna. He - after the suicide of the previous tenant, Terry - is accepted to the Highberger House. In the house, Rob experiences strange encounters with a beautiful girl, Valerie (Clare Grant), who asks for his help. The other tenants - especially Patricia Dunbar - are annoyed with the noise he makes when chasing Valerie. Only Bruce Sweetland remains friendly. Valerie asks Rob to save her from the Beast (Tony Todd), but is violently captured and taken inside a wall by a dark supernatural force. This results in more intense episodes of Rob yelling at the wall, which makes the other tenants angrier, except for Bruce and the old Everett Neely (Christopher Lloyd). Bruce and Rob talk about the existence of Valerie, which Bruce finds funny. Rob discovers a manuscript titled Valerie on the Stairs written by Bruce, Patricia and Everett. This discovery infuriates Bruce and he attacks Rob. Later, Valerie appears in Bruce's room, who is stunned that she is alive; the Beast appears and murders Bruce. Rob visits Everett and discovers an old movie poster depicting the Beast. The movie was adapted from the novel of Neil Everest, which turns out to be Everett's real name. Rob confronts him but he denies the existence of the Beast and Valerie. After discovering Bruce's body, Rob is sure that Valerie and the Beast are the creation of Bruce, Patricia and Everett, and they came alive. Angered, Patricia storms off to pack up and leave. Just then, Valerie appears for a last kiss. It turns out that Patricia created Valerie as a love-ideal for her. However, the Beast also murders Patricia. Rob and Everett find her dying, and after a heated argument, Everett confesses that they wrote the whole story together and couldn't stop continuing the torture and the horror, which was Bruce's specialty. Rob breaks a hole in the wall and asks Everett what is there. Everett admits it is The Beast's torture chamber and they fed a lot of unfortunate girls to him. He starts to suspect that Rob must be Bruce's creation, which Rob does not believe. They enter the chamber and find the skeletons of the girls lured inside. One of them is Anna, who murders Everett. Rob finds the Beast and, fighting for Valerie, kills the monster. Rob forces Valerie out into the open against her will and she vaporizes. The police arrive and order Rob to surrender.

The claim is contested by an agnatic descendant of the former royal house, and both claims are clouded by conflicting interpretations of the dynastic laws which governed the succession to the defunct throne of Saxony, and by familial dispute. Dynastic background The family descends from Princess Anna of Saxony (13 December 1929 ‚Äì 13 March 2012) and her husband Roberto Afif (1916‚Äì1978). Anna was a sister of Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, the childless head of the ex-royal House of Saxony and, as such, titular King of Saxony. Of the five children of the late Prince Friedrich Christian (1893‚Äì1968), son and heir of Saxony's last king Friedrich August III (who was obliged to abdicate in 1918 coincident with Germany's surrender in World War I), Anna is the only one who has living, legitimate children. Succession to Saxony's throne was semi-Salic: only if all male dynasts were to become extinct would the female dynast nearest in kinship to the last male, or her descendants, inherit the throne. Both male and female dynasts, however, were required to \\"marry equally\\" (to a member of a reigning, formerly reigning, or mediatized family) in order to transmit dynastic rights to their own descendants. Thus the eligibility of the Saxe-Gessaphe line for the royal Saxon legacy would depend on the dynasticity of their mother's marriage. Lebanese heritage Afif family claimed to belong patrilineally to an ancient princely Maronite Catholic family in what is now Lebanon. Afif, emir in Keserwan and grandson of the Lebanese emir Mansur 'Asaf bin Hasan (1522-1580), is said to be the ancestor of the Christianised dynasty of the cheikhs of Bkassine, from which Roberto Afif was assumed to descend. According to the royal genealogical book series, L'Allemagne dynastique, Princess Anna maintains that her husband's family descend from Suleiman, who was granted the province of Keserwan, north of Beirut, in 1306 by the Mamluks. She further avers that Roberto's father, Alexander Afif (1883-1971), a lifelong resident of Beirut, was a knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and was Prince of \\"Assaph\\" (or Afif-Gessaphe) in Lebanon. Roberto emigrated to Mexico, obtained a law degree, and made his living as a businessman. The family was associated with some of the most prominent Mexican families. Although not as wealthy as they used to be, the family lives an upper middle class life in one of Mexico City's better neighbourhoods, Polanco. Roberto's sister, Alexandra Afif, born in Beirut in 1919, morganatically married Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern (born 1922), in Rome in 1951. Prince Karl Anton was a nephew of Prince Friedrich Christian of Saxony, and is thus a first cousin of Margrave Maria Emanuel and Princess Anna. Designated heir Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1969-1987), of the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin, was killed in a mountain climbing accident while still a youth, leaving his maternal uncle, Margrave Maria Emanuel, without a dynastic heir in the next generation of Wettins. However the eldest son of his sister Anna, Alexander Afif (b. Munich 12 February 1954), had married Princess Gisela of Bavaria (b. 10 September 1964) in 1987. In May 1997 the Margrave, who has upheld the dynasty's marital standards despite its deposition and exile, recognized Alexander Afif as his heir. By formally adopting him two years later, the Margrave conferred upon Alexander the legal surname of \\"Prinz von Sachsen\\" (literally, Prince of Saxony). Thus was created the family of Saxe-Gessaphe, a cognatic offshoot of the royal House of Wettin: With the approval of the Margrave, Alexander, his sons, and his brothers are also known as Princes of Saxe-Gessaphe. In the spring of 1997 it was announced that the surviving male dynasts of the royal House (presumably Princes Albert, Dedo, and Gero) had met and consented to the designation of Alexander as dynastic heir in the event that none of them leave sons by dynastically valid marriages.Die Welt, 20 May 1997 Dispute However the Margrave's brother, Prince Albert, subsequently stated that he did not accept that decision as binding. He preferred that R√ºdiger Prinz von Sachsen, the son of his first cousin the late Prince Timo of Saxony (1923 - 1982) (and R√ºdiger's three sons) succeed to the royal Saxon claim. Since R√ºdiger's mother was a commoner, retroactive \\"de-morganatization\\" of the late Timo's marriage was required to \\"dynasticize\\" his offspring, an act the agnates of the royal house who participated in the 1997 decision did not undertake. In some circumstances German princely law (F√ºrstenrecht) did allow a consensus of dynasts - or the last surviving male dynast - to dynasticize the issue of a morganatic marriage through unanimous and irrevocable action. Albert had become the last prince of the male line when he died on 6 October 2012. However, Saxony's constitution and house law explicitly required that descendants of the royal house had to be born of \\"equal marriage\\" in order to succeed to the throne. Moreover, F√ºrstenrecht, derived from German legal customs, was considered subordinate in applicability to enacted law. Under such circumstances, if Alexander's father and R√ºdiger's mother would not have qualified as \\"equal in birth\\" (ebenb√ºrtig) for purposes of the succession, neither of them might be deemed eligible to become the next pretender to the Saxon royal throne. If, however, the Afif heritage is deemed to have been \\"princely\\", Alexander, at least, may qualify as a dynast without resort to an act of \\"de-morganatization\\". The line of succession within the Saxony-Gessaphe line would be: # Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe (b. 1954) # Prince Georg Philipp of Saxe-Gessaphe (b. 1988), hereditary prince # Prince Moritz of Saxe- Gessaphe (b. 1989) # Prince Paul of Saxe-Gessaphe (b. 1993) The three last are Alexander's sons with Gisela. They also have a daughter, Princess Maria Teresita. The name Saxe-Gessaphe is used also by Alexander's brothers (younger sons of Princess Anna), nephews and nieces (although none of them has yet been officially adopted into the family): * Friedrich Wilhelm Memo Prinz von Sachsen-Gessaphe (b. 1955), interior designer * Karl August Prinz von Sachsen- Gessaphe (b. 1958), professor at the FernUniversit√§t at Hagen, Dr. iur. habil. He married in 1994 Karen Kurth (b. 1962), divorced in 2003, and married in 2011 Anke Lioba Kunert (b. 1978). He has four children: ** Maria Antonia (b. 1994) ** Maria Fernanda Desir√©e (b. 1999) ** Clemens Maria Roberto Quirin (b. 2008) ** Johann Nepomuk Karl Benedikt Maria (b. 2011) In the event that Princess Anna's marriage with Roberto Afif is not deemed dynastically acceptable, the next cognatic heir born of dynastic marriage (and thus potentially a rival to Alexander) might be found in Karl Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern (born 1952) as the grandson of Princess Margaret of Saxony (1900-1962), the eldest aunt of Maria Emanuel.

He published nearly 150 papers during his career and is credited with the first description of Auer rods. Auer also contributed to the study of anaphylaxis and helped develop modern thoracic surgery. During World War I, he conducted wartime research with the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.  Education  The Johns Hopkins Hospital, 1905 John Auer attended the University of Michigan, where he received his B.S in 1898. In 1902, he received his M.D. from the Johns Hopkins University Medical School.  Career  Following graduation from the Hopkins Medical School, Auer served as House Officer at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1902 & 1903. There, he spent time in the ward of Dr. William Osler. In 1903, Auer began at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research as a Research Fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Samuel J. Meltzer, head of the physiology and pharmacology departments. Like many other physicians, Auer was likely attracted there by his interests in research and education. Between 1906 and 1907 he was sent to Harvard Medical School as an Instructor in Physiology so that he could become further specialized in the subject. Returning to New York in 1907, Auer became an Assistant in Physiology at the Rockefeller Institute. He was later promoted to Associate, and finally to Associate Member in Physiology and Pharmacology, a position he held from 1909 to 1921. While at the Rockefeller Institute, he also served as a NY physician. During WWI he was a Major in the Army Reserve Corps and contributed to wartime research conducted at the Rockefeller Institute. In 1921, Auer became a Professor of Pharmacology at the St. Louis University School of Medicine. He later became Departmental Chairman and took up a position as Pharmacologist to the St. Mary's Hospital in St. Louis. He maintained these positions until his death in 1948. During his time in St. Louis, Auer focused on teaching rather than research. In response to his death, the Administrative Board of the St. Louis School of Medicine published a resolution stating he was \\"a scholar of the broadest interests and a human being of the highest nobility.\\"  Private life  John Auer was born in Rochester, New York. While working at the Rockefeller Institute, he met Clara Meltzer, a fellow researcher in the laboratory and daughter of Samuel Meltzer. John and Clara were married in 1903, at which point she discontinued her work in academia. John and Clara had three children; Helen, James and John. Auer enjoyed painting as a hobby and was a fan of Henri Matisse. He was also an adept gardener. John Auer died in St. Mary's Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri from a heart attack.  Research contributions  Auer Rods  Auer rods  In 1903 while working in Osler's ward at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Auer noticed a 21 year old man with a severe nose bleed, throat infection, anemia, and splenomegaly. Upon examination of the young man's blood, Auer noticed needle-like rod forms in some cells, which he believed were lymphocytes. These rods would come to be known as Auer rods. It has since been shown that Auer rods are found in myeloid cells, and it is now thought that they are formed from fused lysosomes. Auer rods are found only in neoplastic cells and are used in the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia, though they do not indicate the prognosis of a patient. There is some controversy in the eponymous nature of Auer rods. Auer is credited with the first descriptions and illustrations of Auer rods in his 1906 publication, \\"Some hitherto undescribed structures found in the large lymphocytes of a case of acute leukemia.\\" As acknowledged by Auer in the paper, the inclusions had been previously noted in a paper authored by Thomas McCrae. Auer also acknowledged McCrae's kindness for supplying Auer with clinical notes on the phenomena. In his paper, McCrae had foretold of Auer's coming publication and more detailed description of the subject. For his contributions, some stipulate that Auer rods should rather be named McCrae-Auer rods.  Anaphylaxis  In Meltzer's laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute, John Auer and Paul Lewis were the first to recognize asphyxiation as the cause of death in anaphylaxis. Before Auer and Lewis's studies, it was believed that anaphylaxis was a reaction of the central nervous system. In pithing the guinea pigs used in their study, Auer and Lewis were able to show that the peripheral nervous system was responsible for the onset of anaphylaxis. They hypothesized that the asphyxiation observed was the result of bronchial spasms. Operating on this idea, they administered atropine to suppress such spasms, and found this treatment to be effective. The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research  Thoracic surgery  In 1908, Auer and Meltzer began studying magnesium sulfate and its application as an anesthetic. They found that injection of the compound would result in a loss of consciousness and total muscle relaxation. Coupled with the continuous inflation of the lungs via an endotracheal tube, one could maintain ventilation of the body while immobilizing the chest. The patient could then be roused from their unconscious state by the administration of calcium chloride. The application was recognized and further developed by Nobel laureate and Rockefeller colleague Alexis Carrel. Carrel used the techniques set forth by Auer and Meltzer to develop the modern methods of thoracic surgery.  Wartime research  During World War I, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was appointed as the United States Army Auxiliary Laboratory, and its focus was adjusted to aid in the war effort. Conducting such research, Auer was the first to establish intravenous magnesium sulfate as a treatment for the convulsions of tetanus.

History Its first description was written by Adrian Hardy Haworth, in Miscellanea naturalia, 1803, p. 189, with the name of Cacalia tomentosa. Haworth stated that he had received the plant, introduced eight years before, from the Stockwell Botanical Garden of his friend Benjamin Robertson.Senecio haworthii - SANBI article Description Growing up to 10-25 cm high, its leaves are remarkably densely felted, so much so that the felt can be stripped off, dried, and used as tinder. The plant is accordingly called \\"tontelbos\\" in Afrikaans. The word means \\"tinder bush\\". Though its flowers are nothing special to look at, the plant is striking, easily grown, and fairly attractive; a plucked stem, or even a leaf, can be stuck into warm, not-too-dry earth, where it will strike root without special attention.

The presidents appear as small profile busts printed in solid-color designs through 50¬¢, and then as black on white images surrounded by colored lettering and ornamentation for $1, $2, and $5 values. Additional stamps in fractional-cent denominations offer busts of Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington, as well as an engraving of the White House. With its total of 32 stamps, this was the largest definitive series yet issued by the U. S. Post Office. In 1933 President Franklin D. Roosevelt, himself a serious stamp collector, fostered the idea of a set of stamps honoring all the deceased past presidents of the United States. A national contest was held in 1937 to choose a designer for the first stamp of the series, the 1-cent George Washington issue. More than eleven hundred entries were submitted, some from famous artists. An artist from New York, Elaine Rawlinson, won the contest. Her design for the 1-cent stamp showed Washington in profile, modeled after a bust by the famous sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, and became the template for the new definitive series issued in 1938.Smithsonian National Postal Museum The Presidential Issues of 1938 The models for the engravings used in the printing of the various issues were obtained from a number of different sources, from paintings to sculptures to bronze statues, all reproduced in a relatively uniform intaglio style on steel dies. The overall stamp design incorporates a solid background of color. On the values up to 50-cents, the name of each subject appears in capital letters to the right of the bust, with the years of his presidential tenure beneath it (no dates are provided for the non- presidents Franklin and Martha Washington). On denominations from 10-cents through 19-cents a single-line border is added, while a double-line border surrounds the values between 20 and 50 cents. The 1, 2 and 5-dollar values have their own design which places colored columns and stars on either side of the black-and-white presidential portrait, and displays the president's name and the dates of his tenure beneath his image.Scotts US Stamp Catalogue, identifierSmithsonian National Postal Museum {style=\\"margin:0.5em auto\\" |+ Selected Issues |- valign=top |Andrew JacksonModel for engraving, Kinney- Scholz bronze statue, in U.S. Capitol |Abraham LincolnPortrait taken from bust of Lincoln by sculptor Sarah Fisher Ames |Chester A. Arthurfrom a marble bust by Augustus Saint-Gaudens |Warren G. HardingEngraving modeled after a medal struck by George Morgan of the US Mint |} Design competition On June 22, 1937, the Treasury Department announced a national design competition for a new regular series of postage stamps, with a submission deadline of September 15, 1937, offering prizes of $500, $300 and $200 for the three top entrants. The panel of judges included philatelic specialists and art experts. Several eliminations took place for the more than eleven hundred submitted designs, and the remaining entries were scored on a graduating scale. From these the first prize went to Elaine Rawlinson of New York City, the second to Charles Bauer of West Orange, New Jersey, third to Edwin Hoyt Austin of Delmar, New York. The winning design is reported to not have been voted in first place by any of the judges. Some entrants submitted multiple designs, among them J.S. Stevenson, an employee of the American Banknote Company (two designs) and Thomas F. Morris, Jr., son of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's first chief of the engraving division (four designs). Issued stamps Stamp with precancel The issued stamps conform to the prize-winning design by Miss Rawlinson, with, as already noted, some modifications in bordering on higher denominations; these, however, are unobtrusive enough so that an impression of overall uniformity is preserved. Values from cent through 50 cents were printed in sheets on a rotary press and perforated 11 x 10, while the two- colored 1, 2 and 5 dollar stamps required flat-plate printing and were perforated 11 on all sides.Scotts Catalogue of US Stamps, Presidential Issue Beyond honoring the presidents, the series, in effect, cunningly encoded the historical position of each in a visual mnemonic: for the first 22 presidents appear on the single cent values in the order of their accession, with George Washington, the first president, on the 1¬¢, James Knox Polk, the eleventh president, on the 11¬¢ and Grover Cleveland, the twenty-second president, on the 22¬¢ stamp. Cleveland's two non-consecutive presidencies disrupt the series, as he stood as both the twenty-second and twenty-fourth president. In strict order, a twenty-four cent stamp should have been excluded from the Prexies‚Äîbut to eliminate this denomination, which had many postal applications, while including the useless twenty-three cent value would have been perverse. Thus, the twenty-third president, Benjamin Harrison, appears on the 24¬¢ stamp, and president number twenty-five, William McKinley restores the alignment on the 25¬¢ denomination. The higher values thereafter part company with the numerical list of presidencies, beginning with Theodore Roosevelt (number twenty-six) on the 30¬¢ denomination. Of the 29 presidents in the series, 12 had never before appeared on a United States postage stamp; and the Prexies also presented four denominations not found on any previous U. S. stamps: 18¬¢, 19¬¢, 21¬¢ and 22¬¢. These and some other values had been included solely for the educational purpose of placing the presidents in proper numerical order: they did not correspond to any current postal rate. As aforesaid, the non-presidential images of Benjamin Franklin, Martha Washington and the White House were used, respectively, on the ¬¢, ¬¢ and ¬¢ values. Apparently, it was not originally planned to match the presidents with their numerical positions, for James Monroe was initially announced as the subject of the ¬¢ stamp. Ironically, given the historical concept behind the series, the prexies departed from tradition in several significant ways. It was the first definitive series of postage stamps since 1870 in which George Washington did NOT appear on the normal letter rate, for numerical order placed Thomas Jefferson on the 3¬¢ value required for letters in 1938. Washington, instead, satisfied the post-card rate on the 1¬¢ stamp‚Äîand this, too, broke with tradition, which had almost invariably presented Franklin on that value. Franklin did, however, as on many previous definitive issues, begin the series, appearing on the ¬¢ stamp, which, in effect, informally honored him as the \\"halfth\\" president. It may be said that several aspects of the Prexies series‚Äîits concept as a painless public history lesson and its egalitarian treatment of all presidents irrespective of their differing achievements‚Äîare very much in accord with the New Deal ethos of the administration that issued it. Coil and booklet stamps John Quincy AdamsCoil stamp w/ vertical perf's Martha WashingtonCoil stamp w/ horizontal perf's On January 20, 1939, nine values were issued in coil form, consisting of all low values from 1¬¢ to 6¬¢, and the 10¬¢, all perforated 10 vertically. On January 27, the four values from 1¬¢ to 3¬¢ were also issued in vertical coil form, perforated 10 horizontally; and that same day, booklets offering the 1¬¢, 2¬¢ and 3¬¢ denominations went on sale, perforated 11 x 10. An Anomalous Watermark A reprinting of the $1 Wilson denomination in 1950 or 1951 inadvertently resulted in the first watermarked U. S. postage stamp issued since 1916. For this printing run, the technicians inadvertently failed to use normal postage stamp paper, but instead employed a batch of revenue-stamp paper watermarked with copies of the logo \\"U S I R.\\" in double-line letters. (When any stamp from this run is immersed in a special watermark-detecting fluid, part of one or more letters becomes visible.) While examples of the watermarked $1 stamp are not inordinately rare, they still command some thirty times the price of normal unwatermarked copies. (U S I R watermarks had last accidentally appeared on U. S. postage stamps in 1895, when revenue paper had been used for some sheets of 6-cent and 8-cent stamps of the definitive issue then current.) The presidential issues was long-lived among United States definitive postal series. It was only after sixteen years, in 1954, that the postal service began to supersede its denominations, gradually replacing them with stamps of the so-called Liberty series over the next several years. Collecting Prexies One of the (difficult) games for Prexie collectors is to find a cover with, for instance, a single 16¬¢ stamp that pays a combination of rate and fees valid during the Prexies' period of usage. Many such covers remain to be discovered; some sellers on eBay have been surprised to discover a seemingly ordinary-looking cover bid up to several hundred dollars because it was one of the sought-after solo usages.

Early life Drasin was born around 1905 in the village of Sorochints√Ø in Poltava Governorate (modern-day Ukraine). Stage career With her dark, exotic looks and throbbing vocal style, Drasin was ideal casting material for European characters in musicals of the 1930s. In Free for All, she was Marishka Tarasov; in Roberta, she was Princess Stephanie of Russian nobility; and in Right This Way and Leave It to Me!, she portrayed Frenchwomen. In all, Drasin appeared in seven musicals, from 1927 to 1938. Music career Besides \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" and another ballad, \\"The Touch of Your Hand\\", in Roberta, Drasin introduced three other standards: \\"I Can Dream, Can't I?\\" and \\"I'll Be Seeing You\\" in Right This Way and \\"Get Out of Town\\" in Leave It to Me!. Death and legacy As I'll Be Seeing You was becoming one of the homefront anthems of World War II, Drasin died in a United Service Organizations plane crash near Lisbon, Portugal, on 22 February 1943. Drasin's story was partially told in the Jane Froman film With a Song in My Heart (1952). Froman suffered serious injuries in the same plane crash and later said that she had given Drasin her seat, which bothered Froman for the rest of her life.

It is essentially the same design as the Wayfarer dinghy, with the addition of a double-hull and a more comfortable cockpit for recreational users. It was produced in Mahone Bay until 1968 when production was moved to the Toronto area. It continued to be produced by a Canadian company (C&L; Boatworks) in Fort Erie, on Lake Erie, which began production in 1993 after being produced by David Waterhouse, Anne Waterhouse and Bob May in Pickering ON from 1969 to 1989. Now in 2018, CL BoatWorks was purchased by Velocity BoatWorks and all CL production has been moved to Belleville, Ontario on the Bay of Quinte. The CL 16 is an open cockpit boat that is extremely seaworthy and unsinkable due to a double hull design. CL16's and their Wayfarer cousins have circumnavigated the Great Lakes, and have crossed the North Sea. They can be easily modified to run a spinnaker and/or trapeze. The CL 14 represents a smaller version of this stable craft, and that design shares dimensions somewhat resembling the Wanderer but lacks an after locker. The design is said to be based upon the Ian Proctor's Wayfarer with tweaks by Graham Dodd and George Blanchard. Unlike the Wayfarer, the class permits use of a trapeze. The boat uses a retractable Centerboard. The sail plan consists of a marconi rig with a main, jib, and symmetrical spinnaker. On the other hand, the iteration that was produced by C&L; Boatworks first appeared in 1968; its strict one design has remained unchanged since then. The mast has a pin through it that acts as a pivot point, which is held in a tabernacle. When rigged with a tackle on the forestay, it can be lowered to pass beneath bridges. The pivot also facilitates mast raising. As of 2013, it has a Portsmouth Yardstick rating of 95.4. The C&L; website says the rating is 97. The CL boatbuilder website differs from a sailmaker's statements about the rig's size. It claims that the boat carries sails that are: Main 95 sq.ft. 8.83 sq.m; Genoa 46 sq.ft. 4.27 sq.m.

Following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012 he assumed the headship of the Royal House of Saxony, based on a 1997 agreement that named him heir, but which was repudiated a few years later by a number of signatories. His claim is disputed by his cousin Prince R√ºdiger of Saxony. Early life and career Born in Munich as Alexander Afif, he is the eldest son of Roberto Afif, Dr. Jur (mentioned as Catholic nobleman of Lebanon) and Princess Anna of Saxony. At birth Alexander did not possess rights to the abolished throne of Saxony (which was regulated by semi-Salic succession) as his parents‚Äô marriage did not meet the equal marriage requirements of the Saxon house law. Alexander legally assumed the surname Prinz von Sachsen-Gessaphe on 25 August 1972. Alexander grew up mainly in Mexico eventually taking over the running of a logistics company from his father. He married Princess Gisela of Bavaria, firstly civilly at Mexico City 3 April 1987 and then religiously at Andechs Abbey 29 August 1987. They have four children: * Prince Georg Philipp of Saxe- Gessaphe (born Mexico City 24 May 1988) * Prince Mauricio Gabriel Robert of Saxe-Gessaphe (born Mexico City 14 Sep 1989) * Prince Paul Clemens of Saxe- Gessaphe (born Mexico City 23 Mar 1993) * Princess Maria Teresita of Saxe- Gessaphe (born Dresden 7 July 1999) His marriage with Gisela enhanced his dynastical potential in the eyes of his maternal uncle, the childless Margrave who was left without a clearly eligible heir when Alexander's first cousin, the young Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1969‚Äì1987), was killed in 1987 in a climbing accident. In February 2003 Alexander began to work in attracting worldwide investors to Saxony, he also worked as an advisor to Georg Milbradt, Minister-President of Free State of Saxony, leaving with Milbradt in 2008. In the Summer of 2004 he received German citizenship. In 2009 he left Germany to resume living in North America (Mexico). In July 2012 Alexander gave a controversial interview where he criticised what he saw as ingratitude and a lack of etiquette on the part of the people in the former East Germany (which includes Saxony). Royal House of Saxony The headship of the Royal House of Saxony is a matter of dispute in the Saxon Royal Family. The conflict stems from the fact that the last undisputed head of the house Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, and his brother Albert had no children whereas their first cousin, Prince Timo, had children (including R√ºdiger) who were not deemed members of the Royal House of Saxony because of Timo's unequal marriage. The first designated dynastic heir of Maria Emanuel was his and Albert's nephew Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, only son of their youngest sister Princess Mathilde of Saxony by her marriage to Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, dynast of a ducal branch of the House of Wettin senior patrilineally to the royal branch. After the early death of Prince Johannes, the childless Maria Emanuel then considered as potential heir another nephew, Alexander Afif, the eldest son of his elder sister Princess Anna of Saxony and her husband Roberto Afif, despite the Afif-Saxony marriage being contrary to the traditional laws of the House of Saxony which required equal marriages for descendants to inherit dynastic rights. On 14 May 1997 the Margrave of Meissen proposed his nephew Alexander Afif as heir and drew up a document that was signed by the other male and female members of the Royal House (including previously non-dynastic spouses of princes) setting out that Alexander would succeed on his death. The document was signed by: Anastasia, Margravine of Meissen, Prince Albert and his wife, n√©e Elmira Henke, Prince Dedo (for himself, his brother Prince Gero and for their stepmother n√©e Virginia Dulon - his brother Prince Timo had died in 1982), the Princesses Maria Josepha, Anna and Mathilde, and Prince Timo's third wife, n√©e Erina Eilts. Two years later on 1 July 1999 the Margrave adopted his nephew Alexander Afif, who had used the title Alexander, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe since 1972, based on his assumed patrilineal descent from the once-sovereign Lebanese \\"Afif\\" (or Gessaphe) dynasty, Emirs of Keserwan, through the Maronite Catholic Cheikhs Afif of Bkassine. The 1997 agreement proved to be controversial and in the summer of 2002 three of the signatories, Princes Albert, Dedo and Gero (the latter consented via proxy but had not personally signed the document) retracted their support for the agreement. The following year Prince Albert wrote that it is through Prince R√ºdiger and his sons that the direct line of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin will continue, and thus avoid becoming extinct. Until his death, however, the Margrave, as head of the former dynasty, continued to regard his nephew and adopted son, Prince Alexander, as the contractual heir entitled to succeed. Immediately following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012, Prince Albert assumed the position of head of the Royal House of Saxony. According to the Eurohistory Journal prior to the Margrave's funeral Albert met with his nephew Alexander and recognised him as Margrave of Meissen. However this claim is contradicted by Albert himself in his final interview, given after the funeral, where he states that he needs recognition as Margrave of Meissen. Prince Alexander, citing the 1997 agreement has also assumed the headship. Albert, Margrave of Meissen died at a hospital in Munich on 6 October 2012 at the age of 77. Prior to the requiem for Margrave Maria Emanuel, R√ºdiger, who had sought to be recognised by his uncle as a dynastic member of the House of Saxony but was refused, conducted a demonstration outside the cathedral with Saxon royalists in protest against the late Margrave Maria Emanuel's decision to appoint Alexander as heir. The family website of Prince R√ºdiger states prior to his death Albert determined R√ºdiger to be his successor and instituted a clear succession plan. On this basis following Albert's death Prince R√ºdiger assumed the headship of the house, having stated \\"We will not accept Prince Alexander as head of house\\". In a joint statement of 23 June 2015, the heads of the three remaining branches of the senior Ernestine line of the House of Wettin, Michael, Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Konrad, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, declared that, according to the historical princely and house laws of the House of Wettin, Alexander Prinz von Sachsen (formerly Alexander Prinz von Saxe-Gessaphe, aka Alexander Afif Prince of Gessaphe aka Alexander Afif), bearing the name Prinz von Sachsen by adoption, is not a noble and bears a non-noble name, is not a member of the House of Wettin, nor did he succeed the Margrave Maria Emanuel of Meissen, Prince and Duke of Saxony, at his death on 23 July 2012 as head of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin (the Royal House of Saxony), nor have the right to assume the title of the Head of House, Margrave of Meissen.\\"Joint Statement by the heads of the House of Wettin of 23 June 2015 Ancestry References External links * Webpage of the Royal House of Saxony, the Wettin dynasty * Descendants of Alexander Afif, Prince de Gessaphe (1883-1971) Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Lebanese Roman Catholics Category:Nobility from Munich Category:Saxon princes Category:House of Saxe- Gessaphe Category:Recipients of the Order of the Rue Crown Category:Recipients of the Military Order of St. Henry Category:Grand Crosses of the Military Order of St. Henry Category:Recipients of the Albert Order Category:Grand Crosses of the Albert Order Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Hubert Category:Knights of the Order of Parfaite Amiti√© Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria Category:German Roman Catholics ","title":"Alexander, Margrave of Meissen"},{"id":"8138918","text":"IslamicTorrents was a BitTorrent tracker that focused mainly on Islamic and Islam-related materials.

Sand Ridge is to the right, Bald Eagle Mountain is on the left, and Interstate 80 is in-between. Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir located at Bald Eagle State Park can be seen at the top left. The Nittany Valley is an eroded anticlinal valley in the central portion of Centre County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is separated from the Bald Eagle Valley by Bald Eagle Mountain and from Penns Valley by Mount Nittany. The valley is closed to the north by a high plateau that joins these two mountain ridges, but is open to the south at the southern terminus of Mount Nittany. The valley drains to the Bald Eagle Creek through water gaps in Bald Eagle Mountain formed by Spring Creek, and Fishing Creek, along with smaller streams running through Curtain Gap and Howard Gap. The Northwest side of the valley between the Bald Eagle Mountain ridge and the lower Sand Ridge is also known as the \\"Little Nittany Valley\\". The valley has a mixture of farmland, woodlots, and a number of working and abandoned quarries. Bellefonte, the county seat of Centre County, is the largest municipality completely within the valley. The Pennsylvania State Correctional Institution - Rockview, the Nittany Mall, the Pennsylvania Transportation Institute and University Park Airport are large facilities located in the valley. State College, Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania State University main University Park campus lie at the southern end of the Nittany and Penns Valleys, and this area is also known as \\"Happy Valley\\". Transportation The Keystone Shortway, now Interstate 80, runs diagonally across the Nittany Valley on a west to east line, from Curtin Gap east of Milesburg, Pennsylvania, to a natural gap in Mount Nittany and then via a deep rock cut along the Long Run stream. The Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad short line spur that enters the valley from Milesburg, then runs along Spring Creek to Bellefonte, splits, with a track going northeast to Pleasant Gap and another going southwest to Lemont and State College. The spur to Bellefonte follows Pennsylvania Route 144 and the line from Lemont to Pleasant Gap follows Pennsylvania Route 26. Route 26 is the primary north to south route through the valley, and the Interstate 99 extension will also run along its new alignment to I 80. Geology of Nittany Valley Nittany Valley is in the western part of the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian Mountains. During the Appalachian orogeny, the sedimentary rock layers folded up into the Nittany Arch anticline. The arch was an ancient Himalayan scale mountain that towered above what is now the valley. The oldest rock layers from deep within the eroded mountain are now exposed on Sand Ridge in the middle of the valley. Younger rocks from the outer layers of the arch are exposed on the West side of the Bald Eagle ridge in the Bald Eagle Valley, with the youngest across that valley at the foot of the Allegheny Front. The Nittany Valley, formed in the area where the mountain once stood, is an example of inverse topography.

He twice won election to the Virginia House of Delegates, and also served during the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia (1860 to 1864), and in the Second Confederate Congress from (1864 to 1865). The Political Graveyard His son Andrew Jackson Montague became Governor of Virginia and a U.S. Congressman, and grandson Robert Latane Montague rose to become a general in the U.S. Marine Corps after receiving the Distinguished Service Cross in World War I. Early and family life Montague was born at Ellaslee plantation, Jamaica, Virginia to Lewis Brooke Montague (1793-1868) and his wife the former Catherine Street Jesse (1803-1852). The family traced its descent from Peter Montague who emigrated from Boveney, England to the Jamestown Colony in 1621http://www.montaguemillennium.com/history/montague/america/peter_lineage/1-pm1603.html. Montague attended Fleetwood Academy in King and Queen County for two terms.\\"Robert L. Montague\\" in Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography digitized in 2000 available at https://archive.org/stream/encyclopediaofvi03tyleuoft/ He then read law with Judge Lomax in Fredericksburg, Virginia, but later decided to continue studies under Nathaniel Beverly Tucker at the College of William and Mary, from which he received a legal degree in July 1842.David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler (eds), The American Civil War-A Political, Social, and Military History, Vol. 1, pp. 1350-51 Robert L. Montague married Cornelia Gay Eubank on December 14, 1852. Although at least four of their children died young, three sons survived into adulthood: Julieus Drew Montague, Andrew Jackson Montague, and Robert Lynch Montague.Although Montague's name was spelled creatively on many censuses, the 1860 census for Middlesex County, Virginia listed lawyer Robert S. Montague (who owned 15,000 in real estate and 18,536 in personal estate including slaves, by far the largest amount on the page) and his wife as living together with his 67 year old father Lewis B. Montague, his 18 year old brother A.J. Montague, as well as overseer Richard Lane (age 52), and children J.D. Montague(6 years old), A.S. Montague (2 years), P.E. Montague (2 months); the children of farmer R.H. Montague (possibly a relative) and F.A. Montague as Charles (b. 1853), Gabriel (b. 1855), William (b. 1857 and Robert (b. 1859). Virginia's 1860 slave schedule is not available online, but Robert L. Montague is apparently listed in both Middlesex and nearby Essex County Career After admission to the Virginia bar, Montague established his legal practice in Middlesex County. When he earned enough money to buy a plantation, he began farming using enslaved labor, in addition to his legal practice. He became politically active as a Democrat campaigning for James Polk in the Presidential Campaign of 1844.http://www.montaguefamilyassociation.com/TNG/getperson.php?personID=I4613&tree;=0001 Voters in Mathews and Middlesex Counties elected him to represent them in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1850, but two years later he instead ran for (and was elected) Commonwealth Attorney, which position he held until 1860, having won re-election several times. Voters from Mathews and Middlesex Counties elected him as a delegate to the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, and he became the Convention's President after John Janney resigned on November 16, 1861. He was an ardent defender of slavery and secessionist, and was physically in the president's chair when the ordinance of secession passed. Briefly during the American Civil War, Montague led both legislative bodies meeting in Richmond. Elected Virginia's Lieutenant Governor in 1861 (and polling 5000 more votes than John Lechter who led the ticket and was elected Governor of Virginia), Montague served ex officio as President of the Virginia Senate beginning in 1861 until December 21, 1863, when he became one of Virginia's delegates to the Confederate States Congress (1864-1865). His youngest (and favorite) brother, Andrew Jackson Montague, while a cadet at the Virginia Military Institute, volunteered to defend Richmond, and died during the Battle of Gaines' Mill in 1862. After the war, in 1871, Middlesex County voters again elected him to represent them in the House of Delegates. He represented Middlesex County for one term, before fellow legislators elected him in 1875 to an eight-year term as a judge of the 8th Circuit Court, which he died before finishing.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978), pp. xvii, xxx, 444, 472, 474, 475, 481, 486, 518 Death and legacy Judge Montague died at home of erysipelas1880 U.S. Census death schedule for Middlesex County, Virginia; he is the only entry on the page with that cause of death on March 2, 1880, and was succeeded as judge of the 8th Circuit by Benjamin W. Lacy. A prominent Baptist (and moderator of the state's Baptist General Association), he was initially buried at Inglewood. However, he was eventually reburied in the family plot at the historic cemetery of Christ Episcopal Church in Middlesex county.

During development, these cells will differentiate into primordial germ cells, migrate to the location of the gonad, and form the germline of the animal. Creation of germ plasm and primordial germ cells Cleavage in most animals segregates cells containing germ plasm from other cells. The germ plasm effectively turns off gene expression to render the genome of the cell inert. Cells expressing germ plasm become primordial germ cells (PGCs) which will then give rise to the gametes. The germ line development in mammals, on the other hand, occurs by induction and not by an endogenous germ plasm. Germ plasm in fruit fly Germ plasm has been studied in detail in Drosophila. The posterior pole of the embryo contains necessary materials for the fertility of the fly. This cytoplasm, pole plasm, contains specialized materials called polar granules and the pole cells are the precursors to primordial germ cells. Pole plasm is organized by and contains the proteins and mRNA of the posterior group genes (such as oskar, nanos gene, Tudor, vasa, and Valois). These genes play a role in germ line development to localize nanos mRNA to the posterior and localize germ cell determinants. Drosophila progeny with mutations in these genes fail to produce pole cells and are thus sterile, giving these mutations the name 'grandchildless'. The genes Oskar, nanos and germ cell-less (gcl) have important roles. Oskar is sufficient to recruit the other genes to form functional germ plasm. Nanos is required to prevent mitosis and somatic differentiation and for the pole cells to migrate to function as PGCs (see next section). Gcl is necessary (but not sufficient) for pole cell formation. In addition to these genes, Pgc polar granule component blocks phosphorylation and consequently activation of RNA polymerase II and shuts down transcription. Germ plasm in amphibians Similar germ plasm has been identified in Amphibians in the polar cytoplasm at the vegetal pole. This cytoplasm moves to the bottom of the blastocoel and eventually ends up as its own subset of endodermal cells. While specified to produce germ cells, the germ plasm does not irreversibly commit these cells to produce gametes and no other cell type. Migration of primordial germ cells Fruit flies The first phase of migration in Drosophila occurs when the pole cells move passively and infold into the midgut invagination. Active migration occurs through repellents and attractants. The expression of wunen in the endoderm repels the PGCs out. The expression of columbus and hedgehog attracts the PGCs to the mesodermal precursors of the gonad. Nanos is required during migration. Regardless of PGC injection site, PGCs are able to correctly migrate to their target sites. Zebrafish In zebrafish, the PGCs express two CXCR4 transmembrane receptor proteins. The signaling system involving this protein and its ligand, Sdf1, is necessary and sufficient to direct PGC migration in fish. Frogs In frogs, the PGCs migrate along the mesentery to the gonadal mesoderm facilitated by orientated extracellular matrix with fibronectin. There is also evidence for the CXCR4/Sdf1 system in frogs. Birds In birds, the PGCs arise from the epiblast and migrate to anteriorly of the primitive streak to the germinal crest. From there, they use blood vessels to find their way to the gonad. The CXCR4/Sdf1 system is also used, though may not be the only method necessary. Mammals In the mouse, primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise in the posterior primitive streak of the embryo and start to migrate around 6.25 days after conception. PGCs start to migrate to the embryonic endoderm and then to the hindgut and finally towards the future genital ridges where the somatic gonadal precursors reside. This migration requires a series of attractant and repellent cues as well as a number of adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin and Œ≤1-Integrin to guide the migration of PGCs. Around 10 days post conception; the PGCs occupy the genital ridge where they begin to lose their motility and polarized shape. Germline development in mammals Mammalian PGCs are specified by signalling between cells (induction), rather than by the segregation of germ plasm as the embryo divides. In mice, PGCs originate from the proximal epiblast, close to the extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE), of the post-implantation embryo as early as embryonic day 6.5. By E7.5 a founding population of approximately 40 PGCs are generated in this region of the epiblast in the developing mouse embryo. The epiblast, however, also give rise to somatic cell lineages that make up the embryo proper; including the endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm. The specification of primordial germ cells in mammals is mainly attributed to the downstream functions of two signaling pathways; the BMP signaling pathway and the canonical WNT/Œ≤-catenin pathway. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is released by the extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE) at embryonic day 5.5 to 5.75 directly adjacent to the epiblast and causes the region of the epiblast nearest to the ExE to express Blimp1 and Prdm14 in a dose-dependent manner. This is evident as the number of PGCs forming in the epiblast decreases in proportion to the loss of BMP4 alleles. BMP4 acts through its downstream intercellular transcription factors SMAD1 and SMAD5. During approximately the same time, WNT3 starts to be expressed in the posterior visceral endoderm of the epiblast. WNT3 signalling has been shown to be essential in order for the epiblast to acquire responsiveness to the BMP4 signal from the ExE. WNT3 mutants fail to establish a primordial germ cell population, but this can be restored with exogenous WNT activity. The WNT3/Œ≤-catenin signalling pathway is essential for the expression of the transcription factor T (Brachyury), a transcription factor that is was previously characterized somatic and mesoderm specific genes. T was recently found to be both necessary and sufficient to induce the expression of the known PGC specification genes Blimp1 and Prdm14. The induction of Transcription Factor T was seen 12 hours after BMP/WNT signaling, as opposed to the 24 to 36 hours it took for Blimp1 and Prdm14 genes to be expressed. Transcription factor T acts upstream of BLIMP1 and Prdm14 in PGC specification by binding to the genes respective enhancer elements. It is important to note that while T can activate the expression of Blimp1 and Prdm14 in the absence of both BMP4 and WNT3, pre-exposure of PGC progenitors to WNTs (without BMP4) prevents T from activating these genes. Details on how BMP4 prevents T from inducing mesodermal genes, and only activate PGC specification genes, remain unclear. Expression of Blimp1 is the earliest known marker of PGC specification. A mutation in the Blimp1 gene results in the formation of PGC-like cells at embryonic day 8.5 that closely resemble their neighbouring somatic cells. A central role of Blimp 1 is the induction of Tcfap2c, a helix-span helix transcription factor. Tcfap2c mutants exhibited an early loss of primordial germ cells. Tcfap2c is thought to repress somatic gene expression, including the mesodermal marker Hoxb1. So, Blimp1, Tcfap2c and Prdm14 together are able to activate and repress the transcription of all the necessary genes to regulate PGC specification. Mutation of Prdm14 results in the formation of PGCs that are lost by embryonic day 11.5. The loss of PGCs in the Prdm14 mutant is due to failure in global erasure of histone 3 methylation patterns. Blimp1 and Prdm14 also elicit another epigenetic event that causes global DNA demethylation. Other notable genes positively regulated by Blimp1 and Prdm14 are: Sox2, Nanos3, Nanog, Stella and Fragilis. At the same time, Blimp1 and Prdm14 also repress the transcription of programs that drive somatic differentiation by inhibiting transcription of the Hox family genes. In this way, Blimp1 and Prdm14 drive PGC specification by promoting germ line development and potential pluripotency transcriptional programs while also keeping the cells from taking on a somatic fate. Generation of mammalian PGCs in vitro With the vast knowledge about in-vivo PGC specification collected over the last few decades, several attempts to generate in-vitro PGCs from post-implantation epiblast were made. Various groups were able to successfully generate PGC-like cells, cultured in the presence of BMP4 and various cytokines. The efficiency of this process was later enhanced by the addition of stem cell factor (SCF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and BMP8B. PGC-like cells generated using this method can be transplanted into a gonad, where the differentiate, and are able to give viable gametes and offspring in vivo. PGC-like cells can also be generated from na√Øve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that are cultured for two days in the presence of FGF and Activin-A to adopt an epiblast-like state. These cells are then cultured with BMP4, BMP8B, EGF, LIF and SCF and various cytokines for four more days. These in-vitro generated PGCs can also develop into viable gametes and offspring. Differentiation of primordial germ cells Prior to their arrival at the gonads, PGCs express pluripotency factors, generate pluripotent cell lines in cell culture (known as EG cells,) and can produce multi-lineage tumors, known as teratomas. Similar findings in other vertebrates indicate that PGCs are not yet irreversibly committed to produce gametes, and no other cell type. On arrival at the gonads, human and mouse PGCs activate widely conserved germ cell-specific factors, and subsequently down-regulate the expression of pluripotency factors. This transition results in the determination of germ cells, a form of cell commitment that is no longer reversible. Prior to their occupation of the genital ridge, there is no known difference between XX and XY PGCs. However, once migration is complete and germ cell determination has occurred, these germline cells begin to differentiate according to the gonadal niche. Early male differentiation Male PGCs become known as gonocytes once they cease migration and undergo mitosis. The term gonocyte is generally used to describe all stages post PGC until the gonocytes differentiate into spermatogonia. Anatomically, gonocytes can be identified as large, euchromatic cells that often have two nucleoli in the nucleus. In the male genital ridge, transient Sry expression causes supporting cells to differentiate into Sertoli cells which then act as the organizing center for testis differentiation. Point mutations or deletions in the human or mouse Sry coding region can lead to female development in XY individuals. Sertoli cells also act to prevent gonocytes from differentiating prematurely. They produce the enzyme CYP26B1 to counteract surrounding retinoic acid. Retinoic acid acts as a signal to the gonocytes to enter meiosis. The gonocyte and Sertoli cells have been shown to form gap and desmosomelike junctions as well as adherins junctions composed of cadherins and connexins. To differentiate into spermatogonia, the gonocytes must lose their junctions to Sertoli cells and become migratory once again. They migrate to the basement membrane of the seminiferous cord and differentiate. Late differentiation In the gonads, the germ cells undergo either spermatogenesis or oogenesis depending on whether the sex is male or female respectively. Spermatogenesis Mitotic germ stem cells, spermatogonia, divide by mitosis to produce spermatocytes committed to meiosis. The spermatocytes divide by meiosis to form spermatids. The post- meiotic spermatids differentiate through spermiogenesis to become mature and functional spermatozoa. Spermatogenic cells at different stages of development in the mouse have a frequency of mutation that is 5 to 10-fold lower than the mutation frequency in somatic cells. In Drosophila, the ability of premeiotic male germ line cells to repair double-strand breaks declines dramatically with age. In mouse, spermatogenesis declines with advancing paternal age likely due to an increased frequency of meiotic errors. Oogenesis Mitotic germ stem cells, oogonia, divide by mitosis to produce primary oocytes committed to meiosis. Unlike sperm production, oocyte production is not continuous. These primary oocytes begin meiosis but pause in diplotene of meiosis I while in the embryo. All of the oogonia and many primary oocytes die before birth. After puberty in primates, small groups of oocytes and follicles prepare for ovulation by advancing to metaphase II. Only after fertilization is meiosis completed. Meiosis is asymmetric producing polar bodies and oocytes with large amounts of material for embryonic development. The mutation frequency of female mouse germ line cells, like male germ line cells, is also lower than that of somatic cells. Low germ line mutation frequency appears to be due, in part, to elevated levels of DNA repair enzymes that remove potentially mutagenic DNA damages. Enhanced genetic integrity may be a fundamental characteristic of germ line development.

It connects the hamlet of Gulph in the town of Frankfort to the village of Frankfort by way of the Frankfort Gorge. Its western end is at the junction of County Route 145 (CR 145) and CR 185 southeast of Gulph. The eastern end is to the east at an intersection with Main Street in Frankfort village. NY 171 is a narrow, two- lane highway for its whole length. NY 171 is the only signed state highway in New York that does not intersect any other signed New York state routes. However, this was not always the case. When it was originally assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, Main Street in Frankfort was part of NY 5S. A new freeway alignment for NY 5S was constructed between Utica and Ilion in the late 1960s, isolating NY 171 from the remainder of the state highway system. Frankfort's interchange with NY 5S is now at Cemetery Street, to the west. Route description reassurance and reference markers on NY 171 eastbound in Gulph NY 171 begins at an intersection with CR 145 (Ball Road) and CR 185 (Gulph Road) southeast of the hamlet of Gulph. The route heads eastward, passing through a dense forest in the town of Frankfort. The forest surrounds NY 171 for a substantial distance, separating it from more developed areas of the town. The highway eventually turns to the northeast, following a winding, curve-filled route that leads through the Frankfort Gorge towards the village of Frankfort. As it heads through the valley, NY 171 intersects with CR 13, known locally as Furnace Road. CR 13 and NY 171 parallel for a short distance as CR 13 climbs the north face of the gorge and then turns northward at its top. The route then passes under a series of power lines, loosely paralleling the more northerly CR 96 (Higby Road) to the outskirts of the village of Frankfort. Here, NY 171 intersects with several roads of local importance before crossing over the NY 5S freeway to enter the village itself. On the eastern side of the highway, NY 171 becomes South Litchfield Street and passes through areas that are mostly residential. It continues to the village's central business district. State maintenance of the route ends at a junction with Canal Street. but the route continues as a village-maintained highway for one more block to an intersection with Main Street. History NY 171 crossing a bridge in Frankfort Most of what is now NY 171 was improved to state highway standards as part of a project contracted out by the state of New York on July 12, 1916. The work covered the of the route outside of the Frankfort village limits. The reconstruction was completed in the 1920s, and the Frankfort Gorge road was added to the state highway system as unsigned State Highway 1346 (SH 1346) by 1926. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, SH 1346 became part of NY 171, which continued northeast to Main Street in Frankfort on several state and locally maintained streets. At the time, Main Street was part of NY 5S, another route assigned as part of the renumbering. In the late 1960s, a limited-access highway was constructed between Utica and Ilion alongside NY 5S. The new highway became part of a rerouted NY 5S in the early 1970s. As a result, NY 171, which does not interchange with the highway, no longer connects to any other signed state routes. NY 171 is the only signed state highway in New York that is completely isolated from the remainder of the state highway system.

After her father was condemned for treason, she was exiled and eventually killed, possibly on Caracalla's orders. She was related to Julius Caesar's first wife Cornelia. Birth and family Plautilla was born and raised in Rome. She belonged to the gens Fulvia of ancient Rome. The Fulvius family was of plebeian origin, came from Tusculum, Italy and had been active in politics since the Roman Republic. Her mother was named Hortensia; her father was Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, the Commander of the Praetorian Guard, consul, paternal first cousin and close ally to Roman Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus (the father of Caracalla). She also had a brother, Gaius Fulvius Plautius Hortensianus. Severus and Plautianus arranged for Plautilla and Caracalla to be married in a lavish ceremony in April 202. The forced marriage proved to be very unhappy; Caracalla despised her. According to Cassius Dio, Plautilla had a profligate character. According to numismatic evidence, Plautilla bore Caracalla a daughter whose name is unknown in 204. In the same year, her father-in-law ordered the erection of the Arch of Septimius Severus, honoring himself and his family, including his wife, Empress Julia Domna, Caracalla, Plautilla and her brother-in-law Publius Septimius Geta.

It was the predecessor of DOSAAF. Stamp of Osoaviakhim The sign \\"Strengthen the Defense of the Soviet Union\\" History In 1920, during the Civil War, the Military Scientific Society was created as a voluntary defense organization in the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. This would later be renamed the Society for the Assistance of the Defense of the Soviet Union (OSO). A few years later, in the summer of 1925, the Aviakhim society was formed through the merger of the Society of Friends of the Air Fleet and the Society of Friends of Chemical Defense and the Chemical Industry (Dobrokhim). On January 23, 1927, at the joint meeting of the First All-Union Congress of Aviakhim and the Second Plenary Session of the Central Council of the Society for the Assistance of the Defense on the report of the People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs Kliment Voroshilov, it was decided to merge the two societies into one under the name Aviakhim-OSO. Over time, it was renamed to the \\"Society for Assistance to the Defense and Aviation-Chemical Construction of the Soviet Union\\", abbreviated Osoaviakhim of the Soviet Union. On February 10, 1927, Osoaviakhim's first conference in Moscow took place. In 1931, the All-Union Physical Culture Complex program \\"Ready for Labour and Defense of the Soviet Union\\" was introduced in the country. In 1932, at Moscow Aviation Plant No. 22, the country's first public aviation school was created by the Osoaviakhim and Komsomol organizations, which trained pilots and other aviation specialists for the job. It had six sections: flight, glider, aircraft engine, parachute, glisser, model aircraft, and a group for the design and construction of sports aircraft. On October 29, 1932, the Presidium of the Central Council of Osoaviakhim of the Soviet Union and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic approved the provision on the creation of the title Voroshilov Shooter, and on December 29, 1932, the badge Voroshilov Shooter. The magazine \\"Voroshilov Shooter\\" started publication. In 1933, the first parachute squad was created at Krasnaya Presnya in the Bolshevik confectionery factory, which laid the foundation for mass parachuting in the country. At the factory Red Manufactory, the country's first female parachute sanitary squad was organized, which included 20 employees of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth Union, and the Central Council of Osoaviakhim. The squad and factory received the collective title and sign \\"Fortress of Defense\\". It was awarded to teams of factories and factories, which, with the successful implementation of production plans, achieved widespread youth engagement in military affairs and the development of physical education. On March 10, 1934, the Central Council of Osoaviakhim approved the new regulation on the Voroshilov Shooter badge, establishing the 1st and 2nd classes, and in July of the same year, the regulation on the Young Voroshilov Shooter badge. In April 1934, the country's first title \\"Fortress of Defense\\" was awarded to the Valerian Kuybyshev Electric Plant, whose Osoaviakhim organization achieved high performance in its activities. In the autumn of 1934, the country's first club of Voroshilov Shooters opened in the Bauman district. This club was honored to represent the Defense Society for the first time at international competitions ‚Äì the teams of the Voroshilov Riflemen Club and the team of the Portsmouth Rifle Club of the United States met. Muscovites won against American shooters by 207 points. On August 13, 1934, Moscow sportswoman Nina K√°mneva made a record parachute jump. She left the plane at an altitude of 3,000 m and opened a parachute 200 m from the ground. On September 20, 1934, in the newspaper of the Defense Society, On Guard, published the standards of the complex \\"Ready for Air Defense and Chemical Defense\\". On November 19, 1935, the Presidium of the Central Council of Osoaviakhim approved the Regulation on the primary organization of Osoaviakhim. In the summer of 1936, the Central Council of Osoaviakhim, taking into account the massive nature of the work on passing the standards \\"Ready for Air Defense and Chemical Defense\\", introduced the standards \\"Ready for Air Defense and Chemical Defense\\" of the 2nd class. On August 1, 1936, the standards \\"Ready for Air Defense and Chemical Defense\\" for the Voroshilov Shooter badge of the 2nd stage required the use of a combat rifle. At the first All-Union shooting competitions of pioneers and schoolchildren ‚Äì young Voroshilov shooters and Muscovites were the first in the team standings. The sign of Osoaviakhim on the facade of house 17 on Polozov street in Saint Petersburg. On January 28, 1937, the Presidium of the Central Council of Osoaviakhim introduced standards for the collective mark \\"Ready for Air Defense and Chemical Defense\\" for the primary organizations of the Residential Home Society, and at the beginning of next year, the standards for primary Osoaviakhim organizations of educational institutions were approved. The sign was wall-mounted and hung on the facades of buildings. The first organization in Moscow to pass \\"Ready for Air Defense and Chemical Defense\\" was the Institute of Cooperative Trade. On May 8, 1938, the Moscow Osoaviakhim member Mikhail Zyurin set the first world record of Soviet aircraft models that was officially recognized by the International Aviation Federation. His model, equipped with a gasoline engine, flew 21.857 km in a straight line. Osoaviakhim Lottery Ticket, 1941 Osoaviakhim Lottery Ticket. The reverse side of the lottery In 1939, the Osoaviakhim in Moscow had 23 regional organizations of the Society, a record-glider detachment, the Rostokinsky regional glider club, Baumansky, Leningradsky, Leninsky, Oktyabrsky, Proletarsky, Sverdlovsky, Stalinsky, Tagansky regional flying clubs, aero club Mosmetrostroy, city air and chemical Defense school, city maritime school, city rifle school, and the Osoaviakhim camps \\"Cheryomushki\\", \\"Veshnyaki\\", \\"Pushkinskoe\\". On August 27, 1940, the Central Council of Osoaviakhim adopted a decree: \\"On the Restructuring of Military Training of the Members of Osoaviakhim\\". The transition from a circle system to classes in training units began. Groups, teams, and squads were created. In 1939‚Äì1940, 3,248 self-defense groups were trained in the Osoaviakhim organizations of the capital, 1,138 air defense and anti-chemical defense posts were created, 6,000 commanders of self-defense posts and groups were assigned. In 1940, over 770 thousand residents of the city were prepared for air defense and chemical defense. At the beginning of 1941, in Moscow there were more than 4,000 groups, over 100 teams, and about 230 detachments in the Osoaviakhim. They trained 81 thousand people. In June 1941, in Moscow, there were 6,790 primary organizations of Osoaviakhim and 860 thousand members of the Society. In July 1941, the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union charged Osoaviakhim with the responsibility to organize universal mandatory preparation of the population for air defense. On September 17, 1941, the Resolution of the State Defense Committee, \\"On Universal Compulsory Military Education of Citizens of the Soviet Union\\" (16 to 50 years old), was issued. The Osoaviakhim certificate was issued in 1941 to the 16-year-old defender of Moscow, Harry Bargais, about the completion of the sniper course In October‚ÄìNovember 1941, training and shooting centers and shooting clubs were established in Krasnopresnensky, October, Pervomaisk, Stalin and Tagansky districts. In January 1942, training and shooting centers were deployed in all regional organizations of the Society. Over the course of the year, over 25,000 specialists were trained ‚Äì machine gunners, snipers, tank destroyers, and Voroshilov riflemen. Each training and shooting center had a summer and winter camp, a firing range with a shooting distance of at least 800 m, a ski base, training fields, engineering and sapper towns, and training rooms. The main base of training and shooting centers of the Moscow city organization of Osoaviakhim were Mytishchi and Rumyantsev training grounds meeting the above requirements. At the beginning of 1943, the primary organizations of Osoaviakhim began to create units, platoons, companies, and battalions, which became the main organizational form of military training and military education of citizens. In 1941‚Äì1945, during World War II, the following educational and sports organizations of the city council of Osoaviakhim operated in Moscow: 1st and 2nd training and shooting centers, sniper school, naval school, 1st, 2nd and 3rd air defense and chemical defense schools, 1st and 2nd communication schools, car club, a central communications school, radio House, glider club, cavalry school, service dog club, and the Mytishchi and Rumyantsev training grounds. The Osoaviakhim in Moscow trained more than 383 thousand military specialists, including snipers ‚Äì 11,233, signalmen ‚Äì 6,332, easel machine gunners ‚Äì 23,005, manual machine gunners ‚Äì 42,671, submachine gunners ‚Äì 33,102, mortar men ‚Äì 15,283, tank destroyers ‚Äì 12,286, and armored gunners ‚Äì 668. The service dog breeding club raised, trained, and transferred 1,825 service dogs to the Red Army. More than 3 million Muscovites received training in air defense and chemical defense at Osoaviakhim organizations. Moscow Osoaviakhim members raised 3,350,000 rubles of funds for a convoy of KV tanks and more than 1 million rubles for the construction of six IL-2 attack aircraft. The activities of the Moscow's Osoaviakhim during the Great Patriotic War were highly appreciated by the Central Council of the Special Meeting, which awarded it with the Red Banner that was forever left in the capital's organization of the Society. At the beginning of 1945, in Moscow, in the constantly operating formations of Osoaviakhim, there were 183 companies that consolidated into 41 battalions. In 1946, the Moscow City Shooting Sports Club was established. On April 1, 1947, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd city flying clubs were established. On May 20, 1947, the Moscow City Radio Club was established. In 1947, four auto clubs were formed to train specialists for the Armed Forces ‚Äì Dzerzhinsky, Kiev, Kuibyshevsky, Proletarsky. On January 16, 1948, by Decree of the Council of Ministers No. 77, Osoaviakhim was divided into three voluntary societies ‚Äì the Voluntary Society for the Assistance to the Army, the Voluntary Society for the Assistance to Aviation, and the Voluntary Society for the Assistance to the Fleet. In 1948, the first Moscow city conferences of the Voluntary Army Assistance Society, the Voluntary Aviation Assistance Society, and the Voluntary Fleet Assistance Society were held on June 26, 28, and 29. The 1st and 2nd naval clubs and the city naval training center worked in Moscow. Since 1951, Osoaviakhim was renamed to the All-Union Voluntary Society for Assisting the Army, Aviation and Navy ‚Äì DOSAAF.

Published as Op. 22, it was first performed in Christiania on 10 April 1872. An orchestral suite compiled by Grieg from the main work and published as Op. 56 was premiered in Oslo on 5 November 1892 and revised by the composer the same year. The full work consists of nine parts; five are purely orchestral, and four are scored for tenor or baritone, male chorus, and orchestra. Three of the instrumental pieces comprise the suite. The first of these, entitled \\"In the King's Hall\\", is a prelude in ternary form which opens with a bassoon and clarinet theme played against plucked strings. The musical material of the exterior sections comes from the trio of a gavotte for piano that Grieg composed in 1867 and left unpublished. The second, \\"Borghild's Dream\\", is an intermezzo contrasting a sensitive string melody with an agitated section. The third, \\"Homage March\\", opens with trumpet fanfares before presenting its main subject, a martial theme, on four cellos.

The letters are organized to keep vowels and high-point/high value tiles (Q, J, Z, X, K, S and blanks) along the same 'sight-line' rather than in a strictly alphabetical format. There is no 'standard' way of arranging letters on a tracking grid, nor any rules that dictate one style over another. Tile tracking is a technique most commonly associated with the game of Scrabble and similar word games. It refers to the practice of keeping track of letters played on the game board, typically by crossing letters off a score sheet or tracking grid as the tiles are played. Tracking tiles can be an important aid to strategy, especially during the endgame when there are no tiles left to draw, where careful tracking allows each player to deduce the remaining unseen letters on the opponent's final rack. The marking off of each letter from a pre-printed tracking grid as the tiles are played is a standard feature of tournament play. Tracking sheets come in many varieties, and are often customized by players in an attempt to make the manual process of recording, tracking and counting tiles easier, more intuitive, and less prone to error. Tile-tracking tools Accurate tile-tracking depends upon knowing the total letter distribution and letter frequency of the game and then reproducing each tile in its correct frequency to facilitate the \\"accounting\\" of each letter as tiles are played. Pre-printed forms are popular for Scrabble games because they eliminate the need to continuously create such a list for each new game. While Scrabble-branded 'tracker sheets' are available for purchase, customized tracking sheets of all types can be found freely available for downloading online, usually in .pdf format to facilitate printing. Scrabble club websites are the most common source for free pre- printed tracking sheets, and players often create their own tracking sheets. Technology The introduction of Scrabble for computers saw the practical application of automated score-keeping, but the rapid technological advances brought about by computers and the internet seemed only to serve the wider distribution of pre-printed tracking grids via downloads in terms of new tile- tracking tools. Some websites offer online tile-tracking alternatives to paper and pencil. Users are required to manually input played tiles via the keyboard, and the input is then subtracted from a separate letter pool representing total tile distribution. The user then counts or otherwise calculates the status of the remaining tiles. Notes are made on a separate piece of paper as necessary. The user is still tracking and counting tiles manually, and the risk of receiving an inaccurate count through human error remains roughly equal to the non-technological option. The migration of Scrabble to mobile devices and the popularity of the digital exclusive Words with Friends has seen the introduction of a dedicated tile-tracking app exclusively for games played on mobile app devices that automates the process of tracking tiles and requires no manual input. Strategy Advantages The benefits of tracking and counting tiles are widely known among competitive Scrabble players and tile tracking is considered a standard part of tournament play. By tracking played tiles, players can learn more about what tiles remain unseen (either in the bag or on their opponent's rack), and can use that information to make strategic decisions about what tiles to hold, which squares to block, and which tiles to play to create advantages. Tile tracking provides much of the data required to make many of the strategic decisions a player makes in the course of a game, and it has a key role in other strategic elements, including rack and board management. It is considered especially critical in the end game (when there are no tiles left in the bag and seven or fewer tiles on each player's rack). At this point, ‚ÄòScrabble is chess‚ÄôQuote attributed to Jerry Lerman in McCarthy‚Äôs Letterati If both players have tracked the tiles correctly, each knows what tiles sit in the other's final rack. Assuming a close game, the win will go to the player who can plan and calculate the best move while taking into consideration the other player's possible responses‚Äîwinning a close game by blocking an opponent's big play or setting up a high-scoring play the opponent cannot block. Scrabble champion John Holgate notes that tile-tracking is particularly important in tight \\"bobbing\\" finishes when the bag is empty, and that many games are lost through \\"just not knowing what tiles your opponent has on her rack. You simply cannot calculate possible permutations if you are unsure about which letters are relevant.\\" Tracking can also tell a player if the bag is ‚Äòvowel-heavy‚Äô or 'consonant- heavy', how many S's or blanks are unseen, if an opponent is likely to have a bingo on their rack, or which tiles to play or conserve. For example, if Alice has the option of playing J(I)NN or J(I)LL, and four N's and zero L's remain unseen, then assuming both plays are otherwise equal (in terms of score, openings for the opponent), J(I)NN is likely the better play. Letter frequency lists for both Scrabble and Words with Friends are easily accessible (some versions of Scrabble have the tile distribution directly on the board) and, unlike word lists, using them is not against tournament rules. Whether done mentally, using a paper and pencil to track tiles, accessing a website program or a tile-counting app on mobile devices, every player has the same level of access to the same amount of readily available data‚Äî‚Äîand even those unfamiliar with tile tracking as a studied technique are 'tracking tiles' every time they note that the 'Q' is still unseen or when they count the number of 'S's on the board before playing a word that can take an S hook to the opponent's advantage. Disadvantages Manual tile tracking can take away game time that would otherwise be used for finding words and making decisions about where to play them. Inaccurate tile tracking can lead to mistakes, such as setting up a spot for the player's 'S' when the opponent also has an 'S', or failing to block a winning play from the opponent. John Holgate, five-time winner of the Australian Championship recalls winning a game in the 1993 World Championship because his opponent inadvertently crossed off two ‚ÄòS‚Äôs with one stroke and failed to block the last S-hook. The traditional method of manual tracking and counting tiles is generally understood to be a tedious and time- consuming practice.from Everything Scrabble: '...from our own experience it seems that the act of tracking, scoring, and looking for words utilizes different parts of the brain. Doing all three tasks at the same time involves an extra effort‚Äî‚Äòswitching gears‚Äò so to speak.‚Äù p.247 As a result, some players track tiles in a simplified manner, usually by mentally tracking and counting the letters considered ‚Äòkey‚Äô in any game: the Q, J, Z, X, the esses and the blanks. Often, it can take several months to a year for players to track all 100 tiles consistently without affecting their game play. Outside the Scrabble community The idea that an opponent can 'know what's in your rack' or have knowledge to what tiles remain unseen has been labeled in some discussions and reader comments related to Words with Friends as 'outside help'From Ask Us wordswithfriends.net forum: ' or 'borderline cheating.'Jenny Ng article and or using AI or Artificial Intelligence. While the practice of tile-tracking is considered an acceptable part of Scrabble and sanctioned by NSA and NASPA rules, there is much colloquial evidence to suggest that tile- tracking as both a legitimate technique and a strategic tool is not widely known outside of the Scrabble community. The similarities to the technique to 'card counting' is credited as contributing to some of the confusion among novice players. Zynga's Words with Friends online game includes tile-tracking as a paid feature, known as 'Peeks'. This received some criticism as being a form of \\"cheating\\" that the Zynga both condones and profits from. The article concluded with the lamentation that Zynga's strategy was a threat to the integrity of the game, because of what it might cause 'loyal Scrabblers' to 'think' about the Words with Friends player: \\"I seriously doubt that loyal Scrabblers are going to be happy when they find out that the reason their friend has been winning lately is because he paid an extra $10 to have an advantage.\\" Examples The value of tracking and counting tiles becomes apparent once a player understands that the game of Scrabble is as much about math as it is about vocabulary. Once possible plays have been discovered, the strategic decisions to be made have been described as being as \\"dark and complex as a forest.\\" *Suppose that near the end of the game the eight tiles unseen by Alice are EFINRSSJ (seven on the opponent's rack and one in the bag).

He had a reputation as a warrior and wise leader of the Gunn-e-darr tribe.  Burial  Gambu Ganuurru died around 1745, and was buried in a manner befitting a Kamilaroi man of great importance; in a sitting position, backed by a tree carved with totemic designs. The stories of his bravery, achievements and adventures were handed down through the generations and his burial place was treated with great respect. In 1887 the town's doctor arranged for the remains of Gambu Ganuurru to be dug up, and later sent them, along with a section of what was locally known as The Blackfellow's Tree, to the Australian Museum. In the 1950s the museum was asked where his remains and tree the section were, but it could not find them.  Legacy  As custom demanded his silence, \\"Old Joe\\" Bungaree (born ca. 1817), a man considered to be the last full-blooded Aboriginal person of the Gunn-e-darr tribe, was unwilling to talk about his former leader. Just before he died he confided in his friend, John P Ewing, the local police sergeant. The sergeant's son Stan Ewing (1878‚Äì1938) recorded this information and passed it on to other historians. Gambu Ganuurru soon became recognised as a great Aboriginal leader, his story appearing in The Sydney Mail in 1891. Writer Ion Idriess wrote The Red Chief first published in 1953, which became a best-seller of its day. The tag 'Red Chief' was coined by Idriess; it is not used in the source documents. In the 1960s, the Gunnedah Historical Society erected a sign to mark the burial site of \\"The Red Chief\\". This sign still stands on the footpath near the corner of Abbott and Little Conadilly Streets. In 1984, a sculpture, designed by Dennis Adams in consultation with local Aboriginal people and the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service was erected to mark the burial site. It was opened on National Aborigines' Day, 14 September, and officially dedicated by one of the oldest members of the local Aboriginal community, John Lalor. The bronze relief text reads: > :Yilambu giwihr gayir Kambu Gunirah gir ginyi. > Ngihrngu mari ngihrma gayir Gaweh Canuhr. > Ngihrma binal wuraya, wahrunggul yiliyan > maringu Gunidahngu ginyi. > Yirahla ganu wunda dawandah nahbu gayir > gaweh Gawinbara Wuraya. :In times past there was an Aboriginal man > called Cumbo Gunnerah > His people called him The Red Kangaroo. > He was a clever chief and a mighty fighter :(this man from Gunnedah) > Later, the white people of this place > called him The Red Chief.

It used the same MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor as Apple II and Commodore 64. Commissioned by the USSR Ministry of Radio, for many years it was a popular microcomputer in Soviet schools. First introduced at a Moscow trade fair in 1983, the Agat was primarily produced between 1984 and 1990, although a limited number of units may have been manufactured as late as 1993. By 1988, about 12,000 units were produced, over 9 months of 1989 ‚Äî about 7,000. Architecture and Design thumb The Agat was inspired primarily by Apple II, though being largely different from it in design. A domestically produced \\"partitioned 588 series\\" CPU was used on early pre-production series, which simulated the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor instruction set. While this permitted some degree of compatibility with the Apple, timing differences between the two CPUs rendered certain tasks (such as floppy disk access and sound generation) impossible. Later models incorporated actual MOS 6502 CPUs which permitted a greater degree of interoperability between the two platforms. Early editions of the Agat came with a cassette tape reader and a keyboard, although later editions replaced the tape reader with a 5¬º inch floppy disk drive. The keyboard utilised the standard Russian keyboard layout, and offered a choice between either Cyrillic or Latin symbols. Earlier models had very limited upgradeability, but later models incorporated additional upgrade and peripheral slots to allow expansion. Other available peripherals included a printer, mouse, and memory upgrades. The display was provided through a 30 cm Secam television, rather than a specialised computer monitor, that was connected to the rest of the machine through a 1 metre long cable. Editions Apart from the initial model, there were a number of different versions of the Agat produced: * Agat-4: A small quantity of this model was released in 1983. While popular, it quickly became obsolete. * Agat-7: The first mass-produced model, introduced in 1984, it featured more internal memory and disk capabilities than the Agat-4. * Agat-8: An updated and enhanced version of the Agat-7. * Agat-9: The final mass-produced model, with many improvements upon the Agat-7 and Agat-8, including additional video modes, improved memory management, and improved compatibility with the Apple II + 64K. Agat-9 Black.jpg|Agat-9 Production The initial run of Agat-4 machines were produced at the \\"Lianozovsky Electromechanical Plant\\" (LEMZ). Production was difficult, as the LEMZ facilities were more intended for the production of motor vehicles and radar equipment, rather than computers, and the administration of the plant was not closely associated with the designers of the Agat. Future production runs occurred at more appropriate facilities such as the \\"Volzhsky Plant of Computer Technology\\" (EWT) and the \\"Zagorski Electromechanical Plant\\" (ZEMZ). Usage Compared to other computers available in the Soviet Union at the time, the Agat was several times cheaper, which led to its widespread adoption in schools and other educational institutions across the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. This is reflected in the fact that most of the software available for the Agat is of an educational nature‚Äîincluding a BASIC interpreter, text editing programs, and the \\"Shkol'nitsa\\" (\\"schoolgirl\\") package, designed to assist teachers in the classroom.

Software * \\"Schoolgirl\\" with Robic programming language included. Reception BYTE in November 1984 called Agat \\"a bad copy of the Apple\\". While stating \\"my overall impressions were favorable, considering the source\\", the reviewer found that \\"the operating system and ROM seemed to be a direct lift from the Apple\\", the internals were a \\"nightmarish wire maze\\", and that performance was noticeably slower than that of a real Apple. He reported that ELORG planned to sell the computer (with software) for $17,000, and that its officials were \\"shocked\\" when told how much computing power that amount of money would purchase in the United States. The reviewer concluded, \\"it wouldn't stand a chance in today's international market, even if they gave it away. It has neither the polish nor the sophistication to compete\\". Yuri Rogachyov, one of the key figures in the history of the Soviet computer industry, co-founder of M-series computers, and head of the Scientific Research Institute of Computer Complexes in 1983‚Äî1988, stated that Agat computers were not produced at the time when the BYTE reviewer arrived in the Soviet Union, and that what he saw during a visit to the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex in Moscow in 1982 was a custom-built mock-up device intended for testing and debugging medical software, bearing little relation to even the early Agat systems.

Coleman made his first impact of the season by filling in for an injured Darrelle Revis against the New England Patriots in week 2. Coleman impressed greatly as he was part of a Jets defense that did not allow a touchdown in the second half of the game, which is where he made his biggest impact. In the next game against the Miami Dolphins, Coleman continued to make impact plays as he intercepted Chad Henne at the end of the game, preventing a comeback for the Dolphins. Against the Vikings the next week he would sack Brett Favre, and finish the game against the Vikings with 3 tackles and 1 sack. In week 6 he recorded 5 tackles in a win against the Denver Broncos.

Originally scored for piano, woodwinds, violin, and contrabass, the work was rescored for two pianos and three trumpets. The final version, which, in addition to traditional forces includes piano, solo English horn, and three solo trumpets, was introduced on November 23, 1907, by the Boston Symphony under the direction of Karl Muck. Loeffler derived inspiration for the work from the eighth eclogue of Virgil, in which a maiden of Thessaly uses magic to revive her lover's ardor once he deserts her. Rather than follow the program literally, the composer chose to depict moods suggested by the text. Loeffler used extended harmonies to evoke an antique sound.

The township was created on January 1, 1998, through the amalgamation of the former township of Aldborough with the village of West Lorne. Communities The two main population centres within the township are Rodney and West Lorne. Additionally, it also includes the smaller communities of Churchville, Clachan, Crinan, Eagle, Kintyre, New Glasgow, Port Glasgow and Twin Valleys. File:Rodney ON.JPG|Rodney File:West Lorne ON.JPG|West Lorne File:Clachan.jpg|Clachan History The original township of Aldborough was named in 1792 after Aldeburgh, Suffolk, England. The community of Rodney was originally named Stewart's Mills after the owner of the first sawmill in the community. From 1840 to 1865, it was called Centreville due to its central location at the intersection of Furnival Road and 7th Concession (now Downie Line). In 1865, the community was renamed Rodney after British naval officer George Brydges Rodney. The centre of the village was relocated three kilometres to the south when the Canada Southern Railway was built in the area in 1872. The community of West Lorne also had its origins the Canada Southern Railway. Originally named Bismarck after the German chancellor, the community was renamed West Clayton, Dutton, Lorne and finally West Lorne. The name came from the Lorne Mills on the south side of the railway, themselves named for John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne. The station itself was renamed West Lorne in 1907 to avoid confusion with a community named Bismarck in Lincoln County. The villages of Rodney and West Lorne were incorporated as municipalities in 1907 and 1908 respectively, and separated from the township. Subsequently, Aldborough remained a mainly rural municipality. In 1994, Aldborough and Rodney amalgamated to form an expanded Township of Aldborough. In 1998, Aldborough amalgamated with West Lorne to form West Elgin.

West Lorne is linked by Elgin County Road 76 to the 401, a major arterial highway link in Ontario affording easy access to Windsor, Chatham, St. Thomas, London, Brantford, Toronto, and many other places. Local agriculture includes dairy farming, mixed farming, fruit growing and a sizeable tobacco industry. The town of West Lorne was greatly influenced by the railroad that crossed through the heart of the village. The railroad provided jobs for the first residents of the area. There is also some light manufacturing in the town. Notable attractions * Ontario has had some historical claimants, by towns, for the smallest jailhouse in the province. These have included: Tweed, Coboconk and Creemore. However, the jailhouse in Rodney has proven to be smaller than all three, measuring in at 4.5 metres by 5.4 metres. Today, it serves as a part-time tourist information centre.

(September 15, 1929 ‚Äì February, 1971) was a Hmong spiritual leader and inventor of the Pahawh script, a semi-syllabary for writing dialects of the Hmong language, as well as the Khmu language. He is honored as the \\"Mother of Writing\\" (Niam Ntawv) among the Hmong people. Biography Born in the village of Fi Tong (Hu·ªìi t·ª•), Vietnam, near the city of Nong Het, Laos, Yang grew up without learning to read or write, although he likely observed various writing systems.Smalley 1990:86‚Äì90 For much of his life, he subsisted as a farmer and basket maker. From 1959 onwards, he experienced a series of reported divine revelations during which he was taught the Pahawh script by a set of male twins. In his visions, he was instructed to teach the script to the Hmong and Khmu people. He believed that the groups who accepted the writing system would flourish and escape the hardships of the time leading up to the Laotian Civil War. Afterwards, he assumed the title of \\"Savior of the Common People\\" (Theej Kaj Pej Xeem) and began teaching the script and his message of redemption across Laos.Smalley 1990:16‚Äì25 Following initial successes, including the building of a school in the village of Fi Kha, Yang was targeted by communist forces for his association with General Vang Pao and his troops. Later, he fell under suspicion of Hmong groups who supported the Royal Lao Government (including members of Vang Pao's army) as well as Hmong who supported the communist Pathet Lao. By the bribe and order of General Vang Pao, Shong Lue Yang was assassinated in 1971 by Nos Toom Yang in the village of Nam Chia shortly after producing the final version of the Pahawh Hmong script. However, Nos Toom Yang never did receive his reward of 3,000,000.00 Lao-Kip (approximately $158.96 during the year 1974; adjusted for inflation (as of 14 February, 2011), the reward ranges between $340.14 to $377.96). In 1974, while attempting to collect the bribe from General Vang Pao in Thailand, Nos Toom Yang was killed by Thai officials ordered by General Vang Pao. Nos Toom Yang was handcuffed, blindfolded, and thrown into the Mekong River. Though Shong Lue Yang died, his writing system survived and was republished into many books. One of these books is Mother of Writing, by William A. Smalley.

With an altitude of 3,810 m or 12,500 ft above sea level, it is the second-highest summit or ice dome of the East Antarctic ice sheet and represents an ice divide. Dome F is the site of Dome Fuji Station, a research station operated by Japan. Discovery and naming Dome Fuji is an ice dome rising to about 3,700 m in the eastern part of Queen Maud Land. In 1963-64, a Soviet Antarctic Expedition oversnow traverse crossed the north part of the dome at an elevation of over 3,600 meters. Environment Owing to its location on the Antarctic plateau and the high elevation, Dome Fuji is one of the coldest places on Earth. Temperatures rarely rise above -30 ¬∞C in summer and can drop to -80 ¬∞C in winter. The annual average air temperature is -54.3 ¬∞C. The climate is that of a cold desert, with very dry conditions and an annual precipitation of about 25 millimeters of water equivalent, which falls entirely as ice crystals. Dome Fuji Station Dome Fuji Station („Éâ„Éº„É†„Åµ„ÅòÂü∫Âú∞ D≈çmu Fuji Kichi) was established as \\"Dome Fuji observation base\\" („Éâ„Éº„É†„Åµ„ÅòË¶≥Ê∏¨Êã†ÁÇπ D≈çmu Fuji Kansoku Kyoten) in January 1995. Its name was changed to \\"Dome Fuji Station \\" on April 1, 2004. Located at , it is separated from Showa Station by about 1,000 km. Glaciology Deep ice core drilling at Valkyrie Dome was started in August 1995, and in December 1996 a depth of 2503 m was reached. This first core covers a period back to 340,000 years. The core quality from the Dome Fuji station, East Antarctica, is excellent even in the brittle zone from 500 to 860 m deep, where the ice is fragile during the 'in situ' core- cutting procedure. A second deep core was started in 2003. Drilling was carried out during four subsequent austral summers from 2003/2004 until 2006/2007, and by then a depth of 3035.22 m was reached. The drill did not hit the bedrock, but rock particles and refrozen water have been found in the deepest ice, indicating that the bedrock is very close to the bottom of the borehole. This core greatly extends the climatic record of the first core, and, according to a first, preliminary dating, it reaches back until 720,000 years. The ice of the second Valkyrie Dome core is therefore the second-oldest ice ever recovered, only outranged by the EPICA Dome C core.

Although Aboriginal people traditionally did not have kings or chiefs, only elders, the white colonial powers used to often grant king plates to certain elders, hence the moniker King. Life Umbarra lived on Merriman Island, in the middle of Wallaga Lake, while his people lived on the shores of the lake. Umbarra was believed to have clairvoyant abilities, and communicated with a black duck, his moojingarl or being with which he had a spiritual connection, which warned him of coming danger. Umbarra provided information on the Yuin to Alfred William Howitt for Howitt's 1904 book The native tribes of South-East Australia. Umbarra's father, who was also associated with the black duck, is believed to have also been named Merriman and to have died around 1850. His wife, Queen Narelle, died around 1900. The brother of Umbarra and the brother of Narelle, despite being unrelated to one another, founded a single family, the Nobles. Yuin genealogist and researcher Dave Tout is a descendant of the Nobles. Funeral of Queen Narelle, Umbarra's wife, circa 1900 Legends Many legends now exist about Umbarra and his moojingarl. One day it told him of a group of warriors coming from the far south to do battle. King Merriman remained on the island while the other men took the women and children to a place of safety and then hid in the reeds. The first to sight the approaching warriors, the King warned his men who fought a fierce battle but lost. The opposing tribesmen then set out for the island. King Merriman threw powerful spears, and a boomerang which severed the arms and heads of his opponents before returning to him, but it was not enough. He then turned himself into a whirlwind and flew off. He passed over the fierce Kiola tribe and their wise men correctly divined his presence and that it meant the defeat of the Wallaga people and the advance of another tribe. King Merriman journeyed on to the Shoalhaven tribe to warn them but the Kiola tribe defeated the invaders and the King, whose power was finished, stayed for a time at the Shoalhaven then travelled away. Today General access to Merriman Island is forbidden due to its great significance for Indigenous people ‚Äì it was the first place to be gazetted as an Aboriginal site. A focus of tribal culture, the island is associated with the story of King Merriman, widely known among the Yuin Aborigines of the south coast. Today, the Yuin operate the Umbarra Cultural Centre near the Lake. The former Wallaga Lake National Park is incorporated into Gulaga National Park.

Industries and business A waterfront restaurant and boathouses line the foreshore. An oil refinery and fuel storage depot with port facilities were built on reclaimed land at Self's Point in 1951, between Newtown Bay and Cornelian Bay. Cornelian Bay Cemetery Cornelian Bay Cemetery and Crematorium, dominates the surrounding hillside. Cornelian Bay Cemetery with Mt Wellington in the background The cemetery contains 124 Commonwealth war graves of service personnel, 49 from World War I and 75 from World War II; 40 of the graves are in a plot known as the Hobart War Cemetery, the remainder scattered throughout the cemetery.

In attendance was Tom Cruise, Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez, Gwen Stefani, Demi Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow. On October 29, 2009, Madonna announced on the Raising Malawi website and her own official website that she vowed to match, dollar for dollar, every donation made towards all Raising Malawi projects. Programs Education One of Raising Malawi's major focus areas is funding education projects. Raising Malawi supports the basic education needs of Malawi orphans, including academic scholarships, school uniforms, and learning materials. Raising Malawi sponsors 600 children at a Malawian orphanage with educational funding, vocational scholarships and an HIV awareness soccer program. Madonna had co- sponsored investments into building a school, Raising Malawi Academy for Girls.

Retrieved from In December 2014 it was announced that Madonna's Raising Malawi organization completed ten schools to educate 4,871 children in different locations in Malawi. The enterprise is in association with buildOn and follows the original announcement of building an Academy for Girls which was scrapped. Instead the schools will benefit children of all sexes and the project was completed within twelve months, six months ahead of schedule. As of 2020 Raising Malawi and buildOn have built 14 primary schools in rural Malawi and educated community members about the importance of girls‚Äô education. Students who attend these schools no longer have to walk miles to reach a school in a neighboring village, learn math under a tree or study their ABCs under a thatched roof. Today, the Raising Malawi schools serve nearly 10,000 students, fulfilling Madonna‚Äôs commitment to making learning and school accessible to Malawian youth. Health Fifty percent of Malawi's population is under 15 years of age, making pediatric care a top priority for the country. Raising Malawi has addressed this need since 2008 by supporting the pediatric surgery program at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, the country's commercial capital. Queen Elizabeth is the largest hospital in Malawi and serves a population of 700,000 people annually. It is also a public hospital meaning services are free. At Queen Elizabeth, Raising Malawi partners with one of only three pediatric surgeons in Malawi, who performs hundreds of life- saving surgeries annually and teaches local medical students and clinicians. Raising Malawi recently expanded its pediatric surgery work at Queen Elizabeth by launching a project with the Malawi Ministry of Health to construct a pediatric surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital. The facility will include the country's first pediatric ICU, will double the number of life-saving surgeries, and will improve longer health outcomes for children who are currently dying as they wait for ICU beds. Raising Malawi also collaborates with the Elizabeth Taylor Aids Foundation to bring Grassroot Soccer (GRS), a HIV/AIDS prevention and testing program, into the communities where Raising Malawi is active. GRS is also active in the Mulanje region, one of the highest HIV infection areas in the country. Girls' School Following an audit by the Global Philanthropy Group, which questioned expenditure on salaries and benefits as well as the management capacity and culture, the charity's school headmistress was fired in October 2010. In January 2011 it was announced that plans to build a school, the charity's flagship project, were abandoned. In March 2011 the Board of Directors was removed. The collapse of the school project resulted in labour disputes and complicated a dispute with villagers who lost land to the project. It also resulted in a legal suit by former employees at the school for wrongful termination. Government Relations When Madonna visited Malawi in April 2013, President of Malawi Joyce Banda expressed criticism of Madonna and her charity, accused her of exaggerating her charity's contribution and \\"bullying state officials\\". The president's office accused her of being \\"a musician who desperately thinks she must generate recognition by bullying state officials instead of playing decent music on the stage\\" and added \\"For her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in Malawi when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur.\\" Madonna responded by releasing a statement saying she was saddened that Banda \\"has chosen to release lies about what we've accomplished, my intentions, how I personally conducted myself while visiting Malawi and other untruths.

The eighth tropical cyclone and seventh named storm of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Gabrielle developed from a tropical wave in the west-central Gulf of Mexico on August 9\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, the system gradually intensified and by the following day, it became a tropical storm. Favorable conditions caused Gabrielle to continue to strengthen, with the storm nearly reaching hurricane status late on August 11\\\\. However, it soon made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, thus halting further intensification. Once inland, Gabrielle rapidly weakened and dissipated by early on August 12\\\\. As Gabrielle was impacting the east coast of Mexico, Hurricane Flossie in the Eastern Pacific was brushing the Baja Peninsula. The storm produced torrential rainfall in northeastern Mexico, totaling to . As a result, numerous reservoirs were filled, forcing dozens in southern Nuevo Leon to evacuate their homes. Additionally, highway infrastructure and streets in the region were affected. Damage in Mexico is unknown, though six fatalities were reported. Rainfall up to brought minor flooding to Texas, mainly damaging unharvested cotton. Three days after dissipation, the remnants of Gabrielle also produced heavy thunderstorms in New Mexico on August 15\\\\. Meteorological history Gabrielle at landfall A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Africa during the last week of July. As it tracked across the Atlantic, it remained a well-defined system, but never organized into a tropical cyclone. On August 8, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico, and by the following day, it developed a weak low-level circulation. The circulation became better defined later that day, and was confirmed by Reconnaissance aircraft that afternoon, when it was declared Tropical Depression Eight while east of Tamaulipas. From the outset, the cyclone's motion was altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep convection fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200 UTC on August 10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, as the storm curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west- northwest course on August 11, moving very slowly towards the coast. The storm made landfall at 2000 UTC on August 11, just south of La Pesca in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, about 175 miles (280 km) south of the United States- Mexico border and about 90 miles (145 km) north of Tampico. Simultaneously, Gabrielle attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . After landfall, the storm rapidly weakened, deteriorating to tropical depression status by early on August 12 over northeast Mexico. Six hours later, the surface circulation of Gabrielle dissipated over the mountains of the Sierra Madre Oriental, although its cloud pattern transited Mexico intact, moving into the Gulf of California before it sheared across northwest Mexico on August 15. Preparations and impact Gabrielle rainfall totals Starting at 2100 UTC on August 9, a tropical storm warning was issued from Baffin Bay, Texas to La Pesca, Tamaulipas while Gabrielle was still Tropical Depression Eight. By 0900 UTC on the following day, the warning was expanded to include areas south to Tampico, Tamaulipas and extended further to Tuxpan, Veracruz twelve hours later. As the latter was occurring, the tropical storm warning was discontinued for Texas. Early on August 12, all the warnings in Mexico were discontinued, as the storm had already moved inland. 800 people were evacuated in Soto la Marina and San Fernando in Tamaulipas. People in poor villages in the Rio Grande Valley were given sandbags with Tropical Storm Gabrielle approaching. Overall damage was generally minor. There were no reports of wind damage, although tropical storm-force winds affected the northern coast of Tamaulipas. A newspaper in Mexico reported up to 24 inches (600 mm) of precipitation across much of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon; this figure is in dispute, however, as the rainfall database maintained by Mexico's National Weather Service shows the maximum amount to lie under 20 inches (508 mm). The heavy rainfall from the storm filled nearly half the reservoirs in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which were almost empty due to drought conditions in the region. As a result, dozens in southern Nuevo Leon were forced to evacuation their homes. Rains from Gabrielle flooded streets and destroyed bridges and highways in northern Mexico. No storm surge recordings were taken in Mexico, although it is estimated by the National Hurricane Center that a surge of a few feet took place to the north of the track. Six fatalities were reported in Mexico as a result of Gabrielle. In Texas, rainfall from the storm peaked at in Weslaco, while many other areas in southern Texas reported only of precipitation. Gabrielle's rain came after a drought, and some of it soaked in. The rains also damaged unharvested cotton. Otherwise, minor flooding occurred. Brownsville reported up to 4 inches (102 mm) of rain in association with Gabrielle. In extreme southern Texas, minor coastal flooding occurred at some of the beaches in the region. The remains of Gabrielle produced heavy thunderstorms in New Mexico on August 15.

It is a multiplayer game which includes various events based on memory, pattern and logic puzzles. Intellectual Decathlon was written by Gabor and Alexander Laufer, and published by Muse Software. Gameplay The game consists of ten different sub-games which aim to test different aspects of the human intelligence. The score is structured similar to an Olympic decathlon. A player's final score is the total of the ten individual events: #Numberstretcher ‚Äì The computer presents longer and longer string of numbers for the player to memorize (presented only for a few seconds) and type back. #Note the Notes ‚Äì The computer plays a short random tune, 6‚Äì8 bars. Then the computer starts playing a long sequence of random notes. Without notice, the initially presented short tune is played hidden within the longer tune, which the player must identify. #Safecracker ‚Äì The computer presents 9 dials on the screen (3x3) and a single hand in each dial points to either 12,3,6 or 9 o'clock. With key combinations the player has to set as many dials to 12 as he can. For example, pressing number 1 on the keyboard will rotate dial 1,2,4,5 90 degrees clockwise. None of the dials can be individually adjusted. #Mazerace ‚Äì A randomly generated maze appears on the screen. Player 1 is in the lower left corner, Player 2 is in the upper right corner. They have to get to each other's starting point (played at the same time). #Apple Derby ‚Äì An imaginary horse race where the players bet their points earned during the first four events. No luck is involved, it is all pure logic. The race is pre- determined. The moment the horses take off, the program knows exactly which horse will win. That's what the players have to figure out from presented data from those horses' previous history of success. #Lying digits ‚Äì Ten simple (four basic operations) math problems are flashed on the screen with the solution which is either wrong or right. That's all the players has to indicate. #Matchmaker ‚Äì Ten wordpairs are displayed in two columns for 30 seconds. Then the program clears the display and places only one column words back on the screen and displays the other column words one by one. The player has to match the word with its pair. #Brainblender ‚Äì An abstract board game, great deal of memory, strategy and combination is involved. The two players are playing it at the same time. #Instant Replay ‚Äì The program flashes a \\"picture\\" on the screen (primitively drawn objects). Then another picture comes on the screen. It is either exactly the same or one object is not the same. That is what the simultaneously playing players have to determine (same, different). #Abstrajig ‚Äì A randomly generated abstract picture comes on the screen, cut into 16 pieces, shuffled, and the player has to put it back together as in a jigsaw puzzle. There is a practice mode, where each of the ten events can be practiced separately from a competition. While it is a game for 2‚Äì6 players, and the 2 players setup is the most recommended, one player can play the game. In that case the goal is not to defeat the other player, but simply score higher than before. In the PC Apple emulator-based Intellectual Decathlon, Mazerace was replaced with an event called Verdict Guilty. Five imaginary criminals are sitting at the police station, all five arrested. Only one committed a crime the other four are innocent. They keep talking to each other and the player has to figure out which of the five is the guilty one and what the crime he committed. Reception Intellectual Decathlon was recommended by Scouting magazine. Bruce Brown found the events to be challenging and diverse, making fair use of graphics and color.

Centre: breve in mensural notation used in some modern scores as well. Right: less common stylistic variant of the first form. Regular, cross, square, and small noteheads Ride pattern on a cymbal Natural harmonics on the cello notated first as sounded (more common), then as fingered (easier to sightread). In music, a notehead is the part of a note, usually elliptical in shape, whose placement on the staff indicates the pitch, to which modifications are made that indicate duration. Noteheads may be the same shape but colored completely black or white, indicating the note value (i.e., rhythmic duration). In a whole note, the notehead, shaped differently than shorter notes, is the only component of the note. Shorter note values attach a stem to the notehead, and possibly beams or flags. The longer double whole note can be written with vertical lines surrounding it, two attached noteheads, or a rectangular notehead.Gerou, Tom & Lusk, Linda: Essential Dictionary of Music Notation. Alfred Music, 1996, p. 210. An \\"x\\" shaped notehead may be used to indicate percussion, percussive effects (ghost notes), or speaking. A square, diamond, or box shaped notehead may be used to indicate a natural or artificial harmonic. A small notehead can be used to indicate a grace note. History Noteheads ultimately derive from the neumes used to notate Gregorian chant. The punctum, seen at right, is the simplest of the shapes and most clearly anticipates the modern notehead. When placed on a clef, the position of a notehead indicates the relative pitch of a note. The development of different colors of noteheads, and the use of it to indicate rhythmic values, was the use of white mensural notation, adopted around 1450. Franco of Cologne, ancient composer and music theorist, codified a system of rhythm notation. He explained this system in his work, Ars Cantus Mensurabilis, (which means ‚ÄúThe Art of Measurable Music‚Äù) circa 1280. In this system, the relative duration of notes was indicated by the note shapes. The noteheads were rectangles, squares, or diamonds depending on the note length. This system was expanded during the Ars Nova period. Shortly before the Renaissance, scribes began to write the notes of the Franconian and Ars Nova style with open noteheads. During the Renaissance, composers added shorter note durations that used filled-in noteheads. Near the end of the 16th century, the square or diamond- shaped notes changed to the round noteheads that are used today.Burkholder, J.P., Grout, D.J., & Palisca, C.V. (2006).

His series of Reading Books introduced a whole generation of Bengalis to the English language, sold in the millions and were translated into every major Indian language. was also a pioneer of women's education in Bengal and was called 'Arnold of the East'.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), (1976/1998), Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) in Bengali, pp 291‚Äì292, Early life and family Sircar was born at Chorbagan in North Calcutta. His family hailed from Taragram in Hooghly district of West Bengal, and the family name was originally Das. For services rendered, the Nawab of Bengal had awarded the title 'Sarkar' to Bireshwar Das, an ancestor. Bhairav Chandra Sarkar, Pyari Charan's father, had become quite wealthy as a ship chandler serving the East India Company, and the family was a fairly good example of the new bhadralok class. Sarkar was and educated at David Hare's Pataldanga School, and admitted to Hindu College, but shortly afterwards his father and then one of his brothers died. His eldest brother was working in Hooghly and could only send money to their mother; as a Hindu widow she had little standing in the family and was ejected from the family home, along with Sircar and his younger brothers and sisters. Sircar was forced to leave college and take up a job in 1843 as a teacher at the Hooghly School; his teachers gave him glowing certificates and praised his acumen in mathematics and English. In the same year (1843) his essay 'On the Effect upon India of the New Communication with Europe by Means of Steam' appeared in the Department of Public Instruction's Report on Education. Sarkar became headmaster of Barasat School (later named Barasat Peary Charan Sarkar Government High School in his honour), in 1846, and occupied the post till 1854. His son, J.N. Sircar, Esq., Barrister-at-Law, was a lawyer who practised in the Central Provinces and Berar. He was one of the earliest Indian students of Balliol College, Oxford. A great-nephew of his was Brajendranath De, Esq., ICS, who was the District Magistrate and Collector of Hooghly, and Commissioner (Offgt.) of Burdwan. The Barasat Girls' School At Barasat, two brothers, Nabin Krishna Mitra and Kalikrishna Mitra, offered in 1847 to fund Bengal's first private school for girls if Sarkar would agree to help set it up. The school (later renamed Kalikrishna Girls' High School) began operations, but Barasat was an extremely conservative Brahmin-majority area and the residents were outraged. Swapan Basu, in his biography of Sircar, alleges that rumours circulated that several landlords were offering money to have Sircar assassinated (p. 24). At this juncture John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune stepped in to help. He exhorted the financiers not to give up, and with time the opposition weakened. Bethune visited the Barasat school in 1848, and was so impressed that in 1849 he set up the Bethune School for Girls in Calcutta.Bagal, Jogesh C., History of The Bethune School and College in the Bethune School and College Centenary Volume, 1849‚Äì1949. Sircar continued to be active in campaigning for w jiomen's education, helping to set up several more such schools, including a technical and an agricultural school. In 1854, with a stipend of two hundred rupees, he was appointed headmaster of the Colootollah School and was responsible for changing its name to Hare School. Presidency College In 1863 he was appointed as a temporary lecturer at Presidency College, Kolkata, and in 1867 he was made permanent. There was some opposition to this as he had never completed his education, but in those days this was not so unusual as it later was to become, and Sircar's abilities were plainly evident to the authorities. Sircar continued his campaigning for women's rights, donating two and a half thousand rupees (then a huge sum of money) to the Widow remarriage Fund in 1869. In 1873, he became a member of the working committee of Keshub Chunder Sen's Society for the Suppression of Vice in Indian Society. He was also associated with the Bengal Temperance Society. Keshab Chandra Sen later took up his work on temperance in Indian Reform Association.Sastri, Sivanath, History of the Brahmo Samaj, p. 155 Even after he was appointed as Assistant Professor at Presidency College, he used to visit Colootollah school and take a few classes whenever he could. He was a very meticulous teacher and always corrected his students' work minutely. He also insisted that they learn practical skills as well, and used to teach them gardening. In 1875, while working in his garden, he cut his finger. The wound turned gangrenous and an operation failed to save his life. He died on 1 October. The Reading Books The First Book of Reading for Native Children was published in 1850, probably by the School Book Press, and the rest of the Reading Books (numbers two to six) came out between 1851 and 1870, not necessarily in sequence. In 1875 Sarkar's friend and colleague at Presidency College, E. R. Lethbridge, proposed a revision of the books and began negotiations with Thacker and Spink of Calcutta to republish them. However, at around this time Lethbridge was contacted by Macmillan and Company and (rather unethically) he gave the books to them. Thacker had already printed a few copies and when this was discovered Macmillan had to buy them up and soothe Thacker's ruffled feelings.Rimi B. Chatterjee, 'A History of the Trade to South Asia of Macmillan & Co. and Oxford University Press, 1875‚Äì1900', unpublished D.Phil. dissertation, University of Oxford, 1997. Macmillan were looking for a ready made series with which to launch their Indian publishing business. Other achievements He played a significant role in the Bengal Renaissance. Apart from his role in initiating women's education and impressing upon people to send their daughters to school when Bethune school was opened, he played a pioneering role in the teaching of agriculture in a scientific manner. He set up a vocational training centre for the children of women workers and was instrumental in opening many new schools. He was one of the patrons of Hindu Mela.Sastri, Sivanath, Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj, page 151. He took charge of editing the government newspaper Education Gazette in 1866, but resigned from that position when he was not allowed to publish certain news. He took a leading part to promote prohibition and was one of the founders of Eden Hindu Hostel. He published two newspapers named Well Wisher and Hitasadhak.

His works include Provokation f√ºr mich (Provocation for me) ‚Äì a collection of poems written between 1959 and 1964 and published in 1965, a play, Die Kipper (The Dumpers) (1972; written 1962‚Äì1965), and Das ungezwungne Leben Kasts (The Unrestrained Life of Kast) (1972).  Life  After completing his Abitur, Volker Braun worked for a time in construction before going on to study philosophy at Leipzig. There he occupied himself with the contradictions and hopes of a socialist state. He joined the SED in 1960. Nevertheless, he was regarded as critical of the GDR state, and often succeeded in getting his prose and poetry published only through the application of tactical skill. His work included poetry, plays, novels and short stories. At first his writings reflected a critical enthusiasm for the building of socialism. From 1965 to 1967, Braun worked as artistic director at the Berliner Ensemble at the invitation of Helene Weigel. After the events of the Prague Spring, he became increasingly critical of life and the possibility for reform under Socialism. After that, he came under more intense scrutiny of the Stasi. In 1972 Braun began work at the Deutsches Theater Berlin (German Theatre Berlin). In 1976 he was among those who signed the petition protesting the expatriation of Wolf Biermann.Proteste von mehr als 90 DDR-K√ºnstlern gegen die Ausb√ºrgerung Wolf Biermanns, auf: gegen-diktatur.de From 1979 he was active again in the Berliner Ensemble. He received the Lessing Prize of East Germany in 1981. and the National Prize of East Germany in 1988. In 1982 Braun left the Writers‚Äô Union of the GDR. At that time his works described an increasingly depressing life in the GDR. The actors in his plays moved about with resignation in immovable settings. His Hinze-Kunze-Roman, based on Diderot's Jacques le fataliste et son ma√Ætre, received approval for publication in 1985. When it appeared it was reviewed as ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù and ‚Äúanarchistic‚Äù by the influential critic Annalise Loeffler.Anneliese L√∂ffler: Wenn Inhalt und Form zur Farce gerinnen.

In this connection, he undertook work with the west-Marxist journal, \\"Das Argument,\\" edited by Wolfgang Fritz Haug. In 1986, Braun was awarded the Bremer Literature Prize. In 1992 he received the Schiller Memorial Prize. He was awarded a stipend at the Villa Massimo and was a guest of the University of Wales in 1994. In 1996, he received the Deutschen Kritikerpreis (German Critic Prize), became a member of the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung, the S√§chsische Akademie der K√ºnste (Saxon Academy of the Arts) and held the post of Poet-lecturer at the University of Heidelberg. He received the Erwin Strittmatter Prize in 1998 and the Georg B√ºchner Prize in 2000. From 1999 to 2000, he was the Brothers Grimm-professor at the University of Kassel.

Early years Anders was born in Fort Abraham Lincoln, Dakota Territory, in what is now Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park, North Dakota. His father, formerly a Union Army soldier died of complications related to his wounds in 1890, and Anders, at age 15 began work with the Northern Pacific Railroad and became a machinist. Active Service and war years In 1894 Anders enlisted in the National Guard and after starting his second enlistment was deployed to the Philippines. Medal & Citation On May 13, 1899, Anders was one of eleven men later awarded the medal for actions which took place against the Philippine Rebels. These men, part of Young's Scouts caused 300 members of the enemy to retreat before their sudden charge. His medal was officially awarded on March 3, 1906.

It is the world‚Äôs lightest attack helicopter and its flight ceiling is the highest among all attack helicopters. It has been ordered for both the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army. The type is also intended to be sold upon the export market; since 2015, HAL has been seeking other customers for the LCH. The impetus for the development of the LCH came in the form of the Kargil War, a conflict fought between India and neighbouring Pakistan in 1999, which revealed the Indian armed forces lacked a suitable armed rotorcraft capable of operating unrestricted in the high- altitude theatre. Accordingly, both HAL and the Indian armed forces commenced exploratory efforts towards the conceptualisation of a combat helicopter to perform in this role. During 2006, the company announced that it had launched a development programme to produce such a rotorcraft, referred to simply as the Light Combat Helicopter. Originally, the LCH was anticipated to attain initial operating capability (IOC) by December 2010, however development of the type was protracted and subject to several delays, some of which having been attributed to suppliers. The LCH drew extensively on an earlier indigenous helicopter developed and manufactured by HAL, the Dhruv; using this rotorcraft as a starting point has been attributed as significantly reducing the cost of the programme. On 29 March 2010, the first LCH prototype performed its maiden flight. An extensive test programme, involving a total of four prototypes, was conducted. During the course of these tests, the LCH gained the distinction of being the first attack helicopter to land in Siachen, having repeatedly landed at several high altitude helipads, some of which being as high as 13,600 feet to 15,800 feet. During mid-2016, the LCH was recognised as having completed its performance trials, paving way for the certification of its basic configuration. On 26 August 2017, limited series production of the LCH was formally inaugurated. Development Origins LCH model on display at alt= During the late 1990s, India and neighbouring nation Pakistan engaged in a brief but intensely-fought conflict commonly known as the Kargil War. This war, in which various elements of the Indian military were deployed, revealed operational shortcomings and areas for improvement, particularly the requirement for an attack helicopter that would be suitable for use within the high altitude climates in which some combat operations were fought along the north-western border region.McKenna, James T. \\"India OKs Light Combat Helicopter Production.\\" Rotor&Wing;, 28 August 2017. Accordingly, there was considerable interest in not only the acquisition of a suitable contemporary rotorcraft for the task (as well as to replace several aging types in Indian military service, such as the Cheetah and Chetak), but for such an aircraft to be domestically developed and manufactured in India as well. First prototype of HAL Light Combat Helicopter with tandem crew seating arrangement undergoing engine start on 5 April 2010 During early 2004, Indian aerospace manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) declared that the company was in the midst of discussions with the Indian armed forces on the prospects for a potential light combat helicopter derivative of the company's existing Dhruv utility helicopter platform for the requirement.\\"Indian dawn.\\" Flight International, 8 February 2004. During late 2004, the Indian armed forces decided to curtail plans to order foreign-built attack helicopters in anticipation of a decision to formally select the tentative LCH.\\"Indian army slashes multi-role helicopter requirement.\\" Flight International, 23 November 2004. During 2006, HAL publicly announced that it had embarked upon the development of such an attack helicopter, which it referred to as the Light Combat Helicopter (LCH). During late 2006, the Indian government decided to aid the fledgling programme via the issuing of external finance to support the design phase of the LCH's development, this was done as to aid the attack helicopter in conforming with the established requirements of the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force. The LCH is a derivative of the HAL Dhruv, which had been developed during the 1990s and inducted into the Indian Armed Forces during the 2000s. Basing the LCH on an existing helicopter is expected to greatly reduce the associated costs of the programme, which was estimated to be roughly in 2010. By 2010, the Indian Air Force was reportedly set to acquire 65 LCHs while the Indian Army was to also procure 114 LCHs for its own purposes. Light Combat Helicopter Development of the LCH did not progress to schedule. On 21 June 2007, HAL chairman Ashok Baweja announced that and stated that the first prototype LCH was to conduct its maiden flight during October 2008, and stated that the company was currently \\"halfway through the design stage\\".Govindasamy, Siva. \\"HAL targets LCH first flight in Oct 2008.\\" Flight International, 21 June 2007. During November 2008, the company declared that, while the first flight had been postponed until March 2009, it was still working to secure initial operating capability (IOC) for the LCH by December 2010, while it was still anticipated that the type would receive its Final Operational Clearance (FOC) during 2011.Govindasamy, Siva. \\"India delays LCH first flight to March 2009.\\" Flight International, 24 November 2008. During February 2009, Baweja announced another six-month delay to the development timetable, he also attributed some of the setbacks in the programme as having been a result of HAL's suppliers failing to deliver necessary tooling on time.Govindasamy, Siva. \\"AERO INDIA: Light Combat Helicopter hit by six-month delay.\\" Flight International, 13 February 2009.

On 4 February 2010, the first LCH prototype completed its first powered ground run.HAL to flight test LCH prototype next month On 29 March 2010, the maiden flight of the LCH was conducted by the type's first LCH Technology Demonstrator (TD-1). It flew a 20-minute flight from HAL's Helicopter Complex at Bengaluru, during which the rotorcraft carried out low speed, low altitude checks on the systems on board. Following the completion of the flight, the crew reported that the performance of the helicopter and systems were satisfactory. On 23 May 2010, following the successful completion of the third test flight of the LCH prototype; it was deemed to have fulfilled the desired parameters and thus enabled further armed tests to proceed. The second LCH prototype (TD-2) differed considerably from its predecessor, being fitted with armaments and featuring a substantial reduction in weight; it was publicly unveiled at Aero India 2011 during February 2011. Speaking at the event, Nayak stated that the programme had exceeded human and payload requirements mandated by IAF for the development. On 28 June 2011, TD-2 performed its first flight, allowing it to join the test programme. On 1 July 2012, the LCH began a series of trials near Chennai; among other elements, the onboard air speed measurement system was evaluated and various component stresses were measured. Between late June and early July 2012, the second prototype, TD-2, was involved in a series of sea level trials. These trials covered flight performance, the measurement of loads, and the rotorcraft's handling qualities. During mid-2012, the third LCH prototype, which was claimed to be significantly lighter than either of its predecessors as well as incorporating various other improvements, was reportedly set to be delivered. The third prototype, TD-3, ultimately performed its maiden flight on 12 November 2014 for a duration of 20 minutes. Both TD3 and TD4 were extensively used during the test programme for the purpose of testing the rotorcraft's mission sensors and weapon systems, which involved a series of live-firing trials. Reportedly, a total of ‚Çπ 126 crore (US$20.2 million) had been sanctioned for the development and structural build of the fourth prototype. During early 2015, a number of cold weather trials involving the third prototype (TD-3) were carried out at Air Force Station Leh. During these tests, engine start-up tests (performed using internal batteries after lengthy overnight exposure to the cold climate without special protective measures being applied) proved satisfactory at the temperatures as low as ‚àí18 ¬∞C at an altitude of 4.1 km. Several flights were also carried out to assess the rotorcraft's high altitude performance and low speed handling. During the course of these tests, the LCH gained the distinction of being the first attack helicopter to land in Siachen, having repeatedly landed at several high altitude helipads, some of which being as high as 13,600 feet to 15,800 feet. During June 2015, the LCH successfully completed hot weather flight trials at Jodhpur, during which the type was exposed to temperatures ranging from 39 to 42 ¬∞C. The flight testing reportedly covered 'temperature survey of engine bay and hydraulic system', 'assessment of performance', 'handling qualities and loads' at different 'all up weights', 'low speed handling' and 'height-velocity diagram establishment'. On 1 December 2015, LCH TD4 completed its first flight. By March 2016, the LCH had reportedly completed basic performance flight testing and outstation trials, including a number of live-fire tests involving prototype TD-3 firing 70 mm rockets in its weaponized configuration. By mid-2016, certification firing trials had commenced, these included tests of the integration of its mission sensors, such as the electro-optical system, helmet pointing system, and of the various armaments ‚Äì air-to-air missiles, turret gun and rockets ‚Äì that the type can deploy. During mid-2016, the LCH was recognised as having completed its performance trials, paving way for the certification of its basic configuration; a letter confirming this status was hand-delivered to HAL by CEMILAC in the presence of the Indian Defence Minister on 16 October 2015. On 26 August 2017, Defence Minister Arun Jaitley formally inaugurated full- scale production of the LCH.Gady, Franz-Stefan. \\"India Kicks Off Production of Light Combat Helicopter.\\" The Diplomat, 1 September 2017.\\"Arun Jaitley inaugurates manufacture of light combat helicopter at HAL.\\" . Business Standard. On 31 January 2018, LCH TD2 was flown with an Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) designed by HAL. The new system is expected to replace the previously imported Automatic Flight Control System. It was reported that a radar is under development for LCH. On 17 January 2019, LCH completed weapons trials with the successful firing of Mistral-2 air-to-air missile at a flying target. In the same day, HAL announced that the LCH is ready for operational service after completing the required weapon integration tests.https://www.janes.com/article/85800/india-s-hal-declares-lch-ready-for- operational-induction On 21 February 2019, Thales announced that it was awarded a contract to supply 135 70 mm rockets for 15 LCHs alongside 18 Dhruvs.https://www.rotorandwing.com/2019/02/23/thales-supply-70-mm-rocket- launchers-indian-attack-helicopters/  Production  Inauguration of the Light Combat Helicopter Final Assembly Hangar in February 2020. The LCH was declared ready for production in February 2020. A Light Combat Helicopter Production Hangar was established at HAL's Helicopter Division in Bangalore for the production of the aircraft. In June 2020, it was announced that the first batch of LCH choppers ordered is due to enter service.https://www.airrecognition.com/index.php/news/defense-aviation- news/2020/june/6317-india-will-order-soon-15-local-made-light-combat- helicopter-lch-produced-by-hal.html The Limited series production (LSP) has started with first unit LSP1 conducting ground run in September 2020. Design Overview Army version of LCH with green camouflage pattern at Aero India 2013 The design and development of the HAL Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) was done in-house, by the Rotary Wing Research and Design Centre (RWR&DC;), an internal design office of HAL dedicated to the design of helicopters. The LCH is a multirole combat helicopter, designed to perform various attack profiles, including relatively high altitude flight. Equipped with a two-person tandem cockpit to accommodate a pilot and co-pilot/gunner, it has been developed to perform both the anti-infantry and anti-armour missions. In addition to these roles, the LCH is intended to be used for a variety of operational purposes, such as to perform air defence against slow- moving aerial targets, including both manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), participation in counter-insurgency operations (COIN) and Counter Surface Force Operations (CSFO), the destruction of enemy air defence operations and wider offensive use during urban warfare conditions, escort to special heliborne operations (SHBO), support of combat search and rescue (CSAR) operations, and armed aerial scouting duties. In terms of its basic configuration, the LCH possesses a relatively narrow fuselage and is equipped with stealth profiling, armour protection, and is equipped to conduct day-and- night combat operations. According to reports, the protective measures included in the rotorcraft includes a digital camouflage system, an infrared (IR) suppressor fitted to the engine exhaust, and an exterior covered by canted flat panels to minimise its radar cross-section (RCS). It is furnished with an integrated dynamic system, including a hingeless main rotor and bearing-less tail rotor, which works in conjunction with an anti-resonance isolation system to dampen vibrations. During Aero India 2011, HAL's Rotary Wing Research & Design Centre informed the press that the LCH is \\"probably the most agile design in the world because of its rotor\\". The LCH had inherited many of its technical features from one of HAL's earlier indigenous rotorcraft, commonly known as the HAL Dhruv. Shared elements between the two helicopters include the power-plant used, both being powered by a pair of co- developed HAL/Turbomeca Shakti-1H1 derived from Safran Ardiden turboshaft engines, albeit fitted with infrared suppressors. The features that are unique to the rotorcraft includes its narrow fuselage, a crashworthy tricycle landing gear arrangement, crashworthy self-sealing fuel tanks, armour protection, and a low visibility profile; these design elements have been attributed as having resulted in a relatively lethal, agile and survivable rotorcraft. Atypically for a combat helicopter, it shall also be capable of high-altitude warfare (HAW), possessing an in-service operational ceiling of . Avionics and armaments Head-on view of the LCH with underwing rocket pods mounted on its stub wings The LCH is furnished with a glass cockpit which accommodates an Integrated Avionics and Display System (IADS) which used an array of multifunction displays in conjunction with the onboard target acquisition and designation (TADS) system. A prominent element of the TADS system is the helmet mounted sight (HMS), which serves as the principal instrument for targeting and triggering the rotorcraft's armaments. The LCH is protected via an extensive electronic warfare suite which is provided by the South African division of Saab Group; this suite comprises various defensive elements to guard against several different threats, these include a radar warning receiver (RWR), laser warning receiver (LWR) and a missile approach warning (MAW) system. The LCH is equipped with an integrated data link, which enables the type to participate in network-centric operations by facilitating the transfer of mission data to other platforms, comprising both airborne and ground-based elements. This networking capable is said to facilitate operational cooperation and force multiplication practices. The onboard sensor suite is Elbit CoMPASS, produced locally by Bharat Electronics Limited. It consists of a CCD camera, a forward looking infrared (FLIR) imaging sensor, a laser rangefinder and a laser designator to facilitate target acquisition under all-weather conditions, including under nighttime conditions. During 2006, it was announced that HAL had selected the M621 cannon to serve as the gun armament of the helicopter. The M621 cannon is incorporated in a Nexter- built THL 20 turret and integrated into a helmet-mounted sight.\\"Missile Mirage\\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, 1 January 2007.

Operational history During November 2016, the Indian Ministry of Defense (MoD) authorised the purchase of an initial batch of 15 LCHs for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Indian Army Air Corps (AAC), referred to as being a limited series production order.Waldron, Greg. \\"HAL commences LCH production.\\" Flight International, 29 August 2017. By mid-2017, the AAC had placed combined orders for 114 LCHs, while the IAF had a total of 65 LCHs on order. During early 2017, it was reported that the LCH's initial operating capability (IOC) with the Indian armed forces was expected to occur by 2018. The AAC intended to deploy the indigenous LCH alongside the American- built Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter.Kumar, Avinash. \\"Dusk and Dawn of the Indian Attack Helicopters.\\" Business Insider, 20 June 2015. Achieving export sales for the LCH has been a stated priority of both HAL and the Indian government.

Born in Bathurst, New South Wales, Mackay studied law and education at the University of Sydney. In 1926, he became a part-time history lecturer at St. Paul's College, and in 1932 he was a co-founder of the Australian Institute of Political Science, which argued for reform of the Australian Constitution. Encouraged by Labour MP Stafford Cripps, Mackay moved to England in 1934, and began practising law. He stood for the Frome constituency in the 1935 general election, losing by only 994 votes. In 1939, he took a post in the Ministry of Aircraft Production, where he became angered at Labour's reluctance to criticise government policy, and resigned from the party. In 1941, he published Federal Europe, calling for a federation of Western European nations, claiming that this would facilitate socialism. Mackay contested the 1942 Llandaff and Barry by-election as an \\"Independent Socialist\\" on the invitation of the 1941 Committee. Calling for an end to the UK National Government, claiming that this would result in the more effective prosecution of World War II, his campaign gained the support of the local Constituency Labour Party, but proved unsuccessful. Mackay later supported Tom Driberg's successful campaign in the 1942 Maldon by-election, and in 1943, he joined the Common Wealth Party, which had been formed by the merger of the 1941 Committee with Forward March. This new party shared his views on European federalism, and Mackay was able to immediately become its Chair. He altered the party's structure in order for it to focus on fighting by-elections. This had considerable success, Common Wealth gaining three seats during the Parliament. Mackay's position came under fire from several groups within Common Wealth. The London Region complained that he was a careerist and an anti-Marxist, while some Christians in the organisation argued that he was destroying the party's idealism in pursuit of electoralism. Mackay became increasingly interested in electoral reform. In 1943, he published Coupon or Free?: Being a Study in Electoral Reform and Representative Government. He hoped that Common Wealth would be able to affiliate to Labour along with the Independent Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain, and act as a left-wing pressure group. In the event, these groups both applied to affiliate after 1945, but their applications were rejected. Unable to convince Common Wealth of his position, Mackay resigned in late 1944 and rejoined Labour. Mackay stood for Hull North West at the 1945 general election, and gained the seat for Labour. In Parliament, he argued for increased power for the United Nations. In 1947, he joined the Keep Left faction. In 1946, Mackay was a founder member of the European Union of Federalists, superseded two years later by the European Movement. Federalism was unpopular within his own party, who associated the idea with the Conservative Party and the Movement for a United Europe. In distinction to Mackay, they argued that a federal Europe should not contain communist states. In 1949, he became the chair of the European Parliamentary Union. In 1950, Mackay's constituency was abolished, and he was instead elected for Reading North, but he lost this seat the following year. In 1953, he retired from politics due to ill health, but continued to write articles in support of federalism.

Crimp is sometimes described as a practitioner of the \\"in-yer- face\\" school of contemporary British drama, although he rejects the label.Harriet Devine Looking Back 2006 He is notable for the astringency of his dialogue, a tone of emotional detachment, a bleak view of human relationships ‚Äì none of his characters experience love or joy ‚Äì and latterly, a concern for theatrical form and language rather than an interest in narrative. Career The son of John Crimp, a British Rail signalling engineer, and his wife Jennie, Crimp's family moved in 1960 to Streatham where he attended a local primary school before winning a scholarship to Dulwich College. But when his father was transferred to York, he went to the nearby Pocklington School, where he showed an aptitude for languages, music, English literature and theatre. He read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge (1975‚Äì78), where his first play Clang was staged by fellow student Roger Michell.Aleks Sierz The Theatre of Martin Crimp, Methuen, 2006 Before establishing himself as a playwright, he put together An Anatomy, a collection of short stories, and also wrote a novel Still Early Days. These remain unpublished. His first six plays were performed at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond. As he told Marsha Hanlon in an interview for the Orange Tree appeal brochure in 1991: \\"When the Orange Tree ran a workshop for local writers [in September 1981], I was invited to take part. The carrot was the chance of a lunchtime production, so I wrote Living Remains and the Orange Tree staged it ‚Äî my first-ever produced play! I was so excited that I didn't think about the space where it was performed [then a room above a pub], but now I realise that the Orange Tree's intimacy and simplicity provided an extra layer of excitement.\\" Seven of his plays, and his second Ionesco translation have also been presented at the Royal Court Theatre, London, where he became writer-in- residence in 1997. His plays are now frequently performed in Europe. He has also been an assiduous translator of European texts. Possibly his most highly regarded, and certainly his boldest and most innovative play is Attempts on Her Life, first performed at the Royal Court in 1997 and subsequently translated into twenty languages. In this work, none of the lines is assigned to a particular character, nor does Crimp specify how many actors should perform the piece. In seventeen apparently disconnected scenes, groups of people give mutually contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist, a woman talked of as if she were, variously, a terrorist, the daughter of grieving parents, an artist and a new car. This deliberately fragmented work challenges an audience to re-define its notion of what constitutes a \\"play\\" and might seem to question whether someone has any existence beyond the models we construct.

The series, as of June 2009 (July '09 Party issue), is completed in Korea. It is complete with nine volumes. Nine of them have been translated and released in the United States and other parts of the world. It is translated into English by Yen Press, license absorbed from ICEkunion following the latter's dissolution. Plot Five years before the story begins, a fifth grade girl named Myung-Ee Joo is on her way to school when she accidentally bumps into a classmate, a boy named Yu-Da Lee. Yu-Da and Myung-Ee both have an instant dislike of each other but they have one thing in common; eyes that turn red at night when the moon's out. Later, Myung-Ee is asked out on a date by a tenth- grader and is annoyed at Yu-Da for his suspicions that the older boy wished to take advantage of her. This resulted in a conflict where she challenged Yu-Da to a fight after school. Yu-Da's suspicions of the tenth grader turned out to be correct. After school the older boy reveals himself to be a Fox who craves \\"Earth Rabbit Meat,\\" this being Yu-Da and Myung-Ee. Luckily, Yu-Da is saved by an unknown boy and faints. Myung-Ee, not knowing of what had happened, is left still waiting for Yu-Da thinking she has been stood up and resolves to never talk to him again. On the following day however, Yu-Da does not show up for class and no one in class remembers him. No one in the entire school except for Myung-Ee. Five years later, Myung-Ee transfers to a school in a new city but is shocked to see Yu-Da among the student council with no recollection of her or ever living in the city where they both went to school together. Yu- Da's school council friends prevent Myung-Ee from speaking with Yu-Da for long and one member, Sa-Eun, tries to attack her in her home to wipe her memories of ever meeting Yu-Da. She is rescued by Ho-Rang a fellow student at her new school. She soon finds out that she is an \\"Earth Rabbit\\". A descendant of the Rabbit people who came from the Moon. The school council members guarding Yu- Da are Foxes who hunt the Rabbits for their flesh. Yu-Da is the \\"black rabbit\\" whose liver is said to have special immortality powers. Since his disappearance, Yu-Da was imprisoned by the Foxes and put under a memory spell to forget his childhood. He is guarded by the Foxes until he matures and his liver is harvested. Mung-Ee decides she wants to save Yu-Da's life with the help of fellow Rabbit Ho-Rang even if it means being targeted by the powerful Foxes guarding him. Characters Main characters ;Yu-Da Lee :The main protagonist of the story, though he does not seem like it much. Yu-Da was raised by his kind grandpa who was killed by Foxes when he was in the fifth grade. He was outcast a little bit by his peers because of his background of having no parents and living in a poor part of the city. Even Myung-Ee made his life difficult by getting angry at him. His fifth grade personality was somewhat serious. He's known to be kind, not snobby, but he teased Myung-Ee on her hair and her rabbit print underwear. :Five years later, he's the Secretary of Chun-Ah High School's student council. His personality is completely opposite of what he was five years ago. He smiles a lot, wears glasses, has an unusual talisman on his hair, and is extremely kind. Can be considered the peace maker among the student council. He is living with Se-Eun because he is the \\"black rabbit\\". His liver has special powers that can grant the Fox, who devours the liver, an immortal life. So, he has to be protected by the student council, which consist of all Foxes. In order for the Foxes to watch Yu-Da, his memory had to be altered so he doesn't remember anything from five years ago. :When Yu-Da's glasses come off by either some kind of force or any other way, he becomes a completely different person known as \\"Black\\" Yu-Da. He wears his school uniform unbuttoned and loose. His expression is very cold, calculating, and very confident. Also, his \\"black rabbit\\" power is super strong at this point. He can hit Foxes without touching them. He does not even need a Ho-Se sword. Another ability he can do is erase/alter people's memories. He realizes that Myung-Ee really cares for him after her punch, and tells her not to hang out with Sa-Eun to get attention, yet she does not know what he means. ;Myung-Ee Joo :The main heroine of the story. A tenth grader who is super boy crazy and loves taking pictures of boys with her camera phone. She thought her life was pretty much normal with an exception that her eyes turn red whenever it's night time. She can be pretty loud and a bit obnoxious, but in truth, she really does care about other people and feels friendship is an important trait to have. Overall, she can be very brave and determined when fighting against the Foxes. Her \\"courage\\" gives her strength in certain situations. It is revealed that in her past life, she was the greatest female warrior of the rabbit tribe. She befriended Hang-Ah, but she had to kill two of her fox companions on the king's order. In her past life, she had died from the foxes while defending rabbits escaping to Earth during the attack of the foxes. ;Ho-Rang Jin :A serious but also whimsical twelfth grade boy. He is a very honorable heroic person. His family background is that of a noble family. Ho-Rang ran away from home when he was just seven years old because he didn't want to cause his grandfather any trouble concerning the Soon-La army. After vigorous training, Ho-Rang ended up being a Mo-Dal, which is the top rank for being in the Soon-La army. His fighting skills are very good and many Rabbit people in Junghyun Mountain admire him just for being strong. When he first met Myung-Ee, he dressed himself up in a super-hero costume calling himself Taekwon V. At his side is his talking cat, Ya-Ho. At school, he is the president of the kendo club which only had two members until Myung-Ee came along. Ho-Rang also accidentally saw Myung-Ee's \\"bumbum\\", and since he's such an honorable person, he made Myung-Ee his future wife. When it comes to meeting the student council, Ho-Rang has a small grudge against Sa- Eun and will sometimes challenge him to a fight.Ho-Rang once fought Sa-Eun in order to restore Myung-Ee's \\"honor\\" and found out that he likes her when he got hurt. ;Sa-Eun Won :The Treasurer for the student council. He's an unusual case of being an elite Fox. He was brought to the Bon-Ga at the age of 10 unlike other Foxes who were born at the Bon-Ga. Sa-Eun is also the one responsible for finding Yu-Da and taking care of him. His personality is rather stern but he does crack a smirk/grin here and there. He takes his guardian duty seriously over Yu-Da since they live in the same house. His powers are considerably strong too since he's an elite Fox. He can wield a sword quite well, use some magic, and isn't afraid of crashing into people's apartments. Sa-Eun is a smoker so along with his cigarette comes a perverted imprisoned smokey soul named Moky-Moky. He starts to like Myung-Ee because she wasn't afraid of him. He does not want to give up on her even if she's still after Yu-Da. Secondary characters ;Ya-Ho :She is Ho-Rang's talking cat. When it's school time, she changes into a human in order to spy for Ho-Rang. Ya-Ho is the first friend that Myung-Ee meets in Chun-Ah High. At first, she couldn't speak really well. Then, she could only move her mouth to make out words. Finally, with Myung-Ee's small advice, Ya-Ho was able to speak using her voice. She can't speak human well so her words are choppy. Despite that, what she says can come out really funny. Ya-Ho acts sometimes like a mentor towards both Myung-Ee and Ho-Rang when she lectures them. :During a confrontation between Hee-Ju and Ha-Eun, Ya-Ho is severely injured by the stray foxes and is taken into He-Eun's care. When Myung-Ee goes to see Ha-Eun, Ya-Ho has no memory of her. ;Chi-In Shin :He is the student council President and a classmate in Ho-Rang's class. Correction, the \\"sick\\" student council president. He's always sick because he refuses to drink Rabbit blood. He seems to disagree with the way he and the other foxes plan on using Yu-da in the future and considers him a friend, even going so far as to start crying when confronted by it from Myung-Ee. Without Rabbit blood, he's very weak so the Vice-President has been always watching over him. Chi-In doesn't like Ho-Rang that much and wishes to see Ho-Rang's kendo club to be officially closed. :It is revealed in volume 6 that Chi-In is in contact with Ha-Eun and his ideals. During the attack in volume 8, Ha-Eun takes over his body after Sun-Ok's becomes of no use to him. ;Jin-Soo Jung :She is the feisty student council's Vice-President in leopard patterned boots. Jin-Soo, in eleventh grade, loves to see everything kept in order and would constantly check to make sure of that. She's also the one who would usually report things to and from the Bon- Ga elders. Jin-Soo cares greatly about Chi-In's health and has been taking care of him since their Bon-Ga days. Sa-Eun can sometimes say something that sets off Jin-Soo's anger, which causes Jin-Soo to beat up Sa-Eun. Jin-Soo's damage to Sa-Eun is pretty severe so it's best to never ever cross paths with her when she's in that state. Even Yu-Da's \\"shiny face attack\\" doesn't work on pacifying Jin-Soo's anger. ;Mok-Hee Kum (Moky-Moky) :The smoke spirit that hangs around in Sa-Eun's cigarettes who likes girls a lot. He speaks in a perverted tone. Actually, he's not really a spirit. He's a Fox who was banished to become smoke and was entrusted in Sa-Eun's care because of a lot of bad mistakes that he committed in the past. He is good with magic and not really much of a fighter, but he dodges attacks quite easily. When drinking Earth Rabbit blood, he doesn't take a lot because he considers himself one of the more \\"gentle\\" Foxes. Mok-Hee seems to appear more for the comedy relief but behind his cutesy smile, there's always some sort of ulterior plan that he's bound to pull off. ;Ga-Woo Yang :The cross-dresser of the story. He owns a clothing store in Junghyun Mountain and loves dressing himself in dresses of all sorts. His power and strength is only second to that of Ho-Rang. Back when he and Ho-Rang were kids, Ho-Rang accidentally asked Ga-Woo to go out with him because he thought Ga-Woo was a girl. Now, he likes to call Ho-Rang his \\"fiance\\" just for kicks. Ga-Woo helps Myung-Ee train to become a part of the Soon-La army. He seems to always know more than what he says or does. ;Hee-Ju Lim :The boy with the mafia hair-do as Myung-Ee usually refers to him as. He first meets Myung-Ee in Junghyun Mountain and finds a hard time accepting her as a true Rabbit fit for the Soon-La army. When both of them get stuck in a high level training simulator, Hee-Ju learns the importance of friendship and decides to respect Myung-Ee. He acts tough because he wants to be the best warrior in the army but his heart has a soft-side for his friends. He later appears again in an older form of himself in order to pass off as a high school student. : Soon after Sun-Ok is taken over, Hee-Ju goes back to Junghyun Mountain feeling as though he failed. Supporting characters ;Fan-Sy-Cou :Their full name is \\"Fans of Sa-Eun and Yu-Da Couple\\". They are three insane crazy girls who support a yaoi couple of Sa-Eun and Yu-Da. When they say their club motto, they do it in a Charlie Angels style. They were asked by Seo-Wha to do something horrible to Myung-Ee so they stole her underwear and pinned it across from the student council room. ;Seo-Wha :Even though she appeared at the end of volume one, most of volume two, and the beginning of volume three, she doesn't seem like the type who would come back again after her \\"incident\\" with Yu-Da. A Fox who has a bad childhood. As a kid in Bon-Ga, she grew up being disliked by many of the other Fox children and adults alike. This is due to her habit of eating just about anything. She'll eat a cute innocent kitten. She'll eat a bird. Seo-Wha only knows how to cast small spells on Earth Rabbits, which are considered \\"pitiful\\" by the Fox Tribe. :She was subjugated to bullying until Sa-Eun came along telling the other kids to bug off. Seo-Wha realized that while she's with Sa-Eun, she won't get bullied. Now in high school, Seo-Wha is still attached to Sa-Eun. She grew jealous of both Myung-Ee and Yu-Da for being so close to Sa-Eun. She hates Yu-Da above all for being a Rabbit and living with Sa-Eun. Seo-Wha couldn't accept the fact that the \\"prey\\" is living with the foxes. When Seo- Wha got injured in a fight against Ho-Rang and Myung-Ee, she came across Yu- Da. She whacked Yu-Da's comforting hand away from her in anger causing Yu-Da's glasses to fall off. It was then that \\"Black\\" Yu-Da woke up and made sure that she wouldn't make another anger rant again. ;Ah-Ri and Min-Soo :Best friends of Hee-Ju who were possessed by Foxes in the training simulator in Junghyun Mountain. ;Myung-Ee's Teacher :The teacher of Myung-Ee's class appears in the form of a tiger with an Olympic medal on his/her chest. He/She can be very fierce but great for comedy relief. ;Yu-Da's Grandpa :A very gentle and kind grandfather who was the only remaining family member left of Yu-Da's. He appears only in the first volume and some flashbacks later on. He walks around with a walking stick and wears glasses. Myung-Ee saw him briefly. At first, she thought he was a kind old man until he started to joke around, which Myung-Ee took whatever he said, personally. He died in the hands of Foxes. \\"Black\\" Yu-Da, to this very day, can't forgive the Foxes for killing his grandpa. ;Elders :From both Rabbit and Fox sides, there are going to be these so-called \\"Elders\\". Old people who have the highest authority over their respective sides. They've been mentioned several times. ;Sun-Ok :A human girl who Hee-Ju meets during the culture festival. He saves her from when low level foxes attack, but ends up getting possessed by the spirit of Ha-Eun. In volume 8, her body is discarded by Ha-Eun after it becomes too damaged. Antagonists ;Ha-Eun :A noble being in the Moon Palace. In order to live on earth, he must possess one's body. He calls them 'sacrifices' or 'tools', though he is very thankful for them. :In the past, Ha-Eun was the White Rabbit on the moon. He invited Hang-Ah to the moon and made her immortal without telling her. When she discovers the truth, she is thrown into a depression. Hang-Ah begins to slowly lose her sanity and soon begins attacking those in the palace. Ha-Eun disappeared. ;Yumei :A Low-Level fox taken in by Ha-Eun. She has no facial expressions, as a side effect of taking restoration medicine. In volume 8, it is revealed that she likes Yu-Da. Terminology ;Bon-Ga: The place where high level Foxes get to live and play away from human contact. The elite group of Foxes are chosen here and one of their missions is to keep the Black Rabbit from being rescued. ;Earth Rabbit: Rabbits who fled to the Earth from the Moon in order to escape the Fox invasion. Upon living on Earth for many years, many of them have lost their identity and became more like humans. The only difference that set them apart from the humans are their eyes that turn red when it's night. If any Earth Rabbit comes to Junghyun Mountain, their eyes turn red in an instant. ;Foxes' Sword: Some Foxes uses their long claws as defense weapons but the highly trained Foxes don't use their claws. Like Sa-Eun, there are foxes that use swords that's made out of their claws. ;Fox Tribe: Creatures from who knows where. When there was no more Rabbits on the Moon, they followed the Rabbits to Earth. They assumed human form and made their own little community which is Bon-Ga. There are two different types of foxes. #High Level Foxes: Are the elite ones chosen to have a good education mentally and physically so they can live among humans and be able to defend themselves against the Soon-La army. They are chosen right away from birth so they don't even know who their real parents are. #Low Level Foxes: Are the Foxes who aren't capable of controlling themselves. They seem to act almost zombie/animalistic. They are always hungry for Rabbit blood and meat they have already attacked humans. Very dangerous people. ;Ho-Se Sword: A sword that can be formed upon will by a Rabbit. Depending on the wielder's control, the sword will take the shape of whatever the wielder desires of it. ;Hun-Choo-Oak: A special talisman that acts like a tracking device for the Foxes. ;Junghyun Mountain: The place where Rabbits, who don't want to live among humans, stay. The gravity in the area is equivalent to the Moon's gravity so no human is even able to survive being there. ;Mung-Guh-Wan: A special pill that's used for altering memories. ;Mung-Guh-Yeon: Used for mass wide manipulation/altering that only works on humans. ;Rabbit Tribe: The same as Earth Rabbits except, these Rabbits are the ones who are able to preserve their sense of identity by building a hidden community underneath Earth's surface called Junghyun Mountain. They don't live among humans, except when they're on missions. When they are in Junghyun Mountain, not only do their eyes turn red but also, their rabbit ears come out as well. ;Soon-La Army: The elite group of Rabbits chosen to help fight and defend themselves and each other against Foxes. A part of their mission is to rescue the Black Rabbit from the Foxes. Just like the high level Foxes, those chosen to be in the army are usually picked from birth and have never once met their parents.

Prehistory The evolution of the martial arts has been described by historians in the context of countless historical battles. Building on the work of Laughlin (1956, 1961), argues that the martial arts of the Chinese, Japanese and Aleut peoples, Mongolian wrestling all have \\"roots in the prehistoric era and to a common Mongoloid ancestral people who inhabited north-eastern Asia.\\". India Dhanurveda, a section found in the Vedas (1700 BC - 1100 BC) contains references to martial arts. Around the 3rd century BC, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali taught how to meditate single- mindedly on points located inside one's body, which was later used in martial arts, while various mudra finger movements were taught in Yogacara Buddhism. These elements of yoga, as well as finger movements in the nata dances, were later incorporated into various martial arts.J. R. Svinth (2002). A Chronological History of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports. Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences.The Bodhisattva Warriors : The Origin, Inner Philosophy, History, and Symbolism of the Buddhist Martial Art within India and China, by Terence Dukes (1994). Publisher: Yorkindo Beach, Me. The Spiritual Legacy of Shaolin Temple: Buddhism, Daoism, and the Energetic Arts - Page 78 by Andy James. Published 2004. Wisdom Publications. 179 pages. Indian martial arts were an important influence in the development of a number of modern Asian martial arts, particularly within the Indian cultural sphere (countries outside India influenced by Indian culture and religion) of Southeast Asia. Examples include Indo-Malay silat,Draeger, Donn F. (1992). Weapons and Fighting Arts of Indonesia. pg 23. Tuttle Publishing Burmese banshay, naban and bando,Draeger, Donn F. (1981). Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts pg 155. Kodansha International. Filipino escrima and kali,Mark V. Wiley (1994). Filipino Martial Arts: Serrada Escrima pg21. Tuttle Publishing Thai krabi krabongDraeger, Donn F. (1981). Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts. Kodansha International. and Cambodian bokator. Indian martial arts also lightly influenced the various forms of Indochinese kickboxing, namely Muay Thai from Thailand, Muay Lao from Laos, Tomoi from Malaysia, Pradal Serey from Cambodia and Lethwei from Myanmar. China Chinese boxing can be reliably traced back to the Zhou dynasty (1122-255 BC). During the Spring and Autumn period, the literature mentions displays of archery, fencing and wrestling by nobles. Warfare between rival states was conducted according to Confucian chivalry (deference to rank, attacking in turn, food sent to hungry enemies). During the Warring States period, warfare grew bloodier and common men were expected to have skill in personal attack (chi-chi). Shaolin monastery records state that two of its very first monks, Huiguang and Sengchou, were expert in the martial arts years before the arrival of Bodhidharma. The martial arts ShuƒÅi JiƒÅo and Sun Bin Quan predate the establishment of the Shaolin Monastery by centuries. as does sh«íub√≥ (ÊâãÊêè). Indian martial arts may have spread to China via the transmission of Buddhism in the early 5th or 6th centuries of the common era and thus influenced Shaolin Kungfu. Elements from Indian philosophy, like the NƒÅga, Rakshasa, and the fierce Yaksha were syncretized into protectors of Dharma; these mythical figures from the Dharmic religions figure prominently in Shaolinquan, Chang quan and staff fighting.Wells, Marnix, and Naizhou Chang. Scholar Boxer: Chang Naizhou's Theory of Internal Martial Arts and the Evolution of Taijiquan. Berkeley, Calif: North Atlantic Books, 2004, p. 23 The religious figures from Dharmic religions also figure in the movement and fighting techniques of Chinese martial arts.Wells, Scholar Boxer, p. 200 Various styles of kung fu are known to contain movements that are identical to the Mudra hand positions used in Hinduism and Buddhism, both of which derived from India.Johnson, Nathan J. Barefoot Zen: The Shaolin Roots of Kung Fu and Karate. York Beach, Me: S. Weiser, 2000, p. 48 Similarly, the 108 pressure points in Chinese martial arts are believed by some to be based on the marmam points of Indian varmakalai. The predominant telling of the diffusion of the martial arts from India to China involves a 5th-century prince turned into a monk named Bodhidharma who is said to have traveled to Shaolin, sharing his own style and thus creating Shaolinquan. According to Wong Kiew Kit, the Monk's creation of Shaolin arts \\"...marked a watershed in the history of kungfu, because it led to a change of course, as kungfu became institutionalized. Before this, martial arts were known only in general sense.\\"Wong, Kiew Kit. The Art of Shaolin Kung Fu: The Secrets of Kung Fu for Self-Defense Health and Enlightenment. Tuttle martial arts. Boston, Mass: Tuttle, 2002, p. 13 Main gate of the Shaolin temple in Henan. The association of Bodhidharma with martial arts is attributed to Bodhidharma's own Yi Jin Jing, though its authorship has been disputed by several modern historians such as Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Matsuda Ryuchi. The oldest known available copy of the Yi Jin Jing was published in 1827 and the composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624. According to Matsuda, none of the contemporary texts written about the Shaolin martial arts before the 19th century, such as Cheng Zongyou's Exposition of the Original Shaolin Staff Method or Zhang Kongzhao's Boxing Classic: Essential Boxing Methods, mention Bodhidharma or credit him with the creation of the Shaolin martial arts. The association of Bodhidharma with the martial arts only became widespread after the 1904‚Äì1907 serialization of the novel The Travels of Lao Ts'an in Illustrated Fiction Magazine.. The discovery of arms caches in the monasteries of Chang'an during government raids in 446 AD suggests that Chinese monks practiced martial arts prior to the establishment of the Shaolin Monastery in 497. Moreover, Chinese monasteries, not unlike those of Europe, in many ways were effectively large landed estates, that is, sources of considerable wealth which required protection that had to be supplied by the monasteries' own manpower. Japan The historical origin of Japanese martial arts can be found in the warrior traditions of the samurai and the caste system that restricted the use of weapons by members of the non-warrior classes. Originally, samurai were expected to be proficient in many weapons, as well as unarmed combat, and attain the highest possible mastery of combat skills, for the purpose of glorifying either themselves or their lord. Over time, this purpose gave way to a philosophy of achieving spiritual goals by striving to perfect their martial skills. Korea Wrestling, called Ssireum, and Taekkyon are the oldest forms of unarmed fighting in Korea. Besides being used to train soldiers, these were also popular among villagers during festivals, for dancing, mask performance and sport-fighting. The ancient Koreans did develop their own comprehensive system of unarmed weapon-based combat, but they had a preference for bows and arrows. It appears that during the Goguryeo dynasty, (37 BC ‚Äì 668 AD) subak (empty-handed fighting), swordsmanship, bow and arrow, spear-fighting and horse riding were practiced. In 1593, Korea received help from China to win back Pyongyang from the Japanese. During one of the battles, the Koreans learned about a martial art manual titled Ji Xiao Xin Shu (Á¥ÄÊïàÊñ∞Êõ∏), written by the Chinese military strategist Qi Jiguang. King Seonjo (1567‚Äì1608) took a personal interest in the book, and ordered his court to study the book. This led to the creation of the Muyejebo (Î¨¥ÏòàÏ†úÎ≥¥, Hanja: Ê≠¶ËóùË´∏Ë≠ú) in 1599 by Han Gyo, who had studied the use of several weapons with the Chinese army. Soon this book was revised in the Muyejebo Seokjib and in 1759, the book was revised and published at the Muyesinbo (Hangul: Î¨¥ÏòàÏã†Î≥¥, Hanja: Ê≠¶ËóùÊñ∞Ë≠ú).Kim, Wee- hyun. \\"Muyedobo T'ongji: Illustrated Survey of the Martial arts.\\" Korea Journal 26:8 (August 1986): 42-54. In 1790, these two books formed the basis, together with other Korean, Chinese, and Japanese martial art manuals, of the richly illustrated Muyedobotongji (Hangul: Î¨¥ÏòàÎèÑÎ≥¥ÌÜµÏßÄ, Hanja: Ê≠¶ËóùÂúñË≠úÈÄöÂøó). The book does not refer to Taekkyon, but shows influences from Chinese and Japanese fighting systems. It deals mostly with armed combat like sword fighting, double-sword fighting, spear fighting, stick fighting, and so on.  Indonesia  The Indonesian natives began to develop and formulate various style of combat and self-defence systems. Archaeological findings revealed that the origins of Pencak Silat dates back to the sixth century, to the times of the Srivijaya empire on Sumatra and also the 13th century Majapahit empire in East Java. Artifacts showed that this unique combat system had been used consistently through Indonesia‚Äôs history. Philippines Filipino martial arts are considered hybrid systems which incorporates elements from both western and eastern martial arts. Its origins are Asian and come from a period wherein the various prehispanic Philippine states; Rajahnates, Kingdoms, Sultanates and Lakanates warred with each other, therefore producing a rich martial tradition with hundreds of schools as numerous as there are Filipino ethnic groups. It then incorporated Western elements when the Spaniards arrived from Mexico and they unified these prehispanic states unto one Filipino identity and thus, infused the Filipino martial arts with European styles of combat. During the Spanish period, Chinese and Japanese converts to Christianity who fled to the Philippines away from their homeland's persecution, also enriched Filipino martial arts with their own styles. The British Occupation of Manila (Launched from India) and the Moro Wars also shaped Filipino martial arts up to a certain extent. Although the martial arts fell into disuse during the artillery-intensive Philippine Revolution and Philippine-American War, it became practical again during the Japanese occupation especially to Guerillas. Vietnam Flying scissors to the neck. The opponent is forced to the ground with a twist of the body. Vietnamese martial arts are influenced by efforts to defend the country from foreign threats . The most influential in the country's martial arts is China with its thousand-year occupation of Vietnam. But through thousands of years of internal, civil strife: dynastic changes (dynasties), foreign conquests, warlordism and guerrilla tactics, the Vietnamese martial artists used what they learned from their neighbors and evolved a unique form of martial arts. The martial arts were used by Vietnamese kings to train their troops and to defend the country against enemies. In addition to the army, family clans and Buddhist temples cultivated a variety of styles to defend themselves.

It extends from an intersection with NY 5S in the town of Danube to a junction with NY 28 and NY 29 in the village of Middleville. The route directly connects the city of Little Falls to the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90), which bypasses the city to the south. Outside of Little Falls, NY 169 is a two-lane highway that passes through sparsely developed areas. In 1910, the portion of NY 169 between Little Falls and Middleville became part of Route 26, an unsigned legislative route created by the New York State Legislature. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it became signed as NY 169 and originally extended from NY 5 in Little Falls to NY 28 and NY 29 in Middleville. It was then later extended southward in the late 1970s to connect to a new exit on the Thruway. Route description NY 169 approaching the Thruway and NY 5S NY 169 begins a short distance north of New York State Thruway (I-90) exit 29A at an intersection with NY 5S in the town of Danube. It initially heads northward, paralleling a north‚Äìsouth roadway leading away from the exit that overpasses NY 5S. The two roads converge after , directly connecting NY 169 to the Thruway. NY 169 continues on a northward course to just south of the Mohawk River, where it turns to the northwest and subsequently follows the river, through a wooded area that leads toward the city of Little Falls. NY 169 northbound at junction with NY 5 and NY 167 As the route approaches Little Falls, it makes a slight turn to the north, crossing over the Mohawk River (here part of the Erie Canal) and the CSX Railroad, on its way to an intersection with a divided highway carrying NY 5 and NY 167\\\\. NY 169 turns west here, following the highway for toward Little Falls. The resulting overlap with NY 167 is a wrong-way concurrency as NY 169 northbound is concurrent to NY 167 southbound and vice versa. At East Main Street, NY 169 leaves NY 5 and NY 167 to follow East Main Street into the city. The street splits into a one-way couplet three blocks later, at which point southbound NY 169 is shifted one block south onto Albany Street. The route follows the couplet for three blocks, passing through the city's central business district prior to intersecting Ann Street. Here, the two directions of NY 169 converge to follow Ann Street north into a more residential neighborhood. The junction of Albany Street and Ann Street also features northbound NY 167, which approaches the same intersection from the west along Albany Street and abuts NY 169 southbound as the latter route turns east on Albany Street from Ann Street. NY 169 follows Ann Street for four blocks (five southbound) to Monroe Street, where it intersects the southern terminus of NY 170. NY 169 at its terminus with NY 28 and NY 29 in Middleville While East Monroe Street, located to the east of Ann Street, heads along the northern fringe of Little Falls as NY 170, West Monroe Street carries NY 169 northwestward past more homes and, eventually, out of the city limits. Now in the town of Little Falls, the route passes through mostly open areas while serving a small handful of isolated homes. It eventually crosses into the town of Fairfield, where it takes on a more northerly and more winding alignment. After , the route reaches the village of Middleville, located northwest of Little Falls. Within Middleville, NY 169 passes by a row of homes prior to ending at an intersection with NY 28 and the western terminus of NY 29. History The portion of what is now NY 169 between the Little Falls city line and Middleville became part of a realigned Route 26, an unsigned legislative route, created by the New York State Legislature in 1910. Route 26 extended from Routes 5 and 6 in Mohawk, eastward to the city of Little Falls, then north to Trenton, via Middleville and Newport, where it intersected Route 25. NY 169 was not assigned a posted designation until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it was designated as NY 169, which originally began in downtown Little Falls at NY 5. Thruway exit 29A By December 1973, exit 29A on the Thruway was completed, along with new roadway leading from the exit to the south end of the Finks Basin Bridge. Then by December 1974, the NY 5 arterial was completed in Little Falls. At this time the only main connection between the Thruway and Little Falls was the Finks Basin Bridge, a one-way signalized bridge with a 15 ton limit. This caused trucks over 15 tons to detour along NY 5S and NY 167 to access Little Falls. Along NY 5S trucks had to climb a steep 7.2% grade for just over then descend 7% grade for . Then by 1978, a new two-lane arterial highway was being built from NY 5 to the south side of the Finks Basin Bridge, where it intersected the previously built roadway linking to the Thruway. By 1981, the new roadway was completed and NY 169 was extended south to NY 5S and better accessed the new exit 29A on the New York State Thruway. On August 4, 2006, a section of NY 169 was closed to traffic, north of the intersection with North Creek Road, due to a deficient culvert pipe. The new pipe, installed by Reale Construction Company, was installed and open to traffic on October 6, 2006.

(also known as Wild Weed; The Devil's Weed; Marijuana, the Devil's Weed; and The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Expos√© of the Marijuana Racket) is a 1949 exploitation film that follows in the spirit of morality tales such as the 1936 films Reefer Madness and Marihuana. Directed by Sam Newfield (using the pseudonym \\"Sherman Scott\\") and starring Lila Leeds, it was originally produced to capitalize on the arrest of Leeds and Robert Mitchum on a charge of marijuana conspiracy. The film was issued under many titles; it struggled to find a distributor until film presenter Kroger Babb picked up the rights, reissuing it as The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Expos√© of the Marijuana Racket. Its relative success came only after the promotional posters were redone and a story fabricated that the film was being presented in conjunction with the United States Treasury. Plot Leeds' character is \\"Anne Lester\\", a young orphan trying to pay for her brother's college education. After meeting Markey, a drug dealer, Anne begins to believe that she must smoke marijuana to fit in with her friends. She then goes to a \\"tea party\\", where she tries the drug for the first time. She is unaffected by the initial experiment, and loses her fear of drugs as she continues to use it willingly.Schaefer, 243.Reefer Madness reprint. Anne's drug use results in the loss of many of her inhibitions, and the film shows her actions under the influence, including scenes implying sexual promiscuity. As the film progresses, she is fired from her job and begins selling drugs for Markey. Her brother hangs himself when he learns of her new job, and she is arrested and given a tour of the various psychiatric wards and jails in which drug users end up. Finally, after 50 days in jail, she is released, cleaned up and ready to cooperate with the authorities regarding Markey.

(1949) The film itself is semi-biographical, its story following what Leeds herself experienced. The film was inspired by the highly publicized arrest of movie stars Robert Mitchum and Leeds for marijuana possession. On September 1, 1948, the actors, along with two others, were arrested after being caught smoking marijuana at the home of Leeds in the early morning, and were charged with the felony of narcotics possession. Leeds was sentenced to sixty days in prison and placed on probation for five years.Schaefer, 241‚Äì42. Upon her release, Leeds struggled to find work in Hollywood, and signed on to star in Wild Weed.Schaefer, 242. During publicity for the film in 1949, Leeds, who had been 20 at the time of the arrest, said that appearing in the picture would keep other people her age from trying drugs,Unknown 1948‚Äì1949 magazine. but in 1952 she confided in Collier's that she \\"only had one offer‚Ä¶ which was an obvious attempt to capitalize on the Mitchum case notoriety. I took it. I was broke.\\"Colliers. The film gained approval from the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to use the drug references, a standard practice at the time even though the Bureau had no power to censor the films.Booth, 212. The film used its plot to push many of the beliefs of the time: that drug-using youth would turn to crime and the theory of \\"marijuana as a gateway drug\\". The latter was a leading argument for drug prohibition during the era, and an argument that Leeds herself made, based on her own history with marijuana and heroin.Schaefer, 243‚Äì44. She Shoulda Said 'No'! released as The Devil's Weed Via Franklin Productions, Kay filmed the production in six days, a common occurrence given that most films of the era were shot with a quick turnaround. Eureka Productions initially distributed the film, but it struggled to find an audience until Kroger Babb's Hallmark Productions acquired the rights for distribution. Babb initially marketed the film under the title The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Expos√© of the Marijuana Racket, but failed to achieve success with that title and eventually changed it to \\"She Shoulda Said 'No'!\\". He pushed the sensuality of Leeds with new promotional photographs and a new tagline: \\"How Bad Can a Good Girl Get... without losing her virtue or respect???\\", while sending letters to local communities falsely claiming that the United States Treasury Department implored Hallmark to release the film \\"in as many towns and cities as possible in the shortest possible length of time\\" as a public service.Schaefer, 125. The square-up misleadingly stated that the producers wished to \\"publicly acknowledge the splendid cooperation of the Nation's narcotic experts and Government departments, who aided in various ways the success of this production‚Ä¶. If its presentation saves but one young girl or boy from becoming a 'dope fiend' ‚Äì then its story has been well told.\\"Shapiro, 90. Babb, who gained notoriety for his various marketing gimmicks, occasionally had Leeds make appearances and give lectures at showings of the film.Quarles, 56. Babb often booked the movie as a midnight presentation twice a week in the same town; David F. Friedman, who would later use the film in his own double- billings, attributed the distribution plan to a film that was so low in quality that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible. Reception According to Friedman, Babb's presentations of the film made more money than any other film the same theater would showcase over a typical film's full booking.Friedman, 52. While actual dollar figures are not available because of the nature of the genre (which was known for poor record keeping and unconventional distribution practices), the general financial success of \\"She Shoulda Said 'No'!\\" prompted producers, in 1951, to import a similar film from Argentina titled The Marihuana Story. That film, about a doctor who goes undercover into the world of drug addicts to learn about his wife's death only to become addicted to marijuana himself, was not as successful as other exploitation-style efforts as the public was more concerned about drug use by younger people.Schaefer, 244‚Äì245. \\"She Shoulda Said 'No'!\\" was not well-received critically upon its initial release, with The New York Times saying, \\"Never did vice seem so devoid of enchantment.\\"The New York Times. Production and distribution of drug films slowed considerably following the film's run until Frank Sinatra's The Man with the Golden Arm forced changes to the Production Code, which was a studio-based system which regulated various aspects of objectionable content in films.Shapiro, 93. The film achieved some attention due to its B movie status over the years,Briggs. being featured in a number of film compilations while continuing to focus on the salacious material as a selling point. In 1993, a VHS version was released as part of \\"David Friedman's Roadshow Rarities\\", the twenty-ninth volume in the Something Weird video series.Something Weird Video.

Since its inception in 2004, it has been located in Bellinzona.  Legal basis  Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland in Bellinzona Article 191a para. 1 of the Swiss Constitution of 18 April 1999, (SC; SR [Classified Compilation of Federal Legislation] no. 101) states: The Confederation shall appoint a criminal court, which shall hear at first instance criminal cases that by law come under federal jurisdiction. The law may confer further powers on the Federal Criminal Court. The Federal Act on the Organization of the Federal Criminal Authorities (SR no. 173.71) governs status, organization, jurisdiction and the applicable procedural law. Furthermore, its internal Organizational Regulations of 31 August 2010, (SR no. 173.713.161) provides for the rules applicable to the Federal Criminal Court's organization and administration.  Jurisdiction  The Federal Criminal Court's Penal Chamber renders decisions on indictments for crimes that by law come under federal jurisdiction; primarily the felonies specified in articles 23 and 24 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 5 October 2007 (Criminal Procedure Code, CPC; SR no. 312.0). The Court's Penal Chamber moreover tries criminal offences for which jurisdiction is conferred upon the Court either by administrative criminal law or by other federal acts. The Federal Criminal Court's Appeals Chamber provides judicial review in unfolding federal criminal proceedings, in particular by adjudicating complaints against the rulings and procedural acts of the police, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (the federal public prosecutor), the Court's Penal Chamber and the Compulsory Measures Court. Its jurisdiction encompasses other matters; paramount among those are, both in number of cases and in material significance, remedies concerning international assistance in criminal matters (including cases of extradition).  Organisation and size  Pursuant to articles 32 et sqq. of the Federal Act on the Organization of the Federal Criminal Authorities, the Federal Criminal Court comprises the two above-mentioned chambers (each with a presiding judge) and the General Secretariat with its administrative and technical services. The Court manifests and administrates itself by dint of the following executive bodies: the Office of the Chief Justice, the Court's Plenary Assembly and the Administrative Commission. As of January 2013, the Federal Criminal Court is constituted with a staff of about 65 people, 18 of which are judges.

In full operation since 2019, NEON gathers and provides long-term, standardized data on ecological responses of the biosphere to changes in land use and climate, and on feedback with the geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. NEON is a continental-scale research platform for understanding how and why our ecosystems are changing. Vision and mission A short documentary demonstrating the goals of NEON The vision for NEON is to guide global understanding and decisions in a changing environment with scientific information about continental-scale ecology through integrated observations, experiments and forecasts. NEON's mission is to design, implement and operate the first and foremost integrated continental‚Äêscale scientific infrastructure to enable research, discovery and education about ecological change. NEON collects ecological and climatic observations across the continental United States, including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The observatory is among the first to detect and enable forecasting of ecological change at continental scales over multiple decades. NEON has partitioned the United States into 20 ecoclimatic domains, each of which represents different regions of vegetation, landforms, climate, and ecosystem performance. Data is collected by field technicians and passive sensors at strategically selected sites within each domain and synthesized into information products that can be used to describe changes in the nation's ecosystem through space and time. NEON data products are freely available via a web portal. Purpose and function Science NEON headquarters in Boulder NEON tower at the Jornada Experimental Range The data NEON collects are defined by a series of Grand Challenges, as identified by the National Research Council at the request of the National Science Foundation. The National Research Council established a committee to evaluate the major ecological, environmental, and national concerns that require a continental-scale observatory, and it identified the following Environmental Grand Challenges: * Biogeochemistry: The study of how chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes combine to create the natural environment. * Biodiversity: The full range of life forms on earth, or in a particular region. * Climate change: A significant long-term change in the kind of weather we would expect based on averages calculated from climate data. * Ecohydrology: The study of how organisms interact with their environment and with the constant movement of water. * Infectious Diseases: Diseases spread by viruses, parasites, and bacteria that are sometimes transmitted to people by animals, birds, and insects. * Land Use: The many ways that people change the natural landscape and environment, such as by building cities, cutting down forests, or planting crops. * Invasive Species: Plants and organisms that overpopulate a particular place, or species that move into areas they haven‚Äôt lived in before. Thus, the data and observations that NEON collects focuses on how land use, climate change and invasive species affect biodiversity, disease ecology, and ecosystem services. Obtaining integrated data on these relationships over a long-term period is crucial to improving forecast models and resource management for environmental change. The National Science Foundation's vision for NEON is described as: > \\"A continental scale research instrument consisting of geographically > distributed infrastructure, networked via state-of-the-art communications. > Cutting-edge lab and field instrumentation, site-based experimental > infrastructure, natural history archive facilities and/or computational, > analytical and modeling capabilities, linked via a computational network > will comprise NEON. NEON will transform ecological research by enabling > studies on major environmental challenges at regional to continental scales. > Scientists and engineers will use NEON to conduct real-time ecological > studies spanning all levels of biological organization and temporal and > geographical scales. NSF disciplinary and multi-disciplinary programs will > support NEON research projects and educational activities. Data from > standard measurements made using NEON will be publicly available.‚Äù (NSF > 04549, 2004)NSF Synopsis for NEON NEON is specifically designed to address central scientific questions about the interactions of ecosystems, climate, and land use: * How will ecosystems and their components respond to changes in natural- and human-induced forcings such as climate, land use, and invasive species across a range of spatial and temporal scales? And, what is the pace and pattern of the responses? * How do the internal responses and feedbacks of biogeochemistry, biodiversity, hydroecology, and biotic structure and function interact with changes in climate, land use, and invasive species? And, how do these feedbacks vary with ecological context and spatial and temporal scales? Education The data and information products that NEON collects and provides is readily available to scientists, educators, students, decision makers and the public to use to understand and address ecological questions and issues. Data is provided as meaningful information and learning tools that engage many audiences, including members of underserved communities, and promote broad ecological literacy. History NEON was initially conceived in 2000, with a preliminary plan being developed in 2006. The National Science Foundation, the National Science Board and Congress approved funding for NEON in 2011. Beginning in 2011, NEON, Inc., the entity in charge of initially running the NEON project, was audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency on behalf of the National Science Foundation Office of the Inspector General. Auditor-in-Charge J. Kirk McGill determined that NEON, Inc. had poor control over taxpayer funds and could easily go over budget with little or no warning. He also found that NEON, Inc. had spent taxpayer funds on illegal expenditures including alcohol, lobbying, parties, and luxury travel. When McGill's findings were not addressed by senior DCAA management, he disclosed the matter directly to Congress. On December 3, 2014 a hearing on the matter was held before the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. A second hearing was held on February 3, 2015. In April 2015 the Office of Management and Budget ordered all departments and agencies not to use \\"management fees\\" to pay for illegal expenditures. On September 18, 2015, a third hearing was held. The Committee ultimately substantiated McGill's allegations towards NEON, Inc. and on December 11, 2015, NEON, Inc. was fired from the project. This represents one of the largest Federal agreement terminations for cause in history. The NSF chose Battelle in March 2016 to complete the construction of the Observatory in place of NEON, Inc. The program was fully operational in 2019. Layout NEON has categorized five types of measurement systems: the Airborne Observation Platform (AOP), Aquatic Instrument System (AIS), Aquatic Observation System (AOS), Terrestrial Instrument System (TIS), and Terrestrial Observation System (TOS). Airborne observations NEON takes airborne photography and performs aerial LiDAR observations of the sites being studied. This is accomplished by slow flying aircraft surveying at 1,000 meters above the ground. Aquatic sites Aquatic site sampling depends on the type of environment, varying between streams, rivers, and lakes. Automated sensors assess water quality and depth and manual observations study organisms, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and morphology. Terrestrial sites Each terrestrial site studied by NEON includes 30 randomly distributed plots. At select plots, technicians monitor soil biogeochemistry and microbes; plant diversity, biogeochemistry, biomass, productivity, and leaf area index; beetle diversity; mosquito prevalence, diversity, phenology, and infectious disease; small mammal diversity, demography, and disease; avian diversity; and tick‚Äêborne diseases. Each terrestrial site is outfitted with soil sensor arrays and a tower mounted with sensory equipment. Towers are built to extend above the vegetation canopy and take measurements such as on air quality, carbon dioxide flux, temperature, and atmospheric pressure. Additional sampling plots are located within the airshed of the tower.

He co-authored Bang! ‚Äì The Complete History of the Universe with Moore and Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May.Chris Lintott Podcasts A collection of Lintotts' podcasts from the University of Oxford. Education Lintott attended Torquay Boys' Grammar School in Devon. In 1999, while still at school, he won a $500 Earth and Space Sciences award and the Priscilla and Bart Bok Honorable Mention Award at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair for an article on 'Cosmic dust around young stellar objects'. This came from a six-week project at the University of Hertfordshire funded by a Nuffield bursary. He read Natural Sciences at Magdalene College, Cambridge and in 2006 received a PhD in astrophysics from University College London, for his thesis on the early stages of star formation supervised by Ofer Lahav. Research and career Jodcast Live in 2016 Lintott is co-director of the Programme on Computational Cosmology and Citizen Science Project Lead in the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and a Research Fellow of New College, Oxford. He was the Director of Citizen Science Initiatives at the Adler Planetarium from 2010 until 2012. His research focuses on galaxy evolution and the application of astrochemical models of star formation to galaxies beyond the Milky Way; particularly the use of sulphur compounds as a signature of stars that are in the process of formation.Chris Lintott publications in Google Scholar After a recommendation from Ed Vaizey, former Culture Minister, Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Lintott as Astronomy Trustee of the National Maritime Museum (NMM). His appointment ran from 24 June 2010 until 23 June 2014. Lintott's research has been published in a wide variety of peer-reviewed scientific journals. He was formerly a Fulford junior research fellow at Somerville College, Oxford between 2006 and 2010. Lintott's research has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).UK Government research grants awarded to Chris Lintott, via Research Councils UK, gtr.rcuk.ac.uk; accessed 15 March 2015. The Sky at Night Lintott first appeared on the BBC astronomy programme The Sky at Night, presented by Patrick Moore, as a guest in 2000. As Moore's mobility deteriorated, Lintott acquired an increasingly prominent role, often providing on-location reporting from events covered by the programme. In an interview in 2007 with Mark Lawson, Moore described him as \\"eminently suitable\\" as a presenter. He jointly presented the programme with Moore until the latter's death in December 2012. Since the February 2013 episode, Chris Lintott has been a co-presenter with Lucie Green (until December 2013) and with Maggie Aderin-Pocock (since February 2014). In July 2004, Moore suffered a near-fatal bout of food poisoning and Lintott stood in as the sole presenter of that month's episode. It was the only episode which Moore did not present since the show was first broadcast on 24 April 1957 until his death. Galaxy Zoo & The Zooniverse Chris Lintott is the co- founder, along with Kevin Schawinski, of Galaxy Zoo, an online crowdsourcing project where members of the public can volunteer their time to assist in classifying over a million galaxies.(e.g.) Lintott stated when commenting on GZ: \\"One advantage is that you get to see parts of space that have never been seen before. These images were taken by a robotic telescope and processed automatically, so the odds are that when you log on, that first galaxy you see will be one that no human has seen before.\\" This was confirmed by Schawinski: \\"Most of these galaxies have been photographed by a robotic telescope, and then processed by computer. So this is the first time they will have been seen by human eyes.\\" Lintott is the principal investigator (P.I.) for the citizen science web portal Zooniverse. Quoting from the Zooniverse Team page: \\"Astronomer and founder of both Galaxy Zoo and the Zooniverse that grew from it, Chris is interested in how galaxies form and evolve, how citizen science can change the world\\". Lintott is also the chair of the Citizen Science Alliance, the organisation that produces, maintains and develops The Zooniverse. Books Lintott after a lecture for the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario in April 2010 In October 2006, Chris Lintott, Patrick Moore and Brian May co-authored a book entitled Bang! ‚Äì The Complete History of the Universe, which was produced by Canopus Books and published by Carlton Books on 23 October 2006. It has been translated into 13 languages and has appeared in paperback. As suggested by the title, the illustrated book is a history of the Universe from the Big Bang to its eventual predicted end. It is aimed at a popular science audience and claims to make its subject matter easily comprehensible to readers without any knowledge of astronomy. In October 2012, Brian May, Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott co-authored a book entitled The Cosmic Tourist: The 100 Most Awe- inspiring Destinations in the Universe. On the book's PR page, it is stated: \\"Take your seats for the greatest tour ever ‚Äì one that encompasses no less than the whole of the Universe.\\" Chris Lintott's book, The Crowd and the Cosmos: Adventures in the Zooniverse was released in 2019. Awards and honours Lintott is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 2011, Lintott was awarded the Royal Society Kohn Award. He was awarded this (quoting from the Royal Society webpage): \\"For his excellent engagement with society in matters of science and its societal dimension.\\" In 2013, Lintott was awarded the Oxford Internet Institute Internet and Society Award. He was given this (quoting from the OII website): \\"in recognition of Galaxy Zoo's outstanding contributions to research by using crowd-sourced citizen science to capitalise on the availability of online big data-sets.\\" In 2014, he received the Beatrice M. Tinsley Prize from the American Astronomical Society. He was awarded this (quoting from the AAS website): \\"For his insight and creativity that created a transformative approach to science by engaging nonscientists in cutting edge research.\\" In 2015, he won the Institute of Physics Kelvin Medal and Prize. In 2020 he was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society.

It runs from NY 169 in the city of Little Falls to NY 29 in the town of Fairfield. It has only one other junction with a signed state highway, that being NY 170A, its spur route in the town of Fairfield. NY 170 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and has not been altered since. Route description NY 170 southbound approaching NY 169 in Little Falls NY 170 begins at an intersection with NY 169 (West Monroe and North Ann streets) in the city of Little Falls. The route proceeds eastward through the north end of Little Falls along the two-lane East Monroe Street, traversing several blocks of homes until the intersection with Moreland Street. At Moreland Street, NY 170 winds northward on a gradual bend up a hill west of Moreland Park. The route then gradually curves northwest, passing Holy Trinity Cemetery and an intersection with the western terminus of Burrell Road (unsigned County Route 9 or CR 9). NY 170 passes a large complex in Little Falls before turning north past the Little Falls Municipal Golf Course. Continuing north through Little Falls, the route intersects with Sabin Road and Dise Road (CR 159) at a four- way junction. Still in the town of Little Falls, NY 170 crosses under power lines, crossing an intersection with Top Notch Road (CR 126) and Yellow Church Road (CR 92). At this intersection, the route crosses into the town of Fairfield, where two-lane rural roadway continues north, winding past several farms in Fairfield. The route soon intersects with the terminus of NY 170A, a short spur route of NY 170\\\\. At NY 170A, NY 170 bends northwest, crossing past several farms and an intersection with Castle Road (CR 7). The surroundings of NY 170 remain unchanged as the road continues northwest to an intersection with NY 29 in Fairfield that serves as NY 170's north end. History The origins of NY 170 date back to the mid-1910s when the portion of the route outside of Little Falls was first brought up to state highway standards. A contract to rebuild the road was awarded on July 29, 1914, and the improved highway was added to the state highway system on August 27, 1918, as unsigned State Highway 468 (SH 468). In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned a posted route number for the first time. SH 468 became part of NY 170, which continued southwest to NY 169 in Little Falls by way of locally maintained streets. An alternate route of NY 170 through the town of Fairfield was designated as NY 170A by the following year. Most of what became NY 170A was added to the state highway system in the 1920s; however, the northernmost were added on October 11, 1912, as part of a larger project that rebuilt a section of modern NY 29. Major intersections NY 170A NY 170A is a spur connecting NY 170 to the hamlet of Salisbury in Fairfield, where it ends at NY 29. NY 170A was designated by 1931.

Advantages of such splitting are primarily for boosting performance and improving security. Advantages * Reduced congestion: Improved performance is achieved, because on a segmented network there are fewer hosts per subnetwork, thus minimizing local traffic * Improved security: ** Broadcasts will be contained to local network. Internal network structure will not be visible from outside. ** There is a reduced attack surface available to pivot in if one of the hosts on the network segment is compromised. Common attack vectors such as LLMNR and NetBIOS poisoning can be partially alleviated by proper network segmentation as they only work on the local network. For this reason it is recommended to segment the various areas of a network by usage. A basic example would be to split up web servers, databases servers and standard user machines each into their own segment. ** By creating network segments containing only the resources specific to the consumers that you authorise access to, you are creating an environment of least privilege * Containing network problems: Limiting the effect of local failures on other parts of network * Controlling visitor access: Visitor access to the network can be controlled by implementing VLANs to segregate the network Improved security When a cyber-criminal gains unauthorized access to a network, segmentation or ‚Äúzoning‚Äù can provide effective controls to limit further movement across the network. PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), and similar standards, provide guidance on creating clear separation of data within the network, for example separating the network for Payment Card authorizations from those for Point-of-Service (till) or customer wi-fi traffic. A sound security policy entails segmenting the network into multiple zones, with varying security requirements, and rigorously enforcing the policy on what is allowed to move from zone to zone. Controlling visitor access Finance and Human Resources typically need access via their own VLAN to their application servers because of the confidential nature of the information they process and store. Other groups of personnel may require their own segregated networks, such as server administrators, security administration, managers and executives. Third parties are usually required to have their own segments, with different administration passwords to the main network, to avoid attacks via a compromised, less well protected, third party site. Means of segregation Segregation is typically achieved by a combination of firewalls and VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks). Software- Defined Networking (SDN) can allow the creation and management of micro- segmented networks.

Life Henry's father, Duke William IV of Brunswick-L√ºneburg retired in 1491, leaving government of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel with Caleneberg to his two sons Henry the Elder and Eric, and only kept the Principality of G√∂ttingen for himself. In 1494, the brothers divided their territories between them: Henry received the eastern part of the state, with the cities of Brunswick and Wolfenb√ºttel, while Eric took over the Calenberg estates. Starting in 1492, Henry laid siege to the City of Brunswick for a year and a half to enforce tax payments; the siege ended with a compromise. On 24 November 1498 Henry IV, Magnus and the latter's father John V, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg allied in order to conquer the Land of Wursten, a de facto autonomous region of free Frisian peasants in a marsh at the Weser estuary, under the loose overlordship of the Prince- Archbishopric of Bremen.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 266. .

II: pp. 321‚Äì388, here p. 332. . On 16 November, Prince-Archbishop Johann Rode of Bremen had prepared for this by concluding a defensive alliance with Hamburg, fearing for its military outpost Ritzeb√ºttel at the Outer Elbe protecting free navigation from and to the city. Rode gained more allies on 1 August 1499 (Bremen city, Buxtehude, Ditmarsh, and Stade), providing 1,300 warriors and equipment to defend Wursten and / or invade Hadeln, and waged a pre-emptive feud on John V and his allies on 9 September 1499.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol.

By 20 November 1499 Magnus hired the so-called Great or Black Guard of ruthless and violent Dutch and East Frisian mercenaries, commanded by Thomas Slentz, recapturing Hadeln in early 1500.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 267. . By early December 1499 Rode had addressed Duke Henry IV for help, who was actually allied with Magnus.Karl Schleif, Regierung und Verwaltung des Erzstifts Bremen, see references for bibliographical details, p. 20. In return Rode offered to appoint Henry's 12-year-old son Christopher as his coadjutor, a position usually (as coadiutor cum iure succedendi), and in this case indeed, entailing the succession to the respective see. This exactly accomplished Henry's own expansionist ambitions, so he converted to Rode's column.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 268. . Henry IV and his troops were then hunting the Black Guard. Mediated by Eric I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, Prince of Calenberg and Henry IV, Rode and Magnus concluded peace on 20 January 1500. Hadeln was restored to Magnus, thus no substantial change as compared with the status quo ante.Michael Sch√ºtz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 263‚Äì278, here p. 269. . On 1 February Rode and Bremen's cathedral chapter officially appointed Christopher as coadjutor. Rode and chapter had agreed to pay for Christopher's necessary papal dispensation from the canon-law age limit, as he was too young to be coadjutor, while Henry IV guaranteed military support for the prince- archbishopric. In 1501, Henry attacked Frisian Butjadingen, in order to subject it to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, but he had to abort the campaign. On 7 May 1501 Pope Alexander VI dispensed Christopher from being underage, which cost the Bremian see 1,500 Rhenish guilders. Alexander VI confirmed Christopher as coadjutor under the proviso that he should only ascend to office having come of age (27 years), which was in 1514. However, Christopher de facto assumed the rule in 1511, after Rode's death. In 1509 Magnus and Henry's daughter Catherine married, which sealed the reconciliation of Henry and Magnus. In 1511, Henry, together with the other members of the House of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, conquered the County of Hoya, which had refused to recognize Brunswick-L√ºneburg as its liege lord. A second attack on East Frisia in 1514‚Äîin the course of the Saxon Feud‚Äîled to Henry's death; his head was shot off during the siege of Leerort Castle (today part of Leer). Family Henry married Catherine of Pomerania, daughter of Eric II, Duke of Pomerania, in 1486. They had the following children: * Christoper of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, Archbishop of Bremen (c. 1487‚Äì1558) * Catherine of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (c. 1488 ‚Äì 29 June 1563), married Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg in November 1509. * Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (1489‚Äì1568), succeeded as Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. * Francis of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel, Bishop of Minden (c.1492 ‚Äì 1529) * George of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel, Archbishop of Bremen (1494‚Äì1566) * Eric of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel (c. 1500‚Äì1553), joined the Teutonic Order. * William of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (died c. 1557), joined the Teutonic Order. * Elizabeth of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, Abbess of Steterburg * John of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel, died as a child.

The conflict occurred from January 18 to January 20, 1955 during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, and resulted in a PLA victory and the complete destruction of the ROC garrison. Prelude Geography The Yijiangshan Islands consist of two islands, the Northern Yijang () Island and the Southern Yijiang () Island, and the region is approximately 1.2 square kilometers (0.46 square miles) in area. Due to its strategic location near the coast of Zhejiang, it had become a forward base for the Nationalist defense of Chinese coastal islands centered on Dachen Island, as well as a base for launching guerrilla attacks on mainland China. Opposing forces The Nationalist defense force consisted of the following units and totaled more than 1000: Yijiangshan Regional Headquarters *The 2nd Assault Group *The 4th Assault Group *The 4th Assault Squadron *One artillery squadron In addition, the Nationalist defenders could call up the air and naval support when needed. The Communist attackers totaled more than 5,000, with the landing force totaling one regiment and one battalion from the following units: *The 178th regiment of the 60th Division of the 20th Army *The 180th regiment of the 60th Division of the 20th Army *137 naval vessels, (including more than 70 landing vessels, and more than 40 escort vessels). *184 aircraft from a total of 22 groups, 7 artillery battalions, and 2 anti-aircraft artillery regiments assigned to support the landing force. In addition, over 30,000 civilians and three dozen civilian ships were mobilized for logistic support. Battle When the fight began on January 18, 1955, the Nationalist air force and navy did not participate due to overwhelming Communist firepower. The battle started at 08:00 with People's Liberation Army (PLA) bombers from three groups and ground attack aircraft from 2 groups bombing and strafing the islands. At the same time, bombers from another group and ground attack aircraft from the second group began bombing and strafing the Dachen Islands as a diversion. At 09:00, 50 long range artillery pieces shelled the Yijiangshan Islands. Around noon, 70+ naval vessels carrying the landing force sailed from Gaodao (), Queerao (), Toumenshan Island () in three formations in two waves, with more than 40 escort vessels. 2 hours later, the 10 specially converted naval vessels with rocket launchers bombarded Yijiangshan island in conjunction with bombers from 3 groups and 1 squadron, ground attack aircraft from 2 groups, before landing on 20 landing spots. However, the defenders took advantage of their fortifications and severely disrupted the attackers‚Äô formation after their successful landing. As a result, most of the Communist casualties suffered during the battle were at this initial stage. The Communists immediately called for fire support after they met with fierce enemy fire, and PLA aircraft responded by attacking enemy positions at extremely low altitude. With the first line of defence was quickly overpowered by flamethrowers, bombs, and artillery, the PLA gained ground rapidly. Most of the PLA casualties (as many as 200 dead and 400 wounded) resulted from attacks on two machine gun nests. Air strikes and massive artillery bombardments eventually knocked out these two positions. As the demoralized defenders retreated into their tunnels, the attackers changed their tactics by fighting in small groups, and using recoilless rifles and flamethrowers to gradually torch the NRA soldiers to death, including the tunnel complex of the Nationalist 4th Assault Group‚Äîthe largest on the island. By 17:30, the battle on the islands subsided with the PLA having taken 95 hills over 132 meters, and the decimation of the NRA defenders was almost complete with 567 killed (mostly burned by the flamethrowers) and 519 captured alive according to the often exaggerated PRC source; or 712 soldiers and 12 nurses died in the line of duty according to the Taiwan source. The Communist forces were then ordered to assume a defensive posture for the next day, to prepare for a possible Nationalist counterattack that never materialized. Wang Shen-Ming (), the NRA commander was on the phone mentioned he was 50 yards (45 meters) from the approaching Communists. He committed suicide with a hand grenade, ended all the communication and resistance at his 121 hill cave headquarter. Also on the January 19, the Communist force begun their shelling on Dachen Archipelago about 13,2 kilometers (8.12 miles) away, but these actions were still originally intended to prevent possible counterattacks. Finally, on January 20, 1955, the islands were formally declared to be firmly in Communist hands. Aftermath The scale of the battle was minute, and the most important gain of the PLA was demoralizing the NRA will power to continue holding on to some of the islets difficult to defend. The Nationalists became aware that the logistics to send support from Taiwan Island was difficult with its antiquated air force and a lack of strong Navy. The Nationalist lost a destroyer, named Taiping. The Korean War by then was over. The PLA had ample military resources including MiG jets, and warships focused on wiping out anti-Communist resistance. This was the prelude to the eventual abandonment of Dachen island with the United States urging Taiwan not to spread too thin. According to Taiwan sources, the troops garrison consists of mostly former fishermen/pirates and civil war refugees. Some of the casualties were female interns from a Political Warfare College. There are a number of shrines, roads, and even a restaurant today to commemorate the Nationalist resistance on Taiwan. The 18,000 refugees, soldiers and their decedents consider themselves to be fortunate to have relocated to Taiwan. At any rate, over 500 bombs and 50,000 shells were fired over two little rocky islets. PLA launched an amphibious assault with 182 aircraft, bombers, long distance artilleries. Over 5,000 troops were landed with the mobilization of 30,000 civilians. It was considered an example of PRC's modern warfare. The government of the Republic of China reported that all 720 NRA troops died, while killing more than 3,000 enemy soldiers. This assertion was proven false in 2011, when a prisoner of war from the battle, Chen Hsiao-pin, visited Taiwan. The People's Republic of China reported that the PLA killed 519 and captured 567 NRA troops. The PLA lost 393 troops.

The Wuhan incident () was an armed conflict in the People's Republic of China between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city of Wuhan in July 1967, at the height of the Cultural Revolution. The two opposing forces were the \\"Million Heroes\\" () and the \\"Wuhan Workers' General Headquarters\\" (). The former, numbering about 500,000 people, comprised mainly skilled workers, state and local party employees, and were supported by the local PLA, led by the commander of Wuhan Military Region, General Chen Zaidao. The \\"Wuhan Workers' General Headquarters\\", also numbering close to 500,000 people, comprised mostly workers and students from Red Guard organizations.Meisner, op. 354 Both sides engaged in an extensive propaganda war in an attempt to enlist community support. Central authorities in Beijing eventually endorsed the Worker's Headquarters faction as the \\"true\\" revolutionary group and reprimanded Chen Zaidao for his military support to Million Heroes. The event was considered a pivotal turning point in the Cultural Revolution: it marked the first time military leaders refused to carry out orders given by the central authorities and the Cultural Revolution Group in particular. Fears of a more widespread PLA revolt led Mao and his core associates to scale back the movement's most radical components. Background All over China during the Cultural Revolution, provincial and municipal governments were replaced by organizations known as Revolutionary Committees (alliances of cadres, soldiers and student/worker groups) to take charge of governing the country and cleansing it from \\"counterrevolutionary forces\\" and \\"reactionary elements\\". With orders from the top leadership to \\"find and capture those in power walking the capitalist road,\\" almost all incumbent party and government officials became vulnerable to attacks from Red Guard organizations - not owing to their ideological disposition but solely as a result of their incumbency. However, \\"capitalist roader\\" was a nebulous label that could be liberally applied to anyone perceived to be counter to the revolutionary spirit. Various mass organizations around the country took advantage of this chaotic backdrop and seized the opportunity to overthrow incumbent power figures with whom they may have carried other, unrelated grievances. In the central industrial city of Wuhan, two groups largely coalesced around those who wanted to preserve the incumbent political order in the city and those who wanted to overthrow it. The Workers' Headquarters arose out of a union of local Red Guard youth and various \\"revolutionary\\" workers organizations from Wuhan's numerous steel plants. On January 27, 1967, they attempted to lay siege to the Wuhan party organization and the municipal government and seize power in the city themselves, much in the fashion of the Shanghai People's Commune. However, incumbent interests rallied ordinary residents against the action and the takeover ultimately failed. It was thereafter branded it a \\"counterrevolutionary incident\\". In March 1967, local PLA units under the command of General Chen Zaidao forcefully disbanded the Worker's Headquarters faction and detained some 500 of its leaders. At the same time, it had been funding its own \\"revolutionary mass organization\\", dubbed \\"The Million Heroes,\\" drawn from a wider cross-section of conservative interests in the city. The Million Heroes, whose slogans were also broadly \\"revolutionary\\" in tone, were mainly intent on maintaining the status quo. Their position was that, in essence, the existing Wuhan political establishment was loyally adhering to the Cultural Revolution's main programme and therefore should not have been a target for struggle. Central authorities in Beijing did not issue any public statements on the March 1967 actions taken by the PLA against the Workers' Headquarters faction; privately the Cultural Revolution Group (CRG) griped about the direction of the movement in Wuhan, but stopped short of issuing a rebuke to Wuhan's PLA leaders. Instead, they attempted to pull Chen Zaidao aside from a top-level military conference in Beijing in April and prod him into admitting that some of the March actions had gone too far and acknowledge that the local PLA may have made \\"mistakes\\" in their handling of the situation. Chen, however, refused to stand down, and insisted on the general correctness of the PLA's actions. The \\"incident\\" Tensions grew in Wuhan through April as the Worker's Headquarters faction carried out hunger strikes and conducted rallies, claiming to be the \\"true bearer\\" of the revolutionary cause; meanwhile, the Million Heroes accused the Worker's Headquarters of subverting the revolution by not properly adhering to the campaign to criticize Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Amid the growing hostilities, the CRG felt a greater urgency to respond and extend its 'divine interpretation' of the events on the ground. Under the auspice of Zhou Enlai and with approval from Mao, the authorities in Beijing issued an order to General Chen to withdraw support to the Million Heroes. The directive asserted that the Wuhan military had made a mistake in \\"general orientation\\" in carrying out Cultural Revolution policies - that it must publicly admit that its March actions against Workers' Headquarters were incorrect. The directive also labelled the Million Heroes as a \\"conservative organization\\" and branded the Workers' Headquarters as a \\"revolutionary organization\\"; this was, in effect, the CRG throwing its weight behind the latter.Meisner, p. 354 Minister of Public Security Xie Fuzhi and leading propagandist Wang Li arrived on July 16 and immediately ordered General Chen to withdraw support from the Million Heroes and instead extend it to the Workers' Headquarters.Meisner, p. 354 The order, relayed through Xie to a gathering of the PLA leadership in Wuhan on July 19, could not be implemented; several of Chen Zaidao's units refused to carry out the order. Moreover, a significant sub-section of the city lent support to the Million Heroes, making their position a formidable one. Generally, Million Heroes supporters saw that their being labelled a \\"conservative\\" organization would have totally tarnished their leftist credentials and lent rival groups ammunition to attack them - giving them impetus to protest the order en masse. The local PLA organization, too, felt that if they were to accede to the order, it would be an implicit admission that they had committed a grave error in the course of the Cultural Revolution - something that could be used to attack them in the future. In a last attempt to resolve the crisis, Zhou Enlai himself flew to Wuhan on July 20; for his own safety, Zhou landed at a nearby airstrip controlled by the PLA Air Force, a branch of the military loyal to Lin Biao (and therefore, the Cultural Revolution).Meisner, p. 354 Mao himself also made abode at the Wuhan East Lake Guest House. Chen seemed to be swayed by Mao's own presence in Wuhan and acquiesced to writing a self-criticism. Wang Li then gathered some 200 divisional officers at a impromptu conference and reprimanded them for failure to grasp the essence of the Cultural Revolution. The Wang Li speech drew particular ire with the military brass due to its condescending tone. Mao and Zhou's presence in Wuhan having been kept a secret, for all intents and purposes, the Million Heroes regarded Xie and Wang to be the main representatives of the central authorities. On July 20, forces belonging to Chen's mutinous PLA division, disturbed with the verdict assigned to the military district and the Million Heroes, captured and physically assaulted Xie Fuzhi, while simultaneously agitators from the Million Heroes captured Wang Li. Wang Li and Xie Fuzhi were rescued by military operatives as part of a secret operation and returned to Beijing on 25 July, to a hero's welcome, supposedly having saved the city from \\"counter-revolutionary\\" rebellion. It is estimated that about one thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more injured, in Wuhan during the July 1967 troubles in the city. Aftermath On July 26, Chen Zaidao and his political commissar Zhong Hanhua were dragged to Beijing's PLA-controlled Jingxi Hotel to take part in what essentially amounted to a \\"show trial\\" where central authorities in Beijing accused the Wuhan military establishment of supporting the wrong group in the preceding struggles in the city. Air Force Commander Wu Faxian, a Lin Biao loyalist, and security chief Xie Fuzhi accused Chen of a litany of crimes in front a large contingent of senior military and political leaders, many of whom, incredulous at the abuse being hurled on Chen, left in disgust during the meeting. Chen was also beaten by security personnel during the session. Chen and Zhong were then summarily dismissed and replaced with figures more loyal to the Cultural Revolution-friendly central leadership. The Wuhan event was branded as a \\"counter-revolutionary incident\\". Following the incident, Jiang Qing, in a speech to Red Guard organizations in Henan province, introduced the idea of \\"use words to attack but use arms to defend\\" (i.e. wen- gong wu-wei). The incendiary remarks were taken by rebel organizations around the country as an endorsement of armed struggle, and led to the escalation of violent factional clashes across the country. The ensuing violence, some of which were directed squarely at various local PLA units, led Mao and his radical supporters to dial back their support for armed rebellion, likely due to their fears of a more widespread PLA reprisal. In order to appease the PLA and calm nerves among senior military leaders, Wang Li was arrested in August 1967, then scapegoated as the main instigator of the factional violence in Wuhan and sent to prison. The Wuhan incident was the most serious uprising against the Cultural Revolution political order until the 1976 Tiananmen Incident. It is generally characterized by historians as an uprising of the Wuhan military establishment and a broad section of Wuhan society against the Cultural Revolution leadership. Indeed, Mao himself had been warned about the possibility of a 'coup' by Chen Zaidao in response to the verdict on the Wuhan Military Region, though in reality such a coup never materialized.

It is a cognate of James. Jacob is derived from Late Latin Iacobus, from Greek Iakobos, from Hebrew (Ya øqob, Ya øqov, Ya øƒÉq≈ç·∏á), the name of the Hebrew patriarch, Jacob son of Isaac and Rebecca. The name comes either from the Hebrew root  øqb meaning \\"to follow, to be behind\\" but also \\"to supplant, circumvent, assail, overreach\\", or from the word for \\"heel\\",  øaqeb. In the narrative of Genesis, it refers to the circumstances of Jacob's birth when he held on to the heel of his older twin brother Esau (Genesis 25:26). The name is etymologized (in a direct speech by the character Esau) in Genesis 27:36, adding the significance of Jacob having \\"supplanted\\" his elder brother by buying his birthright.\\"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me () these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing\\" (KJV) In a Christian context, Jacob ‚Äì James as reduced English form ‚Äì is the name for several people in the New Testament: (1) apostle James, son of Zebedee, (2) another apostle James, son of Alphaeus, and (3) James the brother of Jesus (James the Just), who led the original Nazarene Community in Jerusalem.

Map of Canada showing provincial and territorial boundaries set out April 1, 1999 History of Saskatchewan encompasses the study of past human events and activities of the province of Saskatchewan, the middle of Canada's three prairie provinces. Archaeological studies give some clues as to the history and lifestyles of the Palaeo-Indian, Taltheilei, and Shield Archaic Traditions who were the first occupants of the prehistoric era of this geographical area. They evolved into the history of the first nations people who kept their history alive in oral tradition. The First Nation bands that were a part of this area were the Chipewyan, Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, Atsina and Sioux.Sask Gen Web SGW First Nations Saskatchewan Genealogy Roots, URL accessed 26 November 2006 Henry Kelsey (1667‚Äì1724), was the first European (an Englishman) to visit this area, and arrived 1690.Saskatchewan Gen Web Project ‚Äì SGW ‚Äì Canadian Migrations Saskatchewan Genealogy Roots URL accessed April 12, 2007 Other European explorers also soon arrived followed by fur traders such as The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay (Hudson's Bay Company) and North West Company. Clifford Sifton, Minister of the Interior in charge of immigration, (1896‚Äì1905) induced a variety of agriculturally inclined European emigrants to Canada to settle prairie land around the transcontinental railway. The political boundaries of this area have changed several times evolving through Rupert's Land, Provisional Districts of the North West Territories, and finally a province. Saskatchewan has been a province of Canada since 1905. Natural history The history of this plains area actually began 2,000‚Äì2,100 million years ago wherein there were two continents separated by an ocean. The \\"Churchill Continent\\" which would be Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and the \\"Superior Continent\\" which would comprise Manitoba and Ontario. 1,830 ‚Äì 1,800 million years ago these two land masses collided. The Northern shield area and western Rockies formed higher land from the collision.TIME TUNNEL Royal Saskatchewan Museum, URL accessed 26 November 2006 The lower lands of today's parkland were covered by a shallow sea even in the Palaeozoic Era. It was not until the Cretaceous Period 144 ‚Äì 66 million years ago that the inland sea began to drain. Here we begin to find the paleontological artifacts of various dinosaur species. The ice age of the Quaternary Period totally again re-shaped and re-shifted the landscape of Saskatchewan, occurring 2 million years ago. Following these geological changes to this area, and the formation of the continent of North America as we know it, pre-history to the history of contemporary day can begin.

Archaeologists divide the time frame to study ancient findings into contemporary which would be from the 20th century on, Protohistoric archaeology from 1620 to contemporary, and Prehistoric archaeology is the study before early exploration to the area. The prehistoric archaeology studies the findings and further classifies them according to traditions followed by the ancient peoples.

Their early archaeological history is documented around 1615. Samuel Hearne was one of the first early explorers to make contact with the Dene. Algonkian or Woodland Cree (Kristinaux) lived above the treeline, whereas plains Cree lived in the open parkland area. Prairie buffalo hunters pre-dominated in southern Saskatchewan and were mainly of the first nation Siouan or Assiniboine (Nakota). Atsina or Dakota (Sioux) were living on the outskirts of the area now known as Saskatchewan.

In May 1670, King Charles II of England declared sovereignty over the lands which drained into the Hudson Bay watershed and granted those lands to \\"the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay\\", which later became the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). The lands became known as Rupert's Land after the founder of the company. In 1774, Cumberland House, the company's first trading post, was erected. Travelling inland were the French Canadian voyageurs of the North West Company arriving from Eastern Canada, and from 1740 to about 1820 the Cree peoples were migrating westward as well, coming into contact with the Haaninin and Siksika nations already inhabiting the Saskatchewan river basins as they continued their role as intermediaries in the fur trade. Canadian, European, and American fur traders set up forts and trading posts and continued commerce with the indigenous people, however conflicts between the local Haaninin and the incoming Cree and Assiniboine were exacerbated because of the preference Europeans showed toward trading with the latter indigenous groups over the locals, culminating in attacks in 1794 against both North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company forts. Local indigenous peoples including the M√©tis, Haaninin and Siksika were accustomed to the buffalo hunt, however, some M√©tis had arrived from the Red River valley in the 1840s-60 precisely because the hunt was declining in that region, a sign of things to come further west. When Manitoba was established in 1870, many M√©tis were disappointed with what they felt was a disenfranchisement of their laws and way of life in the new province and migrated into the Saskatchewan river basin, establishing a settlement there and electing Gabriel Dumont as the first president of the council of St Laurent in 1872, charged with governing the annual buffalo hunts and other local laws. In 1875 local M√©tis hunters led by an HBC employee broke the hunting laws established by this council to protect the buffalo by hunting ahead of the main caravan. A fine was imposed by the local council on the hunters, who appealed to the local magistrate, Lawrence Clarke. Clarke was, in fact, an officer of the HBC, so in siding with the hunters, he appealed for assistance from the North-West Mounted Police, who sent fifty officers to intimidate and undermine the authority of the local councils in favour of the HBC. Soon after, the seat of the government of the North-West Territories was transferred to Battleford and a North-West Mounted Police fort was established at Duck Lake. In 1876 a treaty was concluded between the Government of Canada and the local Cree peoples (Treaty 6), and though restrictions on the buffalo hunt and land ownership were tabled by some, they ultimately failed to materialize in the written version of the treaty. The North-West Resistance In 1877, at the first council meeting in the new seat of government in Battleford, many of the laws of the previous council of St Laurent were adopted to protect the buffalo,LAC, MG26, A, vol. 104, \\"Petition des Metis de la rivier Qu'Appelle, 1874\\" pp. 41996-41999. however these hunting restrictions did not apply to non-Metis indigenous people as per the arrangement of Treaty 6, nor were they an effective means to reduce hunting by and for American markets. According to Gabriel Dumont, the leader of the South Saskatchewan River caravan, bison had become extinct in the region by 1878.SABS, Department of Agriculture (Saskatchewan), Lands Branch Files, Ag II, southwest quarter of section 20 (river-front lots 21 and 22), township 42-1-3, Dumont's Declaration. In the late 1870s and early 1880s, several appeals were made by Metis people to be better represented in government. The treaties established with aboriginal groups in the area gave a sense of voice at that time, and territorial government was dominated by the euro-Canadian minority, referring to themselves as 'white' in contrast to the Metis majority in many regions. In April 1883, a local council voted against a proposition to send a delegation to Ottawa to demand their rights, and instead supported an effort to bring Louis Riel back to Canada. Before the arrival of Louis Riel, a petition was sent from Bishop Gardin to Prime Minister Macdonald that presented all of the grievances and demands of the Metis in the South Saskatchewan river basin including the establishment of the province of Saskatchewan, proper surveying of the traditional river lots of the Metis, and the appointment of Riel as a member of the Territorial Council or Canadian Senate. Louis Riel arrived in Saskatchewan in July 1884. A feast day was established on September 24 (later moved to July 24) along with the establishment of a patron saint of the Metis and Riel met with many councils and individuals before declaring the establishment of the provisional government of Saskatchewan on March 19, 1885. On March 26 Gabriel Dumont, adjunct-general of this provisional government captured Duck Lake with a small army, forcing back the NWMP, thus began the North-West Resistance. Political boundaries Rupert's Land became the first western area under English control in 1670 when King Charles II of England granted the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to The Governor and Company of Adventurers Trading into Hudson's Bay (i.e., the Hudson's Bay Company). This area of land became known as \\"Rupert's Land\\" after King Charles' cousin, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, who was the first governor of the company. The North West Territories was divided into districts in 1870. The Provisional Districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Athabasca, and Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories created in 1882. They were named provisional districts to distinguish them from the District of Keewatin which had a more autonomous relationship from the NWT administration. Due to the vastness of the Northwest Territories, it was divided into more administrative districts. 1895 saw the formation of the District of Franklin, District of Ungava and the District of Mackenzie which were all part of the NWT. By this date, the Provisional District of Athabasca had extended as far west as the first meridian. Immigration and settlement era :For more information on the earliest inhabitants and explorers of Saskatchewan see History of Immigration ‚Äì Western Canada, :Category:Ethnic groups in Canada. The settlements patterns were closely tied to the availability of transportation (especially railways) and the fertility of the soil. Ethnic groups tended to settle together, so they could built support networks for religion, language, customs, and finding marriage partners.W. A. Mackintosh, Prairie Settlement, the Geographical Setting (Toronto, 1934). p 81 Early sod house Travel routes When the surveyors for the railways came through, they at first proposed a route following the early telegraph line. However, a number of historic factors changed this route. Travel from Winnipeg through to Calgary was easier through the southern prairies rather than going upwards to Battleford and Edmonton. The southern route of the railway, went through the village of Pile O' Bones in 1882. By 1903, the influx of settlers via the railway increased the population to city status, and Pile O' Bones was now known as Regina. In 1905, when Saskatchewan became a province, Regina was named the capital city. Immigration was advertised in a massive campaign put forth by Clifford Sifton, Minister of the Interior in charge of immigration, (1896‚Äì1905)Impressions 250 Years of Printing in the Lives of Canadians , URL accessed 26 November 2006 who brought into being Canada's homestead act, the Dominion Lands Act in 1872. The railway brought life to settlements, which quickly grew to villages, and towns. Typically many small communities sprung up 10‚Äì12 miles apart a distance easily traveled by horse and cart in a day. Immigration policy Settlement policy, set by the federal government, the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Hudson's Bay Company and associated land companies encouraged immigration. The key event was the decision to emulate the American Homestead Law by offering, at no cost, 160 acres of farmland to any man over 18 (or to a woman head of family) who settled there.W. T. Easterbrook, Farm Credit in Canada (1938). Dramatic advertising campaigns promoted the benefits of prairie living. Potential immigrants read leaflets information painted Canada as a veritable garden of Eden, and downplayed the need for agricultural expertise. Ads in The Nor'-West Farmer by the Commissioner of Immigration implied that western land was blessed with water, wood, gold, silver, iron, copper, and cheap coal for fuel, all of which were readily at hand. Reality was far harsher, especially for the first arrivals who lived in sod houses. However eastern money poured in and by 1913, long term mortgage loans to Saskatchewan farmers had reached $65 million.Sandra Rollings-Magnusson, \\"Canada's Most Wanted: Pioneer Women on the Western Prairies.\\" Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology 2000 37(2): 223‚Äì238 Ethnicity The dominant groups comprised British settlers from eastern Canada and Britain, who comprised about 50% of the population during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They played the leading role in establishing the basic institutions of plains society, economy and government.Peter Bush, Western Challenge: The Presbyterian Church in Canada's Mission on the Prairies and North, 1885‚Äì1925. (2000); Marjory Harper, \\"Probing the Pioneer Questionnaires: British Settlement in Saskatchewan, 1887‚Äì1914.\\" Saskatchewan History 2000 52(2): 28‚Äì46. About a tenth of the people were Irish, with the more numerous Protestants integrating with English and Scottish Protestants, and the less numerous Catholics taking control of the Catholic Church in the province.Michael Cottrell, \\"The Irish in Saskatchewan, 1850‚Äì1930: a Study of Intergenerational Ethnicity.\\" Prairie Forum 1999 24(2): 185‚Äì209 Blocs and colonies By 1930 there were 19 major ethno-religious bloc settlements in Saskatchewan, chiefly in the north-central region.Alan Anderson, \\"Ethnic Bloc Settlements,\\" Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan online Seven were French, one German Catholic, two Mennonite, two Hutterite, three Ukrainian-Polish, one Russian Doukhobor, and two were Scandinavian. They differed greatly in size, from the small Hutterite colonies with a population of 75‚Äì150 each to St. Peter's Colony, which encompassed fifty-six townships (over two thousand square miles) and included about 9,500 Catholics of German descent.Howard Palmer, The Settlement of the West (U. of Calgary Press, 1977) p. 191. In the north west of the provisional district of Saskatchewan, NWT, Interior Minister Clifton Sifton set up bloc colonies for 7400 Doukhobor settlers from Russia in 1899. Peter Verigin arrived in 1902 and became the leader. After their bizarre behaviour alienated public opinion (such as nude protest marches), the government in 1907 took away much of the land they had been awarded. Verigin led most of them to British Columbia.Bill Waiser, Saskatchewan pp 72-74 The French Counts of St Hubert, Saskatchewan established Rolanderie Ranch and a gentleman lifestyle at Whitewood, Saskatchewan in 1884. The Counts sought to establish a number of commercial ventures, including a chicory processing factory, a Gruyere cheese factory, a sugar beet venture and a horse breeding operation. They occasionally socialized with the English colonial outpost of Cannington Manor. In the 1880s Edward Pierce tried to transplant early Victorian living at Cannington Manor in the 1880s, now preserved as Cannington Manor Provincial Park. The Barr Colonists ventured north in 1903 and settled in Brittania now known as Lloydminster, Saskatchewan. Germans Canadians in 2006 with German ancestry are the majority in parts of the Prairie provinces (areas coloured in yellow); Ukrainian strongholds are in green, British in pink, First Nations in brown. See a more detailed map of Saskatchewan. The German settlers came primarily from Russia, and after 1914 from German-American settlements in North and South Dakota.Heinz Lehmann and Gerhard P. Bassler, The German Canadians, 1750‚Äì1937: immigration, settlement & culture (1986) They came not as large groups but as part of a chain of family members, where the first immigrants would find suitable locations and send for the others. They formed compact German-speaking communities built around their Catholic or Lutheran churches, and continuing old-world customs. They were farmers who grew wheat.Jessica Clark and Thomas D. Isern, \\"Germans from Russia in Saskatchewan: An Oral History,\\" American Review of Canadian Studies, Spring 2010, Vol. 40 Issue 1, pp 71‚Äì85 Arrivals from Russia, Bukovina, and Romanian Dobruja established their villages in a 40-mile-wide tract east of Regina.Adam Giesinger, \\"The Germans from Russia Who Pioneered in Saskatchewan,\\" Journal of the American Historical Society of Germans from Russia, Summer 1984, Vol. 7 Issue 2, pp 1‚Äì14 The Germans operated parochial schools primarily to maintain their religious faith; often they offered only an hour of German language instruction a week, but they always had extensive coverage of religion. Most German Catholic children by 1910 attended schools taught entirely in English.Clinton O. White, \\"Pre-World War I Saskatchewan German Catholic thought concerning the perpetuation of their language and religion,\\" Canadian Ethnic Studies, 1994, Vol. 26 Issue 2, pp 15‚Äì30 In the 199x‚Äì1930 era, German Catholics generally voted for the Liberal ticket (rather than the Provincial Rights and Conservative tickets), seeing Liberals as more willing to protect religious minorities. Occasionally they voted for Conservatives or independent candidates who offered greater support for public funding of parochial schools.Clinton O. White, \\"The Politics of Elementary Schools in a German- American Roman Catholic Settlement in Canada's Province of Saskatchewan, 1903‚Äì1925,\\" Great Plains Research, September 1997, Vol. 7 Issue 2, pp 251‚Äì272 Nazi Germany made a systematic effort to proselytize among Saskatchewan's Germans in the 1930s. Fewer that 1% endorsed their message, but some did migrate back to Germany before anti-Nazi sentiment became overwhelming in 1939.Jonathan F.

Many were unemployed. The government interned about 5000 men, mostly those who were caught trying to cross the border into the U.S. (It was illegal for an enemy alien to leave the country.) They were assigned work on federal and provincial public work projects as well as for the railways.Frances Swyripa and John Herd Thompson, eds. Loyalties in Conflict: Ukrainians in Canada During the Great War (1983) p 4 Religiously the Ukrainians were split between two Catholic and two Orthodox denominations. One of the latter was the \\"Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada\\", established in 1918 with the goal of defending the interests of the people as a bulwark against discrimination and oppression of the sort that Ukrainians had just experienced.Myroslaw Tataryn, \\"Harvesting Heritage Seeds in Prairie Soil: The Role of Ukrainskyi holos in the Formation of the Identity of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada,\\" Historical Studies, 2005, Vol. 71, pp 94‚Äì109 Since World War Two, Ukrainians have largely assimilated into Canadian culture.Alan B. Anderson, \\"Ukrainian Ethnicity: Generations And Change In Rural Saskatchewan\\" in Jean Elliott,Two Nations, Many Cultures: Ethnic Groups in Canada (1979), pp 250‚Äì269 Assimilation and nativism In the 1910‚Äì1930 era, the provincial department of education led systematic efforts to place English-speaking teachers in every school to Canadianize the ethnic groups through the use of the English language and the teaching of British values. He envisioned the role of the teacher to be an educator, missionary, and model Canadian citizen.Caroline Melis, \\"J. T. M.

It built on ethnic prejudices, but had few major successes. Its peak came in 1927‚Äì30 when it shaped the vocabulary used to discuss issues of language, sectarianism, immigration, and control of natural resources. It over and over again warned of \\"Catholic plots,\\" but faded away when the Great Depression hit and the conspiracy-minded turned their attention to eastern cities and bankers.William Calderwood, \\"Religious Reactions to the Ku Klux Klan in Saskatchewan,\\" Saskatchewan History, October 1973, Vol. 26 Issue 3, pp 103‚Äì114 Families Gender roles were sharply defined. Men were primarily responsible for breaking the land; planting and harvesting; building the house; buying, operating and repairing machinery; and handling finances. At first there were many single men on the prairie, or husbands whose wives were still back east, but they had a hard time. They realized the need for a wife. In 1901, there were 19,200 families, but this surged to 150,300 families only 15 years later. Wives played a central role in settlement of the prairie region. Their labor, skills, and ability to adapt to the harsh environment proved decisive in meeting the challenges. They prepared bannock, beans and bacon, mended clothes, raised children, cleaned, tended the garden, helped at harvest time and nursed everyone back to health. While prevailing patriarchal attitudes, legislation, and economic principles obscured women's contributions, the flexibility exhibited by farm women in performing productive and nonproductive labor was critical to the survival of family farms, and thus to the success of the wheat economy.Sandra Rollings-Magnusson, \\"Canada's Most Wanted: Pioneer Women on the Western Prairies.\\" Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology 2000 37(2): 223‚Äì238; E. Rowles, \\"Bannock, beans and bacon: An investigation of pioneer diet.\\" Saskatchewan History, 1952. Vol. V, No 1, pp. 1‚Äì16. Population history When Saskatchewan became a province in 1905, boosters and politicians proclaimed its destiny was to become Canada's most powerful province. Saskatchewan embarked on an ambitious province-building program based on its Anglo-Canadian culture and wheat production for the export market. Population quintupled from 91,000 in 1901 to 492,000 to 1911, thanks to heavy immigration of farmers from the U.S., Germany and Scandinavia. Efforts were made to assimilate the newcomers to British Canadian culture and values.James M. Pitsula, \\"Disparate Duo\\" Beaver 2005 85(4): 14‚Äì24. The population reached 758,000 in 1921 and peaked at 922,000 in 1931. It lost population in the Great Depression and war years, dropping to 830,000 in 1951, then slowly climbed back up, holding steady at about one million since 1986. The ethnic history of the province was reflected in the ancestry data in 2006. The largest ethnic groups were German (30.0%), followed by English (26.5%), Scottish (19.2%), Irish (15.3%), Ukrainian (13.6%), French (12.4%), First Nations (12.1%), Norwegians (7.2%), Polish (6.0%), M√©tis (4.4%), Dutch (3.7%), Russian (3.7%) and Swedish (3.5%). Some 18.1% of all respondents also identified their ethnicity as \\"Canadian\\". Saskatchewan's population since 1901 The largest denominations in 2001 were the Roman Catholic Church with 286,815 (30%); the United Church of Canada with 187,450 (20%); and the Lutherans with 78,520 (8%). 148,535 (15.4%) responded \\"no religion\\". 1905‚Äì1930 Government structure The provisional districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Athabaska of the Northwest Territories amalgamated into the province of Saskatchewan in 1905. The boundaries consist of: on the west is the 4th Meridian [of the Dominion Land Survey], south 49th parallel US-Canada boundary line, to the north the Northwest Territories-Saskatchewan boundary line, and just about on the 2nd Meridian on the eastern boundary with the province of Manitoba. The early government formed local improvement districts (later re-organised into rural municipalities) initially to protect against prairie fires, establish roads and bridges. As homesteads were established, and agricultural methods perfected the community, slowly evolved. With supplemental monetary resources rural municipalities could now develop and establish schools for education, churches, cemeteries and health care for their residents. Political history 1905‚Äì1919 The long-term prosperity of the province depended on the world price of wheat, which headed steadily upward from the 1880s to 1920, then plunged down. Wheat output was increased by new strains, such as the \\"Marquis\\" strain which matured 8 days sooner and yielded 7 more bushels per acre than the previous standard, \\"Red Fife\\". The national output of wheat soared from 8 million bushels in 1896, to 26 million in 1901, reaching 151 million by 1921. In the 1905 provincial elections, Liberals won 16 of 25 seats in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan government bought out Bell Telephone Company in 1909, with the government owning the long-distance lines and left local service to small companies organized at the municipal level.Ronald S. Love, \\"'A Harebrained Plan': Saskatchewan and the Formation of a Provincial Telephone Policy, 1906‚Äì1912.\\" Saskatchewan History 2005 57(1): 15‚Äì33. Premier Thomas Walter Scott preferred government assistance to outright ownership because he thought enterprises worked better if citizens had a stake in running them; he set up the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company in 1911. Despite pressure from farm groups for direct government involvement in the grain handling business, the Scott government opted to loan money to a farmer-owned elevator company. Saskatchewan in 1909 provided bond guarantees to railway companies for the construction of branch lines, alleviating the concerns of farmers who had trouble getting their wheat to market by wagon. Urban reform movements in Regina in the years just prior to the start of the First World War in 1914 depended on support from business and professional groups. City planning, reform of local government, and municipal ownership of utilities were more widely supported by these two groups, often through such organizations as the Board of Trade. Protestant church-related and other altruistic organizations generally supported social welfare and housing reforms, but they were usually less successful in getting their reforms enacted.Girard Hengen, \\"A Case Study in Urban Reform: Regina Before the First World War.\\" Saskatchewan History 1988 41(1): 19‚Äì34 The province responded to the First World War in 1914 with patriotic enthusiasm and enjoyed the resultant economic boom. The price of wheat tripled and acreage seeded doubled. The wartime spirit of sacrifice intensified social reform movements that had predated the war and now came to fruition. Saskatchewan gave women the right to vote in 1916 and at the end 1916 passed a referendum to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Patriotism also created a demand for a common language‚ÄîEnglish‚Äîfor everyone in the province. The war brought to the forefront a fear of ethnicities, and a survival instinct developed the need for a Canadian identity. 1919‚Äì39 The economic crash after the war created an angry agrarian protest movement. Prairie farmers had long considered themselves the victims of powerful corporations‚Äîgrain companies, banks, and railways‚Äîall based in Toronto and Montreal. Attacks on industrialists and financiers blamed high tariffs designed to protect manufacturers at the expense of farmers. During the war farmers felt doubly betrayed. The federal government first promised to exempt their sons from compulsory military service, then canceled the exemption. It imposed a ceiling on wheat prices when they were high, but removed the floor when they were low. The farmers' pent-up frustration led to the formation of the Progressive Party in several provinces; it sent 64 to Ottawa in the 1921 general election. Eager to control the price of wheat, 46,000 farmers joined together in 1923‚Äì4 to set up the \\"Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers\\"‚Äîthe Saskatchewan Wheat Pool‚Äîthat bought nearly everyone's wheat and held it in elevators for the best price. The pool collapsed financially in 1931 and the federal government had to cover the losses; the coop continued as a network of elevators owned by the farmers. It advanced the reform agenda for agricultural development, with full-time district representatives, or fieldmen, who promoted education, demonstrations of farm equipment, community picnics and rallies, and cooperative insurance, among other programs.Ian Macpherson, \\"Missionaries of Rural Development: the Fieldmen of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, 1925‚Äì1965.\\" Agricultural History 1986 60(2): 73‚Äì96. ; also see Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan The Roaring Twenties saw ethnic tensions and unprecedented prosperity. Bootlegging activities, gangsters such as Al Capone, and the underground trade of whisky smuggling used the caves around Cypress Hills, and the Soo Line Railroad which ended in Moose Jaw, the \\"Sin City of the north\\", or \\"Little Chicago\\". The Bronfman family became rich during Prohibition by shipping liquor into the United States, where it was illegal. Under the leadership of brothers Sam and Harry, the family based most of its operations out of Yorkton and Regina, while maintaining a warehouse in Moose Jaw.Kathy Morrell, \\"The Bronfman Family and the Yorkton Courts,\\" Saskatchewan History, Spring 2010, Vol. 62 Issue 1, pp 16‚Äì40John Larsen and Maurice Richard Libby, Moose Jaw: people, places, history (2001) p. 78 The Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association worked with the provincial Liberals and kept them in office until 1929, when a Conservative-led coalition was elected for a term. As wheat prices recovered the late 1920s were golden years. By 1927 Saskatchewan ranked first among the provinces in the production of wheat, oats, rye, and flax, and in sundry other areas. Most important, it ranked first in per capita wealth. With a population of 922,000 in 1931 ranked third in size, behind only Ontario and Quebec. The Great Depression hit the prairies hard, especially when combined with the drought of the Dirty Thirties. The world market for wheat collapsed and per capita money income fell 75%. Thousands emigrated away from the family homestead as it could no longer support the family nor the community. Relief expenditures in the province in 1937 exceeded $40 million, dwarfing the entire 1939 provincial budget of $23 million. The hard-pressed government imposed a new 2% sales tax to cover the promissory notes that had been given to teachers in lieu of salaries. In 1930, Saskatoon initiated a series of \\"work for wages\\" schemes designed to provide the unemployed with unskilled manual jobs. Financed from municipal, provincial, and federal sources, but operated by the city, the projects kept unemployment to manageable levels at first. Before 1932, most experts saw the depression as a temporary anomaly, a short-term emergency requiring no more than short-term emergency measures. By 1932 the depression was getting much worse with no end in sight. By spring 1932, the federal and provincial governments, short of revenue, were forced to abandon expensive public works in favor of the cheaper, more efficient direct relief of giving out cash and foot baskets.Eric J. Strikwerda, \\"From Short-term Emergency to Long-term Crisis: Public Works Projects in Saskatoon, 1929‚Äì1932.\\" Prairie Forum 2001 26(2): 169‚Äì186. Radical activism in the cities led to the Estevan Riot and the Regina Riot. Finally prosperity returned after 1939, as farm prices rose and Saskatchewan plunged into the war effort. Social structure, 1940s‚Äì1950s As late as 1940, the province was heavily rural, dotted with many small service villages and towns. Two thirds of the people lived on farms. A tenth lived in towns or villages of more than 1,000 population. Another 15% lived in four small cities: Regina, the capital, with a population of 58,000; Moose Jaw, forty miles west of Regina, with 20,000; Saskatoon, the home of the university, with 43,000; and Prince Albert in the north, with 13,000. The cities were merely larger versions of the country towns; they were primarily trading centres serving rural areas. Railroads, wholesale trade and retail trade employed most of the urban workers.Lipset, Agrarian Socialism (1971 edition) pp 49‚Äì50 Little economic decision-making power was concentrated in the cities. The small urban upper-middle class was composed of professionals and branch managers of national banks and corporations or heads of small local manufacturing or trading organizations. The banks were mostly branch offices with headquarters far to the east; the leading stores were branches of national chains, especially Eaton's, Simpson's, the Hudson's Bay Company. To the farmer and urbanite alike, the names symbolize the world of eastern business that controls their fate, and became the target of political fears. A pervasive social and economic equality characterized the rural areas. Sharp variations existed between the rich south and the poor north. Farmers in districts of good soil were generally wealthier; large farms of to dominated the rich Regina plains and in the Rosetown district west of Saskatoon; small farms of to typified the poor-soil regions of the north with small outputs even in years with good weather. Within the province the average assessment per acre of land varied from an index of 9 for the poorest rural municipality to 76 for the wealthiest. Within any one rural community, however, variations in the value of land are small, for the great majority of farms have the same conditions of soil and rainfall. Differences in income did exist within individual rural communities, but they were not large enough to result in the emergence of distinct social classes. There were few hired hands, and tenant farmers were mostly men under age 40 who expected to eventually buy or inherit land.Lipset, Agrarian Socialism (1971 edition) pp 51‚Äì52 Mechanization after 1945 thus changed the face of Saskatchewan. Combines and mechanized farming were now available, farms became larger, and more folk moved into urban centres. The one-room school house closed down to make way for the more industrial or consolidated school in town which provided more resources for more technological development. Growth and improvements in technology paved the way for the contemporary society of Saskatchewan. Tommy Douglas and CCF A new political movement emerged, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF); its 1933 manifesto promised to eradicate capitalism and put in place a \\"full program of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Co-operative Commonwealth.\\" Tommy Douglas (1904‚Äì86), a Baptist minister from working class origins, led the CCF to power in 1944 and kept it in power to 1961. Douglas headed the first socialist government elected in Canada, and is recognized as the father of socialized medicine and the leader who put democratic socialism in the mainstream of Canadian politics.A. W. Johnson, Dream No Little Dreams: A Biography of the Douglas Government of Saskatchewan, 1944‚Äì1961 (2004); Lipset, Agrarian Socialism The Saskatchewan CCF won in June 1944 with a \\"Pocket Platform\\" calling for home ownership and debt reduction; increased old age pensions, mothers' allowances, and disability care; public medical, dental, and hospital services; equal education; free speech and religion; collective bargaining; and the encouragement of economic co-operatives. The CCF, while rhetorically socialist, did not nationalize banking or industry; it sought a mixed economy, including public, private, and cooperative sectors, with a strong role for private ownership in innovation and competition, however with new controls. For example, In its first term the CCF passed a farm security act preventing banks and mortgage companies from foreclosing on family farms. The CCF government also introduced the most pro-labour trade union act in North America. Saskatchewan became the first province to allow civil servants to organize unions (1944), the first to enshrine a bill of rights prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, colour, or creed (1947), the first to implement compulsory government automobile insurance (1946), and the first to institute a hospital insurance plan (1947). The CCF was committed to efficiency-oriented planning. Douglas set up an Economic Advisory and Planning Board (EAPB), a cabinet committee with a supporting secretariat, charged with planning economic development strategies for the province and evaluating overall policies and programs. The EAPB evolved into two new agencies: the Budget Bureau and the Government Finance Office. The former was the secretariat for the Treasury Board, the committee of cabinet in charge of allocating budgetary expenditures. In addition, the Budget Bureau had an Organization and Methods unit, which surveyed the operations of various government departments and made recommendations on how they could be managed more effectively. Budgeting became more than the mechanical exercise of allocating money; it became the meeting point of the decision-making process, where all the Douglas government's diverse priorities were integrated. The CCF set up eleven small Crown corporations including power and telephone utilities, bus and airline companies, and ventures into sodium sulfate mining, a woolen mill, and a shoe factory. By 1949, most of the non-utility corporations had been unable to turn a profit and ceased operations. Prosperity returned after 1945, and the population increased gradually. More dramatic was the movement from farms to towns and cities as farming became more mechanized and capital intensive. Increased production of oil, gas, and uranium, and the beginnings of a potash industry helped diversify the economy beyond just wheat. Native policies Douglas brought First Nations delegates together in 1946 to form a single organization to represent Indian interests. Three existing organizations merged into the Union of Saskatchewan Indians, which later became the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN). Douglas's EAPB prepared an in-depth analysis of the demographic, social, and economic challenges facing the First Nation population. In the 21st century the FSIN is a strong policy-making and program-delivery organization, arguably one of the most effective of its kind in Canada.F. Laurie Barron, Walking in Indian Moccasins: The Native Policies of Tommy Douglas and the CCF (1997) CCF initiatives included encouraging northern aboriginals to trade their semi-nomadic lifestyles for lives in urban settings. The establishment of Kinoosao on Reindeer Lake provides an example of how CCF planners established new villages; community development processes excluded local people. Yet, in spite of considerable resistance, various incentives and coercive measures resulted in the movement of nearly all northerners to permanent settlements. Socialized medicine In 1959, Douglas promised universal medical care insurance, based on pre-payment, quality service and government administration, and through a scheme acceptable to both doctors and patients. The election of 1960 was fought on this issue; the doctors campaigning against it, but the CCF won. The CCF comprised two contradictory traditions ‚Äì a group aligned with a rational, bureaucratic, statist approach to government and a faction dedicated to the populist ideals of democratic participation. The struggle between these two sometimes overlapping factions ended, at least temporarily, with the resignation of Douglas and the succession of Woodrow S. Lloyd (1913‚Äì72) as premier in November 1961. Lloyd's statist approach to government dominated the CCF and its policies during the critical period of the introduction of a province-wide system of state-sponsored medical insurance. No referendum or local control through community clinics was permitted in the implementation of the medical insurance plan (in part due to doctors' opposition to community clinics). The plan was presented to the public not for its approval but for its acceptance. The CCF did consider community involvement necessary. After twenty years in office, a centrist-bureaucratic ideology dominated the party and the anti- statist decentralist in the Saskatchewan CCF was in retreat.Keith Brownsey, \\"Policy, Bureaucracy and Personality: Woodrow Lloyd and the Introduction of Medicare in Saskatchewan.\\" Prairie Forum 1998 23(2): 197‚Äì210; Brett Quiring, \\"The Social and Political Philosophy of Woodrow S. Lloyd.\\" Saskatchewan History 2004 56(1): 5‚Äì20. The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Bill became law in November 1961, and the medical society announced doctors would refuse to participate, complaining that it would bring regimentation and would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. The doctors even went on strike for a few weeks in July 1962, but returned when new legislation allowed them to practise outside the system. Eventually the Saskatchewan plan was so popular that in 1968 the federal government extended it nationwide.On the medical leaders who made the plan work in Saskatchewan, see Bill Waiser and Stuart Houston, Tommy's Team: The People Behind the Douglas Years (2010). Douglas became leader of the federal New Democratic Party (formed by a merger of the CCF and organized labour). The party was unsuccessful in its first election, the federal election of 1962, due to the backlash against the CCF's medical care program and to Canadians' general historic reluctance to vote for progressive change. In the 1964 Saskatchewan provincial election, the Liberal party, led by Ross Thatcher (1917‚Äì71), swept to victory, ending 20 years of CCF government. The Liberals had launched a strong party membership drive and engaged in vigorous campaigning on a platform demanding more private enterprise and industrial development; it promised substantial tax cuts. The CCF's internal factionalism, together with lingering reaction to the medical care crisis of 1962 and the separate school issue, contributed to the CCF defeat. The impact of the Douglas government on the rest of the country was profound, both in public policy and the bureaucratic machinery devised to implement it. After the defeat in 1964, the former administration's influence continued to ripple out from Regina, as senior civil servants left the province and became influential elsewhere.Johnson, Dream No Little Dreams (2004) Recent history NDP government 1971‚Äì1982 Thatcher and his Liberals were reelected in 1967, but were defeated in a landslide by Allan E. Blakeney (1925‚Äì2011)See Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan and the NDP in 1971. The NDP was reelected in 1975, as the long-dormant Progressive Conservative party made a comeback. Blakeney's government practised state-led economic intervention in the economy. The farmers were a high priority, as globalization began transforming agriculture, weakening the traditional family farm through consolidation, mechanization, and corporatization. The NDP promised a \\"revitalized rural Saskatchewan,\\" and Blakeney's introduced programs to stabilize crop prices, retain transportation links, and modernize rural life. Looking back he lamented his lack of success: \\"We were, it seems, King Canute trying to hold back the tide.\\"Allan Blakeney, An Honourable Calling: Political Memoirs (2008) pp. 5, 125 The NDP decided to nationalize the potash industry in 1976‚Äì78 by buying out 45% of the mining interests. The government created a Crown corporation in the potash industry in an attempt to further diversify the province's agrarian economy and threatened expropriation of private potash mines within the province. Blakeney pointed out that the sums paid for these mines were slightly in excess of their appraised \\"book\\" value. However, the mere threat of expropriation created a political firestorm that involved even the U.S. government.Blakeney, An Honourable Calling: Political Memoirs pp. 156‚Äì62 By 1979 the Crown Investments Corporation, the holding company for the crowns, had assets of $3.5 billion and revenues of over $1 billion. Blakeney also created a state-owned oil and gas corporation (SaskOil) to handle oil exploration and production. The private oil industry had essentially abandoned Saskatchewan following the NDP's imposition of high royalty rate policy of the early 1970s. Prime Minister Trudeau's policies (to centralize control of natural resources in Ottawa) outraged Blakeney, and he moved closer to Alberta's position of open hostility. Blakeney joined Alberta Progressive Conservative Premier Peter Lougheed in a fight for provincial rights over minerals, oil and gas.Blakeney, An Honourable Calling: Political Memoirs p. 5 Nationalization was the central issue in the 1978 elections; the NDP held its own but the Liberals were wiped out and the Progressive Conservative party grew. Prosperity was at hand, with good prices for wheat and expansion of oil and uranium. The NDP spent resource revenues to build on the social welfare legacy of the CCF. It introduced a guaranteed income supplement for senior citizens, a family income plan for the working poor, a children's dental service, and a prescription drug plan. Since 1982 Voters went to the polls in 1982 as the economy started slipping, with falling prices for wheat, oil, potash and uranium. The NDP was routed after a dozen years in power, dropping from 45 seats to 9 while the Progressive Conservative Party took all the other 55 seats. The new premier was 37-year-old economist Grant Devine (1944‚Äì ), who won with a simple populist message: the people should share in the wealth of the province rather than watch it contribute to the expansion of the 24 Crown corporations. The new government ended the 20% tax on gasoline and lower interest rates on mortgages. It was reelected in 1986 and began selling off crown corporations. The government said the companies would operate more profitably as private businesses. The opposition NDP warned that the sales would result in loss of control over the province's key economic sectors. After taking over balanced books in 1982, the Progressive Conservatives spent liberally on a number of voter-friendly initiatives, including tax rebates and mortgage subsidies, as well as investing millions in several money-losing megaprojects. The provincial deficit peaked at $1.2 billion in 1986‚Äì87, and the accumulated debt rose from $3.5 billion to $15 billion. The Progressive Conservatives, based in rural areas and small towns, lost many rural voters after pushing through the unpopular U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1989. As a result, the NDP was returned to power in 1991. Scandals involving top officials ruined the Progressive Conservative party, which suspended operations in 1997; conservative voters moved to the new Saskatchewan party at the provincial level, and to the Reform Party of Canada at the national level. The NDP won reelection in 1995 and 1999, and (in coalition with the Liberals) again in 2003. Lorne Calvert (1952‚Äì ), an ordained minister, served as NDP premier 2001‚Äì2007. Brad Wall (1965‚Äì ) became premier as his centre-right Saskatchewan Party took over from the NDP after a landslide victory in the November 2007 election. The landslide grew after 4 years of solid economic management, nearly wiping out the NDP (losing 11 of 20 seats) in the 2011 election in which NDP party leader Dwain Lingenfelter even failed to retain his own seat (what was once considered a \\"safe seat\\" for the NDP, Regina-Elphinstone). Lingenfelter resigned immediately, and the party elected Cam Broten as leader in 2013. He was first elected as an MLA in 2007 and re-elected in 2011. He was elected as Leader of Saskatchewan's New Democrats on March 9, 2013 Social and economic trends In 2005 two-thirds of the province's population lived in urban areas, there was a diverse economic base, and citizens enjoyed a rich cultural life. The economic future based on high-priced oil and wheat looks bright. Saskatchewan is the ninth biggest supplier of oil to the U.S., shipping them more than Kuwait. The province has 1.2 billion barrels of recoverable conventional oil and an estimated 1.5 billion barrels of potential oil sands reserves (which create troublesome high carbon emissions when processed).Luiza Ch. Savage, \\"Fuelling up a New Future,\\" Maclean's March 24, 2008 The rural towns have evolved from a very large number of widely dispersed grain delivery points in 1900, through a period of expansion over the first thirty years of the 20th century, to a pattern of relatively concentrated population and businesses in an urban-based economy by 2000. Mechanization, especially the rapid replacement of horses by tractors after 1945, meant one family could operate a much larger farm, so some farmers bought out their neighbors, who then moved to town along with the surplus children. The rural economy diversified far beyond its exclusively agricultural base, with service employment in education and medicine important, as well as small-scale factories. Better highways, along with cell phones and internet coverage encouraged a concentration in fewer, larger centers, which drew customers and clients from a wide radius. Most rural communities declined continuously over the second half of the 20th century, but some grew in population, expanded their economic base, and experienced an increase in their market areas for a limited range of goods and services. These communities also became centers of employment for their own and surrounding (farm and nonfarm) population.M. Rose Olfert and Jack C. Stabler, \\"Rural Communities of the Saskatchewan Prairie Landscape.\\" Prairie Forum 2000 25(1): 123‚Äì138. The Wheat Pool continues in operation as Viterra, having taken over Agricore United (based in Manitoba) in 2007. With soaring wheat prices, Viterra's revenues in the first quarter (three months) of 2008 reached $1.3 billion, triple the total the year before.See Bloomberg Businessweek, \\"VITERRA INC (VT:Toronto)\\" Military history Military history of Saskatchewan includes the early conflicts between conflicting First Nations. Prior to European settlement many battles were fought between the Blackfoot, Atsina, Cree, Assiniboine, Saulteaux, Sioux, and Dene. Many place names hearken back to these early conflicts such as the Battle River: so named due to Cree-Blackfoot fighting in the area. The Blackfoot Confederacy, and Atsina or Gros Ventre were pushed out of Saskatchewan following decades of warfare with the Cree, Saulteaux, and Assiniboine. In the boreal forest conflicts raged between the Woods Cree and Dene or Chipewyan up until the late 19th century. The creation of the M√©tis added a new dimension to conflicts in what is now Saskatchewan. In addition to violence related to the fur trade between the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company (which ended with the merger of the two in 1821), the M√©tis took part in battles with the Sioux and Gros Ventre across the plains. The last battles fought in Saskatchewan, and the last battles fought in what is now Canada occurred in 1885 during the Saskatchewan Rebellion. Although small by global standards this short war had a profound effect on Canadian French- English relations, and was a defining moment in the history of the West and the M√©tis. Since Saskatchewan became a province in 1905, its people have contributed heavily to wars fought by the Canadian state. Saskatchewan Regiments were raised for the second Boer War, First World War, Second World War, and Korean War. In addition many Saskatchewan citizens have served in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and in the current Afghan War. Some current Saskatchewan regiments in the Primary Reserve of the Canadian Forces include the North Saskatchewan, and the Royal Regina Rifles. Inland waterways Travel by boat and canoe along the waterways of what is now Saskatchewan was historically an important mode of transport. During the early fur trading era from the 17th century through to the 19th century, travel to the inland of North America could be facilitated by waterways as there were no roads nor railways at this time. The First Nations and French fur traders from the East relied on birch bark canoes to traverse the main rivers, and the English fur trader from the Hudson's Bay Company travelled by York boat. During the late 19th century steamboats were used to navigate immigrants and goods along the Saskatchewan River. This only continued until 1896 when the last steamboat ceased operations. The ice flows of the winter months and the shallow sand bars made this form of navigation impractical. The most notable highlight of the steamboat era was the impact steamboats made upon the North West Rebellion. Since this time the main use of travel by boat are the 13 seasonal ferries which are still operational and started use in Saskatchewan in the late 19th century. Barges are used to transport freight on the larger northern lakes, Wollaston and Athabasca for the northern mining industry. Archontology of Saskatchewan Archontology is the study of historical Saskatchewan offices and important positions in various organizations and societies. This list cannot be comprehensive but rather an introduction to those who have contributed to the shaping of Saskatchewan. There are a few who are highlighted through the events of history, who have helped to mould and build Saskatchewan as it is today. see also :Category:People from Saskatchewan Louis Riel ‚Äì (October 22, 1844 ‚Äì November 16, 1885) was a Canadian politician, a founder of the province of Manitoba, and leader of the M√©tis people of the Canadian prairies.

Art history Art history of Saskatchewan is complex and diverse as it follows the changes and social context of art in this prairie province. Petroglyphs are the earliest studied artforms which are located in archaeological sites of Saskatchewan. As early as the 17th century, explorers depicted the early North West in both written, painted and drawn artforms. Frederick Verner, W.G.R. Hind, Peter Rindisbacher, Edward Roper and Paul Kane are some of the earliest artists. Followed by William Kurelek, C. W. Jefferys, Robert Hurley and Dorothy Knowles. Margaret Laurence, W.O. Mitchell, Nellie McClung captured the prairie spirit in words. In the 1920s, the Group of Seven formed a group of Canadian landscape painters, made up of Franklin Carmichael, Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, Frederick Varley, A. J. Casson, Edwin Holgate, LeMoine Fitzgerald and Tom Thomson. Augustus Kenderdine, landscape painter started art instruction at Emma Lake, Saskatchewan. Imagery changed of the grasslands shown in the early drawings where the wild west was a romantic adventure of first nation and Buffalo. The prairie scenery then highlighted building a Nation, a prairie utopia, through to the realism of the settlement experience. Paul Kane, (September 3, 1810 ‚Äì February 20, 1871) was an Irish-Canadian painter, famous for his paintings of First Nations peoples in the Canadian West and other Native Americans in the Oregon Country. Henry Youle Hind (1 June 1823 ‚Äì 8 August 1908), Canadian geologist and explorer detailed his travels in both images and these writings Narrative of the Canadian Red River Exploring Expedition of 1857 and Reports of Progress on the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition. Count Imhoff (1865‚Äì1939) painted magnificent religious murals within churches at St. Walburg, Muenster, St. Benedict, Bruno, Denzil, Reward, St. Leo, Humboldt, Paradise Hill, North Battleford etc. Joni Mitchell, CC (born Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943) is a noted Canadian musician, songwriter, and painter.

The troupe performs a variety of songs (particularly Broadway showtunes), comedy sketches, and celebrity impersonations. It has also recorded for several national and local record labels, although record sales were primarily in Hawaii record stores and as souvenirs at the group's performances‚Äîin that context, the group's hits include \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"99.8\\" and \\"I'll Love You Through It All.\\" The SOS released a number of records in Asia, recording with the Hong Kong-based Diamond Records. Their version of \\"A Little Bit of Soap\\" was 1 for 32 weeks on the Hong Kong charts, as well as being a hit in neighboring countries. That started a string of hits, and they had a double hit with \\"Dancing on the Moon\\" and \\"Sunshine\\" (a ballad written by Diamond Music co-director Frances da Silva-Kirk and Vic Cristobal). History The Society of Seven opened at the Main Showroom of the Outrigger Waikiki in 1969 for what was originally a four-week engagement in place of Tommy Sands. There was considerable turnover in the roster in the years that followed‚Äîthree members of the group, Danny Ruivivar, Terry Lucido and Gary Bautista (who joined in 1984), died, and more than 14 others came and went during the next four decades. However, two members of the original 1969 SOS group‚ÄîSOS leader Tony Ruivivar and vocalist Bert Sagum, both also members of the original Fabulous Echoes group‚Äîwere still there when the group celebrated its 32nd anniversary at the Outrigger in 2001. That is believed to be the record for a Waikiki act as the headliner of single major venue (Don Ho was a Waikiki headliner for 43 years, but he headlined several different venues between 1964 and 2007; Danny Kaleikini, another major Hawaiian entertainer, headlined the Maile Terrace at what was then the Kahala Hilton, a few miles outside Waikiki, for 27 years [1967-1994]). In 2001, a second troupe was formed, Society of Seven LV. When the formation of the SOS LV was first announced the publicists said that the original SOS group would remain based in Waikiki and the younger group, with the \\"LV\\" short for Las Vegas would be based in Las Vegas. However, the original SOS eventually moved to Las Vegas and the Society of Seven LV became the resident version of the group at the Outrigger, though the original Society Of Seven has returned to Hawaii for several concert-style performances at the Hawaii Theater in downtown Honolulu. As of May 2009, Society of Seven with Lani Misalucha could be seen performing at the Flamingo Las Vegas and Society of Seven LV, with Jasmine Trias can be seen at the Outrigger Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii. Trias, a finalist on the American Idol TV show, was born and raised in Mililani, Hawaii, near Honolulu, and was seen as a natural addition to the show. On November 6, 2009 the Society of Seven opened a new show with Jasmine Trias doing comedy, impression and dance under a one-year contract to perform two shows Friday, Saturday & Sunday at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino located one mile (1.6 km) west of the Las Vegas Strip on West Flamingo Road. This relationship has continued a second year, with Trias joining SOS in their sold-out 22 October 2011 show at Atlantis Casino Resort in Reno, Nevada. Starting in 2010, when Trias has had other obligations, her place has been taken by Arshiel Calatrava, a high school student from Kalihi, Hawaii, continuing the SOS tradition of showcasing Hawaiian talent. The original SOS group received a \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" from the Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts (HARA) in 2007. The group was voted \\"the Best Show in Waikiki\\" by the readers of Honolulu Magazine.

The film is based on Cole Porter's Broadway musical Mexican Hayride starring Bobby Clark. No songs from the stage musical were used in the film. Plot Joe Bascomb (Lou Costello) chases con man Harry Lambert (Bud Abbott) to Mexico City, after Harry apparently swindled him (and some friends) in an oil stock scam back in the United States. Joe's ex-girlfriend, Mary (Virginia Grey) has hired Harry as her agent, and is going by the name 'Montana', passing herself off as a toreador. When Joe encounters Harry at a bullring arena, he also sees Mary, who is in the ring. As part of 'Amigo Americana Week', she is about to toss her hat into the crowd where the lucky recipient will be proclaimed 'goodwill ambassador'. Mary is supposed to toss the hat to Gus Adamson (Frank Fenton), another con man whom Harry has arranged to be chosen, but Mary instead throws the hat in anger at Joe. It turns out that Joe, now the 'goodwill ambassador', is also being pursued by American authorities for partaking in the oil stock scam; he uses an alias, 'Humphrey Fish', while in Mexico. Joe is persuaded to participate in Harry's, Dagmar's (Luba Malina) and Mary's plan to sell fake silver mine stock. While giving tours of the bogus mine, Joe extols its beauty and sells stock to anyone he can. Eventually the authorities track down and incarcerate Joe, along with Harry; Joe manages to escape and, disguised as an old Mexican woman, helps Harry escape. They return to the bullring in search of Dagmar and the stock money. Joe enters the ring, only to be chased by an irate bull. Dagmar, who has the money concealed in her hat, tosses it to him. Harry enters the ring to retrieve the hat from Joe, who is still being pursued by the bull. Eventually, the money is recovered and returned to the authorities. The gang is cleared of wrongdoing involving the silver mine, but are not yet cleared in their oil stock scam back in the States. Dagmar makes reparations for those charges as well, and they are free to return home. Production Mexican Hayride was filmed from June 11 through August 12, 1948. Early plans for production called for the film to be made in Technicolor. Both Costello and Abbott objected to the making of this film. Costello wanted a different cast, including Carmen Miranda and Lucille Ball, while Abbott simply hated the script. They were both suspended for a week, and filming began only two days behind schedule.Furmanek, Bob and Ron Palumbo (1991). Abbott and Costello in Hollywood. New York: Perigee Books. Costello's brother Pat plays one of the detectives on his trail. The Cole Porter song \\"I Love You\\" sung by Virginia Grey and John Hubbard was filmed but cut from the released movie.

Judaism moved to the south into Arequipa and to others populated cities like Piura. Most B'nai Moshe now live in the West Bank, mostly in Kfar Tapuach along with Yemenite Jews, Russian Jews and others. \\"Inca Jews\\" While Inca Jews is not the community's official designation, it is popular outside the community and is derived from the fact that they can trace descent from Peru's indigenous Amerindian people, although mostly in the form of mestizos (persons of mixed Spanish, Amerindian descent, and Spanish Jewish ancestors) and the association of that country's native population with the Incas. History The community was founded in 1966 by a local man of Trujillo named Villanueva, who faced great exclusion and prejudice in his native city as a result of his decision to convert from the Catholic Church to Judaism. Villanueva had visited Spain for a time, learning from the local Sephardic community, and upon his return, taught around 500 former Catholics in Trujillo about Judaism, igniting a spark which would ultimately lead to their conversion to Judaism and joining the Jewish people. Conversion and aliyah In 1985, Villanueva made contact with the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who sent Rabbi Myron Zuber to Peru to help with their formal conversions. In 1988, Zuber arrived in Peru and aided the converts in matters such as how to properly observe kashrut and Shabbat. As a result of the Lima community's continuing reluctance, it was eventually decided that the B'nai Moshe could not reach their full potential in Peru, and decided that they make aliyah (emigration) to Israel once converted. A Beit Din initially performed formal conversions for about 300 members of the community in 1991, almost all of whom emigrated to Israel, who were followed by an additional 200 several years later. A community of around 30 B'nai Moshe moved to Lima at the same time. Another 84 were formally converted in 2001. Peruvian Jews overall As of 2008, Peru had approximately 2,500 people identifying as Jews. A further 2,500 have emigrated and live outside the country, mostly in Israel and the United States.

The company was one of the first to go public under a system advanced by WR Hambrecht + Co to retain a greater share of capital within the company rather than going to the investment bank underwriters used in conventional public offerings. Byrne has said that competing banks reacted against this, attempting to obstruct the success of the offering through negative reports and by shorting the company's stock. When Google later in 2004 went public via a Dutch auction IPO, Byrne commented that Wall Street firms similarly pushed negative stories, but did not keep it from going forward successfully. Four years after the OpenIPO, one official of Hambrecht, its now former co-CEO Clay Corbus was added to Overstock's board of directors.

The articles described Nazerali as being involved with \\"Osama Bin Laden's favorite financier,\\" and that he worked with criminal syndicates including the Colombian drug cartel, the Russian mafia, and various \\"jihadi terrorist groups\\" including al Qaeda's Golden Chain. Deep Capture also accused Nazerali of \\"delivering weapons to war zones in Africa and to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan,\\" of orchestrating \\"small-time 'pump and dump' scams‚Ä¶ [and] bust-outs, death spiral finance and naked short selling,\\" and of carrying out dirty work for \\"a Pakistani ISI asset\\" who \\"works for the Iranian regime.\\" In May 2016, the Court found that the allegations in the Deep Capture articles were libelous and defamatory; Nazerali was awarded $1.2 million in damages, including $500,000 in aggravated damages, $250,000 in punitive damages and $55,000 in special damages. Byrne was permanently banned from publishing these accusations. The Court found Byrne, his employee Mark Mitchell, and Deep Capture \\"engaged in a calculated and ruthless campaign to inflict as much damage on Mr. Nazerali's reputation as they could achieve.\\" The 102-page decision said \\"It is clear on the evidence that their intention was to conduct a vendetta in which the truth about Mr. Nazerali himself was of no consequence.\\" The judgment was upheld on appeal in August 2018.

In 2019, Byrne announced that had had a relationship with Russian agent Maria Butina and also made claims in support of a deep state conspiracy theory. Byrne also claimed the Federal Bureau of Investigation encouraged him to have a sexual relationship with Butina. After he resigned as Overstock CEO on August 22, 2019, in the wake of that controversy, the company's share value rose by more than 10 percent, before collapsing nearly 50% from that point. Education policy In 2005, Byrne provided financial backing to the Class Education, whose goal is to change state laws to require schools to spend at least 65 percent of their operating budgets on classroom expenses. Proponents of the standard contend that it would free up money to increase teachers' salaries without requiring tax increases. Critics say that many services deemed \\"non- classroom\\" are necessary for education, including librarians, school nurses, guidance counselors, food service workers and school bus drivers.Teaching Schools How to Spend By Matthew Cooper Jun. 20, 2005, Time magazine Byrne also serves as co-chair (with Rose Friedman) of EdChoice.

Opponents of vouchers, funded mostly by the teacher unions, spent $4 million; approximately $3 million came from the National Education Association.\\"Voucher battle costs both sides total of $9.3M,\\" Salt Lake Tribune, Jan. 8, 2008, When that bill was defeated in a statewide referendum (62% opposing vs. 38% favoring), the Salt Lake Tribune reported that Byrne \\"called the referendum a 'statewide IQ test' that Utahns failed.\\" He said, \\"They don't care enough about their kids. They care an awful lot about this system, this bureaucracy, but they don't care enough about their kids to think outside the box.\\" Byrne criticized Utah governor Jon Huntsman for not sufficiently supporting the voucher campaign. Huntsman had before he was elected stated that he was \\"going to be the voucher governor\\", and Byrne had donated $75,000 to Huntsman's campaign for governor in 2004. However, when Huntsman was elected he went missing from the debate, and Byrne told the Associated Press that he would now bankroll anyone who could defeat Huntsman at the polls, \\"even a communist\\".

He was later a medical professor at the universities of K√∂nigsberg, Strassburg and Berlin. Leyden was an important influence to the career of Ludwig Edinger (1855‚Äì1918), and during his tenure at the University of K√∂nigsberg worked closely with Otto Spiegelberg (1830‚Äì1881) and Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen (1833‚Äì1910).Ernst Viktor von Leyden at Who Named It Among his better known students and assistants were Hermann Nothnagel (1841‚Äì1905) at K√∂nigsberg and Hermann Ludwig Eichhorst (1849‚Äì1921) in Berlin.Hermann Ludwig Eichhorst at Who Named It In 1880, with Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs, he founded the Zeitschrift f√ºr klinische Medizin; in 1881 he founded the Gesellschaft f√ºr innere Medizin. He treated Frederick III, German Emperor for his cancer of the larynx, though unsuccessfully, and in the 1890s (from 1894) he was a physician to Czar Alexander III of Russia. Upon Alexander's death in 1894, Von Leyden was awarded the Order of St. Anna, First Class, with Distinction, by his successor, Czar Nicholas II. Von Leyden died in Berlin. The political philosopher Wolfgang von Leyden (1911-2004) was his grandson. Obituary, David Scott, The Independent - 24 October 2004 Von Leyden specialized in neurological diseases, and was also a leader in establishing proper hospital facilities for tuberculosis patients.

Peter Lazer performs the voice of Pinocchio. It was produced by Ray Goossens at Belvision Studios, with American involvement from Norm Prescott (Filmation) and Fred Ladd. The French version was titled Pinocchio dans l'espace and the Dutch version was known as Pinocchio in de ruimte. The film was released in the US by Universal Pictures. It was Universal's second animated film that it distributed (the first was The Snow Queen) and its last one until 1986's An American Tail, which is the first film the company co-produced. The Talking Cricket character was not present in this production. Instead, Pinocchio's sidekick was Nurtle, an alien Twertle (voiced by Arnold Stang), sent by his government to investigate an unusual increase of radiation on Mars. Together they do battle against Astro, a marauding intergalactic whale who was seeking revenge after being abducted by a mysterious race of Martians.

A point x is an adherent point for A if and only if x is in the closure of A, thus : x\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Cl}({A})\\\\iff \\\\forall U\\\\subset X\\\\text{ open}: x\\\\in U\\\\implies U\\\\cap A e\\\\emptyset. This definition differs from that of a limit point, in that for a limit point it is required that every open set containing x contains at least one point of A different from x. Thus every limit point is an adherent point, but the converse is not true. An adherent point of A is either a limit point of A or an element of A (or both). An adherent point which is not a limit point is an isolated point. Intuitively, having an open set A defined as the area within (but not including) some boundary, the adherent points of A are those of A including the boundary. Examples *If S is a non-empty subset of R which is bounded above, then supS is adherent to S. *A subset S of a metric space M contains all of its adherent points if, and only if, S is (sequentially) closed in M. *In the interval (a, b], a is an adherent point that is not in the interval, with usual topology of R. *If S is a subset of a topological space then the limit of a convergent sequence in S does not necessarily belong to S, however it is always an adherent point of S. Let (xn)n‚ààN be such a sequence and let x be its limit. Then by definition, for all open neighbourhoods U of x there exists N ‚àà N such that xn ‚àà U for all n ‚â• N. In particular, xN ‚àà U and also xN ‚àà S, so x is an adherent point of S. *In contrast to the previous example, the limit of a convergent sequence in S is not necessarily a limit point of S; for example consider S = {0} as a subset of R. Then the only sequence in S is the constant sequence (0) whose limit is 0, but 0 is not a limit point of S; it is only an adherent point of S.

Faget has long been acknowledged as one of New Orleans' premier designers of fine jewelry. Her family settled in the city in the late 18th century after leaving Saint- Domingue.Biographical/Reference file, Mignon Faget (1983 March 1), Newcomb Archives, Tulane University. Painter Jacqueline Humphries is her daughter. Jewelry designer John Humphries is her son.  Early life  Mignon Faget was raised in a Creole French downtown family in New Orleans, by her father, a doctor from the West Indies and her mother of French descent. Mignon Faget has a sister of 16 years her eldest and a brother of 9 years her eldest. Education Mignon Faget attended the Roman Catholic Academy of the Sacred Heart as a young woman. She credits much of her talent to her years at H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College where she graduated in 1955 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a concentration in sculpture. While at Newcomb College she studied under Jules Struppeck (1915-1993), Pat Travigno (b. 1922) and Sarah \\"Sadie\\" Irvine (1887-1970). Faget feels a course entitled \\"Design in Nature\\" taught by Robert Durant \\"Robin\\" Feild (1893‚Äì1979) had a major influence on her future career.The Historic New Orleans Collection. Mignon Faget: A Life in Art and Design. Exhibit Guide. She additionally studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris, the Parsons School of Design in New York and print- making at St. Mary's Dominican College in New Orleans. Work Mignon Faget launched her first ready-to-wear line in 1969 in a studio in the Riverbend neighborhood of New Orleans. Faget studied sculpture at Newcomb then transitioned to design at D.H. Holmes Department store. While making a belt one day, Faget melted down wedding gifts into a design reminiscent of sand dollars and the sea. When customers saw the design, they asked to wear the shells as pendants, inspiring her to look further into creating accessories. Since then, Faget has worked primarily in jewelry, creating sculptural jewelry inspired by nature and animals specifically, from Louisiana. She renovated a barge board cottage and it became the early headquarters housing her studio, jewelry workshop and retail gallery for many years. In 1997, she renovated a neo-classical former bank building to house her company, in addition to having galleries in New Orleans, Metairie, and Baton Rouge. After opening her new facility, she donated her original location on Dublin Street to the Preservation Resource Center. Collections and Commissions Faget has designed special commissions for various organizations, including the Preservation Resource Center, Desire NOLA, Woodlands Trail and Park, H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College, the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Junior League of New Orleans, the Louisiana Nature Center at the Audubon Nature Institute, and the Friends of the Audubon Zoo, among others.Biographical/Reference file, Mignon Faget, Newcomb Archives, Tulane University. Her designs for Newcomb College feature the motif of the oak tree, a prominent symbol in the college's history. She has also designed jewelry for various New Orleans Mardi Gras krewes for their annual balls. Exhibitions Faget's work has appeared in various galleries across the country. In 1976 and 1980 she had solo showings in Kruger Gallery in New York City at which she showcased her latest designs. Mignon Faget exhibits Inspiration Her jewelry is often inspired by her local environment, such as New Orleans architecture and culture or based on forms in nature. Faget describes her work as a \\"crossover between a jeweled accessory and a piece of jewelry\\". Faget designs by collections and has created works entitled Sea, Romanesque Return, Zea, Animal Crackers, Armament, Schema, among others. Citing a dictionary, Faget herself referred to her work as \\"biomorphic,\\" meaning \\"related to, derived from, or incorporating the forms of living beings, used especially of primitive and abstract art.\\"Schoeffler, Nancy. \\"Jewelry Designer Inspired by Local Environment.\\" Times-Picayune [New Orleans] 14 Oct. 1982: 36. Print. However, she has also made work drawing inspiration from man-made elements such as architecture and place-based culture. Materials She fabricates in gold, sterling silver, bronze, precious, and semi-precious stones. She also designs items for personal and home adornment and gifts. Philanthropy After Hurricane Katrina, her business raised over $150,000 in eighteen months, which she donated to artists and arts organizations. Similarly, after BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill she raised nearly $100,000. In fall of 2010, Mignon Faget was honored with a retrospective exhibit at the Historic New Orleans Collection entitled Mignon Faget: A Life in Art and Design.

A former member of the Gay & Lesbian Association of Choruses GALA Choruses, SDMC performed some of the finest choral literature from a variety of genres. The Chorus offered numerous 'outreach performances' each season, and supported local LGBT organizations and HIV/AIDS organizations in the San Diego area. The San Diego Men's Chorus was a non-profit, tax-exempt organization under the Section 501(c)(3) of the US Internal Revenue Code. The Chorus was served by four Artistic Directors throughout its history, concluding, in its final years, with the direction of Jerry R. Foust, who had served previously as the Assistant Director for more than 18 months before assuming the Artistic Director position in January 2006.  History  Official San Diego Men's Chorus logo San Diego Men's Chorus was founded in May 1985 by a small group of committed singers who felt a need to provide San Diego with a quality presentation of men's choral music. Membership was open by audition, and, on September 9, 1985, a total of 55 men were in attendance at the first weekly rehearsal. SDMC was assisted by members of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles, which, in August of that year, staged a fundraiser concert at the Casa del Prado Theater in Balboa Park, San Diego, California. Thus, the new chorus in San Diego was able to begin with US$1,500 already in the coffers. SDMC has had many noteworthy achievements in its twenty plus year history: *Performed numerous formal concerts in such venues as Shrine Auditorium and Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, Denver's Buell Hall, and the University of Washington, Seattle. Local venues include San Dlego's Copley Symphony Hall, Spreckels Theatre, Mandeville Auditorium at UCSD, Mandell Weiss Theatre (La Jolla Playhouse), The Grand Ballroom of the Cafe del Rey Moro in Balboa Park, Bahia Hotel and several area churches including the First Unitarian Universalist and University Christian Churches). *Collaborated in artistic efforts with San Diego Opera, Pacific Chamber Orchestra, Three's Company Dancers, and San Diego Symphony. *Performed jointly with other gay and lesbian arts groups, including: San Diego Women's Chorus, Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles, Turtle Creek Chorale, Portland Lesbian Choir, South Coast Chorale from Orange County, Desert Voices from Tucson, Long Beach Men's Chorus, Orlando Gay Chorus, San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus, and America's Finest City Freedom Band. *Received artistic grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Combined Arts and Educational Council (COMBO), City of San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture, and the State of California. *Performed in Heartstrings: An Event in Three Acts in 1990 and Heartstrings: The AIDS Memorial Quilt and You in 1992 (excerpts from the 1992 performance were shown on national television in the summer of that same year). *Received Carol Channing's Diamond Award in 1995 for our involvement in DIFFA and fundraising for AIDS Charities. *Significant events in the late 1990s include singing at the White House during the holiday season, singing and dancing at the Super Bowl pre-game show, and singing at San Diego Padres games. *In the Summer of 2004, the Chorus made its international debut by performing at the GALA Choruses international choral festival in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in front of thousands of spectators from around the world. *In the fall of 2005, the Chorus moved into a new permanent performance home, the refurbished 730-seat Birch North Park Theatre. The Chorus operated from an office suite on the second floor of the 1930s building for several years. *In April 2006, the Chorus presented 20/20 Reflections, a celebration of music from its two-decade past. And in October 2006, the Chorus became the first gay chorus to be featured as mainstage entertainment on a major oceanliner when it presented \\"On the Good Ship...\\" on the Diamond Princess operated by Princess Cruises for a manifest 2,600 of passengers. *In April 2008, the Chorus was the first choral ensemble to perform in the newly renovated Balboa Theatre, operated by the San Diego Civic Theatre, and restored to its 1924 glory after a $20+ million-dollar renovation. The Chorus welcomed American Idol and Broadway star Frenchie Davis for this inaugural performance. *The Chorus has performed with such luminaries as Carol Channing, Barry Manilow, Nichelle Nichols, and the Grammy-nominated Westwind Brass.  Giving Back  right Throughout its history, the San Diego Men's Chorus has made donations of concerts, concert tickets, and money to organizations such as San Diego AIDS Foundation, Auntie Helen's Fluff-n-Fold, Mama's Kitchen, Special Delivery, Human Rights National Committee, Creative Response, San Diego American Indian Health Center, San Diego Hospice, Being Alive-San Diego, Fraternity House, and Positively Speaking. The annual Pride benefit concert performed along with other San Diego area gay & lesbian musical organizations was an enduring tradition for many years. In June 2007, the Chorus teamed up with the San Diego Chorus of Sweet Adelines International to present \\"Sing for the Cure,\\" a song cycle chronicling the struggle and survival of breast cancer survivors. The performance included an all-volunteer orchestra and featured celebrity narrator Nichelle Nichols, star of the original \\"Star Trek.\\" The performance was a benefit for the local chapter of Komen for the Cure. The Chorus initiated a \\"Youth & Arts\\" program in Fall 2007, and hosted San Diego County high school students for free music workshops and a preview of its holiday concert, with the assistance of major contributor Qualcomm. The workshops were presented in conjunction with Westwind Brass.  The End of a Legacy  In January 2010, The San Diego Men's Chorus formally merged with The Gay Men's Chorus of San Diego, forming a new performing arts entity titled the San Diego Gay Men's Chorus. Each of the two 'legacy' choruses participated under their separate names in a joint holiday concert at San Diego's Balboa Theatre in December 2009. Subsequently, they have been performing as a combined unit under the new name. References  External links  *The San Diego Gay Men's Chorus www.sdgmc.org *GALA Choruses, Inc.

He played college football at Chadron State and was signed by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent in 2008. He also played for the New England Patriots, San Diego Chargers and Baltimore Ravens. Woodhead set several NCAA college football rushing records, including the single season rushing and all-time rushing records. In 2006 and 2007, he won the Harlon Hill Trophy, awarded to the best player in NCAA Division II, making him the third player to win the trophy twice in its history (the other players are Johnny Bailey and Dusty Bonner). On October 6, 2007, Woodhead became the NCAA all-time, all-division leading rusher. Woodhead held this record until it was broken by Mount Union running back Nate Kmic on December 13, 2008. With the Patriots, Woodhead made his lone Super Bowl appearance in 2011. He finished the game with four catches for 42 yards and a touchdown while rushing seven times for 18 yards, but the Patriots fell to the New York Giants 21-17. Early years Woodhead played football at North Platte High School in North Platte, Nebraska, and broke many records. North Platte reached the state finals in 2001, with Woodhead's help after beating Millard North High School team 24‚Äì21. Woodhead blocked a field goal attempt late in the fourth quarter to give North Platte possession with only minutes left. North Platte's Ben Woodhead, Woodhead's older brother, threw a pass down field to set up a game- winning field goal by Jake McCarthy. However, North Platte went on to lose the state championship 28‚Äì14 to Millard West High School. In Woodhead's junior season, his team went 8‚Äì1 in the regular season, and won two games in the playoffs before falling to Millard North in the semifinals. In Woodhead's senior season, North Platte had its first undefeated regular season in 40 years, going 9‚Äì0. The team went on to beat Omaha North High School in the first round of the playoffs, Bellevue East in the second round, and finally lost to Millard North 21‚Äì7 in the semifinals for the second year in a row. Woodhead finished as Nebraska's Class A leading rusher, as well as Nebraska's Class A all-time leading rusher with 4,891 yards (2000‚Äì2003). North Platte High's quarterback that year, Derek Enderle, also finished as the state's leading passer. This marked the first time in North Platte's history that the football team finished with the state's leading passer and rusher in the same season. In addition to being a star in football, Woodhead was also a four-year letterman that set school or state records in three other sports; in track & field, he broke the school record after sprinting a blistering 10.5 seconds in the 100-meter dash; in basketball, he once scored 47 points in a game; in soccer, he netted 16 goals in a season.http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/patriots-danny- woodhead-beating-odds-life-beat-team-article-1.454157 College career In 2004, Woodhead began attending Chadron State College in Chadron, Nebraska, where he rushed for 1,840 yards as a true freshman. Woodhead was the first recipient of a full athletic scholarship at Chadron State in its 96-year history. In 2005, Woodhead carried the ball 278 times for 1,769 yards, averaging 6.4 yards per carry, and 21 touchdowns. He also had 30 receptions for 367 yards, averaging 12.2 yards per reception. In 2006, through 12 games, Woodhead rushed for 2,740 yards, a new all-division single season rushing record, surpassing Kavin Gaillaird. Including the playoffs, his rushing yards in 2006 totaled 2,756. He also led his team to the NCAA Division II playoffs in 2006, losing to Northwest Missouri State. Northwest Missouri State managed to hold Woodhead to a season low 16 yards rushing on 16 carries while giving up 79 yards receiving, which was more than double anyone on the Northwest Missouri team. Chadron also had 327 yards of total offense compared to Northwest Missouri State's 306. Through 39 games, Woodhead's 606 points equated to 15.5 points a game, the highest ever in NCAA Division II. Only Dan Pugh of Mount Union College, a Division III school in Ohio, with 248 points in 2002 and Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State with 234 in 1988, had ever scored more points in a season than Woodhead scored in 2006. However, in 2007 Abilene Christian University's Bernard Scott broke Woodhead's Division II record by scoring 39 touchdowns (234 points). Woodhead accumulated 7,441 yards on the ground, for his career, giving him a career average of 190.8 yards per game. He rushed for more than 200 yards in 19 of his 39 appearances and scored in 37 consecutive games, both of which are NCAA all-division records. After a 208-yard game against Western New Mexico in 2007, he became college football's all-time leading rusher, breaking the record previously held by R.J. Bowers, who played for Grove City College, a Division III school in Pennsylvania from 1997‚Äì2000. Woodhead is also just the sixth NCAA Division II player to rush for more than 1,000 yards in four seasons. He has also recorded 9,259 all-purpose yards, which ranks second on the NCAA all-time list. Brian Westbrook (Villanova, 1997‚Äì2001) currently holds the record with 9,512 total yards of offense. Woodhead is also tied with Germaine Race (Pittsburg State 2003‚Äì2006) for first place in Division II in career scoring with 654 points on 109 touchdowns. Woodhead is only the second player in collegiate history to score more than 100 touchdowns. Barry Sanders is the only college player to accumulate more all-purpose yards than the 3,159 that Woodhead gained in 2006, as he gained 3,250 as a junior at Oklahoma State University in 1988, when he won the Heisman Trophy. Woodhead ranked 10th in Division-II in career all- purpose yards with 7,349 after his junior season. The Division-II leader is Brian Shay of Emporia State with 9,301 yards, including 1,207 on kickoff returns, 1995‚Äì1998. Woodhead was a Harlon Hill Trophy candidate in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, winning the award in both 2006 and 2007. When interviewed, Woodhead stated that Nebraska never showed much interest in him and that he wanted to go somewhere where he was wanted. Chadron State showed a lot of interest in him, which is where he ended up. While at Chadron State, he majored in math education. Professional career Woodhead did not receive an invite to the NFL Scouting Combine, so he had to use his pro day to show his abilities. According to a report on NFLDraftWatch.net, he ran the 40-yard dash in times of 4.33 to 4.38 seconds, which would have been the second-fastest among all running backs at the NFL Combine in March 2008. He posted the best pro-agility time of 4.03 seconds, the second-best vertical jump (38¬Ω inches) and the best 60-yard shuttle time (11.2 seconds).

Kaul was born on August 1884 in Habbakadal, a city in Srinagar into a Kashmiri Pandit family. His father, Lakshman Pandit, was indifferent to his formal education and Kaul had to face many difficulties in his life. He was a school teacher for a long time. After that, he worked as a clerk.

In addition to serving the New York City metropolitan area, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, in May 2014, NYBC merged its operations with Community Blood Center of Greater Kansas City (CBC). In February 2016, NYBC and CBC announced the creation of the Kansas City-based National Center for Blood Group Genomics, a new laboratory that will focus on precision testing of blood donor samples. NYBC maintains close relationships with both New York City's Police Department (NYPD) and Fire Department (FDNY). Among NYBC's largest donor groups is the NYPD, which donated more than 11,000 pints of blood through November 2015. At the same time, the FDNY participates with NYBC in the \\"Be The Match Program\\" operated by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). More than 8,000 FDNY members are on the potential donor list, and 179 members have already given this life saving gift to those in need. FDNY members represent more than 10% of all NYBC bone marrow donors. Each year, at an annual induction ceremony hosted by FDNY and NYBC at FDNY headquarters, donors and their recipients meet for the first time. In 2016, Firefighter Mike Wilson was introduced to a recipient from Erie, Pennsylvania, who received his lifesaving bone marrow to treat her acute myeloid leukemia (AML), while Firefighter Frank Perdue met a recipient diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia, a rare chronic blood disorder. In 2015, firefighter Michael McCauley of Staten Island met his recipient, a United States Marine Sergeant who saw combat in Iraq, and who was subsequently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through FDNY‚Äôs participation in NYBC‚Äôs program, McCauley‚Äôs bone marrow is credited with saving the recipient's life. NYBC houses Lindsley F. Kimball Research Institute and the Howard P. Milstein National Cord Blood Center, a public cord blood bank named after board member Howard Milstein. The National Cord Blood Program (NCBP), directed by Dr. Pablo Rubinstein, is the oldest and largest in the world. In August 2015, the NCBP announced a new collaboration with the University of California, Davis Health System to manufacture specialized lines of highly adaptable stem cells for potential new therapies for diseases that include anemia, leukemia, lymphoma, sickle cell disease and severe combined immunodeficiency. The Lindsley F. Kimball Research Institute (LFKRI) has been awarded grants to conduct research in such areas as epidemiology and the development of HIV self-testing interventions, cellular therapy and transfusion medicine, in vitro platelet production, blood genomics, immunology, the development of infectious disease screening techniques and preventions for diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.  History  In 2013, LFKRI was awarded a Grand Challenges Explorations Grant from a grant initiative engaging field leaders in global health to bring progress to targeted world problems. The Grand Challenges Explorations Grant was launched by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2007. The LFKRI used grant money to study the transmission of parasites from Filarial Worm larvae to humans in order to develop a preventative drug to kill mature worms and prevent parasitic infection. In 2014, the New York Blood Center's National Cord Blood Program (NCBP) at the Howard P. Milstein Cord Blood Center received the Prix Galien USA ‚ÄúBest Biotechnology Product‚Äù distinction for the development of HEMACORD, an innovative hematopoietic stem cell product and the first of its kind to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In August 2016, NYBC also combined operations with Innovative Blood Resources, a blood center with operations in Minnesota and Nebraska. LFKRI also oversaw a clinical trial of Immucor‚Äôs PreciseType HEA test, resulting in the approval of the product by the FDA in October 2016. The PreciseType HEA test screens blood donors for sickle cell trait (SCT), an inherited blood disorder that affects 1 million to 3 million Americans, including 8-10% of African Americans. PreciseType HEA is the only FDA-approved molecular test that provides clinicians and blood banks with detailed genetic matching information. Through its work with cord blood, stem cells and sickle cell treatments, NYBC is a leader in precision medicine, which takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle to more accurately match treatments to individual patients. Rhode Island Blood Center, Providence In 2019, New York Blood Center merged with the Rhode Island Blood Center (RIBC). The latter continues to do business as the Rhode Island Blood Center.

Primate research in Liberia  For a thirty-year period starting in the mid-1970s, the NYBC conducted research experiments on a group of chimpanzees in Liberia. At the time, such primate testing was considered a standard part of medical research and drug development, reaching its peak in the early 1970s. After the studies were complete, NYBC moved the survivors onto six islands on the Farmington River. According to The New York Times, an NYBC employee stated at the time that NYBC recognized a responsibility for the lifetime care of the chimps, but NYBC disputes this, stating that its employee's comment was not authorized. The Times also noted that the quote in question was published in an article seeking financial support from a foundation for the care of the chimpanzees. The chimpanzees are owned by the Liberian government: NYBC voluntarily supported the chimps for seven years after its relationship with the Liberian government ended. NYBC argues that it spent millions on the chimps since the mid-2000s and \\"repeatedly\\" reached out to the Liberian government and animal rights groups \\"in an attempt to assist in a long term solution\\" but was ignored. In order to keep the chimps alive, locals who had been employed by NYBC to deliver food and water began to care for them on a volunteer basis. With virtually no resources and burdened by an Ebola outbreak, these volunteers kept the chimpanzees alive until a Humane Society of the United States (HSUS)-led coalition of over 30 animal conservation groups raised funds from the public to pay for the chimps' care on an emergency basis. According to NBC's Today Show, NYBC held discussion with HSUS that ended unsuccessfully in the summer of 2016, but NYBC is open to partnering with other organizations. NYBC maintains they were confronted with requests that \\"have nothing to do with NYBC's original involvement in Liberia,\\" which involved research \\"essential to the development of a hepatitis vaccine.\\" In June 2015, activist groups in New York launched a campaign to demand that the NYBC reinstate funding for the chimpanzees. The campaign consists of protests at the homes of board members and major donors who have refused to engage with the advocacy community. According to NBC News, the campaign has led to threats and social media campaigns that NYBC says have personally threatened their employees over the issue. On March 31, 2016, Citigroup, a former NYBC donor, issued a public statement asserting that \\"the situation is not tolerable\\" and made a $50,000 contribution to HSUS. On May 19, New York State Senator Tony Avella and New York State Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal held a press conference at New York City Hall to demand that NYBC fulfill its promise to provide lifelong care for the chimpanzees.

In her childhood, she was raised in her father's royal household under Katherine Swynford, whom she held in high regard. She grew up a headstrong and spirited young woman compared to her more serious elder sister. Marriages First marriage On 24 June 1380, at Kenilworth Castle, she married John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. She was seventeen years old and the groom was only eight.Weir, Alison. Katherine Swynford. London, 2008. pg.163 She was transferred to another household befitting her new rank as Countess of Pembroke. However, six years later, the marriage between Elizabeth and young Hastings was annulled. Second marriage By the age of 23, Elizabeth had tired of her 14-year-old husband. It is said that she had also been seduced by her cousin Richard II of England's half-brother John Holland, a known schemer, and had become pregnant by him.Weir, Katherine Swynford. pg. 200 This forced her father to have her marriage annulled, and on 24 June 1386, at Plymouth, she hastily married Holland. Her father dealt with her leniently and favoured his new son-in-law, such was Holland's charm. Third marriage Holland, now bearing the title Duke of Exeter, was executed in 1400 for conspiring during the Epiphany Rising against his cousin, Elizabeth's brother Henry IV of England, who had by this time usurped the throne from Richard II. That same year, Elizabeth married Sir John Cornwall, 1st Baron Fanhope and Milbroke. Her marriage to Sir John caused some scandal, since Sir John failed to ask her brother for permission to marry Elizabeth. This resulted in Sir John's arrest. However, the marriage is said to have been a happy and loving oneBarker, Juliet. Agincourt. London, 2005. pg. 152 and they went on to have two children together, Constance and John.

Career  yalƒ±) in Kandilli, Boƒüazi√ßi, ƒ∞stanbul, acquired in 1840 and largely extended by the Pasha and owned today by his descendants His uncle was in charge of Mahmud II's private treasury, secured him for palace service while he was young, and he then entered the Hassa regiment (1833‚Äì1834). He then studied abroad, in France, at the Sultan's expense. He served in a military capacity, as serasker, in Acre (1844‚Äì1845), Jerusalem (1845‚Äì1847; during which time he suppressed a serious Bedouin revolt), Tirnova (1847), and then Belgrade (1847‚Äì1848). During this period, many rumours circulated about his mismanagement practices, but they were dismissed by the Sultan as gossip. He was appointed as a vizier in 1848. In 1850‚Äì51, Mehmed Emin served as governor of the Eyalet of Aleppo, at the end of which he was appointed m√º≈üir (field marshal), in the province of Syria.Stanford J.Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Cambridge University Press, 1977 vol.2 p.70 His periods of administration were for the first term between 29 May and 23 November 1854, the second term between 18 November 1859 and 24 December 1859, and for the last term between 28 May 1860 and 6 August 1861. As such, he was also the last grand vizier under Abd√ºlmecid. Like many other prominent Ottoman statesmen of the Tanzimat period, Mehmed Emin Pasha rose from the Dragoman's office (), largely Turkified by the 19th century, and climbing through the foreign office of the Ottoman Empire, held consecutive ambassadorial and governorship posts. Mehmed Emin Pasha died in his yalƒ± in Kandilli, Istanbul, in 1871. After his death, his first wife, Melek Hanƒ±m, n√©e Marie Dejean (formerly the wife of Julius Michael Millingen), wrote her memoirs of the harem, in the 19th century context of that institution, as well as a controversial account of the high spheres of the Ottoman society, published in London in 1872, treating much the same period as the memoirs of Leyla Saz, written much later in the 1920s.

In this random draw, the true CDF (orange) is entirely contained within the DKW bounds. In the theory of probability and statistics, the Dvoretzky‚ÄìKiefer‚ÄìWolfowitz inequality bounds how close an empirically determined distribution function will be to the distribution function from which the empirical samples are drawn. It is named after Aryeh Dvoretzky, Jack Kiefer, and Jacob Wolfowitz, who in 1956 proved the inequality with an unspecified multiplicative constant C in front of the exponent on the right-hand side. In 1990, Pascal Massart proved the inequality with the sharp constant C = 2, confirming a conjecture due to Birnbaum and McCarty. The DKW inequality Given a natural number n, let X1, X2, ‚Ä¶, Xn be real-valued independent and identically distributed random variables with cumulative distribution function F(¬∑). Let Fn denote the associated empirical distribution function defined by : F_n(x) = \\\\frac1n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\\\\\{X_i\\\\leq x\\\\\\\\}},\\\\qquad x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. So F(x) is the probability that a single random variable X is smaller than x, and F_n(x) is the fraction of random variables that are smaller than x. The Dvoretzky‚ÄìKiefer‚ÄìWolfowitz inequality bounds the probability that the random function Fn differs from F by more than a given constant Œµ > 0 anywhere on the real line. More precisely, there is the one-sided estimate : \\\\Pr\\\\Bigl(\\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R} \\\\bigl(F_n(x) - F(x)\\\\bigr) > \\\\varepsilon \\\\Bigr) \\\\le e^{-2n\\\\varepsilon^2}\\\\qquad \\\\text{for every }\\\\varepsilon\\\\geq\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{1}{2n}\\\\ln2}, which also implies a two-sided estimate : \\\\Pr\\\\Bigl(\\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R} |F_n(x) - F(x)> \\\\varepsilon \\\\Bigr) \\\\le 2e^{-2n\\\\varepsilon^2}\\\\qquad \\\\text{for every }\\\\varepsilon>0. This strengthens the Glivenko‚ÄìCantelli theorem by quantifying the rate of convergence as n tends to infinity. It also estimates the tail probability of the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov statistic. The inequalities above follow from the case where F corresponds to be the uniform distribution on [0,1] in view of the fact that Fn has the same distributions as Gn(F) where Gn is the empirical distribution of U1, U2, ‚Ä¶, Un where these are independent and Uniform(0,1), and noting that : \\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R} |F_n(x) - F(x)\\\\; \\\\stackrel{d}{=} \\\\; \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R} G_n (F(x)) - F(x) \\\\le \\\\sup_{0 \\\\le t \\\\le 1} G_n (t) -t , with equality if and only if F is continuous. Building CDF bands The Dvoretzky‚ÄìKiefer‚ÄìWolfowitz inequality is one method for generating CDF-based confidence bounds and producing a confidence band. The purpose of this confidence interval is to contain the entire CDF at the specified confidence level, while alternative approaches attempt to only achieve the confidence level on each individual point which can allow for a tighter bound. The DKW bounds runs parallel to, and is equally above and below, the empirical CDF. The equally spaced confidence interval around the empirical CDF allows for different rates of violations across the support of the distribution. In particular, it is more common for a CDF to be outside of the CDF bound estimated using the DKW inequality near the median of the distribution than near the endpoints of the distribution. The interval that contains the true CDF, F(x), with probability 1-\\\\alpha is often specified as : F_n(x) - \\\\varepsilon \\\\le F(x) \\\\le F_n(x) + \\\\varepsilon \\\\; \\\\text{ where } \\\\varepsilon = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\ln{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\alpha}}}{2n}}.

Midkine is a basic heparin-binding growth factor of low molecular weight, and forms a family with pleiotrophin (NEGF1, 46% homologous with MK). It is a nonglycosylated protein, composed of two domains held by disulfide bridges. It is a developmentally important retinoic acid-responsive gene product strongly induced during mid- gestation, hence the name midkine. Restricted mainly to certain tissues in the normal adult, it is strongly induced during oncogenesis, inflammation and tissue repair. MK is pleiotropic, capable of exerting activities such as cell proliferation, cell migration, angiogenesis and fibrinolysis. A molecular complex containing receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase zeta (PTPŒ∂), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), anaplastic leukemia kinase (ALK) and syndecans is considered to be its receptor.  Role in cancer  MK appears to enhance the angiogenic and proliferative activities of cancer cells. The expression of MK (mRNA and protein expression) has been found to be elevated in multiple cancer types, such as neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, Wilms' tumors, thyroid papillary carcinomas, colorectal, liver, ovary, bladder, breast, lung, esophageal, stomach, and prostate cancers. Serum MK in normal individuals is usually less than 0.5-0.6 ng/ml, whereas patients with these malignancies have much higher levels than this. In some cases, these elevated levels of MK also indicate a poorer prognosis of the disease, such as in neuroblastoma, gliablastoma, and bladder carcinomas. In neuroblastoma, for example, the levels of MK are elevated about three times the level in Stage 4 of the cancer (one of the final stages) than they are in Stage 1. In neuroblastoma, MK has been found to be over expressed in the cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The resistance to chemotherapy seems to be reversible by administering chemo-resensitization drugs, such as verapamil, which acts not via MK alteration, but by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein pump that exports cytotoxins out of cells. Since chemotherapeutic drugs are cytotoxic, the drugs administered are also exported by this pump, rendering the chemotherapy ineffective. It has been found that when the neuroblastoma cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are grown in co-culture with the wild type (WT), or chemotherapy-sensitive cells, the resistance to chemotherapy is conferred to the wild type cells, and thus no cell death or senescence occurs in either cell type, despite the chemotherapeutic treatment. MK has been identified as one of the factors that \\"transfers\\" this chemoresistance from the resistant cells to the WT cells. MK is a secreted protein, and is therefore found in the microenvironment (media) of the resistant neuroblastoma cells. Following co-culture experiments and the determination that MK was one of the factors that was conferring chemo- resistance to the wild, non-resistant cell type, the gene for MK was transfected into WT cells to determine if MK was overexpressed in the WT cells themselves, would the cells become resistant to chemotherapy independent of resistant cell influence. The tests further confirmed that MK specifically increased chemotherapeutic resistance in the transfected WT-MK cells versus regular WT cells, confirming the specific chemoresistant properties of MK. In addition, the mechanism for such anti-apoptotic (anti-cell death) activity was studied, specifically using the chemotherapeutic Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) on osteosarcoma (Saos2) cells. Doxorubicin works by putting rampant cancer cells into a senescent state. MK, in WT-MK transfected cells versus WT cells, seemed to activate PKB (Akt), mTOR, and Bad protein, while it inactivated caspase-3. PKB, mTOR, and Bad are all elements associated with the cell cycle survival pathway, whereas caspase-3 is important in the apoptotic pathway (cell death). This indicates that MK caused the cells to initiate the survival pathway (via PKB, mTOR, and Bad activation) and inhibit the senescent or apoptotic pathway (via inhibiting caspase-3) encouraging the chemoresistance seen in resistant cells and in the co-culture experiments. The activation and inhibition of these particular factors clearly is maintaining the immortal quality inherent in cancer cells and specifically in the resistant cell types. Stat-3, however, which is another survival pathway factor, does not appear to have any change in activation between the wild type cells and the MK-transfected WT cells, as was initially believed from a previous study. MK may potentially be indirectly targeted as a cancer treatment as a result of its cancerous proliferation properties. Drugs by the name of anti-cancer aptamers have been created to inhibit to proteins involved in MK's cancer cell \\"activation\\". Specifically, the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) protein nucleolin has been targeted with an aptamer that would bind nucleolin and prevent MK from being transported into cancerous cell nuclei, preventing the protein from enhancing the cancerous properties of the cell.

His story is that he's spent many years on an obscure out-of-the-way planet and has found evidence that it once formed part of a now-lost Galactic Federation, based on psychology far more advanced than that now known. Based on his reports, a research group visits the planet to explore it. They discover documents that date back many thousands of years and make a small start in examining them. But Realo insists that the ancient psychologists of the Galactic Federation also set up a world of positronic robots for the purpose of letting them develop their own society and carry out their own research. Realo insists that he has been on this very planet, that the robot society still exists and that he let them examine his spaceship.

He was additionally Abbot-elect of Newbattle, Abbot of Dundrennan, nominal Bishop of Dunkeld, and also held the Abbey of Coupar Angus in commendam. Thomas was an illegitimate son of a Scottish lord, probably Sir John Livingston, baron of Callendar. He was born either in the year 1390 or in 1391. In his early twenties he became a student of the new University of St Andrews, graduating with an MA in 1415. Thomas remained there for a few years teaching in the Faculty of Arts before embarking on a career as a Cistercian monk. In 1422 he was elected Abbot of Newbattle, but failed to hold the position because the Pope had already chosen another man, David Croyse. While remaining a Newbattle monk, the following year Thomas entered the University of Cologne in order to become a Master of Theology, which he attained in 1425. Thomas also became a priest, in addition to remaining a monk. By 1429 at least Thomas was holding the position of Abbot of Dundrennan, but was suffering from severe sight problems. He appears to have obtained from the Pope a dispensation for his \\"defect of birth\\", being an illegitimate son, allowing him to remain in office. At this point in time Thomas joined the Council of Basel convoked by Pope Martin V. Thomas was able to advise King James I of Scotland on the issues and helped convince him to send a full delegation. Thomas became one of the most important men at the council and in 1439 it was Thomas, helped by the archdeacon of Metz, who delivered the council report in June which led to the deposition of Pope Eugene IV. In the following August, Thomas travelled to Mainz to attend the Imperial Diet, where he defended the council's decision to depose Eugene, and later became one of the men selected to choose a new Pope, Pope Felix IV/V (previously Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy). Thomas became one of the main supporters of the new pope, and was rewarded with a provision to the Bishopric of Dunkeld in November 1440. Although conciliarism looked doomed by the early 1440s, Thomas nevertheless remained an ardent conciliarist, and helped shape Scottish politics as an adviser during the minority of King James II of Scotland. In 1447 Pope Eugene died, and Livingston was one of the two Basel delegates who went to Vienna to attempt to persuade Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor to convoke a new council of the church. After the schism caused by the election of Antipope Felix V was finally healed in 1447, the blind Livingston turned his attention to promoting monastic reform, working alongside Cardinal Nikolaus von Kues (a friend of his from university) in the latter's mission in Germany (1451-2). He later returned to Scotland and resumed his role as an advisor to James II. Thomas was never bishop of Dunkeld in anything but name, so had no revenue, although King James did make him Abbot of Coupar Angus in commendam. Thomas died some time before 10 July 1460, at the age of seventy. References * Burns, J.

It was part of the Popular Unity coalition during the government of Salvador Allende. MAPU was repressed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In this period, some of its most radical members formed the Movimiento Juvenil Lautaro, whose leaders were political prisoners during the dictatorship and with the return to democracy. Another faction of the former members of the party joined the social democratic Party for Democracy in 1987. History MAPU was first formed as a splinter group of the Christian Democrat Party of Chile on May 19, 1969. At the time, Christian Democrats were in the government and many party members, especially among the youth, became critical of the party's policies that they regarded as pro-American and pro- imperialist. It joined the Unidad Popular coalition of Salvador Allende and participated in his government. The party's ideological line was not clearly defined at first. In fact, the party leaders were encouraged by Allende and Fidel Castro (whom the MAPU delegation met in 1972 when visiting Cuba) not to embrace Marxism officially, since there were such parties in Chile already, and the Unidad Popular coalition wished to claim a Christian Left niche, too (the newly founded Izquierda Cristiana was considered too small). During the Second Congress of the party, held in 1972, the forces led by √ìscar Guillermo Garret√≥n and Eduardo Aquevedo gained prominence. They adhered to Marxism- Leninism, had become more radicalized and oriented themselves towards non- aligned countries. A group of politicians (Chonchol, Rafael Agust√≠n Gumucio, Alberto Jerez y Julio Silva Solar) left to join the Izquierda Cristiana. On 7 March 1973, the MAPU split into two feuding groups: one organization, led by Oscar Guillermo Garret√≥n and Eduardo Aquevedo embraced Marxism-Leninism and militant leftist positions. This group was supported by the Socialist Party, the MIR and the Izquierda Cristiana. The other faction, led by Jaime Gazmuri and Enrique Correa criticized the former for ultraleftism and formed a new party, MAPU Obrero Campesino, that was close to PCCh and followed more moderate tactics.

The Prisoner of Chillon is a 392-line narrative poem by Lord Byron. Written in 1816, it chronicles the imprisonment of a Genevois monk, Fran√ßois Bonivard, from 1532 to 1536. Writing and publication On 22 June 1816, Lord Byron and his contemporary and friend Percy Bysshe Shelley were sailing on Lake Geneva (referred to as \\"Lac Leman\\", the French name, throughout the poem) and stopped to visit the Ch√¢teau de Chillon. After touring the castle (and walking through the dungeon in which Bonivard was imprisoned), Byron was inspired by Bonivard's story and composed The Sonnet of Chillon. Because of torrential rainfall, Byron and his companion rested at a hotel in Ouchy following their tour. In late June or early July (several early drafts and copies present conflicting dates), Byron composed the longer fable. The work was probably completed by 2 July 1816. The Prisoner of Chillon was first published as The Prisoner of Chillon and Other Poems by John Murray on 5 December 1816.  Structure  Ch√¢teau de Chillon, the castle to which the title refers, is located near Montreux, Switzerland. The work's themes and images follow those of a typical poem by Lord Byron: the protagonist is an isolated figure, and brings a strong will to bear against great sufferings. He seeks solace in the beauty of nature (especially in sections ten and thirteen), and is a martyr of sorts to the cause of liberty. Like much of Byron's work, it came about as a reaction to his own experiences as a traveller, making use of historical and geographical knowledge Byron gained in continental Europe. Byron titled his work The Prisoner of Chillon: a fable; stylistically, it is a romantic verse-tale. Concept Eug√®ne Delacroix, The Prisoner of Chillon The poem describes the trials of a lone survivor of a family who have been martyred. The character's father was burnt at the stake, and out of six brothers, two fell at the battlefield while one was burnt to death. The remaining three were sent to the castle of Chillon as prisoners, out of which two more died due to pining away. In time only the narrator lived.

Early days  Tucker was born in 1849 and grew up in the Lake District in England. Following in the footsteps of his family, he became an artist, exhibiting at the Royal Academy.  Church life  In 1879, Tucker became a mature student at the University of Oxford. This was unusual for an evangelical ordinand of his time, as by far the greater proportion of evangelical students went to Cambridge. In 1882, he was ordained curate in Bristol, then at St Nicholas' Church, Durham before being sent out in 1890 by the Church Mission Society to become the third bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa. He served in this position until 1899. That year, he became the Bishop of Uganda until 1908. Tucker's style was, notably for this era, one of working with the culture rather than trying to replace it with European attitudes. He was quoted in 1908 saying, \\"We are pretty convinced in our mind that we have everything to give and nothing to receive; everything to teach and nothing to learn; moreover we find it very difficult to believe that there is anything good in the pagan races of Africa.\\" He was very much in favour of native garb being used for clergy rather than European cassocks and robes. He argued for African churches to have autonomy, although he continually returned to England for more missionaries, possibly hoping for them to undertake support roles within the church structure rather than the leadership positions that they assumed. Tucker's approach to the evangelization of Uganda had three phases: conversion of individual African men; church planting; and finally, education.  Latter years  In 1911, Tucker returned to Durham where he spent his days as a canon of Durham Cathedral. He died in 1914 and was buried outside the cathedral, where a tall Celtic cross marks his grave. It stands in the raised area to the right of the main entrance path.  Bishop Tucker Theological College  In 1913, a year before Bishop Tucker's death, Uganda's first theological college was formed. On his death, it was named Bishop Tucker Theological College. In 1997, it became Uganda Christian University. In 2004, the University's theology faculty was named \\"The Bishop Tucker School of Divinity and Theology.\\"  Publications  *Tucker, Alfred.

Early life and career  Butler grew up in Ohio and majored in sociology at Kent State University. He was among a crowd of students fired on by the Ohio National Guard on May 4, 1970. Butler was active in the Kent, Ohio, music and art scene that also spawned The James Gang, Devo, and Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders. He appeared in several films by KSU's film professor Richard Myers and played guitar in the blues band City Lights with Jack Kidney. He followed Kidney into The Numbers Band, aka 15-60-75, founded by Jack's brother Robert Kidney, and played bass with them from 1975 to 1978. Butler was fired from the band for skipping a rehearsal to attend a photo session for his Waitresses band project, which were to be part of Stiff Records' \\"Akron: Shine On, America\\" compilation, which also included tracks by Tin Huey, Jane Aire & The Belvederes, Rachel Sweet, The Rubber City Rebels, The Bizarros and Chi-Pig.  1980s  In 1983, Butler went to Denmark and produced the second album by the punk/art band Sort Sol. Starting to get work as a producer, Butler had two cars break down on the Long Island Expressway commuting daily to Water Music Studios in Hoboken, New Jersey, during the recording of Scruffy The Cat's \\"Tiny Days\\" album (1987), and Joan Osborne's \\"Relish\\" EP.

In 2001, he released Kilopop!'s \\"Un Petit Go√ªter\\", a fictional European band's \\"Best Of\\". \\"I've always been a songwriter, and over the years I've been asked to write Waitress-y type tunes for other singers...but none of them were ever used. I had quite a pile of these, plus some fun co-writes lying around gathering dust...so I invented a fake European band that supposedly had had 'hits' with these tunes. I wanted to be a success in Europe, and since this didn't happen in reality, I decided to make it so in fantasy.\\" In 1987, Butler sold his musical gear, including \\"Bebe Blue\\", the Vox Teardrop electric guitar he used to record \\"Christmas Wrapping\\", to a Manhattan music store. More than 20 years later, the store's owners told him that the guitar's latest owner, a woman in Belgium, wanted to sell it to someone who could appreciate its significance.

Life  Arnimal was born in Palhalan during the eighteenth century. She married Munshi Bhawani Das, a poet from Rainawari and an erudite Persian scholar in the court of Jumma Khan, the Afghan Governor of Kashmir between 1788 and 1792.  Poetry  Arnimal followed in the wake of the tradition of her predecessor and made the love lyrics adopted by her predecessor Habba Khatoon more of a plaintive wail. Arnimal's lyrics are masterpieces of Kashmiri language. The word pictures of delicate sentiments drawn by her are so vivid, real and charming that very few Kashmiri poets have reached the standard set by her. Most of these lyrics have been set to music and are sung even now by Kashmiri minstrels with great interest and gusto. Arni Rang Gaum .....\\" is the most stunning one liner written in Kashmir poetry. Its capacity to imagery is unparalleled. One can think of Habba Khatoon‚Äôs Madan Varo Badan Zoltham‚Äù which can flood the sense with similar kind of imagery. But more of that later. Her husband Bhawani Das Kachroo was a more accomplished poet. But poetry is not only about accomplishments. In Arni's case poetry rose from the heart, got welled up in the breast and out came the pathetic gems of Kashmiri literature. In all types of poetry, feelings get converted to thought and thought by conversion to word. In Arin's case spoken word with feeling produced still effect and impact is heard more than two centuries after her death. Arni Rang Gom Shraavani hiyey Karyiye darshun divey. Shamosondran Paaman Laegis Aamataavae Kotah Gaejis Naama Paegam tas Kusniye Kar yiyey darshun diyej \\"All great literature‚Äù, wrote Albert Camus, ‚Äúis written in the silence of the heart‚Äù . In all probability, above song was created in silence. In an autumn breeze looking at the faded leaves, in a clear blue sky. In that moment of solitude and silence above vatsun was composed. Poetry is not mostly about thought. It is about feeling cherished in silence. Poetry is rupture of emotion. Poetry does not convey the universal truth. It highlights particular condition. Devastated by the separation from her husband, Arnimal sought solace in poetry. Aware that her husband was accomplished poet, she created her own to woo him back. In 18th Century Kashmir amidst the tyranny of Afghans and in the midst of bountiful Kashmir nature, life was hard and painful in her parents‚Äô home. She sought solace in nature or mixed nature to create poetic effect. Shamasondran Paaman Lagis. Amatavie Kotah Gaejis Arnimal does not give us philosophical teaching or inspired and complex religions sermons as in the case of Lal Ded. She highlights her condition with simplicity and charm. Her state is sad but creates powerful emotion to hide that sadness or creates poetry for solace. Kanda naabada aaradamtuy Phanda Karith tsolum kotuy Khanda Karinam Lookan thivey kar yivey darshan diyey. Arnimaal's poetry is sort of given up poetry. It is a poetry of disillusion told with beauty and simplicity. In that simplicity lies Arnimal's talent. She highlights her condition in simplest terms and in the process gives glimpse of 18th century Kashmiri women. But poetry is not only about accomplishments of 18th Century kashmiri women. Vuchhi Vesay Kahandi Bo Zaayas Baagani Aeyes Kahaanditam Doha Aki Mallmaaji Nagra Harshaayes Shaaharch Aesis Vastsis Gaam Sati Dohy Phheerit Maatine Anayaages Baagani Auyes Kahandi Taam Doha Aki Shreha Saan Maalyungayaayes Deka Baji Kaakani Dsitnam Paam Deka Reach Zeranuy Kona Moyaagyes Baagam Aayes Kahandi Taam. In the above vatsun. Arnimal talks of embarrassment and taunts she had to undergo in her parents‚Äô home. But disappointment is hidden under a cloak of poetic valour. She tells the story with degree of elan and thereby highlighting the tragic. It is not healthy to give translated version of her songs. As Voltarie has said don't think you have grasped the poetry by reading translation. Separated from her husband after only seven days after the marriage, Arnimal mixes passion for her estranged husband with a poetic imagery Raatas Osum Lava Zan Laerith Subahs Pravi Ketha Traerith Gom. Babri Tsaman Ashi Saganavith Aeshimot Kava Pashinaavitm Gom. Arnimal and Habba Khaaton are twin sisters of Kashmir Vatsun. They seem to have similar sort of image and feeling. They mirror each other in every respect. Both or they do not impose their poetry. Lal Ded is special because of power, punch she generates in her vaakhs. Arnimal and Habakhaaton are product of nature. They seldom rise above it as in the case of Lal Ded. In fact both Arnimal and Haba Khaatun are overwhelmed by nature. But rise at appropriate time in order not to drown. Both of them will float as long as there are hills and mountains in Kashmir. Or in the words of Arnimaal up to Sangar Maalan. Sulvothav Sungarmaalan. Lala Chhararon Kohan to Baalan. Through this piece is about Arnimal's Poetry one cannot resist the doubts raised by Muslim scholars about her existence. Such notions need to be waived with a degree of nonchalance. Suffice it to say her husband was a historical figure as a courtier in Afghan court. Besides who could have composed Arnimal's songs but by Arnimals herself ? Who could have created her anguished feeling? Who could have composed her sadness in poetic form? More importantly who could have faked her sincerity? It is not difficult to see that those who accept Lal Ded as Lalla Arifa now present that there was no Arnimal. Shakespeare's what is in a name‚Äù is not relevant in Kashmir context. It is everything in Kashmir. We end with what Keats has said which applies perfectly to Arnimal. ‚Äú Our Sweetest Songs are the saddest one‚Äù.

It extends for from an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in the Otsego County village of Richfield Springs to a junction with NY 29 in the Herkimer County village of Dolgeville. Midway between the two endpoints, NY 167 passes through the city of Little Falls, where it meets NY 5 and indirectly connects to the New York State Thruway by way of NY 169\\\\. Most of NY 167 is a two-lane rural highway; however, in Little Falls, NY 167 ranges in width from two to four lanes as it serves commercial and industrial sections of the city. The piece of NY 167 between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow, New York a small hamlet southwest of Little Falls, was originally part of an unsigned legislative route in the early 20th century. Farther north, the segment between Little Falls and Dolgeville was added to the legislative route system in 1910. In 1924, the Richfield Springs‚ÄìPaines Hollow route became part of NY 28; however, that route was altered as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to follow a new alignment to the west. NY 28's former routing between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow became part of the new NY 167, which continued north through Little Falls to Dolgeville as it does today. Route description  Richfield Springs to Little Falls  NY 167 begins at an intersection with US 20 (West Main Street) near the northern tip of Canadarago Lake in the village of Richfield Springs. The route proceeds north as a two- lane highway along Church Street, passing through the village's residential northern portion before leaving Richfield Springs and crossing the Otsego‚ÄìHerkimer county line just a half-mile (0.8 km) from the junction with US 20\\\\. The residential surroundings follow NY 167 into the town of Warren; however, they give way to more open, undeveloped areas as the route intersects Millstone Road (County Route 78 or CR 78, an unsigned number) about a half- mile (0.8 km) from the county line. From Millstone Road, the route winds northeast through Warren, traveling through increasingly rural areas as it serves the hamlet of Cullen and intersects Cullen and Hogsback roads (CR 183) in the center of the small community. NY 167 at CR 18 in Jordanville Past Cullen, NY 167 makes a gradual bend to the northeast, passing by a series of farms on its way to the hamlet of Jordanville. Here, the highway intersects with Jordanville Road (CR 18), an east‚Äìwest two-lane road that NY 167 briefly follows as it runs through the community. A short distance east of Jordanville, NY 167 splits from Jordanville Road to head northeast as a two- lane rural road. It intersects with country roads, such as Rock Hill Road (CR 135) and Robinson Road (CR 46) For the next , the route meanders across Warren, following an erratic northeasterly course across largely undeveloped areas to reach the rural hamlet of Paines Hollow, located at the junction of NY 167 and NY 168. After leaving Paines Hollow, NY 167 continues northeast into the town of Little Falls. The route remains rural through the town, intersecting with Johnny Cake and Oregon roads (CR 136 and CR 120, respectively) as it winds to the northeast. Just under from Paines Hollow, the highway briefly curves to the southeast ahead of a hairpin turn that leads northward to a junction with Newville Road (CR 45).  Little Falls to Dolgeville  NY 167 northbound at the junction with NY 168 in Paines Hollow NY 167 heads generally northward through Little Falls, veering to the east and west at various points as it traverses the town. About south of the city of Little Falls, the highway passes under the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90) with no connection to the road. After the Thruway overpass, NY 167 heads into a residential area surrounding its junction with NY 5S. The two routes briefly overlap before NY 167 turns north into a less populated, mostly wooded area along the southern bank of the Mohawk River (here part of the Erie Canal). NY 167 follows the river into an industrial section of the city of Little Falls, where it becomes Overhead Street and soon crosses the Mohawk via the Overhead Street Bridge. North of the river, the highway passes over NY 5 before intersecting Albany Street just west of downtown Little Falls. Albany Street is the eastbound half of a one-way couplet with nearby Main Street; as a result, the two directions of NY 167 split to follow different alignments through western Little Falls. From Overhead Street, northbound NY 167 turns east to follow Albany Street for two blocks to Little Falls' commercial center, where it intersects with southbound NY 169 at South Ann Street. NY 169 turns east here to follow Albany Street while NY 167 heads south along the two-way South Ann Street for one block to reach NY 5, a four-lane divided highway on the north bank of the Mohawk River. At this point, NY 167 northbound reconnects to the southbound route, which follows NY 5 west from South Ann Street to NY 5's junction with the west end of Albany Street. East of South Ann Street, both directions of NY 167 overlap with NY 5, following the four-lane road along the southern edge of downtown to a junction with East Main Street on the city's east side. NY 167 reconnects with NY 169 here, which leaves East Main Street to briefly follow NY 5 and NY 167 along the riverside arterial. The resulting overlap between NY 167 and NY 169 is a wrong-way concurrency, with NY 169 southbound overlapping NY 167 northbound and vice versa. NY 169 splits from the highway after just one block to proceed south across the Mohawk River while NY 5 and NY 167 remain concurrent to the eastern edge of the city. Here, NY 167 forks from NY 5, running east as a two-lane street through the undeveloped eastern fringe of Little Falls. The highway rises in elevation as it heads out of the Mohawk River valley and passes into the adjacent town of Manheim. Now known as Dolgeville Road, NY 167 heads northeastward through dense forests to the hamlet of Manheim Center, a small residential community from Little Falls. Here, the route connects to Dockey Road (CR 42). After leaving Manheim Center, the route becomes rural again, heading northward for several miles past farms, power lines, and the terminus of Snells Bush Road (CR 23). North of Snells Bush Road, NY 167 trends to the northeast, loosely paralleling East Canada Creek as it heads toward the village of Dolgeville as South Main Street. The rural areas along the route gradually give way to homes, which in turn lead to Dolgeville's central business district. In the center of Dolgeville, NY 167 runs alongside the creek for several blocks before ending at an intersection with NY 29 (State Street). History Two sections of what is now NY 167 were included as part of legislative routes when the New York State Legislature created a statewide legislative route system in 1908. From Richfield Springs to Paines Hollow, it was designated as part of Route 5, which continued southeast to Kingston via Oneonta and northwest to Mohawk. The section of what is now NY 167 north of Little Falls became part of Route 26, which ran from Little Falls to Remsen via Dolgeville. In 1910, Route 26 was realigned to follow a more direct routing between Little Falls and Remsen via Middleville and Poland. The former alignment of Route 26 between Little Falls and Dolgeville went unnumbered until March 1, 1921, when it became part of Route 37, which was extended southwestward from Dolgeville to Little Falls. The alignment of NY 167 follows the Paine's Hollow Road, constructed between Little Falls and Paines Hollow. This new road would shorten time between the two communities through Herkimer County. The Paine's Hollow Road opened on October 4, 1921, opening a new road through the dairy country of the Mohawk Valley. The new road had branch alignments toward Oneonta, Cooperstown and Richfield Springs. At 1 p.m. (1800 UTC) that day, a convoy of vehicles drove the route south from Little Falls, with a band on a large truck and a coach with six horses. When the group reached Paines Hollow, a ceremony was held, led by the president of the Little Falls Chamber of Commerce and H.P. Snyder, the local legislator for Herkimer County. The new section between Paines Hollow and Jordanville cost $123,136.25 (equivalent to $ in ) and was designated as State Highway 1363. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, most of legislative Route 5 north of Oneonta‚Äîincluding the section between Richfield Springs and Mohawk‚Äîbecame part of NY 28, which originally began in Oneonta and headed north through Richfield Springs and Mohawk before ending in Utica. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the section of NY 28 between Richfield Springs and Mohawk was moved onto a new highway to the west that went directly between the two locations. The portion of its former routing between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow became part of the new NY 167, which continued north from Paines Hollow to Dolgeville via Little Falls and old legislative Route 37. Realignments In June 2003, a project began to replace the bridge that carries NY 167 across the Erie Canal, Moss Island, Mohawk River, CSX Railroad, and NY 5 in Little Falls. On September 15, 2005, the new $17.4 million (equivalent to $ in ) bridge opened and replaced two deteriorated structures that were built in two phases from 1936 to 1962. The new bridge also eliminated a dangerous at-grade crossing at the CSX Railroad where low profile vehicles frequently got stuck. The bridge was dedicated to Dr. Bernard J. Burke, a local physician remembered for his total dedication to his patients and the community for over 35 years. The Lancaster Construction Company of Richmondville was the contractor of this project.

The Pacific kauri is one of the largest and fastest growing species in its genus, and is important in forestry.Agathis macrophylla was previously known as A. obtusa in Vanuatu and A. vitiensis in Fiji, but these are now regarded as 'non-preferred names' (Thompson 2006:2). Also now included in A. macrophylla is Agathis silbae of Santo Island, Vanuatu. Description Female cones of Agathis macrophyllaIt is a large evergreen tree, reaching 40 m in height and 3 m in diameter. It possesses the mottled, shedding bark that is characteristic of other kauri species. Young trees are narrow and conic in shape, but begin to grow a wider, deeper canopy after attaining a trunk diameter of 30‚Äì50 cm. In mature specimens, the trunk is generally straight or slightly tapered and clear for 15‚Äì20 m before branching into a spreading canopy up to 35 m in diameter. The root system is deep and strong, and the trees are highly wind resistant. The leaves are green and glossy, elliptical to lanceolate, 7‚Äì15 cm long and 2‚Äì4 cm wide. They are borne on short petioles and held in a decussate pairs, but twisted so they lie in one plane. Leaves in the shade, of juvenile trees, and of individuals growing in wetter regions, tend to be larger. Male cones of A. macrophylla are elliptical and measure roughly 2‚Äì5 cm long at pollen shed. The short pollen cones help distinguish this species from related Agathis species. Female (seed) cones are globular, 8‚Äì13 cm across, and are borne on short woody stalks. The majority of the cone crop matures early to mid February, as the cones turn brown and release the winged seeds, which are small, flattened, and attached to a wing about 3.5 cm in length. Wind dispersal is very efficient; seeds have been known to travel tens of kilometres in the wind, and may even travel hundreds of kilometres during the tropical cyclones that occur frequently in the species' range. Ecology Foliage of Agathis macrophylla'A. macrophylla is one of the largest trees in its range, and occurs as a dominant emergent tree in closed, humid, lowland-montane tropical forests. Associated plant species vary from location to location, but include Cryptocarya turbinata, Ilex vitiensis, Garcinia vitiensis, Palaquium spp., and Podocarpus spp. in Vanuatu, Calophyllum vitiense, Dacrydium nidulum, Retrophyllum vitiense, Fagraea berteroana, and Podocarpus spp. in Fiji. It is one of the fastest growing species in its genus, capable of growing 1-1.5 metres in height annually in lightly shaded to open areas, where growth is fastest. The species is fairly shade tolerant, especially in the seedling stage, though growth is slow under suppression. Strong root systems enable mature trees to withstand cyclones and seed rapidly into gaps. The species on the whole is long lived, capable of reaching ages of 300‚Äì1000 years. Uses A. macrophylla is a valued commercial timber species, and its wood is much sought after for many uses. The wood is a cream to gold colour (mature heartwood is a lustrous brown) and much appreciated in the timber industry, particularly as a surface veneer. The dry wood has a density of approximately 540 kg/m¬≥. Pacific kauri is a valuable tree throughout the southeastern Pacific (Melanesia). The timber is frequently used for house construction, canoe carving, and totem pole construction. Smoke from the resin is used as a black dye for hair, clothes and tattoos, and the leaves are used in traditional medicine.

For her illustration of children's books she has been a runner-up for the American Caldecott Medal three times and for the British Greenaway Medal once. Announced June 2015, her 1996 picture book Goose is the 2016 Phoenix Picture Book Award winner ‚Äì that is, named by the Children's Literature Association the best English-language children's picture book that did not win a major award when it was published twenty years earlier. Biography Bang was born in Princeton, New Jersey. Her education includes attendance at Wellesley College, reception of a Master of Arts degree from the University of Arizona (1969) and Harvard University (1970). Bang began writing children's books after a failed stint as a reporter for The Baltimore Sun. At first illustrating folk tales, she turned eventually to her own stories. The ability to carry emotion in pictures is of particular interest to her; her one book for adults, Picture This (1991) is specifically about the practical ways pictures work. Her wordless picture book The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher is notable for its use of negative space and the way Bang contrasts bright colors against grey. In the 2000s, Bang and her daughter Monika Bang- Campbell collaborated as illustrator and writer to create three picture books featuring Little Rat, a girl rat who learns with courage or practice to sail, to ride a horse, and to play the violin. She lives in California, after having lived for some time in Massachusetts.

It is found in tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean. It commonly preys upon shrimp, crabs, and clams, and displays unusual behavior including bipedal walking and tool use (gathering coconut shells and seashells and using these for shelter). Size and description The main body of the octopus is normally long and including the arms, approximately long. The octopus displays a typical color pattern with dark ramified lines similar to veins, usually with a yellow siphon. The arms are usually dark in color, with contrasting white suckers. In many color displays, a lighter trapezoidal area can be seen immediately below the eye. Behavior and habits Small (4-5 cm diameter) individual using a nut shell and clam shell as shelter The coconut octopus is found on sandy bottoms in bays or lagoons. It frequently buries itself in the sand with only its eyes uncovered. In March 2005, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, published an article in Science in which A. marginatus was reported to show bipedal locomotion. It is one of only two octopus species known to display such behavior, the other species being Abdopus aculeatus. The authors discovered this behavior in an area off Sulawesi, Indonesia, where the sandy bottom was littered with coconut shells.Sanders, Robert: Octopuses occasionally stroll around on two arms, UC Berkeley biologists report, University of California, Berkeley, March 24, 2005. The bipedal motion appears to mimic a floating coconut.Christine L. Huffard, Farnis Boneka, Robert J. Full: Underwater Bipedal Locomotion by Octopuses in Disguise, Science, March 25, 2005. Researchers from the Melbourne Museum in Australia claimed the coconut octopus uses tools for concealment and defense by gathering available debris to create a defensive fortress. This behavior was observed in individuals in Bali and North Sulawesi in Indonesia.. The researchers filmed the octopus collecting coconut half-shells discarded by humans from the sea floor. They were then carried up to and arranged around the body of the octopus to form a spherical hiding place similar to a clam- shell.

The fair was conducted by the City of Stockholm and the Svenska Sl√∂jdf√∂reningen (which has evolved into the existing organization, Swedish Form) art society. The art historian and leader of the Svenska Sl√∂jdf√∂reningen, Gregor Paulsson, was the intellectual leader of the fair, inspired, after a visit to the 1927 Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart, to organize a similar event for Stockholm. It took place from May through September 1930, on the southern portion of the Djurg√•rden recreation area in eastern-central Stockholm, and entertained about four million visitors. Swedish artists, craftsmen and companies showed their latest products, particularly the glass producer Orrefors Glasbruk. Many of the available images were taken by the pioneering photographer W. Gustaf Cronquist, and were published by Swedish Form. The exhibition's slogan was: Acceptera!, or Accept!, literally a plea for acceptance of functionalism, standardization, and mass production as a cultural change. The effort to persuade Swedish citizens of the benefits of a modernized lifestyle included serving mass- produced food.  Architecture  The fair was significant in the history of architecture in Stockholm, firmly establishing functionalism as the dominant architectural style in Sweden. The two head architects were Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz. Through the 1920s Asplund had been one of the principal figures of the Neo-Classicist Swedish Grace style. But here, in 1930, Asplund's style takes a dramatic turn into stripped-down functionalism. Especially conspicuous was the Paradise Cafe and the Entry Pavilion, with its exposed steel frame, airy expanses of glass, and dramatically lit at night. Above the fair, a towering advertising mast stood with an electrically lit version of Lewerentz's \\"Flying V\\" logo. Le Corbusier had been invited to contribute to the fair, but declined. The fair also showcased new housing alternatives, bright and hygienic apartments with ample space for all members of the family. Swedish architects involved in the Housing Exhibition included Sven Markelius, Paul Hedqvist, Nils Ahrbom, Helge Zimdal, and Uno √Öhr√©n. Some critics found the architecture too crisp and cold to consider living with permanently. Three of the fair's architects were, in the following year, co- authors of the Acceptera! functionalist manifesto. Alvar Aalto, describing the exhibition for the Finnish press, wrote, \\"The exhibition speaks out for joyful and spontaneous everyday life. And consistently propagates a healthy and unpretentious lifestyle based on economic realities.\\"  Impact  All of the fair buildings were temporary. But the fair's ideas lived on and influenced the shape of Swedish housing for years to come. As early as 1931 one of the exhibition architects, Uno √Öhr√©n, won the commission of the terraced settlement in North √Ñngby in Bromma, and in the outskirts of Stockholm, Traneberg (1937‚Äì38) and Hammarbyh√∂jden (1938), all apartments for large families. All houses had central heating; all apartments had a private bath / toilet and running hot and cold water, a fully equipped kitchen and a balcony. Large windows let light and air into the flats, the stairwell, there was even a rubbish chute, an adjoining greenspace, and a playground. Villa √Ñngbyh√∂jden No.30, S√∂dra √Ñngby, constructed 1938 The largest and finest-preserved collection of early functionalist housing is the residential settlement S√∂dra √Ñngby, Bromma. S√∂dra √Ñngby consists of about 500 single-family homes during the years 1933 to 1939, all in the functionalist style. One of the earliest examples was the house architect Sven Markelius built for himself at Nockeby 1930‚Äì31. These housing districts were directly influenced by the 1930 fair, were designed by the same architects, and were built around cooperative Social Democrats values. Social housing was, in turn, were a significant element in the development of the Swedish idea of Folkhemmet. √Öhr√©n was to collaborate with the sociologist, reformer and Nobel Prize winner Gunnar Myrdal from 1932 though 1935 on a social housing commission, and in 1934 they co-authored The Housing Question as a Social Planning Problem, a work that would prove influential in the structuring of the Social Democratic Swedish society. Markelius and the Swedish reformer Alva Myrdal collaborated on a design for a 57-unit communal-living Collective House in the center of Stockholm, in 1935. and Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson, who coined the word Folkhemmet, himself moved into an √Öhr√©n-designed functionalist house in 1936.

It connects NY 7 to U.S. Route 20 (US 20) by way of the village of Delanson. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and has not been altered since. Route description NY 395 southbound at the junction with NY 7 in Quaker Street NY 395 begins at an intersection with NY 7 (Duanesburg Road), Darby Hill Road (unsigned County Route 133 or CR 133) and Schoharie Turnpike (CR 74) in the hamlet of Quaker Street in the town of Duanesburg. NY 395 proceeds north out of Quaker Street and through a residential section of Duanesburg, crossing a junction with East Shore Road (CR 80) before crossing into the village of Delanson. Now named Main Street, NY 395 crosses a railroad line into downtown Delanson as a two-lane residential street before turning northeast just north of Thousand Acres Road. NY 395 continues northeast through the village of Delanson, reaching a junction with Cole Road (CR 84). At this junction, NY 395 turns northward once again, paralleling the railroad line back into Duanesburg. After a bend to the northwest, the route passes the Delanson Reservoir and reaches an intersection with US 20 (Western Turnpike). The right-of-way and the designation of NY 395 both terminate at the intersection, east of the Schoharie County line. History On May 17, 1902, the state of New York let a contract to improve the section of modern NY 395 between Quaker Street and Delanson to state highway standards. The project cost $15,993 (equivalent to $ in ) and took roughly one year to complete. The improved road was added to the state highway system on July 1, 1903. By 1926, all of what is now NY 395 was state- maintained. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not have a posted route number were assigned one. One of these was the state highway running north‚Äìsouth through Delanson, which was designated as NY 395.

The association was a diverse group of people all with their own talents and skills. The goal of this group was to ‚Äúconnect a diverse group of friends in a critical examination of the city, in the collaborative development and dissemination of ideas, in political action and in city building projects‚Äù. Throughout the ten- year span in which the association lasted, five leading members contributed to this goal. Clarence Stein, Benton MacKaye, Lewis Mumford, Alexander Bing, and Henry Wright were the essential backbone of the RPAA. Originally an idea of Clarence Stein‚Äôs, through a series of introductions and acquaintances in Washington DC in 1918, the Regional Planning Association began to form. Founders  Clarence Stein  Clarence Stein attended the Ethical Culture Society‚Äôs Workingman‚Äôs School, which influenced his interest in the city life and social responsibility through its teaching. Stein was closely influenced by the founder of Ethical Culture, Felix Adler, and teacher, John Lovejoy Elliott, in involvement with movements and committees, such as the Hudson Guild Settlement House and the Progressive Reform movement in New York City at the turn-of-the-century. Therefore, Stein‚Äôs enrollment at Workingman‚Äôs School proved to be of strong influence on his later interests and achievements. The very principle of the Ethical Culture Society being ‚Äúthat an individual‚Äôs growth toward excellence comes from furthering the unlike excellence of others‚Äù, exemplifies the basis of Stein‚Äôs life achievements through the RPAA. Stein first met future fellow RPAA members, Henry Wright and Alexander Bing, in Washington (in 1918) through a friend, Charles Whitaker (editor of the JAIA). In 1920, Stein became the Associate Editor for Community Planning with the Journal of the American Institute of Architects and soon later discovered the idea to create the RPAA including his friends at the JAIA office, including Lewis Mumford, as well as many others. The group included members in various fields of study from architects to union leaders, city officials to writers, and engineers to sociologists. And so, on April 18, 1923, the first official meeting of the Regional Planning Association of America was held. The association began with only a total of eight people present at its first official meeting but it soon grew.  Benton MacKaye  The first major project of the RPAA was that of fellow RPAA member, Benton MacKaye; the Appalachian Trail, a trail which we would refer to today as a greenway, of which he wrote an article in the JAIA two years earlier (‚ÄúAn Appalachian Trail ‚Äì A Project in Regional Planning‚Äù). The trail was planned to connect a footpath from Maine to Georgia in an attempt to ‚Äúlead civilization to the wilderness‚Äù. The project was not directly implemented by the RPAA, however, their part was successful in introducing their idea to others and helping the various groups of Mountain Clubs come together to create the final project. The majority of the trail was completed by the mid-1930s. From this project came another main goal of the RPAA which was to create ‚Äúthe preservation of large areas of the natural environment, including parts of the wilderness, as a green matrix for shaping a ‚Äúregional city‚Äù and for serving its various-sized, spatially well defined, specialized communities‚Äù.  Lewis Mumford  The success in publicizing this project as well as others was in large part due to Lewis Mumford. Mumford was the RPAA‚Äôs leading journalist and spokesperson. Having published his first book in 1922, The Story of Utopia, and well on his way with another, Mumford was extremely useful to the association. He worked on not only books and articles related to the RPAA but also wrote/edited policy documents. Mumford also contributed to the group by sharing his interest of Patrick Geddes‚Äô ideas on regional development and planning. Mumford contributed concepts of ‚Äúa dispersed yet concentrated urban culture integrated with nature‚Äù which were integrated along with MacKaye‚Äôs concepts into the RPAA‚Äôs later projects.  Sunnyside and Radburn  The leading community building experiments conceptualized and implemented by the RPAA were Sunnyside Gardens, Queens and Radburn, New Jersey. Sunnyside started as a small-scale housing development experiment in Queens, New York. The goal was ‚Äúto produce good homes at as low a price as possible, to make the company‚Äôs investment safe, and to use the work of building and selling houses as a laboratory to work out better house and block plans and better methods of building‚Äù. Radburn, New Jersey, would be the new and improved built community utilizing the analysis from the Sunnyside community experiment. through not only his own real estate company and wealth but through his outstanding real estate and business skills. Bing, president of the RPAA, found the funds through outside contributions and personal contribution (more so than any other member) to support the projects of the association. For the Sunnyside community project Bing founded the City Housing Corporation through which he would establish the funding and opportunity to complete the project.  Henry Wright  Henry Wright, known as the analyst due to his never-ending questioning and analysis on projects, worked alongside Stein in site designs and development on such projects as Sunnyside, New York. Studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania along with work as a landscape architect and site planner, Wright shared many interests with Stein. Close work in 1923 on the Sunnyside Homes development with Stein led to a trip to England in 1924 to study the designs of Unwin and Parker as well as that of Ebeneezer Howard. Though close at the beginning of the association‚Äôs organization, Wright went on to establish ‚ÄúThe Housing Study Guild‚Äù along with several RPAA members which Stein viewed to work more independently than directly with the RPAA‚Äôs projects. This slight dispute would be the beginning point of the division and end of the Regional Planning Association of America. In 1933, many members began to move away and/or join various other movements or committees which quickly led to the association's end. Legacy The Regional Planning Association of America, led by Clarence Stein, Benton MacKaye, Lewis Mumford, Alexander Bing, Henry Wright, as well as many others started simply as a group of people with similar interests wanting to make a difference in the American towns and cities.

It may have originated as a handbook for novice monks composed from excerpts of canonical texts. History The KhuddakapƒÅ·π≠ha was excluded from the lists of canonical texts collected by the Theravada Digha- and Majjhima-bhanakas as well as the Chinese translation of Buddhaghosa's commentaries. This suggest that the KhuddakapƒÅ·π≠ha had not attained canonical status until relatively late in the process of fixing the Theravada canon, and may be one of the last texts added to the Canon itself. All but one of the discourses it collects are found elsewhere in the Pali Canon- the Nidhi Kanda is not extant in the current Pali Canon but does include text [Khp 8.9] quoted in the Abhidhamma Pitaka's Kathavatthu [Kv 351,18-21].) It may have originated as a handbook for novices composed from excerpts from the canon, and was accepted as canonical because it consisted of texts that were already part of the Canon. The KhuddakapƒÅ·π≠ha is not widely used or studied in modern Theravada countries, but several of its texts are included in a common Paritta collection (the Maha Pirit Potha), suggesting that this collection originated with the KhuddakapƒÅ·π≠ha or a precursor text.

His best known acting role was the title role in the crime drama TV series Bluey playing the title role. Early life and career  Born in Hobart, Tasmania, Grills was best known for portraying the title role of unconventional detective \\"Bluey\\" Hills in the television series Bluey in 1976. Prior to Bluey, he worked as a stand-up comic in the Sydney clubs.TV Week magazine - \\"Bluey - TV's New Two-Fisted Cop\\" by Eric Scott, 3 April 1976 pages 20 & 56. He would change his material to suit his audience, stating: \\"Some people know me as the dirtiest comic in the business... but others know me as a man who never drops even a mild four- letter word.\\" One time in Adelaide, Grills had done a show and needed to get a taxi. He had put on a big houndstooth-checked sports jacket and carrying a suitcase. The taxi driver looked at him and asked where he had been wrestling. Lucky had to set him straight and let him know he wasn't a wrestler but a comic. For the rest of the journey, Grills had to listen to the cabbie telling old jokes. He also did three hundred weeks in a migrant education programme called \\"You say the Word\\" where he played the owner of a factory. \\"It was designed to show newcomers to Australia how things were done and to teach them English\\", he explained. Prior to Bluey, he played other parts in Crawford shows but \\"oddly enough, despite my bulk and appearance, never once have I been asked to play a heavy\\". It was a guest role in one of those shows - Matlock Police - that brought him to the attention of producers for the role of Bluey. He was sent a script page, read it and duly went to the audition. Within ten days he knew he had the part. He was reintroduced to a younger generation in a recurring segment of the early-1990s comedy series The Late Show called Bargearse, a humorous re-dub of Bluey. Grills also made three in- person appearances on the show, including singing as a member of a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young parody band and in character as Bluey protesting the last episode of Bargearse. Honours  He was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in the 2000 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to the entertainment industry and the arts. He was also awarded the O.A.M. (Order of Australia Medal) in the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours List for his services to the entertainment industry through charitable organisations., 19 April 2011 Death  Grills died in his sleep in Queensland.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. action thriller film directed by Burt Reynolds, who stars in the title role. It is an adaptation of William Diehl's first novel Sharky's Machine (1978) with a screenplay by Gerald Di Pego. It also stars Vittorio Gassman, Brian Keith, Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Bernie Casey, Henry Silva, Darryl Hickman, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward and Joseph Mascolo. The film was released by Warner Bros. on December 18, 1981, and received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ward was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year ‚Äì Actress. Plot Tom Sharky, a narcotics sergeant for the Atlanta Police Department, is working on a transaction with a drug dealer called Highball. Another member of the force, Smiley, shows up unexpectedly during the sting, causing the drug dealer to run and Sharky to give chase, ultimately shooting the suspect on a MARTA bus, but only after the wounding of the bus driver. In the aftermath, Sharky is demoted to the vice squad, which is considered the least desirable assignment in the police department. In the depths of the vice-squad division, led by Friscoe, the arrest of small-time hooker Mabel results in the accidental discovery of a high-class prostitution ring that includes a beautiful escort named Dominoe, who charges $1,000 a night. Sharky and his new partners begin a surveillance of her apartment and discover that Dominoe is having a relationship with Hotchkins, a candidate running for governor of Georgia. With a team of downtrodden fellow investigators that includes veteran Papa, Arch, and surveillance man Nosh, referred to by Friscoe sarcastically as Sharky's \\"machine\\", he sets out to find where the trail leads. During one of the stakeouts, a mysterious crime kingpin known as Victor comes to Dominoe's apartment. He has been controlling her life since she was a young girl, but now she wants out. Victor agrees, but forces her to have sex with him one last time. The next day, Sharky witnesses Dominoe being killed by a shotgun blast through her front door, killing her and disfiguring her face beyond recognition. Sharky has privately been developing feelings for her while viewing her through binoculars and listening to her bugged conversations. The man who shot her, known as Billy Score, is a drug addict and Victor's brother. He answers to Victor, as does Hotchkins, who is in love with Dominoe, but remains a powerless political stooge under Victor's rule. Dominoe suddenly turns up, to Sharky's surprise, and is told that her friend Tiffany used her apartment and is the one who was mistakenly shot by Billy Score. Dominoe is convinced that if Victor wants her dead, she is going to be dead, but reluctantly leaves with Sharky to be hidden away at his childhood home in the West End neighborhood. Meanwhile, Nosh informs Sharky that most of the surveillance tapes have disappeared from the police station, leaving both of them wondering if the investigation has been compromised. Nosh is then confronted by Billy Score, who kills him off-screen. Sharky confronts Victor at his penthouse apartment in the Westin Peachtree Plaza, and vows to bring him to justice. Victor smugly tells Sharky that Dominoe is dead and cannot testify against him, but is stunned to be told by Sharky that she is still alive. While attempting to find Nosh at his home, two men spring an attack on Sharky, and he is knocked out cold. He awakens on a boat, where he is held captive and tortured by Smiley, who turns out to be working for Victor. Smiley informs him of the killing of Sharky's old narcotics division boss JoJo (who was run over by a car), and reveals that Nosh is dead, as well. He cuts off two of Sharky's fingers while demanding to know where Dominoe can be found. Sharky attacks and shoots Smiley, and he manages to escape. Later, Sharky turns up with Dominoe at a Hotchkins political rally, to the candidate's considerable shock. Hotchkins is arrested and taken into custody, and Victor finds out about it on the evening newscasts. Billy Score, in an agitated state, shoots and kills Victor. Almost immediately, Sharky and other police officers arrive at Victor's penthouse in an attempt to catch Billy. He is pursued through the upper floors of the Westin, where like a ghostly apparition he appears and disappears, killing Papa and seriously wounding Arch. Billy ultimately is gunned down by Sharky, crashing through a window and plummeting to his death nearly 700 feet below. In the end, Sharky returns to his childhood home, where Dominoe is now living with him.

Diehl, who was 50 when he wrote the novel, saw the movie shot on location in and around his hometown of Atlanta. El Mongol played the part of the limo driver in the film. Reynolds talked about his directing: > Most directors cast actors on the basis of what they've seen before, and > they don't want surprises; they want the actor to give another version of > what he's already done. I try to do the opposite. I tell the actors, 'You've > done that before, so let's go for something else.'

There really was a wonderful feeling of camaraderie. \\"In my picture the good guys win and the bad guys, the dopers, lose,\\" said Reynolds. \\"That's important to me: I don't like dopers. I get mad as hell when I hear that studios are coddling actors who are always high on cocaine.\\" Music The opening credits use the 1979 hit song \\"Street Life\\", originally performed by The Crusaders with vocalist Randy Crawford. The recording in the film is a newer version (song length ~4:17) orchestrated by Doc Severinsen, inviting Crawford to reprise her vocal and who composed the original score, as well. This version is a much more powerful and faster-paced version with a full orchestra, and it was the one that Quentin Tarantino included in Jackie Brown (1997) (Crawford is given the only credit on the song title). As was standard for the time, little of Severinsen's score is included on the album, with many of his contributions being heavily edited for the album tracks and several, like his version of \\"My Funny Valentine\\", being omitted altogether. The soundtrack album has been re-released after more than 30 years on the Var√®se Sarabande label.Sharky's Machine original soundtrack, film credits  Soundtrack  The Sharky's Machine original motion picture soundtrack contained these tracks: # \\"Street Life\\" - Randy Crawford # \\"Dope Bust\\" - Flora Purim and Buddy De Franco # \\"Route 66\\" - The Manhattan Transfer # \\"My Funny Valentine\\" - Chet Baker # \\"High Energy\\" - Doc Severinsen # \\"Love Theme From Sharky's Machine\\" - Sarah Vaughan # \\"8 To 5 I Lose\\" - Joe Williams # \\"My Funny Valentine\\" - Julie London # \\"Sexercise\\" - Doc Severinsen # \\"Let's Keep Dancing\\" - Peggy Lee # \\"Sharky's Theme\\" - Eddie Harris # \\"Before You\\" - Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams  Reception  Critical reception The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. As of December 2019, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of 22 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.06 out of 10. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing that \\"'Sharky‚Äôs Machine' contains all of the ingredients of a tough, violent, cynical big-city cop movie, but what makes it intriguing is the way the Burt Reynolds ... plays against those conventions.... The result of his ambition and restraint is a movie much more interesting than most cop thrillers.\\"Ebert, Roger. \\"Sharky's Machine,\\" Roger Ebert.com (Jan. 1, 1981). Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, \\"Burt Reynolds establishes himself as yet another movie star who is as valuable behind the camera as he is in front of it. Mr. Reynolds's third and best directorial effort ... is an unexpectedly accomplished cop thriller.\\" Variety noted, \\"Directing himself in 'Sharky's Machine,' Burt Reynolds has combined his own macho personality with what's popularly called mindless violence to come up with a seemingly guaranteed winner. Borrowing from buddy Clint Eastwood, Reynolds has already dubbed this one 'Dirty Harry Goes To Atlanta' and that's about as good a description as any.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Sharky's Machine\\". Variety. December 16, 1981. 16. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and lamented its \\"unfortunate split personality,\\" explaining, \\"Obviously, Reynolds decided to hedge his bets in the film and play some of it for laughs. That's too bad, because although 'Sharky's Machine' is miles ahead of such recent Reynolds' trash as 'Smokey and the Bandit II' and 'The Cannonball Run,' what Reynolds could use most in his career is a solid dramatic role in which he didn't leer at the audience.\\"Siskel, Gene (December 21, 1981). \\"Too bad: Burt's 'Sharky' gags on split personality\\".

The season one episode \\"Careers in Science\\" states that in 1987, on the space station Gargantua-1, a showing of the film was the scene of a massacre of the space station's crew, as an unknown figure in a spacesuit opened the bay doors sucking the entire crew into the void of space, killing them. In season seven's \\"Arrears in Science\\", Jonas Venture is shown putting a Sharky's Machine tape into a VCR to show the movie before the incident mentioned above.

University Academy serves approximately 1,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade who reside in the Kansas City Missouri School District (‚ÄúKCMSD‚Äù). Presently, over 95% of the student body is African- American and roughly 75% qualify for free or reduced lunch. As a charter public school, University Academy admits students on the basis of a random lottery drawn from a pool of applicants. All applicants must reside within the boundaries of the Kansas City Missouri School District. History In 1998, the Missouri Charter School Law was adopted by the Missouri House and Senate and signed into law by the Governor. The law created a path for citizens to come together to operate public schools, but only within the boundaries of the Kansas City Missouri and St. Louis School Districts. Under the law, Charter public schools may be authorized by the two school districts or by various public universities. University Academy was founded by Tom Bloch, Lynne Brown, and Barnett and Shirley Helzberg. The University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) is the school‚Äôs charter sponsor. The school opened its doors with grades 7th, 8th, and 9th in 2000, operating in a facility leased from UMKC located at 5605 Troost Avenue. In addition to providing University Academy the initial space for the school to operate and agreeing to sponsor the charter, UMKC has supported University Academy in many ways including providing an additional layer of oversight and guidance for both the board and administration. As a result of the support and generosity of University Academy‚Äôs board of directors and the Kansas City community, construction on a new 172,000 square foot facility began in 2004. When the new facility opened in August 2005, enrollment expanded from 300 students in grades 6-12 to roughly 1,000 students in Kindergarten through grade 12. In 2017, the US Department of Education named University Academy's Upper School a National Blue Ribbon School. This award is based on exemplary performance over the last 5 years and is considered the highest honor an American K-12 school can receive. Less than 1/3rd of 1% of the roughly 125,000 eligible K-12 schools receive this award in any year. University Academy is the first charter public school in Missouri and the only high school in Missouri in 2017 to receive this recognition. In 2017, University Academy also celebrated the opening of its new athletic complex with help from the NFL, Kansas City Chiefs, and LINC. Since University Academy started graduating seniors in 2004, 100% of its seniors have been accepted to 4 year colleges. In recent years, roughly 50% of University Academy seniors have received an acceptance from a Top 150 college or university as ranked by U.S. News & World Report. University Academy graduates who have been out of high school 6 years or longer have a college completion rate that is more than 5x the national average for students from lowest quartile income families.

Route description NY 406 heading through Rotterdam NY 406 begins at an intersection with US 20 (Western Turnpike) in the Princetown hamlet of Gifford. The route progresses eastbound past the Hillcrest Golf Club as Giffords Church Road, paralleling US 20 to the north until an intersection with Parkers Corners Road (County Route 60 or CR 60). There it turns northeast, intersecting with Windy Hill Road (CR 99), a north‚Äìsouth road leading to CR 60\\\\. NY 406 continues northeastward through farmlands, intersecting with Quackenbush Road (CR 62) on its way into the town of Rotterdam, where the route passes to the south of Schenectady Memorial Park in the hamlet of Pine Grove. The route ends just east of the park at a junction with NY 158 (Guilderland Avenue). History The origins of NY 406 date back to January 3, 1922, when the Schenectady County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution expressing the county's desire to have the state of New York reconstruct the road as a state highway. At the same time, the board withdrew the county's support for a state project to rebuild part of what is now NY 147 in order to offset the mileage gained by adding Giffords Church Road to the state highway system. The changes required the approval of the New York State Department of Highways, which rejected the proposal by January 11. Despite this fact, Giffords Church Road was taken over by the state of New York by 1926 and designated NY 406 at some point between 1933 and 1936.

Maier's \\"From Resistance to Revolution\\" and \\"American Scripture\\" were both required reading. In the 1990s, Maier was a charter member of \\"The Historical Society\\" group among American Historical Association membership who were concerned about restrictive 'political correctness' and collegial civility. ‚ÄúBoston Globe, Oct 16, 1998‚Äù Its intent was to \\"illuminate rather than polarize the study of history\\", see ‚ÄúThe Historical Society purpose‚Äù They found a home at Boston University which hosts their webpage at ‚ÄúThe Historical Society‚Äù. The dual membership group was founded by Eugene Genovese (Atlanta U.), Stephen A. Schuker (UVA), and Donald Kagan (Yale). One explicit goal was to enlarge treatment of diplomatic and military history. The Times (London) Literary Supplement (‚ÄúTLS 08 Dec 2000‚Äù) called their journal, \\"history as it should be ‚Ä¶ serious attention ‚Ä¶ to serious subjects\\". Another reviewer, a former AHA President, called it \\"‚Ä¶ the New York Review of Books for history\\", see ‚ÄúTHS webpage‚Äù. For the AHA reaction, see ‚ÄúPerspectives, Sep 1998‚Äù. A non-tenured AHA member spoke to age differences, generalists, hierarchies, and concluded that both the AHA and the THS leadership were alike, short-changing young faculty with teaching challenges, where their part time positions depended on undergraduates enrolling in sufficient numbers each semester.

In 2012, President Obama appointed Maier to the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation Board of Trustees. The foundation was created by Congress in 1986 as part of the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution and offers $24,000 graduate-level fellowships to secondary teachers to undertake a master's degree which emphasizes the study of the Constitution.jamesmadison.gov Writing Maier's writing is characterized as serious and unadorned, with a crossover appeal from scholars to intelligent readers who enjoy a well-told story of well-researched scholarly history. In Ratification, Maier attributed her storytelling ability to Barbara Tuchman's insight that the writer can build suspense by never acknowledging a development until the characters in the narrative could know it.Woods, Gordon S., ‚ÄúThe Great American Argument‚Äù, The New Republic, December 24, 2010, in the magazine Dec 30, 2010, viewed 05/14/2011. Professionally, her research-writing technique was self-described as looking for something comparative to come up with new questions. For example, in American Scripture, she found over 90 local declarations and then compared them to that of the Second Continental Congress. Popular support for the Declaration of Independence was built on how much was known and how widely the newspapers circulated. Massachusetts did not control Virginia, there was a confluence of ideas, assumptions, and similar responses to similar events. As a popular history writer, she sought to understand her subjects as humans as well as their causes. Personal elements may not be important to public life, but they are the kinds of things people want to know. In Hamilton's famous phrase, he was \\"unfaithful to my wife, but not to my country.\\" Historians always ask, What did they do for the public? Teaching teachers Maier won fellowships to write curriculum for college courses and high school teachers. She believed that the interest in American history was not tapped in the curriculum of many states. As a democratic country, the U.S. should give any student a background knowledge of what happened to make the Declaration and the Constitution, and how their uses changed. Assumed things were not always so, students should understand how things can and do change. \\"Every time you understand what's distinctive about a different time, you are understanding what is distinctive about our time.\\" Scholarship Paxton Boys at Phil.

Her work is likened to that of Gordon S. Wood and Edmund S. Morgan. Radical English libertarian thought changed American beliefs and society and culture. The spreading ideas of natural rights and individual liberty distinctively altered politics, economy and society. These are explained with political analysis apart from ideology, incorporating English and French sources.Rothbard, Murray N., \\"Modern historians confront the American Revolution.\\" Sat.

The neo- Whigs added empire perspective, explored Patriot differences among colonies and within each colony, and added treatment of Tory elements.Martin, Raymond. \\"Progress in Historical Studies\\" http://www1.union.edu/martinr/documents/rm- progress50.pdf accessed 04/22/2011. pp. 6, 15 Maier's account of evolving Patriot differences is \\"Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution 1787‚Äì1788\\". Still, neo-Whigs have critics who see no causal imperative to revolution by Lockean ideals. Maier's account of the connections is found in \\"American Scripture: The Making of the Declaration of Independence\\". Neo-Whigs versus neo-Progressives In contrast to the neo-Whigs, neo-Progressives explain many developments as a conservative return to Coke's 'Rights of Englishmen', a reaction to economic imperatives of expanding Empire.Reid, John Philip. ‚ÄùThe concept of liberty‚Äù in the age of the American Revolution\\" pp. 10, 12 The British of all classes everywhere in the empire were more free than any in the world.Reid, John Philip. Op.Cit. p. 14 Neo-progressives show that the structural economic change in the English Atlantic empire and local profit margins counted as much for merchants and planters as a colonial concern for Parliament's enactments. Control of domestic markets motivated as much as rights and ideals. The Neo-Whigs have difficulty explaining a tipping point from mild protest to sustained violence. At times they have not accounted for the exodus by Tories and ex-slave British. 'Liberty' in 1776 meant different things to different people.Egnal, Marc and Ernst, Joseph. ‚Äú‚ÄùAn Economic Interpretation‚Äù of the American Revolution\\" WMQ Jan, 1972. pp. 3, 9 Maier's take is found in \\"From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765‚Äì1776\\". Neo-Whigs in general answer that doctrine of every kind was underpinned by a colonial social reality that was by its nature uncertain and unstable.Egnal, Marc and Ernst, Joseph., op. cit., p. 8 Nevertheless, they are charged with favoring those who could read and write. Social historians expanded historical inquiry into urban labor movements and rural militias. Maier contributed to the wider sensibility with her article \\"Popular Uprisings in 18th Century America\\" in the William and Mary Quarterly, featured in a reissue of their 50-year best.\\"Popular Uprisings in Eighteenth-Century America\\", Reprint of 50-year best: William and Mary Quarterly. 1, (1999): 138 OCLC 96273569 And while neo- Whigs can explain much of later social, economic and political transformation, see Maier's \\"Revolutionary Origins of the American Corporation\\", there still remains how marginalized populations (day-laborers, women, blacks slave and free, Amerindians) should be incorporated into the narrative of the American Revolution.Gould, Elga H., ‚Äú‚ÄúAmerican Revolution‚Äù‚Äù p. 1218 in Boyd, Kelly, ed., \\"Encyclopedia of historians and historical writing\\" (1999). Vol.2. Expanding 'early American' history Indeed, whatever was once \\"Early American History\\" is changed and changing. The field is 'imperialistically' reaching chronologically forward fifty years and backwards a century. It has spread geographically over the entire continent and across Atlantic communities. It topically encompasses slavery, gender, ethnicity and borderland outliers. The new intellectual fault line is methodological, based on differences in research standards and how to relate theory and archival research.Yerxa, Donald A., ed., ‚ÄúRecent Themes in Early American History‚Äù 2008 U of SC Press. , pp. 1,2 A recent collection by Donald A. Yerxa looks towards finding a 'reconceptualization' of the field with chronological bounds based on newly researched continuity and change, along with more coherent themes. Maier's section was a forum on historiography, Peter C. Mancall led 'the colonial period', and Gordon S. Wood started 'revolution and early republic'. Maier began the historiography section with three \\"Disjunctions\\" based on her previous work at NEH and a newly written rejoinder following comments by five other scholars.Yerxa, Donald A., ed., Op.Cit., pp. 3, 9. Maier's chapter is also found online in ‚ÄúHistorically Speaking‚Äù: the bulletin of The Historical Society\\". Mar/Apr 2005 In the first disjunction considered by Maier, the social 'Colonial' history is unlike the predominantly political and ideological 'Revolution' history. Colonial history from the Amerindian experience reaches a discontinuity at a time when U.S. imperialism overtakes earlier Hispanic developments in the 1800s.Yerxa, Donald A., ed., Op.Cit., p. 9 Maier agreed, \\"a disjunction in historical research is not a disjunction in history.\\" The challenge is to find a bridge from modern fruitful research into the previous scholarship based on national boundaries.Yerxa, Donald A., ed., Op.Cit., p. 41 The second disjunction is between scholarly interests and the general public. Younger scholars are dropping the history of white men's politics. While bestsellers are written on Franklin, Washington, Adams, and '1776', many modern, cultural historians shun white male elites. \\"Nation\\" is dismissed as an imagined or invented construct and 'nationalism' in their critique lacks explanatory power for inclusive historical analysis.Yerxa, Donald A., ed., Op.Cit., p. 5 Maier's third disjunction, related to the second, is between historical scholarship and history taught in secondary schools and college survey courses. While social and cultural historians add to the body of the scholarly literature in their professional careers, Maier asks, \\"why not synthesize and perpetuate the contributions of previous (political, military and diplomatic) scholars, at least in the classroom?\\"Yerxa, Donald A., ed., Op.Cit., p. 43 (Related on this page, see references to Maier's work in two fellowships at National Endowment of Humanities, Guggenheim Foundation, Annenberg Foundation, PBS, History Channel, and textbooks referenced by scholars.)

Often referred to as \\"English-speaking radio\\" or \\"Expat radio\\" the broadcasts enables expats, vacationers and travelers to listen to radio in their native language while traveling abroad. The idea is that stations broadcast in English to popular holiday destinations such as Pattaya or the French Riviera or places with high expat communities. English language broadcasting also takes the form of military-backed radio such as the American Forces Network. However English-language radio based in foreign countries has to now compete with the introduction of internet radio and satellite technology that has increased listener's access to English- language radio based in \\"home\\" counties. History The first English- language radio in a foreign country transmission was thought to be in 1925 when Radio Paris broadcast from the Eiffel Tower, a show about fashion design, sponsored by Selfridges of London. With end of World War II American and British forces began occupation of bases within regions of conquered Axis countries such as Germany and Okinawa for the enjoyment and informative power radio bring to both the troops and their families. Today traditions remain as the American Forces Network and the British Forces Broadcasting Service continue to provide English-language entertainment and information to troops stationed abroad in their respective countries or areas. Non-military English broadcasting gained momentum with the increase in globalization after World War II. As English-speaking business personnel and expat communities grew because of international trade and investment, so did the demand for English language entertainment. As the number of global English speakers has grown, demand from the local native market has grown as well. Stations that actively reach out to the local community such as International Community Radio Taipei have been on the rise. Location The location of most English-language radio stations can be determined by their proximity to large populations of English speakers. Geneva, Switzerland, for example, has many English speakers and expatriates, also the Spanish coastal areas, and thus English radio broadcasts. Radio stations in places such as Baja California and Costa Rica also serve the increasing number of English speakers.

It is the state flower of Washington.Symbols of Washington State  Description  It is an evergreen shrub growing up to tall. The leaves, retained for 2‚Äì3 years, are long and broad. The flowers are long, with five lobes on the corolla; color is usually pink, although variants exist.  Distribution  The northern limit of its range is somewhat north of the border between Canada and the United States in British Columbia. It is found as far south as Monterey Bay in California. It is widely distributed in the Coast Mountains and Cascade Range. It is less abundant in the coastal mountains of Washington and northern Oregon and more common south of the Siuslaw River. It is mostly coastal in distribution but extends its range eastward to locations in the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.  Habitat  Rhododendron macrophyllum, like many rhododendrons, thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadside embankments and recently deforested wildlands. They can also live up in the mountains.  History and cultivation  Archibald Menzies found R. macrophyllum growing along with Arbutus menziesii in May 1792 when he and George Vancouver made their second landfall after leaving Hawaii, near present-day Port Discovery, Washington.Justice, Clive L.

The club has entered a team in the Manawatu Rugby Union senior 1 competition every year since 1953. The club's senior 1 success has fluctuated somewhat and reached a pinnacle in 1962 when with Viv Long as coach they won the senior 1 competition. From there its success was limited until 1997 when a very spirited senior 1 team coached by Geoff Webb and David Staite uplifted 'Hank' the Hankin Shield that started a run of success that included 57 undefeated senior 1 competition games in succession, a record that could be near impossible to overhaul by any team in the future.

In the undergraduate men‚Äôs program there are four Torah studies tracks, in order to properly serve a diverse student population. One of them is the Irving I. Stone Beit Midrash Program, referred to as ‚ÄúBMP‚Äù. In addition there are three others: JSS (James Striar School), IBC (Isaac Breuer College), and MYP (Mazer School of Talmudic Studies). JSS is geared towards, ‚Äúthose new to Hebrew language and textual study who want to attain a broad- based Jewish philosophical and text education.‚Äù IBC is geared towards students who wish to study seriously but in a classroom setting. MYP, the most rigorous of the four programs, is for those seeking the deepest exposure to traditional learning. With funding from the Irving I. Stone Support Foundation BMP was established in 1995. It is geared towards students who are not interested ‚Äúin a classical yeshiva approach‚Äù, which gives the most rigorous deep exposure in a Yeshiva setting that the Mazer School of Talmudic Studies (known as ‚ÄúYP‚Äù) has to offer but rather desire more flexible chavruta (study partner)/shiur (lecture) options. The goal of this program, ‚Äúis to create educated and committed Jewish lay leaders‚Äù whose breadth of knowledge spans the gamut of Jewish disciplines such as: Talmud, Tanakh, Jewish Law, and Jewish thought.  Curriculum  The program has about 300 students divided into nine classes (shiurim) ranging in level from beginner to advanced. As part of the curriculum students are taught both Tanakh and Jewish Law twice a week. \\"Tanakh study revolves around central stories and themes, as expounded by the classic commentaries. By the completion of their time in BMP students will have completed the entire Neviim Rishonim (Early Prophets.) The curriculum of Jewish Law covers the range of the basic laws students will need in their daily life, including the laws of Shabbat, Kashrut, family law, and synagogue, among others. On Sundays students are taught Jewish Thought. Besides for all of the elements of the curriculum already mentioned the most central focus of the program is on Talmud study. Students first study with a partner (chavruta) in the Beit Midrash (learning center) and subsequently hear a lecture (shiur) by an experienced Talmud scholar; the Rabbi. Students are required to purchase the Talmudic Tractate which is being studied in any given year. In addition to their morning studies requirements, BMP students can also opt into an optional learning program on Monday through Wednesday night.  Schedule  _Monday- Thursday_ 9:00‚Äì10:20 Tanakh/Jewish Law 10:30‚Äì11:40 Sikha (Inspirational Lecture)/ Morning Seder (study time with a partner independent of the Instructor) 11:45‚Äì12:55 Talmud Lecture 1:00‚Äì2:30 Lunch, Hebrew/Bible Classes 3:00‚Äì8:00 College courses and dinner 8:15‚Äì10:00 Night Seder (study time with a partner) in Harry Fischel Beit Midrash (Learning Center) _Sunday_ 10:00‚Äì11:40 Talmudic Lecture  Faculty and staff  The BMP faculty consists of three distinct categories. First of all there is the overall heads of all the undergraduate Torah Studies program‚Äôs in Yeshiva University, which includes BMP. Each class (shiur) in BMP has a warm Rabbi/teacher who provides the main instruction for the class while also forming a close relationship with the students. In addition each class (Shiur) has a Sho'eil U'meishiv (Teachers Assistant) who is available to discuss the topic being studied in order to help the students prepare for class (shiur). These Teacher Assistants also contribute towards the warm BMP environment.Guide to Undergraduate Torah Studies at YU Handbook Heads of the Undergraduate Torah Studies at Yeshiva University Rabbi Menachem Penner-The Max and Marion Grill Dean Rabbi Yosef Kalinsky-Associate Dean Rebbeim/Teachers Rabbi Eli Belizon, Rabbi Aharon Ciment, Rabbi Meir Goldwicht, Rabbi Daniel Rapp, Rabbi Eitan Schnall, Rabbi Moshe Tzvi Weinberg Shoelim-Umeishivim Rabbi Shmuel Goldstein, Rabbi Zac Katz, Rabbi Shimon Danielli, Rabbi Shaya Katz, Rabbi Alex Landsman, Rabbi Yisrael Apfel, Rabbi Yehuda Meyers, Rabbi Justin WexlerGuide to Undergraduate Torah Studies at YU Handbook  Student perspectives: BMP in practice  While BMP has certain theoretical goals, as mentioned above, in practice, BMP means something different to various elements of the student body. To many students BMP is a program filled with warmth, excitement, and a serious commitment to learning Jewish topics. One student commented, ‚ÄúThe warmth that the Rebbeim in the program provide is unmatched, and the chevrah (group of friends) that are created through that warmth last a lifetime.‚Äù This same student extolled the serious commitment to Jewish studies that BMP students take upon themselves, manifested by the night learning program from Monday through Wednesday night which many choose to join. Students like this one perceive BMP as an equal alternative to the Mazer School of Talmudic Studies in terms of commitment and seriousness to Judaism and the study of Jewish topics. These students simply chose BMP over the Mazer School of Talmudic Studies because they value the warm relationship that BMP offers to its students. They reject the notion that BMP is a less serious program as compared to the Mazer School of Talmudic Studies. However, other students do not see things in the same light. Over the years there has been a controversy regarding the placement of different morning programs in the various learning centers. BMP used to learn in its own Beit Midrash (learning center) in Furst Hall. In recent years they have been relocated into the Glueck and Fischel Batei Midrash (learning centers), joining the students from the Mazer School of Talmudic Studies. While many BMP students laud this relocation to what President Joel has termed the ‚Äú[h]eart of our Yeshiva,‚Äù (the Glueck and Fischel learning centers) many of the students in the Mazer School of Talmudic Studies are unhappy with these new developments. A particularly passionate student remarked that ‚Äú[t]he learning of YP students (Mazer School of Talmudic studies students) would be best if they were surrounded by equally motivated and strong Torah learners.‚Äù This student‚Äôs opinion, contrary to the view mentioned above, is that BMP lacks the level of seriousness and commitment to Torah that the Mazer School of Talmudic Studies has to offer. This perspective on BMP is exacerbated by policy changes in regards to the Jewish studies requirements. Previously BMP students, similar to their Mazer School of Talmudic Studies counterparts, did not have the option to fulfil any of their Jewish studies requirements as part of their morning studies. Rather they were expected to spend the whole morning in the Beit Midrash (learning center). In recent years, BMP students have been given the opportunity to take a Bible course twice a week during part of the morning in order to fulfil an element of their Jewish studies requirements. This new development has left many concerned that the seriousness of the Beit Midrash (learning center) will be diminished as students come and go during the morning studies. Yet, not all students take such a negative view of such changes. One student claimed that ‚Äúthe new morning structure, which allows for seniors to take a Bible class in the morning, allows for students to allocate their morning studies more efficiently, making the most of their time both in the Beis Medresh and in the classroom.‚Äù  References  Category:Yeshiva University ","title":"Stone Beit Midrash Program"},{"id":"8141760","text":"The mass media in Barbados have had a long history of being entitled to an open policy by the Government, and by the citizenry with respect to press Freedoms.

He entered the University of Chicago in 1902, where he became a member of Delta Upsilon fraternity. In his junior year, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which necessitated a change of climate. Hence, he moved to the Territory of New Mexico and worked on a ranch on the slopes of Mount Taylor, near the railroad town of Grants. After a long vacation in Europe in 1914 he returned to Chicago and married Shirley Bergman, and brought her to their new residence in Ramah, New Mexico. They built their house of sandstone and adobe, raised four children, and as the largest sheep ranchers in New Mexico experienced both fortune and as well as economic privation through the 1920s and 1930s.

In projects, an interim report is often compiled to analyze how the project is proceeding, before its final completion. Interim analysis is important in medical trials, to ensure that the patients are not exposed to unnecessary danger during the trial. An interim constitution is a constitution that has not been completely ratified but serves as a temporary law until a permanent is made. An interim official or leader is a person who is filling official role temporarily. This can be in between two other people, or when the normal person is temporarily unable to do it and somebody else must fill in temporarily or without following the ordinary protocol. For example, a school can have an interim principal, a congregation an interim spiritual leader, or a country an interim prime minister or president. The synonymous term \\"acting\\" is frequently used as well to refer to a temporary occupant of an office or position. The primary task of interim (and acting) officials is to ensure both the stability and continuity of the institution despite the absence of a formal leader. A specific usage of this term is the interim leader in Canadian politics. Interim management is used by businesses in trouble, which need extra management resources to control the crisis or change the direction of the company. An interim manager is a person who provides temporary managerial support usually at executive level to an organization and the achievement of its business objectives. An interim solution is a solution to bridge a connection between two different things. This is usually associated with computer networking and the interim solutions between different network protocols. A ceasefire is sometimes called an interim, as it interrupts the progress of a war.

The complainant  On October 2, 2004 Vancouver resident Ralph Stopps applied to the Just Ladies Fitness facility in Metrotown and was denied membership because he is male. Stopps filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal on November 21, 2006 that he was discriminated against because of his gender, violating s. 8 of the \\"Human Rights Code,\\" which prohibits discrimination by sex. The tribunal, a panel of 9 females and 3 males, rendered its decision that the complainant had not established that he was discriminated against.  The respondent  Just Ladies Fitness is a women-only fitness facility, although some men work there in management and maintenance. It was argued at the tribunal that women attend the facility because they feel demeaned by men gazing at them at unisex facilities. The facility also claimed that because it is cleaner, has smaller weights that are more suitable for females, and because it has prenatal fitness classes their women-only admission policy was justified. The managers argued that women pay higher fees at their facility than at other fitness facilities and that this proves that some females feel that going to a female only fitness facility is necessary, but does not constitute sexual discrimination.  Tribunal decision  The Human Rights Tribunal ruled that the complainant had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities all the elements required to demonstrate that illegal discrimination had happened. Stopps still has the right to appeal the BCHRT's decision. Firstly, the tribunal found that the complainant was not adversely affected by the denial of membership. His claim that the facility was nearer his home was incorrect, his claim that the free initial membership period was not significant and since he had not pursued other opportunities to join other gyms, the tribunal found he had no serious intention of working out at a facility, as he had never gone to any fitness facilities before, and did not attend any after he was denied membership at \\"Just Ladies Fitness\\". Second, the tribunal found that the complainant failed to prove that his dignity has been adversely affected by his denial of membership. In British Columbia, one cannot receive compensation for being discriminated against unless one also proves that the discrimination demeaned their dignity, and Mr. Stopps failed to prove that his dignity had been significantly demeaned. Third, the tribunal found that its purpose is to provide compensation for those who have actually suffered from being discriminated against, and that the tribunal should not be used to make a political point. The tribunal found that Stopps's claim was politically motivated, and filing such claims harms those who file legitimate claims of discrimination, including men who have been discriminated against and whose dignity has been demeaned.

When the popularity of mountain resorts ended as the Jersey Shore grew as a vacation destination thanks to the automobile, Glenside Park closed in 1916.http://www.ucnj.org/trails- map/pg_0010.pdf The Murals de la Selva In 1916, the Deserted Village fell into decline upon the closure of Glenside Park. A local civil engineer and travel enthusiast named Edward J. Grassmann purchased a number of properties to serve as a club, which he eventually sold to the Union County Parks Commission. Grassmann was a lifelong Elizabeth resident who made his fortune in land surveying and kaolin processing; the trust that bears his name is still in existence today.Giving It Away https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/12/nyregion/giving-it-away.html?mwrsm=Twitter Grassmann decorated two of his structures at the Deserted Village to demonstrate his fondness for the Southwest and Latin America. He called one the \\"Mexican Cottage\\" and the other he christened as the \\"Indian Cottage.\\"Unveiling the mystery of the murals in the Deserted Village http://www.nj.com/suburbannews/index.ssf/2016/10/unveiling_the_mystery_of_the_m.html > It was Grassmann who apparently persuaded celebrated Nicaraguan/Mexican > artist Roberto de la Selva to paint themed murals throughout the first floor > interior of the Mexican Cottage.

The Union County Park System and the formation of the Reservation Soon after the Union County Park System was formed in 1921, purchasing land all along the Rahway River to the east, this area was incorporated into the Watchung Reservation. The March 23, 1927 edition of The Westfield Leader describes the creation of new bridle trails in the young park. Enchanted Forest and other apocryphal tales Stories of paganism and witchcraft surround what is known as the Enchanted or Magic Forest in the Reservation. The Enchanted Forest is actually a pine plantation of 16,000 trees placed in \\"endless, ruler-straight rows\\" by the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s. The forest contains white spruce, red pine, and Norway spruce which are not native to the area, and native trees replace the pines as they die. It has suffered heavily from pine beetle predation in recent years. Other tales of hauntings and witchcraft abound in the Reservation, as well as apocryphal tales of black magic and teenage devil worship. Some arose likely in relation to real-life teenage murder and suicide in the area, such as in nearby Houdaille Quarry (Jeannette DePalma). According to one true-crime writer, \\"[t]hroughout the 1970s and up into the 2000s, there were reports of 'devil worship' in [Watchung Reservation]. There are police reports and newspaper accounts to back that up. So it was all going on in this hot spot of weird, paranormal activity.\\"A Cult Murder Emerges from the Darkness in True-Crime Book Death on the Devil's Teeth via @gizmodo Some say thirteen witches are buried beneath the stretch of road that runs from Watchung to Scotch Plains by the Reservation. Recreation While there are recreation areas within the reservation, much of the 1,945 acre (7.8 km2) parcel is forested, and the reservation is managed for the preservation of its natural resources. The most popular recreational activities in the reservation are hiking and horseback riding on its many trails.

Unique natural springs and salamander habitat In its 1981 environmental impact report on a flood control project, Army Corps of Engineers discussed the unique natural spring environment in the Reservation, providing habitat for six species of salamander: Environmental concerns Governmental land takings In spite of heavy local public protest, higher levels of government have taken land in the reservation twice for their own purposes. The first time was in the late 1950s when the U.S. Army built a Nike missile base and operated it between 1957 and 1963 to defend the airways over New York City. Today, the site has been redeveloped for use as Watchung Stables. A more lasting effect on the reservation came in the 1980s when, following years of litigation and public activism, the New Jersey Department of Transportation won approval for completion of I-78 through the northern fringe of the reservation. Wildlife crossings designed to allow wildlife to travel safely between the severed parts of the Watchung Reservation were built. 2017 mountain biking controversy In 2017, local controversy erupted over mountain biking enthusiasts, including Princeton-based Jersey Off Road Bicycle Association (JORBA), making efforts to introduce mountain biking in the Reservation.Public Comment page and link to CME Associates Master Plan. The Sierra Club, other environmentalists, and hikers claimed that the county had failed to behave transparently in working with a group of cyclists and bicycle store owners in pushing a plan to carve 13.5 new miles of bike-only trail in untouched forest in the Reservation. They asserted that no environmental impact studies had been performed on the Reservation itself, that hiking advocates like the New York‚ÄìNew Jersey Trail Conference (NYNJTC) had not been consulted, that no attention had been paid to the Olmsted landscape architectural legacy of the reserve, and that the county had gone straight to hiring an engineering consultant firm, Parlin-based CME Associates, to draft a master plan to insert the bike-only trails.Jennifer Popper, VIDEO: Hikers Give Feedback on Mountain Biking in Watchung Reservation at Public Meeting. https://www.tapinto.net/towns/westfield/articles/video-hikers-give-feedback- on-mountain-biking-in-2 In response, one Union County bicycle store owner dismissed concerns as biased and misguided hysteria, noting the many health benefits of mountain biking.

In all cases, however, sharia (Islamic religious law) calls for burial of the body as soon as possible, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by salah (prayer). Burial is usually within 24 hours of death to protect the living from any sanitary issues, except in the case of a person killed in battle or when foul play is suspected; in those cases it is important to determine the cause of death before burial. Cremation of the body is strictly forbidden in Islam. It should be mentioned that the rites of a burial is not constituted in the Qur'an.  Common Islamic burial rituals  Muslim Cemetery in Macau Muslim Cemetery in Taipei, Taiwan Burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include:Ghamidi (2001),Customs and Behavioral Laws * Collective bathing of the dead body,Sahih al-Bukhari 1254 except in extraordinary circumstances, as in the battle of Uhud.Sahih al-Bukhari 1346 * Enshrouding the dead body in a white cotton or linen cloth.Sahih Muslim 943 * Funeral prayer ( ÿµŸÑÿßÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜÿßÿ≤ÿ© ).Ghamidi, Various types of the prayer * Burial of the dead body in a grave. * Positioning the deceased so that the head is faced towards Mecca (Makkah Al- Mukarramah). Bathing the body The corpse is washed (ghusl, bathed), with the purpose to physically cleanse the deceased. The exact manner, method, style and accessories used for bathing the corpse may vary by locale and temporal position, except that it is to be done with heated water. Bathing the dead body is an essential ritual of the Sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad,Sahih Muslim Volume 2, Book 23, Number 344-358 and therefore a part of the Islamic Sharia. This should occur as soon as possible after death, preferably within hours. Orthodox practice is to wash the body an odd number of times (at least once) with a cloth covering its awrah (parts of the body that should be hidden according to Sharia). The \\"washers\\" are commonly adult members of the immediate family, who are of the same gender as the deceased. In cases of violent deaths or accidents, where the deceased has suffered trauma or mutilation, morgue facilities mend the body and wrap it in a shroud to minimise fluid leakage prior to surrendering it to mourners for washing. Shrouding The corpse is typically wrapped in a simple plain cloth (the kafan). This is done to respect the dignity and privacy of the deceased with the family sometimes present. The specifics of this ritual, including the material, style, and colour of the cloth, may vary between regions. However, the shroud should be simple and modest. It is for this reason that Muslims have generally preferred to use white cotton cloth to serve as the shroud. Men may use only three pieces of cloth and women five pieces of cloth.Sahih Muslim Volume 2, Book 23, Number 353-358 The body may be kept in this state for several hours, allowing well-wishers to pass on their respects and condolences. Funeral prayer The Muslims of the community gather to offer their collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead. This prayer has been generally termed as the Salat al-Janazah (Janazah prayer). The Janazah prayer is as follows: * Like Eid prayer, the Janazah prayer incorporates an additional (fourSahih Muslim Volume 2, Book 23, Number 404 ) Takbirs, the Arabic name for the phrase Allahu Akbar, but there is no Ruku' (bowing) and Sujud (prostrating). * Supplication for the deceased and mankind is recited. * In extraordinary circumstances, the prayer can be postponed and prayed at a later time as was done in the Battle of Uhud. * It is required for every Muslim adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, but conventionally and in practice the Janazah is performed by few people so it alleviates that obligation for all.Sahih Muslim Volume 2, Book 23, Number 359 Burial Grave of a Muslim Muslim men finishing a grave after a burial The body is then taken for burial (al-Dafin). The exact manner, customs and style of the grave, the burial and so forth may vary by regional custom. The grave should be perpendicular to the direction of the Qibla (i.e. Mecca) so that the body, placed in the grave without a coffin lying on its right side, faces the Qibla. Grave markers should be raised, not more than about above the ground, so that the grave will neither be walked nor sat on. Grave markers are simple, because outwardly lavish displays are discouraged in Islam. Graves are frequently marked only with a simple wreath, if at all. However, it is becoming more common for family members to erect grave monuments. In Middle Eastern Muslim cultures, women are generally discouraged from participating in the funeral procession. The reason for this is that in pre-Islamic Arabia it was customary in Arabia for grieving women to wail loudly. Wealthy families often even hired moirologists to attend the funerals of their deceased relative. Wailing at funerals is not permitted according to the Sahih Bukhari. Women are allowed to attend or be present if they do not wail or cry or hit themselves in grief, especially in an exaggerated excessive manner as in pre-Islamic Arabia.Sahih Muslim Volume 2, Book 23, Number 368 Three fist-sized spheres of hand-packed soil prepared beforehand by the gravediggers are used as props, one under the head, one under the chin and one under the shoulder. The lowering of the corpse and positioning of the soil- balls is done by the next of kin. In the case of a deceased husband, a male brother or brother-in-law usually performs this task. In the case of a deceased wife, the husband undertakes this if physically able to. If the husband is elderly, then the eldest son (or son-in-law) is responsible for lowering, alignment and propping the deceased. Orthodoxy expects those present to symbolically pour three handfuls of soil into the grave while reciting a quranic verse meaning, \\"We created you from it, and return you into it, and from it we will raise you a second time\\".; compare \\"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return\\" (Genesis 3:19) More prayers are then said, asking for forgiveness of the deceased, and reminding the dead of their profession of faith. Tatar Muslim cemetery The corpse is then fully buried by the gravediggers, who may stamp or pat down the grave to shape. Commonly the eldest male will supervise. After the burial the Muslims who have gathered to pay their respects to the dead collectively pray for the forgiveness of the dead. This collective prayer is the last formal collective prayer for the dead. In some cultures, e.g. in South-East Asian, the relatives scatter flowers and perfumed rose water upon the grave before leaving the grave. Mourning According to Sunni Islam, loved ones and relatives are to observe a three-day mourning period.Sahih Muslim Volume 2, Book 23, Number 369‚Äì371 Islamic mourning is observed by increased devotion, receiving visitors and condolences, and avoiding decorative clothing and jewelry in accordance with the Qur'an. Widows observe an extended mourning period (iddah, period of waiting), four months and 10 days long. During that time, the widow is not to remarry or to interact with non-mahram (a man she can marry). This rule is to confirm that the woman is not pregnant with the deceased's child prior to remarrying. However, in case of emergencies such as visiting a doctor because of a health emergency, the widow can interact with non-mahram. Grief at the death of a beloved person and weeping for the dead is normal and acceptable.Sahih Muslim Volume 2, Book 23, Number 391 Sunni Islam expects expression of grief to remain dignified, prohibiting loud wailing (bewailing refers to mourning in a loud voice), shrieking, beating the chest and cheeks, tearing hair or clothes, breaking objects, scratching faces or speaking phrases that make a Muslim lose faith. Grieving is allowed and a part of the death and burial process to allow one to come to terms with the loss of a person passing away as long as it respects the above.Sahih Muslim Volume 2, Book 23, Number 375‚Äì393 Directives for widows The Qur'an prohibits widows to engage themselves for four lunar months and ten days, after the death of their husbands. According to the Qur'an: Islamic scholars consider this directive a balance between the mourning of a husband's death and the protection of a widow from cultural or societal censure if she became interested in remarrying after her husband‚Äôs death, often an economic necessity.Islahi (1986), p. 546 This provision also operates to protect the property rights of the unborn, as the duration is enough to ascertain whether a widow is pregnant or not.Shehzad Saleem.
