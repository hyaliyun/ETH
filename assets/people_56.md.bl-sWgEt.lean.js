Nothing is known of his life, but his death left a legacy for a millennium. Namely, the Túath where he died was renamed in his honour, and his brother Saint Caillín obtained a substantial honour price in compensation under Brehon Law, securing a revenue stream for the famous monastery of Fenagh. Life Nisi (pronounced Nishy) was born in 6th century Gaelic Ireland, the son of and brother of Saint Caillín, the patron saint of Fenagh. He belonged to the tribe of Conmaicne-Rein who lived in present-day South Leitrim and West Longford. He was probably a noble or a priest, and close associate of his sibling Caillín. Little else is known of his life. His death is described in both prose and rhyme by the ancient along the following lines. Sometime in the 5th or 6th century, Nisi and Caillín journeyed from Ard-Carna Monastery in Roscommon eastwards towards Cora Droma Rúisc crossing the river Shannon to (\\"the plain of Cellachan\\"), staying overnight at a place named the Bennachan, in the home of Cellachan, who was not of the Conmaicne tribe. Next morning for some unknown reason, Nisi was killed unlawfully by Cellachan who then had to pay Nisi's brother a substantial \\"body fine\\" and honour price in compensation. Nisi was interred at Fenagh. Legacy For the following millennium, the locality where he died was known as (\\"the plain of Nisi\\") in his honour. Nisi's \\"honour price\\" became the perpetual claim by the monastic settlement at Fenagh to patronage from Moynish nobles. * From Cellachan the active, * The proud plain had been named; * Magh-Nissi, manifest famous, * Is its name from that time down. * Their land and their tributes, * Caillin got for the deed. The name of Nisi was forgotten when Gaelic Ireland collapsed in the 17th century. Irish nobles had their estates confiscated in the plantations of Leitrim. The English incorporated Moynish into the barony of Leitrim and Cromwellian forces plundered Moynish in 1652. Though forgotten today, the place name of Moynish is preserved by the Irish annals and English Fiants.

In terms of the number of victims, it was one of the largest bombardments of a Dutch city during World War II. Officially, nearly 800 people (almost all civilians) were killed by accident due to inaccurate bombing but, because people in hiding could not be counted, the actual death toll was probably higher. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including Saint Steven's Church. Saint Augustine's Church and Nijmegen railway station (the intended target) were heavily damaged as well. Because the Dutch government-in-exile in London, which was able to reestablish itself on the continent in early 1945 thanks to the U.S. Army and other Allies' military efforts, tried to avoid criticism against the countries it was relying on for its liberation and future security, it and local authorities largely remained silent on the unfortunate event for decades, leaving survivors with unaddressed grief and questions, and allowing wild conspiracy theories to thrive. Although officials long maintained it had been an \\"erroneous bombardment\\", as if Nijmegen was the wrong target, historical research has shown that the attack was intentional, but had been executed poorly.  Background  A planned raid on the city of Gotha was part of the so-called 'Big Week' (official name: Operation Argument), a series of Allied bombardments on German aircraft factories to weaken the Luftwaffe in preparation for D-Day (June 1944). On 20 and 21 February, the first bombings had been carried out. At the time, it was common within the Allied air forces to attack secondary targets if the primary target could not be reached. These secondary targets were called targets of opportunity. Because a bombing raid was risky and expensive (because of enemy fire and fuel), and the main target could often not be hit, an opportunistic bombing attack could still deal an important blow to the enemy, thus turning the operation into a partial success, and providing some return for the costs and risks. The railway station area of Nijmegen was marked as such a target of opportunity, because the Allies knew that the Germans were using it for weapons transport. There was pressure on the flyers to bomb anything if possible, because it was unsafe to land with unexpended bombs and, once the flyers had carried out 25 raids, they were given leave of absence.  Course of events  = Gotha mission cancelled = At 9:20 in the morning of 22 February, 177 American B-24 Liberator bombers, escorted by dozens of P-38 Lightning, P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang fighters, took off from RAF Bungay airbase near the Suffolk village of Flixton. They flew in the direction of the German city of Gotha, where the Gothaer Waggonfabrik aircraft factory was producing Messerschmitt fighters and other Luftwaffe planes. This required a four-hour flight over German territory, making it a highly dangerous mission. If Gotha could not be reached, Eschwege was the next target, and if even that failed, the pilots had to seek out a target of opportunity by themselves on the way back to their bases in Britain. Because the clouds were unusually high, the aircraft had trouble gathering into formation, and quickly lost sight of each other. In consequence, a considerable number of bombers broke off their mission 15 minutes after take-off and returned. While still above the North Sea, the Americans were unexpectedly fired on by German fighters. When the group passed over Nijmegen at 12:14 (CET), the air raid siren was activated by watchman Van Os, and residents ran for their shelters until it was safe.Brinkhuis (1984), p. 86. Shortly after, around 13:00 when the bombers had reached about 10 miles into Germany, they received a message from command that the raid was cancelled due to too heavy cloud formations above Gotha for an effective bombardment; the units were recalled. Because Eschwege was still far out of reach, looking for targets of opportunity on the way back was now recommended. = Airstrike = A similar B-24 Liberator bombing a German railyard in March 1945 It was an extremely difficult task to turn around hundreds of planes and stay in formation, leading to a great deal of chaos and fragmenting the group into several squadrons who each sought their way back to Britain independently. Underway, they looked for targets of opportunity, and eventually the Dutch cities of Nijmegen, Arnhem, Deventer and Enschede were selected and attacked. The squadron flying to Nijmegen consisted of twelve Liberators of the 446th Bombardment Group, which were joined by two detached Liberators of the 453rd Bombardment Group.Brinkhuis (1984), p. 74. Beforehand, the flyers had been poorly informed about whether Nijmegen was a Dutch or a German city, whether German-occupied cities could or could not be bombed, and if so in what way, and they were negligent in finding out exactly which cities they were about to strike, partly due to miscommunication that can be ascribed to technical problems such as a stuck radio operator's morse key. Watchman Van Os had given the clear sign at 13:16. For reasons that are still unclear, he failed to activate the air raid siren a second time immediately 14 of the aircraft returned in Nijmegen's airspace, mere minutes after the clear sign had been given, causing citizens not to run for cover as quickly as possible in time on this occasion. Van Os stated afterwards that he did not ring the siren a second time until he heard explosions coming from the city centre. At 13:28, 144 brisant bombs (each weighing 500 pounds) and 426 shrapnel shells (20 pounds a piece) were dropped. The actual target of opportunity, the train station area, was successfully hit. However, a considerable number of bombs fell on the city centre in residential areas, destroying homes, churches and other civil targets and killing hundreds of civilians. After the fact, official Allied sources claimed that the pilots thought they were still flying above Germany, and had misidentified Nijmegen as the either the German city of Kleve (Cleves) or Goch. Yet some flyers themselves stated just an hour after landing in England that they had bombed Nijmegen, and a navigator even reported this in the air moments after the raid. = Allied and German reactions = With _friends_ like these, who needs enemies!?' The Nazis reported that the Dutch government-in-exile in London had given permission for the airstrike on Nijmegen, and that it therefore was an intentional bombardment. They made passionate attempts to exploit the bombing for propaganda: in public places, posters were hung with texts such as 'With friends like these, who needs enemies?' and 'Anglo-American Terror'. The German-controlled newspapers also furiously rebuked the Allies and the Dutch government-in-exile, one remarking \\"The Anglo-American pirates of the sky have once again executed the orders of their Jewish-Capitalist leaders with extraordinarily positive results\\". It appears that the propaganda was ineffective: seven months later, the American ground troops were welcomed as heroes by the inhabitants. Internal sources of the occupying government's Department for Popular Education and Arts even suggest the propaganda may have been counterproductive. On the day after the raid, the Allied air force launched an investigation: all air raids planned for that day were cancelled (also due to poor weather conditions), and all flyers and briefing officers involved were held on the base and questioned.Brinkhuis (1984), p. 138–139. The full scale of the disaster was not yet clear on 23 February, but American aerial photographs taken during the attack that Dutch naval commander Cornelis Moolenburgh managed to obtain via the Royal Air Force left no doubt that Nijmegen (and especially civilian targets in its centre), Arnhem and Enschede had been hit. Molenburgh informed Dutch ambassador Edgar Michiels van Verduynen, who confronted American ambassador Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr. (until then ignorant of the events) on the matter in the presence of Dutch queen Wilhelmina. Biddle quickly informed U.S. President Roosevelt. American air force commander Henry H. Arnold was irritated when he discovered that the Dutch embassy had been informed earlier than he himself, and he henceforth denied Moolenburgh access to USAAF documents via the RAF (which Moolenburgh could however still obtain via secret service officer Kingman Douglass). The USAAF also refused to send out reconnaissance aircraft for taking photos assessing the exact damage in the three cities, whereupon the RAF offered and executed this task.Brinkhuis (1984), p. 130–135. Wilhelmina demanded and received a written statement on what had happened, although it is unclear what it said. The American army command was relatively late in drawing lessons from the disorderly air raid, which had struck an ally's civilian population hard. Not until mid-May 1944, orders were given to seek out targets of opportunity at least 30 kilometres away from the Netherlands' border.  Post-war investigation  Allied and Dutch governmental officials have maintained for decades that the bombing was a complete mistake, and the flyers supposedly did not know that they had bombed Nijmegen. This led to great frustration amongst Nijmegen's populace, which struggled with questions that were left unanswered. Concerning the real causes and motives of the attack, wild rumours and unlikely conspiracy theories sprang up and circulated widely. Although they were implausible, and contradicted each other, they satisfied a strong desire for an explanation, any explanation, for the tragic events.Brinkhuis (1984), p. 7–10. = Brinkhuis (1984) = Finally, amateur historian Alfons Brinkhuis, who as a 10-year-old boy had experienced the bombing of Enschede on the same day, became the first person to conduct an elaborate investigation into the archives, and interviewed dozens of eyewitnesses. In the summer of 1984, he published his conclusions in De Fatale Aanval 22 februari 1944. Opzet of vergissing? De waarheid over de mysterieuze Amerikaanse bombardementen op Nijmegen, Arnhem, Enschede en Deventer (\\"The Fatal Attack 22 February 1944. Intent or Error? The Truth About the Mysterious American Airstrikes on Nijmegen, Arnhem, Enschede and Deventer\\"). In doing so, he broke a taboo, and many facts were brought out in the open for the first time, although some of his research has been rendered obsolete by later findings. Brinkhuis' seven conclusions were:Brinkhuis (1984), p. 138. #Hundreds of bombers were unable to gather due to the high cloud formations, and had to cancel their mission prematurely. #Formation of the attack group was not completed before German fighters carried out an unexpected counterstrike above the North Sea. #Miscommunication occurred due to poor weather conditions, the American Mandrel radar jammer and especially the stuck morse key, preventing most aircraft from sending verifiable messages to the bases (vice versa was still possible, however). #Because of this miscommunication, some units received the recall sooner than others, and therefore had to choose targets of opportunity far outside the normal routes. #Because of the wind, planes were driven to the west without realising it (the clouds prevented them from seeing which country they were flying over). #The Norden bombsights were set on Gotha as the target; there was no time to reprogram them, making precision bombing impossible. #Navigators always flew based on schedules; they were not trained to orientate themselves based on the landscape. This enabled flyers to get lost when missions were not going according to plan. = Rosendaal (2006–09) = In 2006, history docent Joost Rosendaal of Radboud University Nijmegen started a new study into the bombardment, which was eventually published in 2009 as Nijmegen '44. Verwoesting, verdriet en verwerking (\\"Nijmegen '44: Destruction, Grief, and Consolation\\"). In it, he classified the attack as an opportunistic bombing rather than an error. Rosendaal rejects the notion of an 'error', because the Americans were negligent in properly identifying which city to bomb. The Americans \\"intentionally bombed a target of opportunity, which, however, had not been unambiguously identified.\\" Rosendaal added that the death toll was further increased by several disastrous circumstances. The switchboard operator, who normally directed emergency services, was killed during the raid, and without her communications were slower. Many water pipes had been destroyed, making firefighting efforts much harder and more time- consuming. Dozens of people were still alive, but stuck under the rubble; many burnt to death when flames reached them before they could be extinguished.  Legacy  Monument 'De Schommel' at the Raadhuishof (2000) remembers the raid's civilian casualties. The Allied bombing of Nijmegen claimed almost as many civilian casualties as the German bombing of Rotterdam at the start of the war, but nationally it is not given nearly as much attention. The population of Nijmegen was told not to express their emotions, because the bombardment had been carried out by an allied nation. Furthermore, it was officially maintained that it was an 'erroneous bombardment' (vergissingsbombardement), and the fact that the railway station area was the intended target of opportunity, was covered up. Many survivors have always found the word 'error' rather painful, and Roosendaal opined that term does not do justice to what has happened. The memory of the February bombardment overshadows that of the city's destructive liberation during Operation Market Garden in September 1944 and the five months succeeding it, in which Nijmegen was an oft-shelled frontline city. This caused hundreds more casualties, which may have been prevented had the city been evacuated. The deaths in Nijmegen - over two thousand - make up 7% of all civilian war casualties in the Netherlands, well above the national average relative to its population size. Furthermore, it was long unclear how to commemorate these 'pointless' victims; there were enough monuments for soldiers and members of the resistance, but not of civilian deaths, and they were never part of any official memorial services. In 1984, a memorial service was held for the first time, and at the 1994 Nijmegen Storytelling Festival amidst great public interest, eyewitnesses and survivors were given the chance to speak after 50 years of silence. Not until 2000, a monument was erected for the civilian casualties: 'De Schommel' (The Swing) at the Raadhuishof. Annual memorial gatherings held on 22 February were attended by an increasing number of people in the 2010s.

Spanning the Adaja River, the bridge was on a route leading to the Decumanus Maximus within the walls of Ávila. Of the original structure built in the early-1st century A.D., the piers with their starlings survive; the rest of the bridge is Romanesque (11th and 13th centuries). Description It consists of five arches and four piers with starling, bow of boat shaped projection against the rising of the stream, Roman style, projecting spurs in the piers to contrary side to the sterling, preserving the west side abutment. The top of the bridge (road) is horizontal in the eastern half presenting the other half falling to west. The arches start from different height reaching its top at the same elevation, except the more amplitude, entirely remade, it appears lower. Apparently the bridge was disabled, on an unspecified date, totally destroying the biggest arch and cut the rest, tears still clearly visible today. In this sense the more possible was that the disablement of the bridge had taken place in the same period of the Arab invasion to 711, it is also possible that the semidestruction of the bridge would have happened at any time of the Reconquista when, coming the swollen river, any Arab or Christian army would have believed necessary to get rid of their pursuers or cut off their retreat. At the time of the Ávila's repopulation (11th century), the bridge was rebuilt on its granite Roman pillars. This was done with sandstone from La Colilla, widely used in the Romanesque churches in Ávila, but with little resistance to wear. In the 13th century a new repair was made, whose remains are probably the granitic rocks of the upper topped with a rounded parapet in the style of the Santi Espiritu and Romanillos bridges on the Chico River.

A member of the Society of Jesus, abbot de La Porte first worked to some periodical publications, in society with Fréron and, among others, with '. Temporarily in bad relation with Fréron, abbot de La Porte began in 1758 to publish l'Observateur littéraire. The first sheet of this periodical for the year 1761, including Voltaire, implacable enemy of Freron, speaking of \\"a masterpiece of its kind,\\" contained an article on l’Année littéraire, a newspaper where Father La Porte saw \\"a designed plot consisting of censorship, debasing, and decrying the masterpieces, and placing our most famous writers below more obscure literators.\\" A prolific author, abbot de La Porte also wrote a large number of books and compilations. His first writing was the Voyage au séjour des ombres, critical book that had some success. He then made a periodical entitled Observations sur la littérature moderne as it applied to contradict Fréron. His compilation of world travels LE VOYAGEUR FRANÇAIS, ou la connaissance de l'ancien et du nouveau monde (THE FRENCH TRAVELER, or the knowledge of the old and the new world), is a fiction based in real voyages. The author was never a traveler, he was an expert in travel literature. Rather than telling other people's travels, La Porte chooses another formula: he introduces himself as \\"the Traveler\\", and, writing letters from his places of residence to a certain \\"Madame\\", uses Traveler Relations, real those, to furnish her souvenirs in her dressing-gown. And he pepper his story of the meeting of some other characters. And due to its objectivity, many historians have cited him as a primary source, when his text is of secondary or referential source.

Jefferson National Forests. It is a small tract of land in western Virginia, consisting of an area of next to the banks of the Powell River. It was designated as wilderness area in 2009 by Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. On a ridge between the Powell River and the North Fork of the Powell River with deep gorges, sheer cliffs, rocky outcrops, dense woods and rhododendron, the wilderness is far removed from the throngs of outdoor adventurers. There are good views across the Powell river to Powell Mountain from an old tower site on Stone Mountain.Virginia Wilderness Committee: Stone Mountain Wilderness - Virginia Wilderness Committee, accessdate: June 28, 2017 This is the only protected wilderness in the Cumberland Mountains. The wilderness is part of the Clinch Ranger District Cluster. Location and access The wilderness is a few miles south of Bundy in Lee County, Virginia. It is bounded on the north by the North Fork of the Powell River; Stone Mountain is on the south side of the wilderness. There are two trails in the area. The Stone Mountain Trail (Forest Trail 207) begins at Cave Spring Campground and is 6.7 miles long in the wilderness, but extends northeast beyond the wilderness boundary. The Payne Branch Trail (Forest Trail 213) begins at Sigma and is 1.8 miles long. Natural history The forest, largely undisturbed because the rough terrain makes access difficult, contains tulip poplar, red maple, black cherry, yellow birch, frazier magnolia, oaks and hickories. Habitats include rhododendron thickets, ponds, stony creeks, deep gorges, sheer cliffs and rocky outcrops. Green Salamander Aneides aeneus 1aThe wilderness provides watershed for Cave Springs Cave, which is just outside the wilderness on the south. The cave, a winter roosting site for several species of bats, has a gate at the entrance to prevent disturbance of the bats and minimize exposure to White-nose syndrome, a disease that has decimated the bat population in eastern North America. Two rare salamanders are found in the wilderness, the green salamander and the Cumberland Plateau salamander. The wilderness is within the watershed of both the Powell River and the North Fork of the Powell River. The North Fork of the Powell River contains 29 species of mussels and 19 species of rare fish. The Powell River contains three federally endangered mussels; the oyster mussel, the Cumberlandian combshell and the rough rabbits foot. Topography The wilderness is in the Appalachian Plateau, sometimes called the Allegheny Plateau. The Appalachian Plateau has mountains with broad, flat summits composed of resistant sandstones and conglomerates with seams of coal. Outcrops of shales and limestones are seen on the side slopes. Stone Mountain is part of the Cumberland Mountains complex, lying on its eastern end. Little Stone Mountain, outside of the wilderness, is part of the mountain complex as it extends further east. The southeast side of the mountain ridge falls off rapidly with large cliffs and rock outcrops. The other side of the ridge on the northwest falls off slowly with streams, originating in springs and seeps near the crest, flowing into the North Fork of the Powell River. The streams include Low Gap Branch, Flanary Branch, McConnell Branch, Mill Branch, Payne Branch and Laurel Branch.General Information: Wilderness.net - Stone Mountain Wilderness - General Information, accessdate: June 28, 2017 Elevations range from about 2000 feet along the North Fork of the Pound on the western boundary to 3000 feet on the ridge top. Management The wilderness is managed by the Forest Service. There are some regulations to maintain the integrity of the area as a wilderness. For example, motorized equipment, motor vehicles and mountain bikes are prohibited, group size is limited to ten people, and limits are placed on camping.

History The direct predecessor of the Aegean Express was the Aegean Mototren, which operated between İzmir and Ankara between 1951 and 1978. The Aegean Express was one of four daily trains operating between İzmir and Eskişehir. Out of these four trains, the Agean Express operated during the day, while the other three trains, Karesi Express, 9th of September Express and the İzmir Blue Train, operated overnight and continued east from Eskişehir to Ankara. Scheduled departure from Basmane Terminal in İzmir was at 6:45 and scheduled arrival in Eskişehir was at 18:25 while scheduled departure from Eskişehir was at 7:30 and scheduled arrival in İzmir was at 18:49, however the Aegean Express was famous for its delays and would arrive on average at its final destination 78 minutes late.Average delays for passenger trains (Turkish) - kentvedemiryolu.com Service to Basmane Terminal was suspended on 3 March 2006Groundbreaking for the new Karsiyaka tunnel done with large fanfare - Izmir belediyesi due to the construction of the Karşıyaka tunnel. The Aegean Express terminated at Çiğli ( from Basmane Terminal), along with other trains from the north, and connection to railway stations in the city were offered by ESHOT replacement bus service. In early-2008 the İzmir terminus was pushed further north to Ulukent.ESHOT TCDD service buses (Turkish) - wowturkey.com During this period, trains would layover at Menemen. Due to the rehabilitation of the Eskişehir-Konya railway, the Aegean Express was cut back by to Kütahya in July 2008. Two months later, in September 2008, the train was extended south to Afyon as a replacement to regional service between Alayunt and Afyon. On 25 May 2010, inter-city service from the north was brought back to center terminals in İzmir; however due to route changes, the Aegean Express would terminate at Alsancak Terminal instead of Basmane, along with all other trains from the north. When construction to modernize the Balıkesir-Kütahya railway started in 2013, the Aegean Express was shorted by to Balıkesir. The Karesi Express was also shorted from Ankara to Balıkesir and currently operates as a regional train, along with the Aegean Express, between İzmir and Balıkesir.Karesi express shortened to Balikesir - yenihabergazetesi Route details The Aegean Express operates on the following railways in Turkey: * İzmir–Afyon railway - Basmane terminal to Manisa * Manisa-Bandırma railway - Manisa to Balıkesir * Balıkesir-Kütahya railway - Balıkesir to Kütahya Gallery Ege at afyon.jpg|Westbound Aegean Express #71602 ready to depart Afyon in 2009.

Natural History Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumbertree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in the valleys while chestnut oak, scarlet oak, and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and exposed south and east slopes. A large part of the trees in the area are less than 100 years old because of logging and burning in the late 1800s and early 1900s, however there are about 840 acres of possible old growth trees. The area contains a pure stand of the unique table mountain pine, a tree that requires fire to reproduce. Southern mountain cranberry, intermediate shield fern, Indian cucumber root, fire pink, wild sarsaparilla, bloodroot, black cohosh and white snake root are found along the tops of the mountains. Bird species include cerulean warblers, red crossbills, winter wrens and black throated green warblers.

During his racing career he competed in England, Ireland, France, Germany, Canada and Dubai. In 2015 he was beaten on his first two appearances but then recorded three consecutive wins in minor races. As a three-year-old in 2016 he made rapid progress, taking his winning run to six with victories in the Newmarket Stakes, Tercentenary Stakes and Eclipse Stakes. As a four-year-old he won the Aston Park Stakes and Princess of Wales's Stakes and was placed in the Coronation Cup, Grosser Preis von Berlin and Northern Dancer Turf Stakes. He began his fourth season by winning the Dubai City of Gold and followed up by recording his most valuable success when he took the Dubai Sheema Classic. Background Hawkbill is a chestnut colt with a broad white blaze and long white socks on his hind legs bred in Kentucky by the Helen K Groves Revokable Trust. As a yearling in September 2014 Hawkbill was offered for sale at Keeneland and bought for $350,000 by the John Ferguson on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation. The colt was sent to race in Europe and entered training with Charlie Appleby at Godolphin's British base in Newmarket. He was sired by Kenneth and Sarah Ramsey's stallion Kitten's Joy the U.S. Champion Male Turf Horse of 2004. His other offspring include Stephanie's Kitten, Bobby's Kitten and Big Blue Kitten. Hawkbilll's dam Trensa won three races from nineteen starts in the United States between 2006 and 2010. Her grand-dam Mochila was a half-sister to Cozzene. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Hawkbill began his racing career by finishing ninth of ten in a five furlong maiden race at Newbury Racecourse on 17 April. He was of the course for two months before returning in a similar event over seven furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse in which he finished third behind They Seek Him Here after leading for most of the way. In a maiden on the Polytrack surface at Lingfield Park Racecourse in July he was partnered for the first time by William Buick, who became his regular jockey. Starting the 11/10 favourite he took the lead a furlong out and won by a neck from Lazzam to record his first victory. Hawkbill's two remaining starts of 2015 were on the Polytrack course at Kempton. On 18 August he carried top weight of 133 pounds in a nursery handicap and won by three and a quarter lengths after leading for most of the way and drawing clear in the straight. He was then moved up in class and distance for a race over one mile on 9 September. After leading from the start and going three lengths clear early in the straight he was hard-pressed in the final strides before prevailing by a head from the Richard Hannon Jr.-trained Steel of Madrid. At the end of the season Hawkbill was sent to spend the winter at Godolphin's base in Dubai. =2016: three-year-old season= On his first appearance of 2016, Hawkbill started a 14/1 outsider in an eight-runner field for the Listed Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in which his opponents included the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère runner-up Cymric. After tracking the leaders he went to the front approaching the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from Abdon with the favourite Sky Kingdom in third. The colt was stepped up in class again at Royal Ascot when he was one of nine colts to contest the Group Three Tercentenary Stakes on 16 June. Abdon and the Cocked Hat Stakes runner-up Prize Money started 4/1 joint favourites ahead of the unbeaten Long Island Sound, with Hakwbill next in the betting on 11/2 alongside Blue de Vega (third in the Irish 2000 Guineas). After racing in third place behind the outsider Race Day, Hawkbill took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on to win by one and a quarter lengths from Prize Money, with a gap of almost three lengths back to Long Island Sound in third. After the race Appleby commented \\"We didn’t know how good he was until he went to Newmarket and since then he's thrived. It was a great ride from William and a great win for the team\\". On 2 July Hawkbill was moved up in class and was matched against older horses for the first time in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. The odds-on favourite was the Irish colt The Gurkha who had won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains before being narrowly beaten in the St James's Palace Stakes. Hawkbill was next in the betting alongside My Dream Boat (Prince of Wales's Stakes) and Time Test (Joel Stakes). The other three runners were Western Hymn (Brigadier Gerard Stakes), Bravery (fourth in the Irish 2000 Guineas) and Time Test's pacemaker Countermeasure. Hawkbill tracked the leader Countermeasure before taking the lead two furlongs out but was soon challenged and headed by The Gurkha. The two colts engaged in a prolonged struggle in the closing stages before Hawkbill gained the advantage in the final strides and won by half a length. Time Test took third ahead of Countermeasure. Buick commented \\"Hawkbill is a very good horse. He goes on the ground very well and the future is very bright for him\\". John Ferguson added \\"He's a horse that has improved and the sky is the limit for him. I think it's going to be a really enjoyable time now thinking where to go. There's no hurry and the horse has a great future in front of him.\\" Hawkbill bypassed the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and reappeared in the International Stakes at York Racecourse on 17 August. Starting the 6/1 second favourite in a strong field he tracked the leaders but weakened in the last quarter mile and finished eighth of the twelve runners behind Postponed. In the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse on 16 September he started a 16/1 outsider and finished ninth, twelve lengths behind the winner Almanzor. He ended his season with a trip to Germany, where he finished third behind the four-year- olds Guignol and Racing History in the Grosser Preis von Bayern over 2400 metres at Munich on 1 November. =2017: four-year-old season= Hawkbill began his third campaign on 1 May in the Prix Ganay, run that year at Saint- Cloud Racecourse. He briefly took the lead in the straight but was outsprinted in the closing stages and finished fifth of the seven runners behind Cloth of Stars. Nineteen days later the colt was dropped in class for the Group 3 Aston Park Stakes over one and a half miles on soft ground at Newbury Racecourse and started 3/1 favourite against five opponents. Buick sent him into the lead from the start and he was never seriously challenged, winning by two lengths from My Dream Boat. He then finished third to Highland Reel and Frontiersman in the Coronation Cup before running sixth behind Zarak in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. In the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket 13 July he started at odds of 7/1 against five opponents including Wings of Desire, Frontiersman, Algometer (Cocked Hat Stakes) and Western Hymn. He led from the start and won by three quarters of a length from Frontiersman. In his two remaining starts of 2017 Hawkbill finished runner-up to Dschingis Secret in the Grosser Preis von Berlin and was then sent to Canada where he was beaten a head by Johnny Bear in the Northern Dancer Turf Stakes. =2018: five-year-old season= Hawkbill was sent Dubai in early 2018 and began his campaign in the Group 2 Dubai City of Gold over 2400 metres on 10 March and started the 2/1 favourite against twelve opponents. Ridden by Buick he took the lead 300 metres from the finish and won by a head from his stablemate Frontiersman. Three weeks later over the same course and distance the horse contested the Group 1 Sheema Classic in which he faced nine opponents including Rey de Oro (Japanese Derby), Cloth of Stars, Poet's Word, Idaho and Satono Crown. The start was delayed when Hawkbill contrived to get his leg over the top of the starting stalls and had to be reloaded. Sent into the lead from the start by Buick, Hawkbill opened up a clear advantage approaching the straight and won \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths from Poet's Word. After the race Buick said \\"Physically he did well over the winter and we’ve always thought a lot of him. He relaxed well in front and was in a lovely rhythm. It was going to take a good one to get past him\\". On his return to Europe Hawkbill ran poorly when finishing a distant fifth behind Cracksman in the Coronation Cup on 1 June but produced a slightly better effort at Royal Ascot later that month when he ran third to Poet's Word and Cracksman in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. In July the horse returned to Sandown as he attempted to repeat his 2016 success in the Eclipse Stakes. He led for most of the way but was overtaken approaching the final furlong and came home fourth behind Roaring Lion, Saxon Warrior and Cliffs of Moher, four lengths behind the winner. After a break of over two months Hawkbill was sent to Canada for a second time but ran poorly when unplaced behind Johnny Bear in the Northern Dancer Turf Stakes on 15 September. Hawkbill's retirement from racing was announced on 9 October. Charlie Appleby commented \\"He was a wonderful racehorse who will be remembered for bringing Moulton Paddocks to the international stage. He was an ambassador for Godolphin who gave everybody connected with him immense pleasure. He was hugely popular in the yard. Now he is set to enjoy a well-deserved retirement\\". Stud career Hawkbill commenced stallion duties in 2020 for Godolphin at their Darley Stud in Japan for a fee of 1 million yen.

It takes its name after Admiral Cort Adeler who lived there for the last seven years of his life in the 17th century. History The house was built about 1630 for count Jens Sparre. It was later adapted for Admiral Cort Adeler who acquired it in 1768 and lived there until his death in 1775. Thomas Potter, founder of Denmark's first iron foundry, lived in the building from 1797 until 1807. He had previously lived in the Potter House overlooking Christianshavn Canal. The priest and philanthropist Carl Johan Visby (1801-1871) was a resident in the building from 1831 until 1844. The military officer N. C. Lunding (1795-1871) had his home in the building from 1735 until 1842. He would later command the Danish troops in Fredericia in the war against Germany in 1848. The zoologist H. N. Krøyer (1799-1870) lived in the building in 1840-1842. Architecture The house was originally a two-storey building. It was extended with an extra floor in 1770 by the merchant Søren Lyche who then owned it. The Mansard roof dates from an adaption in 1927. The building at No. 24 was until 1743 part of the property. The houses were then both two stories high and six bays long. The side wing dates from the 17th century and was probably built at the same time as the building facing the street. It was originally two stories high but adapted in 1943. A rear wing attached to the side wing is from 1933. It is five bays wide, four floors tall and has a Mansard roof. On the wall in the courtyard is a white marble plaque with an inscription in gilded lettering stating that Cort Adeler lived in the building 1768-1775.

The FCSO is responsible for patrolling the 499-square miles of the County and its 17,000+ residents. The FCSO currently employs 20 sworn full-time law enforcement officers, 7 part-time sworn officers and over 20 Correctional Officers. The current Sheriff of Fentress County is Michael Reagan.  Sheriff's sex scandal  On Tuesday April 11, 2017 around 9:30 a.m. the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Department of Justice executed a search warrant on the Fentress County Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Charles \\"Chucky\\" Cravens. The FBI and TBI went into the sheriff's office and jail with around 20 agents and began seizing items from the Fentress County Sheriff's Office. Agents confiscated computer files, documents, and 2 sheriffs department vehicles. The Fentress County Sheriff's Office and Deputy Chief Ledbetter released a joint statement saying: We are disappointed and shocked by Cravens past actions and his admissions. Our focus remains on the day-to- day operation at the sheriff's office and the justice center. We echo 8th District Attorney General Jared Effler's sentiments in that 'we are committed to serve and protect the citizens of Fentress County.' The actions of Cravens do NOT reflect the brave men and women we have the privilege of working with on a daily basis.\\" Fentress County Government and Fentress County Sheriff's Office have no further comment at this time, and with today's events we look forward to putting this matter behind us as we move forward to restore confidence with the professionalism and integrity that the people deserve. \\"Today, another public official was sentenced to prison for violating their sworn oath to uphold the law,\\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Jack Smith in a news release. \\"There are dire consequences when elected officials violate the public's trust and place their own interest above that of their constituents.\\" Cravens was in charge of operations at the Fentress County Jail in Jamestown, TN. An inmate claims she had unprotected sex with the sheriff in his office in July 2016. According to federal investigators, Cravens talked with two female inmates about having sex with them and leaving the jail together. Cravens reportedly drove the inmates to a trailer, which is where they had unprotected sex. Investigators say Cravens maintained relationships with these inmates until they were released in February 2017. Cravens was also accused of driving a third female inmate outside of the county to visit a relative. The inmate claims she had unprotected sex with Cravens during that trip. Federal officials say Cravens used his position to deliver \\"additional benefits\\" to the inmates he was involved in sexual relationships with, including being allowed outside to smoke and leaving the jail to visit relatives. Cravens is also accused of kicking a male inmate and putting him in a headlock while he was being handcuffed. The inmate claims Cravens hit him in the back of the head twice while he was handcuffed. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the FBI both assisted in the investigation. In Federal court Charles \\"Chucky\\" Cravens, 47, was charged with three counts of honest services fraud and one count of deprivation of rights under color of law. Cravens was sentenced to 33 months in the Petersburg Low Federal Correctional Facility where he is scheduled to be released on March 14, 2020 (Inmate Number: 25236-075). The FBI does not talk when it is executing search warrants and collecting evidence, but it was pretty clear when it seized Fentress County Sheriff Chucky Cravens' truck and put it on a wrecker that he was the target. The FBI and TBI went into the sheriff's office and jail Tuesday morning. About 20 agents were seizing items from the Fentress County Sheriff's Office for hours. Agents came out with plenty of items, including paper records and computer files. Agents then brought them out to the mobile command center for processing. At the same time, other agents were spread all over the county conducting interviews and seizing evidence. What was the target of the investigation? Well, that's a secret, for now. Who was the target? That's not so secret. Inside the District Attorney's Office, agents were interviewing Sheriff Cravens. Just outside the office, the sheriff's confiscated vehicle was going to be carried back to Nashville for processing. Cravens is a lifetime Fentress County resident. He grew up in Clarkrange, graduated high school and moved quickly into law enforcement. Cravens was elected Fentress County sheriff in 2006 and lasted one term. Then he came back and ran successfully again in 2014. Cravens ran on a platform of an \\"officer in every school, open door policy,\\" and treating all people with dignity. Right now, the FBI will only say it is investigating allegations of impropriety. Meanwhile, some residents say this is a long time coming. \\"This is a good day for a lot of people in this county,\\" Jack Baker Sr. said. \\"I thought there would be a whole bunch of people cheering, but I am cheering in my heart because nothing I hate worse than someone who abuses their authority or neglects their authority.\\" The FBI and TBI took files, took computers, but they did not take the sheriff. He is not under arrest, and that puts the county executive in a tough position. \\"Things may change by the hour, but at this point in time nothing has changed,\\" County Executive J. Michael Cross said. \\"I am going to sit down with the county attorney and talk about our options. We want to be cautious. We want to be prudent, not overreact. We are concerned, deeply concerned, and will help with the investigation any way we can.\\" References Sheriff's Office Sheriffs' offices of Tennessee ","title":"Fentress County Sheriff's Office (Tennessee)"},{"id":"51360559","title":"Nicholas Scarvelis"},{"id":"51360572","text":"Rosa Keleku (born 16 January 1995) is a Democratic Republic of the Congo taekwondo athlete.

History Daqneesh was injured on August 17, 2016, in an alleged Russian Air Force strike on the rebel-held al-Qaterji neighbourhood of Aleppo, Syria. He suffered a wound to his head and was taken to a hospital known as M10 and later discharged. Daqneesh was rescued with his parents and three siblings, then aged one, six, and ten. His ten-year-old brother, Ali, died on August 20, 2016, of his injuries. The apartment building collapsed shortly after the family was rescued. Eight people died in the air strike, including five children. The footage was released by the Aleppo Media Centre, a Syrian opposition activist group. Photojournalist Mahmoud Raslan, who photographed Daqneesh, and journalist Mustafa al-Sarout, who filmed him, both spoke to Western media about the iconic photo. Russia Today interviewed Sara Flounders of the International Action Center who said that Raslan's social media suggested previoous support for rebel group Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement. The image of him sitting bloodied in an ambulance after being dragged from the rubble of his home caused international outrage and was widely featured in newspapers and social media. It has been compared with photographs of Alan Kurdi, a child refugee of the Syrian Civil War who drowned trying to reach Europe. In June 2017, new photos and videos of the boy emerged from Syrian government media. In an interview with Kinana Alloush, a presenter for Syrian state TV, Omran’s father said that his son had been used as a 'propaganda tool' by rebel forces, and that the family had always been pro- government. His father also criticized rebel groups in Aleppo for attempting to exploit his family as propaganda to push for regime-change.

It was discovered in 2010 and is a component of the skin flora in healthy adults. Discovery HPyV6 was first discovered in 2010 by rolling circle amplification, a genetic technique that efficiently amplifies and detects circular DNA, such as a polyomavirus genome. It was identified as a component of skin flora in healthy adults, along with Merkel cell polyomavirus (which can cause Merkel cell cancer) and Human polyomavirus 7. Taxonomy HPyV6 is closely related to HPyV7, which was discovered at the same time; the two viruses' genomes share 68% sequence identity. In the 2015 taxonomic update to the polyomavirus group, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses classified HPyV6 as the type species of the genus Deltapolyomaviridae. This group contains only four viruses, all of which infect humans: HPyV6, HPyV7, MW polyomavirus, and STL polyomavirus. Prevalence All known human polyomaviruses are fairly common in healthy adult populations and are usually asymptomatic. In studies that profile polyomavirus seroprevalence, or prevalence of detectable antibodies against viral proteins indicating either past or present exposure in immunocompetent adults, estimates of HPyV6 prevalence have ranged from approximately 60–85%, with evidence of low prevalence among children and increasing prevalence with age. The age-dependent pattern of seroprevalence featuring a decline at around six months old is consistent with the transmission of maternal antibodies. A study of cutaneous viruses in men found prevalence of HPyV6 DNA—indicating actively replicating virus—at around 12%. Another similar study reported HPyV6 DNA prevalence at around 30%, with 24% showing persistent viral shedding over time. Clinical manifestations As with many recently discovered human polyomaviruses, the clinical significance of HPyV6 is poorly characterized. Attempts to detect polyomaviruses in a variety of tumor types have consistently found that HPyV6 is either absent or present at very low viral loads, indicating that it is unlikely to be causally related to the tumor. HPyV6, and the closely related HPyV7, have been linked to skin rashes known as pruritic and dyskeratotic dermatoses in immunocompromised patients in case reports, though a causal association has not yet been established.

He was killed in June 1944 in France after being taken hostage by the Resistance, leaving Peters and her four daughters behind. Personal life After her graduation in 1933, Peters attended courses in the fine arts at the Art School of Lerchenfeld. In 1944, she had her first exhibition of paintings at Rothenbaum in Hamburg, displaying landscape watercolors and portraits. She met fellow painter Gustav Hagemann during a trip to Scandinavia, she met in 1956, with whom she became close friends. During this time, she made many trips to Lapland, during which she created many watercolors, oil paintings and woodblock prints. Further journeys lead Lilo Peters to Egypt, Morocco, Nepal, Mexico, Guatemala and the United States. In 1977, Peters began to take an interest in sculpting. She created numerous sculptures that are on display in Timmendorfer Strand, where she lived from 1946 until her death. There are also plenty of her sculptures on display in Carrara, Italy, where her studio was located. Until her death in 2001, she was good friends with and created artistic pieces with Eutin sculptor Pierre Schumann. Peters died from old age on April 2, 2001 in Travemünde.

Edward Lhuyd (1660–1709), the Celtic philologist, spent four months in 1700 in Cornwall learning Cornish as the basis for his planned Cornish-English vocabulary. His main informants included James Jenkins, John Keigwin, the Reverend Henry Ustick and Nicholas Boson. Lhuyd published a phonetically spelled transcript of Jenkins' verses. James Jenkins died in 1710. Although little of his work has survived, during his lifetime Jenkins was considered one of the most learned of writers in Cornish.

She attended elementary and secondary schooling in Szentgotthárd and Győr, Budapest. In 1939, Farkas entered university and graduated in 1944 and with a degree as a mathematics and physics teacher from Pázmány Péter Catholic University in Budapest.

During 1960s her work shifted increasingly to the study of atmospheric ozone including the measurement of total ozone with the Dobson ozone spectrophotometer. She became one of a small international group of atmospheric scientists dedicated to the study of atmospheric ozone-interest in which, in that era, was largely in use as a tracer to aid atmospheric circulation studies. Her work contributed substantially towards the discovery of the \\"hole in the ozone layer\\" which changed the world's behavior towards pollution forever. Her interest in atmospheric ozone measurement led naturally to the application of her expertise to the monitoring of surface ozone as part of air pollution studies and also to the measurement of atmospheric turbidity. Farkas was the first Hungarian woman and also the first female New Zealand MetService staff member to set foot in Antarctica in 1975. Her World War II diaries form the basis of a book titled The Farkas Files.

This is his eleventh fictional work. It is about a man named Alain, who has not seen his mother since his childhood; Ramon, an intellectual who has retired; D’Ardelo, a man who has a narcissistic personality; Charles and “Caliban” are two people who operate a catering firm; and Quaquelique is an old man who remains attracted to women. Quaquelique manages to seduce women using his skill at non-stop talking. The novel is set in Paris. The themes include \\"the erotic potential; the link between mother and child; the procreative role of sex; angels...[,] navel gazing...and insignificance. The novels' characters discuss the philosophical ideas of Hegel, Kant and Schopenhauer. The novel is made up of seven parts (an approach he also used in his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being, among others, and representative of a structure he laid out in his book The Art of the Novel). The theme of insignificance was also used in The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Reception The Guardian stated that \\"...there’s something very appealing in the flavour and personality of this new short novel...\\" The Guardian states that while \\"[p]erhaps the textures of the novel are thin, and perhaps it does seem to circle around some missing centre – of drive, or story. But then again, that’s part of the point: everything ends in Ramon’s hymn to insignificance, celebrating the life that doesn’t signify anything, the world that is just itself “in all its obviousness, all its innocence, in all its beauty”. And indeed this austere prose – with its elusive ironies, and aura of the 18th century – works beautifully, just as itself, in Linda Asher’s translation from the French.\\" Plot Alain is strolling down a Paris street, examining women and he comes up with an explanation for their thighs, buttocks, and breasts, he fails to grasp the mystery behind the seductive power of their navel, Around the same time, Alain’s recently retired friend, Ramon, is in the Luxembourg Gardens admiring the sculptures. Ramon runs into his wealthy friend, D’Ardelo, and they gossip about Madame Franck. They both admire her courage in the face of her husband’s death. Ramon invites D’Ardelo to his birthday party; D’Ardelo confesses that he has untreatable cancer and will soon die, though none of this is true. Ramon believes the lie, and D’Ardelo is pleased that he was so convincing. After parting Ramon visits his friend Charles to discuss a cocktail party they are planning. However, they become distracted gossiping about Quaquelique, a friend of theirs whom they find banal and unfunny to be around. Ramon mentions that Quaquelique has more success with women than D’Ardelo. Charles explains that Quaquelique’s personality is more agreeable than D’Ardelo’s. They both agree that D’Ardelo is a narcissist but still feel sorry for him because of his non-existent disease. Caliban, an out of work actor, joins Ramon and Charles. They talk about a story Charles recently read in the book Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev. Caliban laughs off the story about Stalin, but Charles makes the point that people under Stalin wouldn’t have found it very funny. However, they agree that the story must have been intended as a joke and the only reason it was misunderstood was that no one knew what a joke was anymore. Meanwhile, Alain continues to think about women’s bodies, specifically the navel. He recalls an event from his childhood in which he thought he noticed his mother staring at his navel with contempt and pity. His mother abandoned him shortly after that. Alain tells Charles about this, and Charles confesses that he has been thinking about his mother recently as well. Before they can continue, however, they have to get ready for a party. Caliban is working at the party as a waiter. While working at such events, he often pretends to be Pakistani, speaking in a made-up language. He and Charles see this as a joke, but how it is meant to be funny remains unclear. Ramon attempts to speak to Caliban in French, but Caliban warns him not to spoil the joke. Ramon is afraid that Caliban’s joke might land him in jail and laments society’s lack of humor. Caliban makes it through the party undiscovered and goes to Alain’s for a drink. The next morning, Alain senses the presence of his mother. He imagines his mother apologizing to him for bringing him into the world without his consent, while Alain apologizes for coming into his mother’s life without being asked. He meets Ramon and D’Ardelo in the Luxembourg Gardens, and they stroll among the statues. Children are busy setting up the park for a concert. Ramon, who still believes that D’Ardelo is soon to die, tells him that it is important to maintain a good sense of humor and a positive mood, including joking and pranking. The men feel light-hearted and happy as the children in the park begin to sing “La Marseilles.” See also *Insignificance References 2013 novels Novels by Milan Kundera Éditions Gallimard books ","title":"The Festival of Insignificance"},{"id":"51361022","text":"Fossy Church is a medieval church and National Monument in County Laois, Ireland.

Origins In 1882 the Bala and Ffestiniog Railway opened the line from to a temporary terminus at , Trawsfynydd was one of the stations opened with the line; the future Cwm Prysor Halt would be on this line, east of Trawsfynydd. At Festiniog passengers had to transfer to narrow gauge trains if they wished to continue northwards. To do this people travelling from Bala to Blaenau or beyond walked the few yards from the standard gauge train to the narrow gauge train, much as they do today between the Conwy Valley Line and the Ffestiniog Railway at . The following year the narrow gauge line was converted to standard gauge, but narrow gauge trains continued to run until 5 September 1883 using a third rail. Standard gauge trains first ran through from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog on 10 September 1883. The line was taken over by the Great Western Railway in 1910. Cwm Prysor was a later addition to the line, opened in 1902. At it stood at the summit of the route in very thinly populated uplands with no obvious source of traffic, for example, the station house's nearest neighbour was a mile away. Conversely, the people who did live and work in the area had no other obvious means of transport. The location served traffic purposes as much as being a point where goods and passengers boarded or alighted, in that: * staff or the public could use the station and signalbox to warn of snow or other severe weather blockages * the signalbox broke up an otherwise very long section, which could result in trains being stuck or held for very long periodsThe signalbox and section, via Great Western Archives * a passing loop was installed in 1908, primarily used by troop trains to or from * the level crossing next to the station was operated by railway staff until the last. Description The unstaffed halt's single platform's edge was made of wood, the platform itself being infilled with ash and cinders. It was a mere long, sufficient for just two coaches to draw alongside at one time, though one or two coach trains were normal in later years. The amenities provided were a platform shelter and an oil lamp; access was by a country lane. The Stationmistress who ran Cwm Prysor station - Harriet James - lived at Trawsfynydd and had to cycle nearly each day to Cwm Prysor through open terrain. Services The station enjoyed its best passenger services in its closing years. Until 3 July 1938 Cwm Prysor was a request stop, but after that date most trains were timetabled to call. The September 1959 timetable shows * Northbound ** three trains calling at all stations from Bala to Blaenau on Monday to Saturday ** an extra evening train calling at all stations from Bala to Blaenau on Saturday ** a Monday to Friday train calling at all stations from Bala to Trawsfynydd * The journey time from Bala to Cwm Prysor Halt was around 30 minutes. * Southbound ** three trains calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala on Monday to Saturday ** two extra trains calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala on Saturday ** an extra train calling at all stations from Blaenau to Trawsfynydd on Saturday evening ** a Monday to Friday train calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala, except Llafar, Bryn-celynog and Cwm Prysor Halts * The journey time from Blaenau to Cwm Prysor Halt was 50 minutes, except for one Saturdays Only train which took one hour and 13 minutes because it sat at Trawsfynydd for 25 minutes. * There was no Sunday service. After the Second World War at the latest most trains were composed of two carriages, with one regular turn comprising just one brake third coach. At least one train along the line regularly ran as a mixed train, with a second between Bala and Arenig. By that time such trains had become rare on Britain's railways. Workmen's trains had been a feature of the line from the outset; they were the Festiniog and Blaenau Railway's biggest source of revenue. Such a service between Trawsfynydd and Blaenau Ffestiniog survived to the line's closure to passengers in 1960.1960 Working timetable, via 2D53 Up to 1930 at the earliest such services used dedicated, lower standard, coaches which used a specific siding at Blaenau where the men boarded from and alighted to the ballast.Blaenau Ffestiniog (GWR) track layout, via Signalling Record Society Closure By the 1950s the line was deemed unremunerative. A survey undertaken in 1956 and 1957 found that the average daily numbers of passengers boarding and alighting were: *Blaenau Ffestiniog Central 62 and 65 *Manod Halt 7 and 4 *Teigl Halt 5 and 5 *Festiniog 28 and 26 *Maentwrog Road 8 and 6 *Trawsfynydd Lake Halt 1 and 1 *Trawsfynydd 28 and 24 *Llafar Halt 2 and 2 *Bryn-Celynog Halt 2 and 2 *Cwm Prysor Halt 3 and 3 *Arenig 5 and 5 *Capel Celyn Halt 7 and 8 *Tyddyn Bridge Halt 4 and 6 *Frongoch 18 and 15 *Bala 65 and 58 Military traffic had ended and, apart from a finite contract to bring cement to Blaenau in connection with the construction of Ffestiniog Power Station freight traffic was not heavy, most arriving and leaving Bala did so from and to the south and that to Blaenau could be handled from the Conwy Valley Line northwards. In 1957 Parliament authorised Liverpool Corporation to flood a section of the line by damming the Afon Tryweryn. Monies were made available to divert the route round the dam, but it was decided that improving the road from Bala to Llan Ffestiniog would be of greater benefit. Road transport alternatives were established for groups such as schoolchildren and workers. The plans afoot for rail serving Trawsfynydd nuclear power station were to be catered for by building the long-discussed cross-town link between the two Blaenau standard gauge stations. The estimated financial savings to be made were £23,300 by withdrawing the passenger service and £7000 in renewal charges. The halt closed in January 1960 but freight services between Bala and Blaenau continued for a further year, the last train of all passing on 27 January 1961. The track though the halt was lifted in the 1960s. In 1964 the line reopened from Blaenau southwards to a siding near the site of where a large (\\"Goliath\\") gantry was erected to load and unload traffic for the then new Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. The main goods transported were nuclear fuel rods carried in nuclear flasks. The new facility was nearly eight route miles north of Cwm Prysor Halt, so the reopening brought no reprieve. Special trains Rail enthusiasts' special trains traversed the line from time to time, notably the \\"last train\\" from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog and return on 22 January 1961. The halt and art The mountainous countryside around Arenig was of particular interest to James Dickson Innes who introduced his friend Augustus John to the area. Innes painted several works which have been publicly displayed to some renown, such as \\"Arenig, North Wales\\".The painting \\"Arenig, North Wales\\", via Tate Gallery He and his friend are known to have used the railway as a means of getting to remote spots, as well as to arrive and depart for London and elsewhere, Cwm Prysor and its stationmistress being specifically mentioned in at least one resumee of Innes's life and work.Innes's use of the line, via Keith Bowen, Artist The station site in the 21st Century In 2015 the station building was in use as a private residence.The station hose in modern times, via Geograph The trackbed in both directions from the halt was clearly defined both on satellite imagery and on the ground. The future Between 2000 and 2011 there were at least two attempts to put the remaining line to use, but none of these aspired to come close to the site of the halt. As the line of route to the east has been severed by Llyn Celyn the prospects of revival must be very remote. To considerable local surprise fresh moves to reopen the line from Blaenau as far south as Trawsfynydd began in September 2016, with the formation of The Trawsfynydd & Blaenau Ffestiniog Community Railway Company. On 21 September at least one regional newspaper reported that \\"Volunteers are set to start work this weekend on clearing vegetation from the trackbed between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd.\\" The company was quoted as saying \\"We have been given a licence by Network Rail to clear and survey the line.\\" See also * Cwm Prysor Viaduct References =Sources=        * Further material  * External links * The station site on a navigable OS Map National Library of Scotland * The station on a navigable 1953 OS map npe Maps * The halt and line Rail Map Online * The line LJT2 with mileages Railway Codes * Reminiscences by a local railwayman Forgotten Relics * The station Forgotten Relics * Festiniog and Blaenau Railway Festipedia * Driver's view through the station to Blaenau YouTube * Several photos of the line Penmorfa * Several photos of the line Penmorfa * The line in 2009 The Railway Muddler * 1960 Working timetable 2D53 * Details and photos of 22 Jan 1961 railtour Six Bells Junction * The 1961 last train special YouTube * The trackbed in 2009 Keith O'Brien * Scenes along the trackbed flickr * The line RM Web * The signalbox in context Severn Valley Railway * The signalbox diagram Signalling Record Society Disused railway stations in Gwynedd Llanycil Former Great Western Railway stations Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1960 Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1902 ","title":"Cwm Prysor Halt railway station"},{"id":"51361360","text":"Ari Lahti (born 1963) is a Finnish businessman and the owner of KuPS of the Veikkausliiga.

She first appears in the series thirty episode \\"Cradle to Grave\\", broadcast on 19 September 2015. The character is introduced as an F2 doctor for a workplace bullying storyline with registrar Lily Chao (Crystal Yu), appearing for a stint of eight episodes. Alicia is characterised as bright, bubbly and a try-hard, making her appear naive. Despite this, Alicia is a brilliant doctor who always does more than is acceptable for her patients. Alicia's backstory states that she has grown up in Newcastle where she attended medical school, but recently moved to Holby. Halfpenny reprised the role in August 2016 and the character was involved in a story about how separation affects adults. Alicia then became embroiled in a love triangle between brothers Caleb \\"Cal\\" Knight (Richard Winsor) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford), and a subsequent relationship with Ethan, which ends following Cal's death. Producers later involved Alicia in a two-part special set in France, followed by a focus on Alicia's career, which saw her become a specialty registrar in pediatric emergency medicine. Alicia's development continues as she creates an anonymous blog criticising the ED's ongoing problems after becoming disillusioned with the NHS. Producers then explored the topic of rape and sexual consent in a new storyline arc for Alicia after she is raped by F1 doctor Eddie McAllister (Joe Gaminara). Halfpenny decided to leave the drama in 2018 and Alicia departs in the twenty episode of series thirty-three, broadcast on 19 January 2019. The character and her storylines have been well received by critics, with Elaine Reilly of What's on TV writing that she arrived in \\"a puff of pink hair and optimism\\".  Casting  Chelsea Halfpenny was cast in the role of Alicia. Alicia was previewed to viewers through a show trailer released on the show's official website on 15 July 2015. It featured a clip of Halfpenny wearing doctor's scrubs. Halfpenny confirmed her casting in August 2015 via Twitter, expressing her delight at joining the series. She revealed her first episode would air on 19 September 2015. Halfpenny had previously appeared on the show as a patient, Karine, in the series eighteen episode \\"What Parents Do\\". Derek Thompson, who plays Charlie Fairhead, remembered Halfpenny from her guest appearance because of her \\"unusual\\" surname. Halfpenny recalled her guest appearance and praised the cast then and upon her return. She added that she found it easy to make friends within the cast. The character was introduced during the series thirty episode \\"Cradle to Grave\\", broadcast on 19 September 2015. Halfpenny had two auditions for the character and believed that because producers had an idea about the character, she did not have to attend several auditions. She auditioned for the show's casting director in her first audition. Halfpenny described her second audition as \\"overwhelming\\" and \\"so stressful\\". In her section audition, she screen-tested with Crystal Yu (who portrays Lily) and performed an operation on a mannequin which she said was hard. Halfpenny struggled with the 'operation' and was \\"squeamish\\" so the medical advisor and Yu assisted her. Halfpenny struggled to pronounce the medical terminology and was nervous when she had a single line in a scene in case she forgot it. Halfpenny also had to learn how to stitch for the role. In 2016, Halfpenny shadowed an A&E; doctor which she described as \\"really interesting.\\" She hoped that shadowing a doctor would allow her to make her acting appear more \\"realistic\\" and said she was \\"more confident with things like CPR\\", but would not be able to perform it in real life.  Development  = Characterisation and introduction = Alicia is billed as \\"bright and bubbly\\" and Halfpenny said that \\"she's got blonde and pink hair, so people expect her to be a bit ditzy, but she's not.\\" She called Alicia \\"a bit of a try-hard\\" because she tries to impress everyone, making her appear naive. She added that Alicia was \\"a young and kind person\\". Alicia is a \\"typical junior doctor\\" and very talented at her job which shows when she starts working. A BBC Online reporter described her as \\"effortlessly brilliant and passionate about her chosen subject – medicine\\". She is a positive person and \\"a joy to have in the department\\". Halfpenny was highly publicised for playing Amy Wyatt in the British soap opera Emmerdale, and she contrasted Alicia's characteristics with that of Amy, stating that whilst Amy \\"lied quite a lot\\", Alicia is \\"very happy-go-lucky\\". She said she also preferred smiling to being miserable, which Amy was known for being. Halfpenny reflected on Alicia's characterisation in 2018, noting that Alicia joined the show as \\"a naïve girl\\" who struggled with serious injuries and found herself getting over involved in patients' lives, but over the course of her time on drama, Alicia has become more \\"professional\\". Alicia's backstory states that she had recently graduated from medical school, which not only made her a brilliant doctor, but also a \\"genuinely nice person to be around.\\" In an interview with Olivia Heath (Reveal), Halfpenny described Alicia as a \\"clever girl\\" and \\"a quick learner\\" who does not appreciate how hard working in the ED is, but despite that is professional. On-screen, the character Connie Beauchamp (portrayed by Amanda Mealing) described Alicia as \\"a breath of fresh air\\". Her positive nature can also cause her to be portrayed as annoying. Alicia's popularity among her colleagues irritated Lily Chao (Crystal Yu), who struggled to connect with them personally. In addition to this, Alicia tried to \\"have a laugh\\" with Lily, who had \\"none of it\\". Halfpenny opined that because Alicia is kind, she wanted to give Lily a hug and \\"understand\\" her. Halfpenny described Alicia's first shift as \\"hell on earth\\" and revealed that Alicia would impress her colleagues, apart from Lily, when she spots a vulnerable patient. Halfpenny hoped fans would like Alicia, but worried that they may be annoyed by her cheerfulness. Halfpenny did not watch any of her scenes before they aired and said that she was \\"nervous\\" about watching her first scenes. Of her introduction, Halfpenny said that she was \\"enjoying this new chapter\\" of her career. = Workplace bullying and departure = Halfpenny's initial stint on the show revolved around a storyline which saw her bullied by her mentor Lily. Lily disliked Alicia's popularity and sound medical skills and Halfpenny believed that Lily was \\"threatened\\" by someone with both those skills. She began to resent Alicia and started expressing her resentment of her in front of their colleagues. Yu described Lily's actions as bullying, but believed that she bullied her because she was grieving for her father. Lily did not realise that she was bullying Alicia and Yu explained that \\"Lily says things in the heat of the moment and then regrets them, but she’s too proud to own up or say sorry to Alicia.\\" Alicia coped well with Lily's treatment of her for several weeks and Halfpenny explained that Alicia has an \\"outlook on life where she doesn’t take everything to heart\\", which meant she felt \\"quite bad for Lily about her father’s death\\" and wanted to be her friend. When Lily's attitude worsens, Alicia starts to realise how bad their situation is. Halfpenny believed that Alicia's vulnerability made her \\"even more of a target\\" for Lily. Alison Graham of Radio Times and Elaine Reilly of What's on TV both believed Lily was \\"jealous\\" of Alicia, with Reilly also describing Lily's constant criticism as a \\"sustained bullying campaign\\" against Alicia. Halfpenny was only signed to appear in eight episodes and departed in the series 30 episode, \\"Avoidable Harm\\", broadcast on 14 November 2015. The episode was centric to Alicia and Halfpenny voiceovered the episode. She described it as \\"high drama\\" where viewers discover more about Alicia. Halfpenny described it as \\"the most challenging couple of weeks\\" of her career because she \\"had so much to do\\". The show's executive producer, Oliver Kent, teased the episode before its airing, promising \\"a huge crisis of conscience\\" for the character which would make her question \\"her faith in her career.\\" The episode left Alicia's future \\"open ended\\" and Halfpenny speculated whether Lily's constant criticism caused her to end her career as a doctor. Halfpenny described Alicia's departure as \\"sad\\", while Reilly described Alicia's final shift as \\"harrowing\\". In the episode, a child in Alicia's care goes missing, but in her search for the child, she is forced to treat a seriously injured man, who is being followed by his partner's violent father, in the back of a van. Halfpenny explained that Alicia realises \\"the true depths of the job\\" when in the van. Alicia saves the man's life and when the father gives up, he accidentally runs down his daughter and despite Alicia's best efforts to save her back in the department, she dies. Lily publicly berates Alicia in the department's reception, taking her bullying to a new level. Yu described the scene as \\"an explosion of all the emotions Lily has been feeling\\", adding it was \\"a shame that Alicia is on the receiving end of it!\\" Alicia struggles to cope with her emotions and Halfpenny said Alicia questioned whether she was \\"strong enough\\" to be a doctor. Alicia decided to quit her job at the hospital following Lily's bullying and Halfpenny described her decision as \\"impulsive\\". She said that Alicia was under pressure and felt \\"lonely\\" because she was lacking support from Lily. Following Alicia's resignation, Lily's colleagues accused her of bullying Alicia, making her briefly feel guilty. Yu explained that Lily felt guilty, but believed that because of her bad experience being mentored by Martin Ashford (Patrick Robinson), Alicia should receive the same treatment from her. Lily realises that she has made a mistake in her actions towards Alicia, but it is too late and it \\"gets to the point where she's way beyond saying sorry\\". Yu disliked filming scenes where she was mean to Halfpenny as they were friends off-screen. Reflecting on the role, Halfpenny said that the episodes were \\"really nice\\" for her and that she \\"really enjoyed it\\" and had \\"a great time\\", describing it as \\"action-packed\\". Her role in Casualty had reminded her why she had left Emmerdale, because she had \\"wanted to do other things\\". = Reintroduction = Following her departure in 2015, Halfpenny teased a possible return for her character. In November 2015, the show's series producer Erika Hossington suggested that Alicia's departure was \\"an 'au revoir' and not a goodbye\\", teasing that the character should face Lily. Halfpenny later expressed her desire to return to the show as a regular cast member. She told Soaplife that she enjoyed her time on the show and wished it had been more permanent. The show's Summer 2016 trailer featured a clip of Halfpenny, with Radio Times confirming that she had returned to the role of Alicia. Oliver Kent confirmed that Alicia would be returning to the show, with TV Times magazine predicting that Alicia's return would be \\"bound to cause a stir\\". Halfpenny promised \\"interesting storylines\\" for Alicia. Alicia returns as a locum doctor, following her parents' divorce, which would delight Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford) and Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka). Alicia tries to avoid Lily, but realises she is not as nasty as before and decides to stay at the hospital. Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy described the announcement as \\"good news for Casualty fans\\". = Introduction of parents = Alicia's parents, Jackie Munroe (Tracey Wilkinson) and Howard Munroe (James Gaddas), were introduced in September 2016, having previously been mentioned on-screen. Jackie was admitted as a patient under Ethan's care and Jackie tries to set Alicia on a date with Ethan. Alicia is left with \\"the biggest shock of all\\" when Ethan reveals Jackie is diagnosed with gonorrhea. Alicia believed Jackie had had an affair, but she was devastated when Howard revealed he was having an affair and is leaving Jackie \\"for good\\". The characters were reintroduced in January 2017 for an episode which explored Alicia's backstory. Halfpenny described the episode as \\"really exciting\\" and said it would \\"delve deeper into family issues\\". She added that it was \\"great to have an episode that revolves around the personal life of your character\\" and the episode featured \\"the affect their marriage split has had on her.\\" Off-screen, Alicia's parents had reconciled, which Alicia disagreed with. In the episode, Howard was revealed to have had an affair with another man, leaving Alicia and Jackie devastated. In a 2017 interview with Digital Spy, Hossington discussed Alicia's upbringing, noting that \\"Alicia came from a very strong family\\" where she was content and unsuspecting, with her parents separating after she became an adult. She added that the show wanted to explore \\"what impact that has on you when you are grown up.\\" Halfpenny explained Alicia's family \\"have fallen apart\\" which has \\"made Alicia rethink what she believes love to be\\" and lose faith in relationships. Hossington supported this view and revealed Alicia \\"becomes very distrustful of men\\". = Ethan Hardy and Cal Knight = During her original stint, Halfpenny revealed that her character would not have a love interest, but suggested a love triangle between Alicia, Ethan and his brother, registrar Caleb \\"Cal\\" Knight (Richard Winsor). In July 2016, Winsor revealed to Duncan Lindsay (Metro) that Ethan and Cal would \\"end up competing\\" for the attention of an unnamed woman. He added that there would be \\"sparring between them, and few misunderstandings\\". Producers teased a possible romance for Alicia and Ethan when they became trapped together on two occasions. They became trapped in a sinkhole together and when Alicia began having a panic attack, Ethan comforted her. As they were rescued, Alicia tried to kiss him. Lindsay predicted \\"complications\\" in their relationship and teased that Cal \\"may develop a soft spot\\" for Alicia. He ran a poll asking readers for their opinion on who the character should date: 91% of people who answered said Ethan, while the other 9% opined Cal as the ideal partner for Alicia. A show trailer confirmed a love triangle between the characters. When Ethan failed to ask Alicia out, she began a relationship with Cal. Halfpenny explained that Alicia \\"looked to Cal for comfort and thought of him as a kindred spirit\\", despite knowing she should be with Ethan. She believed that Alicia \\"made the wrong choice at a time when she was feeling vulnerable.\\" After a date ended because of his feelings for Alicia, Ethan confessed his feelings for her. They had sex, which she \\"really [tries] to forget about it\\". Alicia chose to end her relationship with Cal and commit to Ethan, however, she had second thoughts and decided not to damage the brothers' relationship. Halfpenny believed that Alicia chose to stay with Cal because it was \\"the easiest option for herself\\" as she has developed feelings for Cal as well. Producers plotted a twist where Cal discovers someone else's cuff-link on her bedroom floor, taking the decision out of her hands. Halfpenny said that Alicia was shocked by Cal's discovery because she was not \\"expecting to get caught\\" and he \\"catches her off guard\\". Halfpenny believed that Alicia knew Ethan was the best partner for her because of the character's home life and previous relationships, but opined that Alicia should \\"go with her heart\\" and not \\"the easy option.\\" The three co-stars got along well with each other and had \\"a real laugh together\\" on set. They often find it \\"really hard\\" to not corpse. Hossington explained that Alicia's distrust in men first occurred as she met Ethan, \\"the most perfect man she could ever meet\\". She added that the \\"emotional turmoil\\" she is experiencing, as a result of her parents' separation, has left her \\"stuck\\" between two \\"incredibly close\\" brothers. In January 2017, Halfpenny revealed that the storyline had not been resolved in scenes the show was currently filming, which was five months ahead of transmission and quipped that \\"Nothing’s ever simple in Holby!\\" Hossington said the story would \\"carry on running\\" into spring 2017. Cal kept the cufflink and did not tell Alicia about his discovery. He continued to suspect Alicia of having an affair, which she was unaware of. Halfpenny explained that because Cal is \\"not usually that kind of person\\", Alicia does not suspect anything. Writers featured scenes of Cal's paranoia instead of scenes featuring the couple together and Halfpenny noted that Cal is not often seen in this respect so it is \\"fun to watch him squirm on screen for once\\". Cal finds Alicia's second phone in her locker and believes she \\"is having a separate life with someone else.\\" Halfpenny said that \\"Cal’s fears are confirmed in that moment\\" and he lashes out. She added that Ethan is the \\"last person\\" who Cal would suspect and he would be \\"wounded\\", \\"completely surprised and massively hurt\\" by the news. When Cal eventually discovers the truth, he kisses another woman. Ethan later requests Cal's permission to date Alicia, which he grants. While they are on their date, Cal is murdered, leaving Ethan and Alicia devastated. Rainsford commented, \\"It's typical that after a year of ups and downs and procrastinating, they got together on the day that Cal is murdered\\". In the aftermath of his death, Alicia and Ethan grow close and she comforts him. Rainsford explained that despite Ethan needing Alicia's support, it will be \\"difficult\\" for them. Ethan struggles with Cal's death and seeks revenge for his murder, adding strain to his relationship with Alicia. Halfpenny explained that while Alicia has feelings for Ethan, his revenge meant their relationship faltered. She hoped that the couple would reunite, but realised that the timing was not ideal. Rainsford confirmed that Alicia and Ethan's relationship has been \\"parked for now\\". In a September 2017 interview with Dainty (Digital Spy), producer Lucy Raffety called Alicia and Ethan \\"the lovely, glowy heart of the show\\" and expressed hope that the couple would reunite. She stated that within their relationship, they have a close friendship, which would be revisited and challenged. Rainsford reiterated this and confirmed that there was \\"discussions\\" to reunite the couple. = Volunteering and career progression = The serial announced plans to begin their thirty-second series with a two-part special set in Northern France on 30 July 2017. The special, which was filmed in Fishguard and Cardiff, follows Alicia, Louise Tyler (Aforka), Dylan Keogh (William Beck) and David Hide (Jason Durr) as they travel to France to offer their medical services at a refugee camp. After discovering that Cal had an interest in the project, Alicia and Louise decide to volunteer at the refugee camp as a legacy to him. On the journey to the camp, Alicia witnesses refugees attempting to flee their country and seriously injuring themselves in the process. Halfpenny explained that since the hospital environment is still \\"nerve-wracking\\" for Alicia, she is left \\"in pure shock\\" by the events in France. She added that when Alicia arrives, she goes \\"straight into doctor mode\\" and tries to commit to the job. The actress said the events portrayed in the episode are based on real-life situations which producers observed as research for the special. While in France, Alicia meets \\"young and good-looking\\" volunteer doctor Cameron Hamilton (Cian Barry), who has volunteered at the camp for a while. Alicia finds Cameron attractive and uses him as \\"light relief\\" for the situation surrounding her. Halfpenny explained that Alicia becomes \\"distracted\\" by Cameron and attempts to impress him, which does not happen. Halfpenny liked the special as she felt it build awareness on the issues tackled. She also enjoyed working away from the show's studio and likened it to filming a small film. Following her experience volunteering at the refugee camp, Alicia \\"develops more of a backbone\\" and decides to focus on her career. Halfpenny found Alicia's decision \\"really exciting\\" because she enjoys the challenge associated with the medical scenes. Alicia also decides to stop drinking and to not have any relationships so she can focus on her career. Halfpenny explained that since focusing on her career, Alicia has taken her job \\"more seriously\\" and as a result, she has been promoted to a specialty registrar and passed her exams. While she liked Alicia's promotion, Halfpenny also found it challenging to portray the medic who may often lead Resus. F1 doctors Rash Masum (Neet Mohan) and Bea Kinsella (Michelle Fox) join the drama in series 32. Alicia begins mentoring Rash and Bea; Halfpenny found it surreal that Alicia was mentoring two junior doctors as she was being mentored by Lily only recently. Raffety confirmed that Alicia and Bea would develop a friendship. Halfpenny found Alicia and Bea's friendship enjoyable to film. = Anonymous blog = On Bea's first day in the ED, the department faces a crisis, which Alicia and other staff struggle to control. Alicia is assigned to be Bea's mentor. Reilly (What's on TV) revealed that Alicia would face the consequences of Bea's actions after her behaviour becomes unacceptable. During the day, Alicia treats Kam Kainth (Gary Wood) in an ambulance due to a lack of space in the ED. Not being treated in the ED results in Kam being admitted to the Intensive Treatment Unit. On Alicia's feelings towards this, Halfpenny said, \\"That was the straw that broke the camel's back because Alicia knew it was avoidable.\\" She told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that she liked that Casualty could display what happens in British hospitals. When Halfpenny read the episode's script, she noticed something different about it in comparison to other episodes. She found this was more prominent when filming the episode. For the ED to appear busier, Fiona Walton, the episode's director, included more background artists in the scene. Halfpenny felt that the set was smaller with additional people on-set, but found the experience \\"fun\\" and commented, \\"It keeps you on your toes!\\" Walton wanted to accurately portray the NHS, which Halfpenny thought was \\"really important\\". Disillusioned with the NHS, Alicia creates an anonymous blog called \\"Rage in Resus\\", which outlines the struggles that the emergency department are facing. Halfpenny explained that Alicia finds the blog \\"important\\" and believes it is about more than the ED; it is about the NHS. The blog receives a lot of attention from hospital staff and the public, while also upsetting some people. Halfpenny stated that this was never Alicia's goal when she created the blog. As the acting clinical lead of the ED, Ethan is pressurised from his superiors to find out the bloggers' identity. The pressure becomes too much for Ethan and he confides in Alicia about the situation, making Alicia feel guilty about her role in the situation. While comforting him, Alicia and Ethan kiss. Halfpenny said that Alicia believes that Ethan will never know that she is the creator of the blog. The actress hoped that fans of the couple would be pleased by their reconciliation, although she admitted that the weather was cold and windy when they filmed the scenes, which she disliked. After Alicia and Ethan have sex, she hopes that he will share details about the management of the ED with her. Alicia is \\"fuming\\" when Ethan warns her that at work, he is her boss and she is under his instruction. When Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) warns Ethan to find the owner of the blog, Alicia begins to struggle with the pressure of maintaining her secret. Ethan reaches \\"the end of his teather\\" while trying to find the blog owner and accuses Alicia of being responsible. Halfpenny explained that Alicia did not think that Ethan would accuse her due to their close relationship. She stated that Alicia becomes \\"more and more panicked\\" by the popularity of the blog, although she believes that the blog is directed at the ED and its leadership rather than Ethan himself. Alicia denies being responsible for the blog; on Alicia's decision to confess, Halfpenny commented, \\"It's not the right time for her to confess, because she's doing this blog to make a difference — she's doing it to help people.\\" She also felt that Ethan would be upset when he discovered that Alicia had lied to him. Junior doctor Rash Masum (Neet Mohan) becomes prepared to take the blame for the blog, which makes Alicia question her behaviour. The anonymous blog storyline also helps to progress Ethan and Alicia's relationship, although Halfpenny observed that \\"something always gets in the way\\" of their relationship. The actress thought that the audience would not like the couple together after the storyline. = Rape = The show's spring trailer, released on 16 March 2018, features Alicia looking upset and burning her clothes and collapsing. Dainty (Digital Spy) confirmed that Alicia would be involved in a new storyline and thought that she could face \\"a harrowing ordeal\\". She questioned whether Alicia would be attacked, become ill or become pregnant, and wondered whether new F1 doctor Eddie McAllister (Joe Gaminara) would be involved in the storyline. On 9 May 2018, it was announced that Alicia's new storyline would see her raped by Eddie. The storyline begins in May and continues for six weeks as Alicia struggles with the attack and its aftermath. Alicia experiences flashbacks of a night of drinking with her colleagues, which help her realise that Eddie has raped her. The storyline had previously been teased by producer Lucy Raffety in an interview with Digital Spy. She dubbed the story \\"a huge, topical story that could divide the nation\\". She revealed that the storyline had divided the opinions of the cast and crew and said that the story is contentious and would be \\"very different in feel\\". Rafferty confirmed that Alicia's rape would culminate in the series 32 finale, which would be written by Barbara Machin. Producers spoke with Rape Crisis England and Wales about the storyline and sought their guidance before developing the scripts for the episodes. Halfpenny felt \\"a distinct sense of responsibility\\" to portray the storyline accurately and thought it was crucial to use Casualty to highlight the issue. She concluded that the drama had portrayed the plot \\"authentically and respectively\\" and hoped that it helped some people. Katie Russell, a spokesperson for Rape Crisis, said that Casualty is trying to highlight important societal issues and avoiding the stigma that rape is a taboo subject. She explained that Alicia's storyline explores the issue of consent \\"responsibly and carefully\\" and hoped that it could raise awareness for the issue. Simon Harper, the show's executive producer, thought it was important to portray a \\"tough, contemporary\\" storyline. He praised the show's work on the story and commended Halfpenny for her \\"stunning, heart breaking performance\\". He also thanked Rape Crisis for their assistance with the plot. =Departure= Alicia departed during the thirty-third series on 19 January 2019. Connie informs Alicia that she has been put forward for a paediatric job away from Holby. Halfpenny described the offer as \\"an amazing opportunity\\" for Alicia. After accepting the job, Alicia then receives a marriage proposal from Ethan, which leads her to question whether she wants to stay for \\"the comfort of Ethan and doing the job she knows and loves\\". Halfpenny explained that she told the show's producer Lucy Raffety about her decision to leave Casualty as she was due to film Alicia's rape storyline. They decided that Alicia would not leave straight after that story had concluded, as they did not want it to look like she was running away. Instead, viewers saw Alicia becoming happy again and returning to her old self. Halfpenny said filming her last episode was very emotional and she had to stop filming at one point as it was \\"too traumatic.\\" Reception For her portrayal of Alicia, Halfpenny won the Best Drama Star accolade at the 2018 Inside Soap Awards. At the same ceremony, Alicia's rape plot received a nomination for Best Drama Storyline. Later that year, Halfpenny was nominated for Best Soap Actor (Female) at the Digital Spy Reader Awards; she came in ninth place with 4% of the total vote. The rape storyline was also nominated in the Best Soap Storyline category; it came in tenth place with 3.9% of the total vote. Alison Graham (Radio Times) labelled Alicia as \\"a dip-dyed flopsy\\" and \\"a cheerful Geordie with an almost supernatural ability to discover the secrets of others, just by looking at them.\\" Her colleague, David Brown, described Alicia as \\"very upbeat and enthusiastic\\". Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy observed that Alicia's original stint had \\"a great response\\". Producer Hossington said that she \\"loved\\" the character. While reviewing Alicia's first episode, a contributor to The Sunday People stated that she \\"shows an admirable bedside manner\\". Elaine Reilly (What's on TV) said that Alicia arrived \\"in a puff of pink hair and optimism\\". Reilly opined that the workplace bullying storyline made Alicia and Lily \\"sympathetic characters\\". Ellis (Inside Soap) described the storyline as \\"brutal\\". TV3 described Alicia's departure as \\"emotional\\". Graham said the episode was \\"charged, tragic and rather good\\", adding that Halfpenny's voiceover was \\"unnerving\\". A reporter from the Liverpool Echo included Alicia's departure in a television highlights of the week feature. They said that in the workplace bullying storyline, Alicia was in a position where she has \\"a boss [she] simply can't please, no matter how hard [she tries]\\". A reporter from Inside Soap noted that it was obvious that Ethan and Alicia were \\"secretly carrying a torch for one another\\". Halfpenny received many tweets from fans of the show, telling her \\"to stop messing them [Ethan and Cal] both around\\". She added that fans backed the coupling of Alicia and Ethan and were \\"so relieved when they finally kissed\\". She later said that she receives tweets telling her \\"she's ruining the brothers’ relationship\\" and said that fans were \\"worried\\" since they enjoy Ethan and Cal's pairing. In March 2018, Halfpenny told Ellis of Inside Soap that fans of the show liked the pairing of Alicia and Ethan, which she thought was because they enjoyed seeing the relationship \\"blossom\\" from a friendship. On the anonymous blog storyline, Ellis observed, \\"Tongues have been wagging in Holby City ED over the past few weeks, as everyone tries to work out who's behind the explosive Rage in Resus blog that's been publicly blasting the department.\\" Employees of the NHS liked the storyline as they felt they could relate with it, while Halfpenny was told it \\"realistically\\" reflected the conditions of the NHS. Reilly of What's on TV described the anonymous blog plot as \\"explosive\\" and said that Casualty developed \\"a realistic atmosphere on set\\".

Lindley Swifts played in the Leeds & Districts League against clubs like Sharlston Rovers. They played in this league because the team was open age and the Huddersfield & Districts League at that time was an under 21 age group. The club played in black and white hoops, the same colours that they play in today. Lindley lost 32-2 to St. Helens in the first round of the Challenge Cup in 1928–29. In the 1930–31 Challenge Cup, they played Rochdale Hornets and lost 13-2 in the first round. In 1939 the pitch was turned into an allotment to grow vegetables for World War II. It is believed that the Huddersfield Royal Infirmary stands where the ground used to be.

There are two recognized subspecies. The epithet ottonis honors the German botanist Christoph Friedrich Otto. Description The plant at first grows individually and later forms groups. The light to dark green or blue-green spherical shoots are often tapered towards the base. They reach diameters of 3 to 15 centimeters. The six to 16 distinct ribs are rounded or sharp-edged. There are usually only a few areoles on each rib . The bristle-like thorns that spring from them are straight, curved or twisted. The one to four central spines are brownish, reddish brown or yellowish and have a length of 0.8 to 4 centimeters. The four to 15 spines are whitish to yellowish or brownish and 0.5 to 3 centimeters long.Zuloaga, FO, O. Morrone, MJ Belgrano, C. Marticorena & E. Marchesi. (eds.) 2008.

Players putt a golf ball from each in turn of 12 numbered points arranged in a circle as in a clock face, to a single hole placed within the circle. Alternative names include Clock-Golf, Round the Clock Golf, and Golf Around the Clock. The firm Jaques of London claim that they \\"originated the popular garden game of Clock Golf in the mid 19th century\\". The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest illustration of the use of the term dates from 1905. The wording on an early boxed set of equipment was \\"Clock Golf - A new game for the lawn - Interesting to golfers and a most popular amusement at garden parties\\". The game has often been offered to hotel guests as an entertainment. A 1905 print of \\"Clock golf at the Royal Palm [Hotel], Miami, Fla\\" is held by the Library of Congress, and in 1909 the New York Times reported that 30 guests, both ladies and gentlemen, had taken part in a clock golf tournament at the Pocono Mountain House hotel at Mount Pocono. A 1925 advertisement for a hotel in Bournemouth, England offers \\"Croquet, Clock Golf, Billiards, etc.\\" while in 2016 a hotel in Scarborough, England says that \\"the children's play area, clock golf and putting green, provide plenty of fun activities for children of all ages\\" and at one in Silkeborg, Denmark, \\"You can also avail yourself of clock golf or the pétanque court.\\" English Novelist E. F. Benson makes reference to clock golf in Chapter 8 of his novel Lucia in London (1927) in the Mapp and Lucia series. Daisy and Robert Quantock are playing the game on their lawn. British Novelist P.G. Wodehouse makes reference to country house lodgers playing clock golf in Summer Moonshine (1937). Agatha Christie's novel 4:50 from Paddington (1957) also features a (rusty) clock golf. Clock golf was available to passengers on the promenade deck of the Short S.23 flying boat. The first course in Denmark is said to have been at Gråsten Palace where Queen Ingrid enjoyed playing with her family. Jaques still sell equipment for the game, comprising a set of 12 markers numbered I to XII (with spikes on the back for insertion into the lawn), balls, and a pre-formed hole with flag, with or without a putter. Metal roman numbers have also been made by F.H.Ayres of London and Hamleys. The firm of A.G. Spalding of New York manufactured a set using numbers 1–12 around 1900, and in the late 1920s the firm of P.S.P. Inc sold a stylish set of 1–12, painted alternately red and white, presented in a tin under the name \\"Round the Clock Golf\\". A Danish firm offers to install a prefabricated clock golf playing area with artificial grass surrounded by a granite border. Jaques' description suggests that clock golf can be played wherever there is space for \\"an approximate circle of 10–30ft in diameter\\", and that shrubs and other obstacles can add to the interest. The hole is not placed centrally, so the 12 \\"holes\\" of the game can be of different lengths.

Contemporary records also referred to her as Marshall de Cobourg, Marshall Cobourg, Marshall Cobourg, Marquis Cobourg, Marquis de Cobourg, Cobourg, Coborg, and Saxe Cobourg. Further adding to the difficulty in tracking her through the records, is that although she was originally a cutter, later the Navy converted her to a brig. Her contract ran from 16 October 1794 to 2 November 1801. As a cutter she had a burthen of 202 tons (bm), and carried twelve 4-pounder guns.Winfield (2008), p.388. As a brig she had a burthen of 210 tons, was armed with 16 guns, and had a crew of 60 men. Service In March—April 1795, Saxe Coburg was part of a squadron under the command of Commodore John Willett Payne, who had hoisted his pennant in , Captain William Lechmere commanding. The squadron's task was to escort George, Prince of Wales's official wife, Caroline of Brunswick to Britain. Princess Caroline left from Cuxhaven on 28 March 1795 in Jupiter and, delayed by poor weather, landed at Greenwich on 5 April.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, pp.114-8. Marshall de Cobourg was under the command of Lieutenant Charles Webb on 12 December 1796 when she captured the French privateer lugger Espoir off Dungeness. Espoir was armed with two guns and had a crew of 18 men.Schomberg (1815), Vol. 5, p.120. Marechall de Cobourg recaptured Anson, of Wells, on 21 September. At some point before October 1797, Marshall de Cobourg recaptured the ship Watts, of Mary Port, and the brig Blackest and Ridley, of North Shields. Webb and Marechal de Cobourg also recaptured the ship William, of Whitby, and the brig Eliza, of Sunderland. At 7.a.m. on 25 February 1798 Cobourg, still under Webb's command, encountered a French privateer lugger at about 16 leagues from Cromer. A nine-hour chase ensued, including two hours of close combat. The lugger twice attempted to board but Coburg repulsed her, before a broadside brought down the lugger's main and mizzen masts, and took away her fore yard; at that point the lugger struck. She turned out to be Revanche, of 16 guns and 62 men, and she had lost seven men killed and eight wounded; Coburg had only two men lightly wounded. Webb just succeeded in evacuating all the prisoners and getting his own boarding party back, when Revanche sank, having taken more than 40 shots between wind and water. She was an entirely new vessel, the largest to have sailed out of Calais, and was six days into a one-month cruise, but had taken nothing. Lord Spencer appointed Lieutenant Terence O'Neill commander of Marechal de Cobourg on 30 April 1798. At that time she was a brig.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, pp.314-6. Between 2 and 6 May 1798, Coburg (still described in prize money notices as a cutter), captured Werf Lust, Eendragt, Verwagting, Hoop, Jonge Paulus, and Jonge Adriana, which were Dutch fishing vessels. On 14 September Marshall de Cobourg captured Mentor. Also in September and Cobourg captured Neptunus. On 18 January 1799 Admiral Lord Viscount Duncan sent O'Neill and Marshall de Cobourg to cruise off the Texel. On 1 February, north of the Texel, Marshall de Cobourg sighted a cutter sailing towards them. The cutter's movements and signals suggested an enemy vessel, so O'Neill executed several deceptions to decoy her closer. When she came close enough Marshall de Cobourg fired a few shots and the cutter struck. The British took possession of the cutter and found that she was the Dutch privateer Flushinger, armed with four 2-pounder guns, and having a crew of 28 men under the command of Mynheer Van C. G. Hamendel. She was three days out of Helvoet, and had not captured anything. Marshall de Cobourg then returned to Yarmouth, but had to sail on to the Nore to replenish her ordnance stores. O'Neill frequently carried messages from Duncan to the Dutch authorities at the Texel and earned their. On one occasion, when supplies on Cobourg were running low, the Dutch commodore, Commodore Capelle, sent O'Neill an abundant supply of provisions with a warm note. The British and Dutch came to an agreement in autumn 1799 that they would, within certain limits, permit each other's fishermen to fish without interference. Therefore, on 25 March 1800 Admiral Lord Viscount Duncan wrote a letter to Admiral de Winter concerning a British fisherman's complaint that a Dutch privateer had chased him, and dispatched O'Neill and Cobourg to deliver the letter. de Winter replied that the privateer had been French, and so beyond his control. On 25 April 1800 O'Neill received an appointment to Tromp as master and commander. (O'Neill sailed Tromp to the West Indies but on arrival had to give up command due to there being an officer there who had also been appointed to command her.) Lieutenant James Watson commanded the cutter Saxe Cobourg in the North Sea until he received promotion to Commander in January 1801. Earlier, he had commanded the gun-brig until she wrecked in January 1800.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, pp.3-4. A few days after O'Neill's promotion, on 4 and 5 May, Coburg was among the vessels that captured 12 outward-bound Greenland ships. The other vessels included the hired armed cutter Fox, Jalouse, and , though most were much larger and included , , , , and , among others. The hired cutters Rose and Cobourg shared the proceeds of the capture on 11 July of Kleine Charlotte. On 2 March 1801, observers on shore in Southwold Bay observed a French vessel of 12 to 14 guns and 50 to 60 men working her way towards some coasters, and capturing a sloop. The Sea Fencibles were alerted, as was a detachment of dragoons, and a local shore battery fired a number of shots. The shots both drove off the privateer, and alerted other vessels in the area. Among the vessel the shots alerted were Cobourg and the hired lugger Speculator.Paul Benyon, Naval Database: Marechal de Cobourg / Marquis Cobourg / Marshal de Cobourg etc., 1794. - Accessed 18 August 2016. At nine o'clock in the evening the \\"Hired Brig Cobourg\\" was a few miles off the land and under the command of Lieutenant Mayson Wright when she captured the French privateer lugger Bienvenu (or Bien Venu), of Calais. She was armed with 14 carriage guns and was two days out of Calais. She had a crew of 80 men.Demerliac (2004; 1800-1815), p. 333. At the time of her capture two of her prizes were in sight and Wright hoped to recapture them. As it happened, Speculator succeeded in recapturing the sloop Adventure, which Bienvenu had captured. Jalouse and Marshal de Cobourg captured several Dutch vessels on 22 and 23 July: :Negotie and Zeeward (22 July) :Hoop (same) :Jusfrouw Dirkje (23 July) Coborg, , and shared in the proceeds of the capture on 3 October of Juffrow Catharine. Three days later Cobourg captured the fishing vessel Jonge Jan. Kite shared by agreement with Cobourg in the proceeds.

In 2013, Kim Jong-un elevated the holiday to an official status on the North Korean calendar, on par with the Day of the Sun (birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung). Thus it became the holiday associated with Kim Jong-un, with his own birthday still missing from the official calendar. This has helped to further Kim Jong-un's charismatic rule. According to North Korea analyst Adam Cathcart, the purpose of the holiday is \\"to reinforce Kim Jong-un's legitimacy to rule, confirm the principle of very early succession and young leadership, and emphasize the preternatural military abilities of the sons in the Kim family.\\" On the calendar, the 25 August holiday takes place after the Liberation Day (15 August) and before the Day of the Foundation of the Republic (인민정권_창건일) (9 September). Day of Songun is one of three days celebrating Kim Jong-il on the calendar, the other two being the Day of the Shining Star (his birth anniversary) and Generalissimo Day (commemorating his accession to the rank of Taewonsu). Background Songun (military-first) is the political ideology peculiar to North Korea that all problems in society can be corrected by giving priority to military affairs. Its roots are traced to Kim Il-sung's activities during the anti- Japanese struggle of the 1930s, but it is especially identified with Kim Jong- il. Lately, Songun has been associated with Kim Jong-un in his effort balance the interests of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean People's Army (KPA). According to Fyodor Tertitskiy, the term has largely lost its original meaning and now simply means anything \\"good\\". Consequentially, Day of Songun is not so much about the army as it is about the person of Kim Jong-il. Until 2005, the history of Kim Jong-il's Songun leadership was presented as having begun on 1 January 1995 with his visit to a guard-post. After 2005, the date was backtracked to 1960 to suggest a much longer held tradition. The Day of Songun commemorates his supposed 25 August 1960 inspection of the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division with his father Kim Il-sung. The visit is considered the beginning of his Songun leadership. Although Jong-il would have been 18 then and not yet started his studies at Kim Il-sung University, according to, Tertitskiy, \\"[t]he date looks right, as it seemingly the date when Kim Jong Il made his first steps up the political ladder\\". History Supreme Commander of the KPA on the day. The commemoration was not a major celebration under Kim Jong-il's rule, but there had been annual celebrations even before the holiday was officially instituted. Plans for an official holiday surfaced in 2012, and the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported some celebration of a \\"Day of Songun\\" already back then. Kim Jong-un delivered a speech during the 2012 festivities, entitled \\"Only Victory and Glory Will Be in Store for Us Who are Advancing under the Unfurled Flag Bearing the Immortal Beaming Images of the Great Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il\\". The next year, on 25 August 2013, Kim Jong-un officially announced the holiday in a long speech, entitled \\"Let Us Forever Glorify Comrade Kim Jong Il's Great Idea and Achievements of the Military-First Revolution\\", published in Rodong Sinmun and Joson Inmingun. In it, Kim Jong-un declared: The next day, 26 August, a decree on instituting the Day of Songun as an annual national holiday was adopted by the Supreme People's Assembly. Celebrations The Day of Songun is marked with flying the flag of North Korea, by civilians, and the flag of the Supreme Commander of the KPA by military units. Observances include galas for service people, dancing parties around the country, outdoor concerts, laying bouquets, and visiting historic sites.

Definitions =Pursuit-evasion= Cop-win graphs (and the complementary class of graphs, robber-win graphs) were introduced by in the context of the following pursuit- evasion game, whose invention they credit to G. Gabor and A. Quilliot. Two players, a cop and a robber, are positioned at different initial vertices of a given graph. They play in turns; on each player's turn, the player may either move to an adjacent vertex or stay put. The game ends, and the cop wins, if the cop can end his turn on the same vertex as the robber. The robber wins by indefinitely evading the cop. A cop-win graph is a graph with the property that, no matter where the two players start, the cop can always force a win.. =Dismantling= The closed neighborhood of a vertex in a given graph is the set of vertices consisting of itself and all other vertices adjacent to . The vertex is said to be dominated by another vertex when . That is, and are adjacent, and every other neighbor of is also a neighbor of .. call a vertex that is dominated by another vertex an irreducible vertex. A dismantling order or domination elimination ordering of a given graph is an ordering of the vertices such that, if the vertices are removed one-by-one in this order, each vertex (except the last) is dominated. A graph is dismantlable if and only if it has a dismantling order. Closure properties The family of cop-win graphs is closed under strong products of graphs. The cop can win in a strong product of cop-win graphs by playing to win one of the factors of the product, and after doing so playing in the remaining factors in the same way while continuing to stay on the same vertex as the robber in the already-won factor. For instance, the king's graph, a strong product of two path graphs, is cop- win. The factor strategy for the white king would be to first move to the same row as the black king, and then move towards the black king while remaining on the same row as the black king.For the fact that a strong product of paths is cop-win, see . For the fact that the king's graph is a strong product of paths, see . It is not true that every induced subgraph of a cop-win graph is cop-win. However, certain special induced subgraphs do remain cop-win. define a retraction of a graph onto one of its induced subgraphs to be a mapping from the vertices of to the vertices of that maps each vertex of to itself, and that maps each two adjacent vertices of either to the same vertex as each other or to a pair of adjacent vertices in . Then, as they argue, the family of cop-win graphs is closed under retraction. For, a cop can win in by simulating a game in . Whenever the winning strategy in would call for the cop to stay put, or to follow an edge whose endpoints are mapped to the same vertex of , the cop stays put in . And in all other cases, the cop follows the edge in that is the image under the retraction of a winning edge in . Equivalence of cop-win and dismantlability Every dismantlable graph is cop-win. A winning strategy for the cop is to find a dominated vertex , and to follow (by induction) an optimal strategy on the graph formed by removing , pretending that the robber is on the vertex that dominates whenever he is actually on . This will result either in an actual win of the game, or in a position where the robber is on and the cop is on the dominating vertex, from which the cop can win in one more move. This strategy can be used as the basis for a proof by induction of the fact that, in an -vertex graph, the cop can force a win in at most moves... Conversely, every cop-win graph has a dominated vertex. For, if the robber plays optimally to make the game last as long as possible and the last position of the game before the cop wins has the cop at vertex c and the robber at r, then r must be dominated by c, else the robber could prolong the game for at least one move. The function that maps r onto c and leaves every other vertex in place is a retraction, so the graph formed by removing the dominated vertex must remain cop-win. By induction, it follows that every cop-win graph is dismantlable. The same argument shows that, in a graph with no dominated vertices, the robber can never lose: there is always a move to a vertex that is not adjacent to the cop. In an arbitrary graph that is not cop-win, the robber can win by removing all dominated vertices and playing within the remaining subgraph, which must be non-empty else the graph would be dismantlable. Recognition algorithms and the family of all dismantling orders If a vertex in a cop-win graph is dominated, then (as other dominated vertices are removed) it remains dominated until it is either removed itself or it becomes the final vertex of a dismantling order. Therefore, the collection of valid dismantling orders has the structure of an antimatroid, and a dismantling order can be found by a simple greedy algorithm that repeatedly finds and removes any dominated vertex. The process succeeds if and only if the graph is cop-win, so as well as providing an algorithm for finding dismantling orders this method provides an algorithm for testing whether a given graph is cop-win. One way to find each successive vertex to remove is to perform the following steps: *Find all triangles in the graph, and count the number of triangles that each edge participates in. *Repeatedly find a vertex that is an endpoint of an edge participating in a number of triangles equal to the degree of minus one, delete , and decrement the triangles per edge of each remaining edge that formed a triangle with . In a graph with vertices, edges, and degeneracy , this process can be carried out in time .. An alternative and more complicated algorithm by involves maintaining a number called the deficit for each adjacent pair of vertices , which counts the number of neighbors of that are not neighbors of . It constructs and maintains the actual deficit set (neighbors of that are not neighbors of ) only when the deficit is small. To speed up its computations, it uses decision trees that classify vertices according to their adjacencies with small blocks of vertices. It performs the following steps: *Group the vertices into blocks, build a decision tree for each block, and classify all vertices by their sets of neighbors within each block. *Use this classification to compute the deficits for all adjacent pairs of vertices, in time per pair. *Repeat the following steps times, until all vertices have been removed: **Construct the deficit set for all adjacent pairs that have deficit at most and that have not already had this set constructed, using the initial set of decision trees, in time per pair. **Repeat the following steps times: ***Find a pair with constructed but empty deficit set. ***Delete vertex ***Remove from all constructed deficit sets that it belongs to. **Build a decision tree for the removed vertices and classify all vertices by their neighbors in this set. **Use the decision tree to update the deficits for all edges in constant time per edge. The time for this procedure is .. Spinrad gives a simpler but less tight time analysis of . The total time spent in the step that removes from deficit sets is , dominated by the other terms in the time bound. Related families of graphs Every finite chordal graph is a dismantlable graph, and every elimination ordering of a chordal graph (an ordering of the vertices in which the later neighbors of each vertex form a clique) is a valid dismantling order. However, there exist infinite chordal graphs that are not cop-win.. Every graph that has a universal vertex is dismantlable, for every other vertex is dominated by the universal vertex, and any vertex ordering that places the universal vertex last is a valid dismantling order. Conversely, almost all dismantlable graphs have a universal vertex, in the sense that, among all -vertex dismantlable graphs, the fraction of these graphs that have a universal vertex goes to one in the limit as goes to infinity.. The five-vertex wheel graph is cop-win but not hereditarily cop- win. The hereditarily cop-win graphs are the graphs in which every isometric subgraph is cop-win. This is not true for all cop-win graphs; for instance, the five-vertex wheel graph is cop-win but contains an isometric 4-cycle, which is not cop-win, so this wheel graph is not hereditarily cop-win. The hereditarily cop-win graphs are the same as the bridged graphs, graphs in which every cycle of length four or more has a shortcut, a pair of vertices closer in the graph than they are in the cycle.. A cop-win graph is hereditarily cop-win if and only if it has neither the 4-cycle nor 5-cycle as induced cycles. For a hereditarily cop-win graph, the reversal of any breadth- first traversal is a valid dismantling order, from which it follows that any vertex can be chosen as the last vertex of a dismantling order.. A similar game with larger numbers of cops can be used to define the cop number of a graph, the smallest number of cops needed to win the game. The cop-win graphs are exactly the graphs of cop number equal to one.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. MIA3 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site, where it binds bulky cargo molecules such as collagens and creates mega transport carriers for the export of cargoes from the ER. This function suggests that it plays a role in assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM) and bone formation. MIA3 has been demonstrated to contribute to both tumor suppression and progression. The MIA3 gene also contains one of 27 loci associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.. A TANGO1 like protein called TALI is expressed in liver and intestine and shown to be required for the export of bulky very Low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons. TANGO1 and TALI assemble into rings around COPII coats and this function is necessary for cargo export.  Structure  = Gene = The MIA3 gene resides on chromosome 1 at the band 1q41 and includes 32 exons. This gene produces 4 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = MIA3 is a member of the MIA/OTOR family. The full-length protein spans 1,907 amino acids and localizes to the ER exit sites. It contains an N-terminal, SH3-like domain, two predicted transmembrane domains, a coiled-coiled domain, and a C-terminal, proline-rich domain. The SH3-like domain faces the ER lumen, where it can bind cargo for COPII carrier biogenesis, while the proline-rich domain faces the cytoplasm, where it can bind the COPII components Sec23/24. Of the two predicted transmembrane domains, only one actually crosses the membrane, whereas the second likely forms a hairpin structure that is only embedded in but not crossing the membrane.  Function  Unlike other members in the MIA gene family, MIA3 is broadly expressed, except in the cells belonging to the hematopoietic system. High levels of MIA3 expression are observed both in embryonic and adult tissues. MIA3 resides at the ER exit site and functions as a guide for loading the cargo molecule collagen VII into COPII carriers, which mediates the exit of secretory protein out of the ER with the help of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma–associated antigen 5 (cTAGE-5). A recent study indicates that MIA3 is also involved in the secretion of other collagens, including collagens I, II, III, IV, and IX, from chondrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mural cells, indicating its participation in chondrocyte maturation and bone mineralization. MIA3 has been suggested as a tumor suppressor in malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, and hepatoma, and induction of expression of MIA3 results in a significant decrease in motility and invasive potential. On the other hand, it has also been found that MIA3 promotes angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by upregulating platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGF-b) polypeptide and neuropolin 2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma.  Clinical significance  In humans, MIA3 was first discovered as an important constituent in the growth and adhesion in malignant melanoma cells. As it is secreted from both chondrocytes and melanoma cells, it also plays a role in the metastasis of melanomas as well as cartilage development. It has been established that melanoma inhibitory gene family members serve several tumor-related functions that are subjected to a variety of human malignancies. = Clinical Marker = It was found that melanoma inhibitory activity gene family members are frequently expressed in human tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer with nodal or distant metastasis and cervical cancer. In addition, melanoma inhibitory activity gene family expression is also associated with poor prognosis among cancer patients overall. Nevertheless, further research is needed to determine the association between melanoma inhibitory family member expression and its diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic relevance in clinical oncology. Additionally, a multi-locus genetic risk score study, based on a combination of 27 loci including the MIA3 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incidence and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).

It stars Janis Paige, Binnie Barnes, and Massimo Serato. Fugitive Lady is based on the novel Dark Road by Doris Miles Disney. Film editing was done by Nino Baragli. It was shot at the Scalera Studios in Rome. Plot The wealthy industrialist Ralph Clementi (Eduardo Ciannelli) after being released from a tavern in a drunken state he leaves his car near Rome, but came close to Lake Nemi , not noticing the broken road, he plunges into a ravine: the Ralph dies. Since he had taken out insurance on the life of himself in the amount of £100,000, his wife Barbara (Janis Paige) is going to collect the prize of the policy. Jack Di Marco (Tony Cento), insurance investigator, also thanks to the half-sister of the victim, Esther (Binnie Barnes), which appears detached from the sister-in-law and her fake pain, investigates the history of the protagonists. Esther secretly harbored feelings for her half-brother, now no longer young, but Ralph was in love with Barbara, a singer in nightclubs, and he married her. But over time the affection of Barbara at her husband had been reduced to a forced patience; in her life she had returned to her former lover, Jim West (Massimo Serato). Discovered by Ralph, she tried to get a divorce from him, but the man denied the satisfaction. Unable to separate from him legally, she decided to get rid of him. In a stormy night, she led a drunk Ralph to get into the car; two exchanged signs were the cause of the accident. Jim, who was also unaware of the intent of the fact, thanks to a confession of the villa caretaker, he feels that in planning the incident was Barbara. With these, disgusted about the perfidy of woman abandons her, she shoots him to death behind him. At the sight of Jack, who secretly has witnessed the murder, Barbara flees from the villa by car, but perishes in the same incident, which she herself organized, that happened to her husband. Cast * Janis Paige as Barbara Clementi * Binnie Barnes as Esther Clementi * Massimo Serato as Jim West * Eduardo Ciannelli as Ralph Clementi * Tony Cento as Jack De Marco * Alba Arnova as Francine * Dino Galvani as Giuseppe * Rosina Galli as Teresa * John Fostini as Beppo * Luciana Danieli as Maria * Michael Tor as Bob * Alex Serberoli as Chauffeur * Joop van Hulsen as Druggist * Giulio Marchetti as Giovanni Reception =Critical response= The New York Times staff wrote in a review of Fugitive Lady: \\"Mr. Frankovitch has unwound this meandering claptrap, which is recounted in an interminable series of flashbacks by practically everybody in the cast, against the eye-popping magnificence of Rome's cafe society playground. John O'Dea has pounded out a laboriously one- dimensional scenario, Sidney Salkow's direction is vacuous and fumbling and the cast responds accordingly. As the passion-blinded spouse, Eduardo Ciannelli grits his teeth and grins like an agonized possum. Binnie Barnes, who is also Mrs. Frankovitch, does a stiff but at least restrained job as his protecting sister. And Massimo Serato makes an honest but unsustained try as the gigolo. But Miss Paige, who ranges from Louisa M. Alcott demureness to snarling tantrums, takes the cake for water-level histrionics. Just why Mr. Frankovitch bothered with such a diabolically dull heroine is anyone's guess. Maybe Doris Miles Disney, who wrote the original novel, knows. At any rate, somebody should have opened a window to let in some more air—and scenery.\\" References =Sources=  External links * 1950 films Republic Pictures films Films directed by Sidney Salkow 1950 crime drama films Italian films British films Italian crime drama films British crime drama films English-language films Films shot at Scalera Studios ","title":"Fugitive Lady (1950 film)"},{"id":"51361926","text":"Copyfish is a browser extension software for Google Chrome and Firefox that allows users to copy and paste, or copy and translate text from within images. “Images” come in all kinds of forms: photographs, charts, diagrams, screenshots, PDF documents, comics, error messages, memes, Flash, and subtitles in YouTube movies.\\"Now you can easily extract texts from images using this tool\\".

Description The Common Missile was designed as a four- stage solid propellant, stellar-inertial guided intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering up to six Mark 21 reentry vehicles to independent targets. It is propelled from a canister by a gas generator prior to first stage ignition. The post boost vehicle consists of a structure to house the guidance and solid propulsion systems and a platform to mount the reentry vehicles. The post boost vehicle provides the reentry vehicle spacing and deployment maneuvers. The basic dimensions, length, and diameter, were derived from submarine launcher volumetric constraints. The booster stages were sized to provide for Navy guidance access requirements at the II-III interstage and for at-sea maintenance access. The missile was designed to fill the current Trident submarine tube.

It was ordered in 1985 along Superbird-A, Superbird-A1 and Superbird-B1 on the very first order of the SSL 1300 platform. It was to be the second satellite of SCC. It was supposed to be used for video distribution, news gathering, remote publishing and high definition TV service to the main islands of Japan and Okinawa from the 162°East position. Satellite description The spacecraft was the second satellite designed and manufactured by Ford Aerospace on the SSL 1300 satellite bus. It was based on the design of the Intelsat V series and offered a three-axis stabilized platform. It had a launch mass of and a 10-year design life. When stowed for launch, its dimensions were . With its solar panels fully extended it spanned . Its power system generated approximately 4 kW of power due to two wings with three solar panels each. It also had dual NiH2 battery to survive the solar eclipses. It was supposed to serve as the main satellite on the 162°East position of the Superbird fleet. Its propulsion system included an R-4D-11 LAE with a thrust of . It included enough propellant for orbit circularization and 10 years of operation. History Space Communications Corporation (SCC) was founded in 1985, the same year as the original companies that later formed JSAT. On 1986 SCC ordered four spacecraft from Space Systems/Loral: Superbird-1, Superbird-2, Superbird-A1 and Superbird-B1. On February 22, 1990, at 23:17 GMT, Superbird-2 was launched aboard an Ariane 44L along with BS-2X. At 100 seconds into the flight, the flight failed due to a piece of cloth that blocked a water line in one of the Viking engines of the first stage. Both satellites were lost, and Superbird-B1 was rushed into launch.

A series of blog posts by Alan Hudson shows how to code in the language and provides scripts for making many different objects including many jewelry and housewares items. Previewing For fast previewing of models, ShapeJS provides a cloud-based web service that turns ShapeJS into images at real time speeds. This allows very thin clients without graphics hardware to visualize the scripts. In addition it protects the underlying code and 3D models of the author by not sending the contents to the user. Preview is relatively fast and allows interactive modifications while modifying the script. Underlying Representation ShapeJS uses a combination of signed distance functions and voxel representations. This avoids some typical accuracy issues with triangle based representations when doing solid modeling. Allowing per-voxel level control enables generation of printable products at printer native resolutions. This representation also makes it easy to use high resolution image data in designs to leverage 2D art in making 3D objects.

It was not discovered until 2008, and is the only member of the genus Tepakiphasma. Nymphs of T. ngatikuri were first collected in Radar Bush, Te Paki Recreation Reserve, in December 2008. Radar Bush, a 65 ha forest remnant 9.5 km south-east of Cape Reinga, is home to several very localised Northland species such as the slight skink (Oligosoma levidensum) and Bartlett's rātā (Metrosideros bartlettii). The two nymphs were reared to adulthood, and the new species was described and named in 2010. Its genus name is taken from the type locality of Te Paki (or North Cape), and its species name is from the Ngāti Kurī people of Northland, whose area of interest includes Te Paki. Tepakiphasma ngatikuri is a moderately large (10 cm) stick insect, slender and wingless. Its body is mottled grey and brown, with no spines and sparsely- scattered tubercles. Its most distinctive feature is its egg, which has a conical perforated cap, a structure seen on no other New Zealand stick insects but found in some overseas groups. The only known specimens were collected from white rātā (Metrosideros perforata). Although the surrounding area has been searched, no specimens of T. ngatikuri have been found anywhere but Radar Bush. Because the species occurs in just one small location, making it extremely vulnerable to extinction from accidental fire or introduced predators, it has been classed as Nationally Critical under the Department of Conservation's Threat Classification System.

It was designed by George Bernard Roskell and built in 1913 by John Draney. It is also known as Iona. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 December 2010.  History  The former St Columba's Convent was built in 1913 for the Sisters of Mercy from a design by local architect George Bernard Roskell, to provide accommodation for the nuns and the boarding students in their care. At that time, the town of Dalby and its surrounding rural districts were experiencing economic growth. The Sisters of Mercy occupied the convent until 1990, after which it was purchased by the Dalby parish and used as a student hostel, before being leased as a youth and community centre. Dalby evolved as part of the expansion of one of the most significant pastoral regions in Queensland, the Darling Downs. The township was first laid out by Surveyor EO Moriaty in 1852. Due to an error in flood levels, Captain Samuel Augustus Perry, the Deputy Surveyor General of New South Wales resurveyed the township in 1853, naming it Dalby after a location on the Isle of Man. The Town Reserve was declared in the New South Wales Government Gazette in August 1855. Dalby soon had a range of government services, including a post office in August 1854, the declaration of the Dalby Police District in 1855, and the establishment of a National School in 1859. The first urban land sales were held in 1857 and the Town of Dalby was gazetted as a municipality on 29 August 1863. The extension of the Western railway line from Toowoomba to Dalby in 1868 led to a boom in the town which only diminished when the line was extended further west in 1877. At the time of the appointment of James Quinn as the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane in 1861, the population of the Colony of Queensland was 30,059, of whom 7,696 (39%) were Catholics. The proportion of Catholics in the main towns of the Darling Downs was: 18% in Warwick, 22% in Toowoomba, 28% in Dalby and 32% in Drayton. Initially Catholic pastoral care in Dalby was irregular; visiting priests had to celebrate mass in local hotels like Josiah Milstead's Plough Inn Hotel from 1855. The first Catholic school in Dalby was established in 1864. Dalby's first Catholic church, St Joseph's was opened by Bishop Quinn in August 1866. In 1876 Quinn instructed Father Denis Byrne, curate of Dalby, to establish a convent in the town, using £400 that the Sisters of Mercy of All Hallows Convent in Brisbane had allocated for the purpose. The Sisters of Mercy, having initially travelled to Queensland with Bishop Quinn in 1860, were integral to the expansion of Catholic schools across the state. A new commodious version of the Plough Inn Hotel, built in 1863, was sold as part of the estate of pastoralist CC Macdonald. A half share of the property - lots 14, 15 and 16 (originally lots 2, 3, and 4) of section 16 - was transferred to Bishop Quinn in 1876. A small group of Sisters of Mercy arrived in Dalby on 8 August the following year, from the Toowoomba convent established in 1873; and this new Plough Inn became the order's eleventh school in Queensland known as St Columba's. A new timber church designed by Toowoomba architect James Marks was opened in September 1886. By that time, Catholics comprised one third of the population of the Darling Downs. Dalby's regional prosperity was spurred by a number of legislative processes aimed at rural development in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the creation of smaller land holdings and the construction of new railways. The Bell branch railway opened in 1906, followed by the Glenmorgan railway line to Tara in 1908. Dairying and wheat cultivation expanded. A butter factory and a flour mill were established in Dalby in 1906, while the wool industry continued to underpin the rural economy of the area. Despite the dramatic effects of the Federation drought which peaked in 1902, the market for cattle improved in the 1910s, while the price of wool more than doubled between 1900 and 1915. The growth of the area and the general expansion of the network of boarding schools led to the planning of a new, purpose-built Catholic convent for Dalby. In 1910, 3? acres (1.4 ha) on the corner of Cunningham and Edward Streets were transferred to the Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Rockhampton, James Duhig came in November 1910 to lay the foundation stone of the convent there. In November 1911 local architect George Bernard Roskell called for tenders for its construction. Born in India, Roskell migrated to Sydney in 1881, having previously been articled to E. W. Pugin in Dublin. (Pugin and his father Augustus Pugin were responsible for the design of a large number of Gothic Revival ecclesiastical buildings in Britain and Western Europe.) In Sydney, Roskell worked in partnership with John Bede Barlow between 1885 and 1891. (The 1887 Church of St Canice in Rushcutters Bay and the 1889 St Francis of Assisi Church in Paddington, designed by the practice are both on the Sydney Local Heritage Register.) Roskell then went to New Zealand, working for two firms known for their ecclesiastical projects. He relocated to Queensland as an employee of the Department of Public Works in 1907. Living in Dalby from 1909, he worked as clerk of the Dalby Town Council and also ran an architectural practice responsible for the Dalby National Bank (1910), the Dalby Hospital (1914) and the Wambo Shire Council offices (1916). St Columba's Convent was opened by the recently appointed coadjutor, His Grace Archbishop Duhig on 8 June 1913, the eve of the feast day of St Columba of Iona. (St Columba had been exiled to this island off Scotland in 563 and later established his ministry there.) A crowd of around 500 visitors attended the ceremony. Father Nolan, the Parish Priest indicated that the convent had cost £7,267 and he needed a further £2,600 to clear the debt. A collection was then taken up, which yielded around £1,600. Speakers praised the efforts of the builder, John Draney and the Clerk of Works, Michael Kelly, as well as the fund raising efforts of the ladies committee. It was expected that subsequent fund raising would focus on building a new church and presbytery for Father Nolan. Michael Kelly departed Dalby the following week to take up the position of Clerk of Works for St Brigid's Church at Red Hill, Brisbane. The Dalby Herald described the new convent as Gothic in style, standing on a large site, on solid foundations four feet deep, reinforced with rolled joists, bolted together under all the walls of the structure, creating a singular solid frame. Entry to the property was through ornamental iron gates composed of crosses with the name St Columba's Convent emblazoned on them in brass. A gravelled path led to the central main entrance, which had a simple gabled portico again lettered with the name of St Columba's. The front verandah featured sections of cast iron balustrade and all were ten feet wide. Flooring throughout was crows ash. The convent's entry doors opened to a hall, flanked on each side by reception rooms, with passageways leading to both wings. To the right was a boarders' study which was separated by high folding doors from a boarders' refectory. Three French doors led to the western verandah, along which were located four music rooms. A nearby staircase led up to the boarders' dormitory. Directly behind the entrance lobby was the nuns' refectory, which included a fireplace and mantle. To the left of the entrance lobby, a grand timber staircase with turned silky oak balustrade ascended to the upper floor. Beyond the staircase was the chapel. The sanctuary was lit by arched stained glass windows illuminating the altar. A soft shade of green was used in the glass and in the interior paint scheme. The altar, which no longer remains, was designed and built by Trittons Furniture in Brisbane, donated by Mother Patrick of All Hallows in Brisbane and made as a copy of its altar. The first floor boarders' dormitory occupied the entire western wing and had high coved ceilings. A lavatory and bathroom, with enamelled baths and showers adjoined the dormitory at the rear of the building. The dormitory opened onto front, rear and side verandahs. A corridor led from the boarders' dormitory to an infirmary for smaller children, which had a fireplace. Six nuns' cells , painted in French grey were also located here. The upper floor of the eastern wing housed three more cells and a large community room, the nun's bathrooms and toilets, and linen room. Water was supplied from a bore and from four 2 000 gallon tanks and three smaller rainwater tanks. The convent was one of the earliest buildings in Dalby to have a septic system, the local firm Downs Plumbing and Manufacturing supplying and executing all the plumbing work. Pressed metal ceilings were by Extons. Ongoing development of Catholic facilities in Dalby included a locally designed school (1916) to the rear of the convent towards Jimbour Street, and a new church (1921) a block to the north-east on Cunningham Street and an adjacent presbytery (1930), both designed by Sydney architects Hennessy and Hennessy. Also in Cunningham Street, St John's Church of England, designed by Toowoomba architect Harry Marks, opened in 1935. Father Nolan was honoured by the Pope in November 1930 and invested as a Monsignor in St Joseph's Church, when he was praised for the beautiful church buildings erected in Dalby - the convent, church and school. Within the Parish of Dalby, Nolan was responsible for the construction of new churches in Bell (1912), Warra (1913) and Jandowae (1917), Catholic communities which all would have sent children to school in Dalby. In 1930 and 1932 two further churches - at Cecil Plains and Kaimkillenbun respectively - were opened, both under his direction. The well-respected Nolan remained in the parish until his death in 1950. His church building scheme formed part of Duhig's overall program, which produced over 400 buildings in Queensland, including religious, educational and charitable institutions and hospitals. The chief towns of the Darling Downs - namely Toowoomba, Warwick and Stanthorpe - became, along with Dalby, centres of education with the establishment of a number of day and boarding schools by different Christian denominations. With regards Catholic convents predating St Columba's, of the four built only the Sisters of Mercy Convent of the Assumption built in 1893-94 in Warwick still exists. Around the time of the construction of the convent at Dalby, other Christian boarding schools were established in Toowoomba and Warwick but were not overseen by an order of nuns or brothers. These generally remain in operation with early buildings often having become part of co-educational colleges formed through a process of school amalgamation, such as in Warwick where the Presbyterian Ladies College (1918) and Scots College for boys (1919) merged in 1970 and now operate as Scots PGC College over two campuses. A brick and timber convent built in Goondiwindi in 1911 and similar in scale to that at Dalby has been demolished. A number of smaller convents and schools were established on the Downs after 1913, including at Allora, Clifton, Crows Nest, Oakey, Miles, Chinchilla and Yarraman. Of these only the Sisters of the Good Samaritan convents at Clifton (1917) and Yarraman (1946) are known to remain, while a number of the schools continue in operation. Boarding was phased out at St Columba's during the 1960s, while the school continued to expand on land behind the convent along Jimbour Street. In 1963 St Mary's Christian Brothers College was established in Nicholson Street, near the Dalby Airport, to educate boys from grades 5 to 10. St Mary's College became co-educational for grades 8 to 10 in 1980, with St Columba's operating as the co-educational primary school. In October 1990, the Sisters of Mercy departed Dalby, as part of the trend towards co- educational colleges staffed by lay teachers and managed through Diocesan Education Offices. In 1991, the Dalby Parish Finance Committee purchased the convent from the Sisters, upgraded its facilities and established a non- denominational rural student hostel, known as St Joseph's, servicing the regional community. St Columba's school to the rear of the convent was extensively fire damaged in 1998 and the decision made to begin a process of relocation to Nicholson Street. The last of the significant school buildings remaining on the site was moved elsewhere. St Columba's and St Mary's formally merged in 2008 to form Our Lady of the Southern Cross College based at the Nicholson Street campus. A decline in the Dalby region's rural prosperity led to the closure of St Joseph's Hostel in 1999. The former convent became known as Iona after the relocation of the school. It was then used by a number of community and educational groups. In May 2006 the Myall Youth and Community Network Centre (MYCNC) moved into the former convent, however in mid-2010 it was awaiting completion of purpose-built facilities in Diplock Park opposite Dalby High School.  Description  Convent, circa 1935 The former St Columba's Convent occupies a corner block in the south-western part of Dalby, north-west of Toowoomba on the Darling Downs. Addressing Cunningham Street to the north-west and Edward Street to the south-west, the two storey brick and timber building has a commanding presence on the street. Opposite it along Cunningham Street are the Dalby Ambulance Station and several residences; whilst further to the north-east are St Joseph's Catholic Church and the adjacent Presbytery (not original). The flat allotment covers approximately 2.7 hectares, with the proposed heritage boundary encompassing only its north- western part. The former convent's plan is H-shaped with a south-western wing extended further to the rear than the north-eastern one. The two storey building stands on concrete footings with various brick piers and timber stumps supporting the verandahs; its core made from reddish bricks laid in English bond, with white render bands at sill and head height decorating the main facade. The brick lintels over the windows and external doors are arched, with either two or three rowlock courses. Throughout the building extensive cracking in the masonry walls is visible both on the exterior and interior. Some of the building's timber verandahs were originally enclosed with weatherboarding, while others have been more recently enclosed with flat sheeting or chamferboards. Original timber verandah decoration, including stop chamfered posts, decorative post capitals and brackets, and solid timber valances, remains in many parts of the building, particularly on the facade addressing Cunningham Street. The ground floor verandah ceilings are lined with ripple iron sheeting, whilst those on the first floor are raked and have v-jointed timber board linings. Areas of unenclosed verandah have exposed timber floors. An early timber tank stand remains at the rear of the north- eastern wing. Original timber doors are either single-leaf or French with rectangular fanlights. The former are low-waisted with four solid panels, while the latter are low-waisted with single solid panels at the bottom and two rectangular panes divided by a narrow glazing bar at the top. Some doors appear to have been relocated within the building. The main roof, clad in corrugated iron sheeting, consists of two parallel long gables over the north- eastern and south-western wings connected by another gabled section over the central building range. The gable ends are decorated with moulded bargeboards and partial timber batten infill. The roofs over the verandahs are broken- backed. Two brick chimneys, painted white, are located above the inner face of the south-western wing, and several metal vents pierce the roof ridges. Celtic crosses adorn the ends of the main gables. The Cunningham Street facade is largely symmetrical, with a central portico formed in timber and verandahs running behind it between the brick walls of the two main gabled wings. The verandahs here have original cast iron balustrades, painted white, set into timber top and bottom rails. The portico is supported on double posts and topped by a pediment with ornamentation forming a gothic pointed arch. The western gable end has three lancet windows on each floor, with pink and green patterned glass; while the eastern gable end is slightly narrower, with two lancet windows on the upper floor and a projecting bay on the ground with three lancet windows (one filled with sheeting). It has a corrugated iron gable roof and timber gable ornamentation. Under the adjacent verandah a sacristy is formed in brick with lancet windows. The north-eastern facade retains many of its open verandah areas. A recent timber staircase provides access to the first floor verandah, the southern end of which is clad in weatherboards. At the northern end of this floor the first two bays of the verandah are enclosed with chamferboards and banks of louvered windows. On the south-western facade only a small portion of the ground floor verandah remains unenclosed. A double storey brick section with three original windows divides the facade and houses an original internal staircase. Various window types feature including three-light casements, aluminium sliders and louvers. The rear facade is dominated by the two projecting wings forming a courtyard. The areas of enclosed verandah are variously clad in weatherboards or chamferboards. A multitude of window types feature, including original timber- framed double-hung sashes, four-light timber casements, and aluminium-framed sliders. There is an original external timber staircase in the verandah area of the central building range. The brick gable ends of both wings feature small ventilation openings. The interior fabric of the building is largely intact. Most internal ceilings are lined with pressed metal, in a variety of patterns, including ceiling roses and cornices, although modern fluorescent lights and ceiling fans have often been fitted over the roses. All interior masonry walls are plastered and painted; and most rooms and corridors have a timber picture rail positioned either in line with the top of the fanlights or just below ceiling level (rooms without picture rails include the former nuns' cells and the kitchen). Wide timber skirtings line the base of most walls, and timber floors are largely carpeted. The ground floor layout of the former St Columba's Convent remains substantially intact, with only one interior wall removed (in the kitchen). Entry is from Cunningham Street, off the verandah and into a small lobby with reception rooms either side. The elaborate front door is timber-framed and set into an arched opening; with patterned glass lights (green, red and yellow) surrounding the central, low-waisted double door. Some original door hardware remains. On the far side of the entrance lobby is an elaborate doorway into the central corridor. Topped by an open timber-framed fanlight containing the top of a pointed arch and two timber quatrefoils, the doorway has two fixed and two opening leaves, each glazed with five arctic glass lights. Beyond this a central hallway runs parallel to the main facade, linking the north-eastern and south-western wings. This has a carpeted floor and stop-chamfered edges around openings. Rooms on the southern side of the corridor are the former nun's refectory, a small office (formerly work room) and the main staircase. This features a polished silky oak balustrade. At the south-western end of the former nun's refectory is a fireplace with a carved silky oak mantelpiece. The north-eastern wing houses the chapel, with adjacent brick sacristy. The sanctuary is located in the bay projection at the northern end, separated from the main space by an arched opening and two steps. The stained glass of the sanctuary features flowers and symbols such as alpha and omega, whilst all other windows contain leadlighting in various shades of green. A door leads into the small sacristy and the one connecting to the central corridor has a flashed glass border. The Stations of the Cross are in timber frames surmounted by a small cross. The south-western wing contains two large rooms at the northern end, with original bi-fold timber doors made of eight panels, approximately high, dividing the former boarder's study from the refectory. At the southern end is a kitchen, with an adjacent cold room and pantry inserted where the music rooms were. The kitchen is recently fitted out; however an original stove alcove remains. The floor is covered with linoleum. These rooms contain original doors, windows, timber- lined walls and a corridor leading to the western verandah. The amenities area on the eastern side of the enclosed verandah contains some original fabric, such as doors and board lined walls. The brick enclosed staircase in the north-western corner of this wing has a simple, painted timber balustrade, carpeted stairs and pressed metal on the underside of the upper landing. On the first floor, the core of the former convent on either side of the central corridor consists of six small rooms, formerly nun's cells, and a large room (former infirmary) currently divided in two. Five of the cells run along the northern side of the corridor, with the sixth adjacent to the main staircase. The enclosed verandah to the rear of these rooms contains a kitchen, dining area and bathroom. The timber floor here is lined with linoleum and the exterior brick walls are unpainted. The north-eastern wing houses a meeting room at the front of the building, three former nun's cells and amenities at the southern end. The south-western wing was formerly a single long dormitory room but is now divided into five rooms by plasterboard-lined partitions and areas of ceiling. The original coved ceiling runs the entire length of the former dormitory and is visible in three of the five rooms, with low plasterboard ceilings in two of the rooms. The former boarder amenities are located in the verandah at the southern end of this wing. Rooms here, which include a large amenities room, retain some original doors, windows and board- lined walls and ceiling. Floors have been lined with linoleum and modern bathroom fixtures installed. In the former nuns cells there are sections of likely recent wallpaper remaining on the walls. A fireplace with timber mantelpiece identical to the one on the ground floor features in the largest room. The rear external staircase has been enclosed on this level. The meeting room at the front of the north-east wing has two filled doorways on the north- east wall. The three former nun's cells are divided from each other and from the corridor by timber walls lined with vertically-jointed, tongue and groove boards. They each have a recent double door opening on to the north-east verandah. The amenities and store room at the southern end of this wing have recent fixtures and linings. Though largely open lawn, a variety of trees and shrubs are planted along the edges of the St Columba's property and throughout its grounds. Some mature trees as remnants of early planting schemes are significance, such as several mature bottle trees (Brachychiton rupestris) in the front and north-east lawn areas. There is an informal parking area at the rear of the building. The main feature of the front fence is a gateway marked by two original brick pillars. Near the north-east boundary is a brick pavilion, housing a crucifix statue on a raised platform. It has a gabled, tiled roof and round arches spanning between the corner pillars, some of which are topped by a small cross. Larger crosses sit at the gable peaks and the flat ceiling is lined with pressed metal. On the north-east side of the building, near the sacristy, is a grotto made from stone with a garden in the centre. A statue of the Virgin Mary stands in an alcove in the rear wall and a marble plaque, dedicated to Sister Mary Agatha who died in 1917, is attached to a sandstone block. A brass plaque in the front garden area commemorates 113 years of the Sisters of Mercy in Dalby. A marble plaque is attached to the northern corner of the main facade commemorates the laying of the foundation stone but is unlikely to be original. Next to the main door is a large brass plaque, commemorating the blessing and reopening of the building as St Joseph's Parish Hostel in 1991.  Notable residents  * Ivy May Pearce, aviator and fashion designer, was a student at St Columba's  Heritage listing  The former St Columba's Convent was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 December 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Columba's Convent, a substantial brick and timber building constructed and opened in 1913 almost debt-free because of the donations made by parishioners, strikingly demonstrates the prosperity generated through pastoralism and agriculture on the Darling Downs, one of the most productive rural areas in Queensland. St Columba's, designed by local architect George Bernard Roskell and constructed for the Sisters of Mercy, demonstrates the spread of the Catholic Church in regional Queensland, and in particular the significant contribution played by this order of nuns in the spiritual and educational development of the state through its establishment of convents, schools and boarding accommodation. The order served the Dalby parish for 113 years, occupying St Columba's for 77 of these until 1990. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. St Columba's Convent is an outstanding and highly intact example of a Sisters of Mercy convent and boarding facility built to serve the prosperous Darling Downs town of Dalby. On Cunningham Street the former convent retains its commanding presence, while its exterior displays further principal characteristics of a building of this type: triple- gabled street facade employing Gothic motifs and a perimeter of timber verandahs. In terms of layout and interior finishes, the former convent is also highly intact and therefore strongly illustrative of this type of cultural place: including ground floor chapel and sacristy, stained glass and leadlight windows, decorative timberwork, refectory and reception rooms and first floor nun's cells and boarders' dormitory with a coved, pressed metal ceiling. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. St Columba's Convent is an elegant architectural composition with great aesthetic merit, with its triple-gabled front facade, walls of face brick with cement rendered bands, and a perimeter of timber verandahs. The cohesive design and scale realised in the convent gives it a commanding visual presence on the south-western end of Cunningham Street, Dalby's main thoroughfare, a quality that it shares with two other ecclesiastical buildings in the block to the north-east - St Joseph's Catholic Church and St John's Church of England.

Hager House is a historic building located in Waukon, Iowa, United States. Built from 1907 to 1908, the Hager house is the only known Iowa commission for Chicago architect Robert Clossen Spencer, Jr. Spencer played a leading role in the development of the Prairie School movement in the Midwest. with His work was strongly influenced by the English Arts and Crafts movement, but with this house he moved away from that influence. It was designed in what was thought to be the most innovative period of his career. The two-story, brick residence with a rubble stone foundation follows a rectangular plan. The main facade is asymmetrical. The open entry porch is off-center and features a superimposed chamfered balcony room. It is balanced by the stepped window stair set to the right. These two elements are vertically aligned with two hipped dormers on the roof. The entry is flanked by two free-standing flared columns with decorative capitals. They support an exposed wooden beam below the balcony room.

He also served as aide-de-camp to several members of the Grand Ducal Family throughout his career and chamberlain of the Grand Ducal court.  Biography  Émile Speller was born on 7 October 1875 in Niederanven. On 1 June 1902 he began his service with the Grand Ducal Court, being appointed as an aide by Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. He subsequently served as aide-de-camp to Grand Duke William, Grand Duchess regent Marie Anna, Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde, and Grand Duchess Charlotte. On 12 January 1927, he was promoted to the rank of captain. On 25 February 1937, Speller was appointed Major-Commandant of the Corps des Gendarmes et Volontaires. On 30 April 1937, he was appointed via ministerial order to be chairman of the supervisory commission on forestry education. On 2 February 1938, he was appointed to the High Military Court of Luxembourg. Major Speller reorganized Luxembourg's troops on 24 February 1939. He still served as the force's commander during the German invasion of Luxembourg on 10 May 1940. Most of the soldiers did not partake in the fighting, as only those who volunteered for guard duty were stationed along the border. The rest remained in their barracks, leaving the defence of the country to the Grand Ducal Gendarmerie. Total casualties amounted to six gendarmes and one soldier wounded. Twenty-two soldiers (six officers and 16 non-commissioned officers) and 54 gendarmes were captured. After the invasion Speller was briefly incarcerated by the Gestapo. He was released but monitored closely by them throughout the rest of the occupation. On 3 March 1945, the returned and reformed Luxembourg government appointed Speller to the 1945 Pension Board for the Army. On 7 October, the government retroactively recognized Speller's resignation, effective exactly five years previously. On 9 August 1946 he was granted the title of honorary colonel. Speller continued his service to the government as the chamberlain of the Grand Ducal Court. He died at his home in Luxembourg City on 17 January 1952 following a long illness.

The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2016, and was released in a limited release and through video on demand on November 3, 2016, by Vertical Entertainment and Orion Pictures. Plot Suffering from depression and longstanding guilt over a fire that killed his parents and disfigured his younger sister Pearl, Owen Roberts struggles through relationship issues with his girlfriend Isabel Sullivan. Together with Isabel and on his own, Owen regularly sees uninterested psychiatrist Florence and takes medication for sudden seizures that include flashbacks to the fateful house fire he blames himself for. After alienating Isabel's devoutly religious brother Caleb as well as Isabel's friends Sheldon and Amiee, Owen further frustrates Isabel when she reveals she is pregnant and he callously insists on abortion immediately. Owen has a change of heart and expresses a newfound desire to start a family. As a condition of forgiveness and acceptance, Isabel insists that Owen first make amends with his estranged grandmother Violet and sister Pearl, whom he abandoned to live with Isabel following the fire. Owen agrees, but warns Isabel about his grandmother's abrasive disposition. Devoutly religious, Violet greets the couple coldly, insists they sleep apart, and repeatedly refers to Isabel as a whore. A recluse whom Violet insists remain in her room because of her appearance, Pearl remains hidden away and refuses to see Owen. Isabel wants to leave because of Violet's constant verbal abuse, but Owen insists on staying until he can reconnect with Pearl. While Owen and Violet are out grocery shopping, Isabel privately bonds with Pearl. Later, Isabel repeats her wish to leave after another outburst from Violet at the dinner table, though Pearl visits Isabel during the night trying to convince her to stay. Violet tampers with Owen's medication. She then goes to see Pastor Sterling at her local church to tell him of haunting visions that she began experiencing when Owen returned. Violet claims that she hears a voice she believes to be God telling her to kill the rest of her family. She confesses that she set the fire that killed her daughter and son-in-law, and convinced Owen he was responsible in order to drive him to suicide. Horrified, Pastor Sterling insists that Violet is delusional. Violet threatens to expose Pastor Sterling for having sex with Owen's mother when she was just fifteen if he goes to the police. Violet then steals a rattlesnake from an aquarium tank in the pastor's office before leaving. Back at home, Violet hides the snake in the toilet bowl and masturbates while watching an evangelist preach on television. Meanwhile, Owen pays an emotional visit to the site where his family's house once stood. Isabel screams when she discovers the snake. Pearl rushes into the bathroom, kills the snake with her bare hands, and thrusts it at her grandmother in the kitchen. Violet makes Owen go into the crawlspace underneath her house under the pretense of repairing a piping hole where the snake came through. Violet tries starting a fatal fire while Owen is under the porch, but is physically unable to strike the match. Owen and Pearl finally speak to each other. Pearl refuses to forgive Owen for abandoning her. During the night, Violet enters Pearl's room and points a gun at her granddaughter. Pearl responds by pointing a shotgun at Violet. Violet laughs and leaves the room. Owen takes the tainted medication and collapses in the kitchen. Violet enters and points her gun at Isabel as Isabel cries on the floor over Owen. Pearl comes in with her shotgun and kills both Violet and Owen. While Isabel sits against the wall in shock, Pearl comes over and lays her head on Isabel's pregnant stomach, smiling.

The story chronicles the origins of Kris Kringle, also known as Santa Claus. The book was released in 2005. Summary Summary is coming from the Scholastic website: \\"Unlike the traditional Santa Claus myth, Kringle is a coming-of-age story about an orphan who becomes a force for good in a dark and violent time. It is a tale of fantasy, of goblins, elves, and flying reindeer — and of a boy from the humblest beginnings who fulfills his destiny. Our tale begins in 500 A.D., when goblins kidnapped human children and set them to work in underground mines. Kringle is one such child.... until he discovers his mission — to free children from enslavement. His legend lives on today, as he travels the earth every Christmas Eve to quell the goblins once more.\\" Reception Kringle has been called \\"deft writing\\" and \\"a credible blend of Anglo-Saxon legend and Christian myth\\". Booklist wrote \\"On first glance, this story of how Kris Kringle came to live at the North Pole, surrounded by toy- making elves, sounds like the premise for a lighthearted cartoon. It is anything but. ... Told in a come-nearer voice, this epic could have used some tightening, but the enticing premise, appealing young hero, and nonstop action will appeal to many fantasy lovers.\\" Film adaptation In 2007, Paramount Pictures optioned the film rights. The idea was pitched by film director Mark Dindal based on a script written by Dindal and Jason Richman, with Lorenzo di Bonaventura producing and Dindal directing. , no new updates have been announced regarding the status of the production.

Antic Software  Yost created the Antic Software publishing unit for Antic Magazine in 1984 after Jack Tramiel bought Atari Computer from Warner Communications and shut down the Atari Program Exchange. Yost met Tom Hudson at the Fall 1985 Comdex trade show and they began planning a suite of 3D animation tools for the Atari ST line of microcomputers, which became the Cyber Studio suite of animation products, beginning with CAD-3D 1.0, released autumn 1986. Stereo CAD-3D 2.0, released in late 1987, was built on an open-architecture framework and incorporated support for creating stereoscopic animations using the Tektronix “StereoTek” liquid crystal shutter 3D display. The StereoTek display was the first low-cost mass-market 3D display for microcomputers.  The Yost Group, Autodesk and beyond  In 1988 Yost left Antic Software to form “The Yost Group” when Autodesk offered him a software licensing agreement to create a suite of affordable animation tools for the IBM PC, beginning with Autodesk 3D Studio and Autodesk Animator, which was a 2D cel animation tool written by Jim Kent for The Yost Group. An obscure fact about Yost in 1988 is that, along with Computer Graphics pioneer Jim Blinn, he played percussion on the Todd Rundgren album \\"Nearly Human,\\" which was recorded at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Working with Tom Hudson, Jack Powell, Dan Silva, Rolf Berteig and Gus Grubba, Yost led the team that created Autodesk 3D Studio versions 1-4 for the MS-DOS platform. Don Brittain, former VP of Research for Wavefront Technologies, was brought into the Yost Group to help create the re- designed 3D animation program called Autodesk 3ds Max, based on the Microsoft Windows NT platform and it was first shown at the Association for Computing Machinery’s SIGGRAPH conference in Los Angeles in 1995 before its 1996 release. Yost and his engineering team applied for and received eight US patents for the technology they invented for Autodesk 3ds Max and in 1997 they sold their rights to the source code and inventions to Autodesk, ending Yost’s involvement with the product. In 2004 Yost joined Berlin-based mental images, GmbH & Co. as Executive Vice President of their US-based operation. Yost and mental images’ founder Rolf Herken had formed a relationship when Yost licensed the mental ray rendering library and other software components from mental images for Autodesk 3ds Max. mental images was acquired by nVidia, and Yost’s involvement wound down by 2011. In 2013, Yost joined Rolf Herken’s Mine Innovation as an engineering advisor.  Photography, Filmmaking and Virtual Reality.  Yost has been a photographer for over 40 years and began pursuing photography more seriously in 2012 when he created the viral video “A Day in the Life of a Fire Lookout,” about the Gardner Fire Lookout on Mt. Tamalpais in Marin County, California. That video won a Vimeo Staff Pick award. He has since been working with the Marin Municipal Water District and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy on a trilogy of films about Ground Equipment Facility J-33, the abandoned Mill Valley Air Force Station on the West Peak of Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, California. Yost's Mt. Tamalpais film series covers a wide range of topics, including a short doc about artist Zio Ziegler and his Mill Valley mural that was inspired by the Sitting Bull monument on Mt. Tam. The first film in the trilogy, “The Invisible Peak” was created by Yost with help from Peter Coyote and George Daly. It has been a selection at 16 film festivals, and has won awards for Best Documentary, Best of Show, and Outstanding Environmental Vision. The most-recent work in Yost's Mt. Tamalpais film series is \\"The Way it's Supposed to Be\\" featuring performances by Marin County musicians Bob Weir, Maria Muldaur, Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Matt Jaffe In addition to the filmmaking work he has accomplished on Mt. Tamalpais, Yost has been working on films that document the cultural life of Fijians in 2015. His other videos include a project with Puddles the Clown, which has garnered over 8 million views on YouTube and an innovative use of infrared cinematography for a project with the YASSOU band, featuring synchronized swimmers from LA-based Aqualillies. Yost has been actively promoting the use of time-lapse to tell stories, and was a judge for the LA-based 2016 Timelapse Film Festival along with Godfrey Reggio, the producer of the seminal time- lapse film Koyaanisqatsi. In 2017 Yost was the recipient of the Mill Valley Creative Achievement \\"Milley\\" award from the Mill Valley, California Arts Commission, joining previous recipients including Dan Hicks (singer), John Korty, Joyce Maynard, Sammy Hagar, Jane Hirshfield and Bob Weir. In both 2018 and 2019 Yost won the Best Indie Filmmaker reader's choice award in Marin County, California from the Pacific Sun (newspaper) and he launched the 360 Filmmaking blog in early 2018, focusing on documenting the learning processes involved in become an immersive virtual reality filmmaker.

Background In 2014, a series of powerful offensives by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant brought much of al-Hasakah Governorate under the group's control. Control of al-Hasakah city itself was split between the Kurdish and Syrian Government forces. On 21 February 2015, the YPG launched a counter-offensive against ISIL, which was followed by a Syrian government offensive on 27 February. The dual offensives saw ISIL pushed back in Hasakah, with the YPG capturing over 100 towns, villages and hamlets and the Syrian Army capturing around 40 villages on Highway 7, which links al-Hasakah to Qamishli. In May 2015, the YPG captured a further 230 towns, villages, and farms west of al- Hasakah during the Western Al-Hasakah Offensive. On 30 May ISIL launched an offensive on al-Hasakah city, but this was repelled. They launched a second offensive on the city on 23 June, initially capturing four districts and areas within three others, as well as multiple villages southwest of Al-Hasakah. However, a YPG counterattack in al-Hasakah with the support of coalition and later backed by the SAA cleared it of ISIL fighters by 1 August, with the YPG left in control of 75% of the city, while the Syrian Army controlled 25%. The battle On 16 August 2016, clashes broke out in al-Hasakah city between Asayish and NDF forces, after a small skirmish, with both sides claiming to be advancing. On 19 August, Al-Masdar News claimed that NDF fighters had advanced in the city center, capturing the New Hospital and parts of the Marsho area. The Syrian Arab Air Force launched 10 airstrikes on the Asayish headquarters. It was the first time during the Syrian civil war when the Syrian Arab Air Force launched airstrikes against the Kurdish forces. According some news agencies, US special forces withdrew around al-Hasakah the same day, though the CJTF–OIR increased their air patrols in the area to prevent the Syrian Air Force from bombing U.S. special forces as well as their Kurdish allies and monitor the situation. Nevertheless, U.S. officials said that they were not trying to establish a no-fly zone. Meanwhile, heavy clashes took place in the Ghwyran area northeast of al-Hasakah and in the al-Nashweh area in the eastern city, where Kurdish forces made major progress according to the Hawar News Agency. Early on 20 August, fighting calmed down, as another attempt to mediate a ceasefire was made. The governor of al-Hasakah, Muhammed Za’al al- Ali, urged the YPG to stop fighting against the Syrian government, as they had fought together against ISIL and had a supportive relationship before the clashes. The PYD accused local NDF troops of spreading anti-Kurdish propaganda and demanded that all NDF units had to leave the city for a new peace agreement, which the Syrian government refused. As result, these talks failed, so heavy clashes once again broke out in the city at noon, when the Syrian Air Force started airstrikes with the artillery support for the Syrian Arab Army. After fierce fighting near the Guweiran District to the southwest and in the Nashwa neighborhoods at the city center throughout the night, the violence again abated in course of the following day. Later on 21 August, the newly arrived YPG and MFS forces launched a massive offensive in the city, storming the Red Villas, the Guweiran District, the Al-Askari District, and the eastern Nashwa neighborhoods, resulting in fierce fighting there as Syrian government fighters launched counterattacks to regain these positions. Despite several attempts, Syrian government forces failed to regain lost positions. In southern al-Hasakah city, the Asayish captured the Faculty of Economics, but reportedly retreated after being shelled by the Syrian Army from the Kawkab Mountains. To support the pro-government fighters, the Syrian Air Force launched over 30 airstrikes on the Kurdish forces in the city. Despite heavy airstrikes and artillery, Kurdish forces captured much of the eastern Guweiran district and were still advancing by the evening. In course of the next night, fighting again stopped. US jets began preventing the Syrian Air Force from striking the Kurds in the city, thus enabling the latter to better advance against government forces. By dawn on 22 August, however, the Syrian Air Force started its airstrikes again against Asayish checkpoints, which led the Asayish to storm the northeastern Guweiran District, while NDF units reportedly managed to advance in the Tal Hajjar District in northern and the Al-Zuhour District in southern Al-Hasakah. Fighting was also reported at the al-Basil turning. On the same day, pro-government media al-Masdar News reported that the Kurdish forces were \\"on the verge of seizing the entire provincial capital\\", al-Hasakah, after they captured the eastern neighborhoods of the Al-Nashwa District and positions in the Sports City, which served as a major NDF stronghold. Later that day, Kurdish forces captured the central prison and all NDF positions around the Sports City collapsed. At that point, Kurdish forces were in control of about 90% of Hasakah. On 23 August 2016, a ceasefire agreement was signed after Russian mediation, which left al-Hasakah city almost completely under the control of the Kurdish forces, with all Syrian Armed Forces personnel forced to leave and indefinitely banned from the city. Only the security square which contained the government departments of the city remained under the protection of Syrian government police units, while control over all seized areas were given to the Asayish.

Convolution quotients were introduced by , and their theory is sometimes called Mikusiński's operational calculus. The kind of convolution (f,g)\\\\mapsto f*g with which this theory is concerned is defined by : (f*g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x f(u) g(x-u) \\\\, du. It follows from the Titchmarsh convolution theorem that if the convolution f*g of two functions f,g that are continuous on [0,+\\\\infty) is equal to 0 everywhere on that interval, then at least one of f,g is 0 everywhere on that interval. A consequence is that if f,g,h are continuous on [0,+\\\\infty) then f = g. This fact makes it possible to define convolution quotients by saying that for two functions ƒ, g, the pair (ƒ, g) has the same convolution quotient as the pair (h * ƒ,h * g). Convolution quotients are used in an approach to making Dirac's delta function and other generalized functions logically rigorous.

Alison Murray is an American microbial ecologist and Antarctic researcher, best known for studying the diversity, ecology and biogeography of Antarctic marine plankton dynamics of the plankton over the annual cycle; and her work demonstrating the existence of microbial life within an ice-sealed Antarctic lake (Lake Vida). She studies how microorganisms persist and function in extremely cold and harsh environments, including those that lack oxygen and biological sources of energy. Early life and education Murray was born and raised in Carmel, California and attended Carmel High School. She received her B.S. in Biochemistry at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo in 1989, followed by participation in a work-study program that turned into a Research Assistant position at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (formerly, Bermuda Biological Station). Following two years of work experience she joined the Biogeochemical Reactions in Estuaries - Land Margin Ecosystem Research Program at Tomales Bay, earned her M.S. degree at San Francisco State University in Cell and Molecular Biology in 1994 where she studied with James T. Hollibaugh to develop molecular fingerprinting approaches for marine microorganisms. Murray's Ph.D. was earned in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology under the mentorship of Edward F. DeLong, from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1998. It was during this time that she participated in two research expeditions to the Antarctic where she studied the ecology of planktonic marine archaea, Crenarchaeota, with circumpolar distributions and demonstrated significant shifts in bacterial community composition and archaeal biomass over the extremes of the high latitude seasonal cycle. Career and impact  Murray's postdoctoral research (1999-2001) was conducted at the Center for Microbial Ecology at Michigan State University in which she studied in the emerging field of functional genomics with Distinguished Professor James M. Tiedje. She then moved to Desert Research Institute (DRI) in Reno, Nevada, USA in 2001 where she is a research professor. Murray is best known for studying the diversity, ecology and biogeography of Antarctic marine plankton dynamics of the plankton over the annual cycle; and herdiscovering the existence of microbial life at −13 °C existing within an ice-sealed the Antarctic Lake Vida, the largest of several unique lakes found in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This research finding was profiled by BBC TV, National Public Radio, and in the international news media including The Guardian, Los Angeles Times and Nature. Murray's research has provided critical insights into how microorganisms persist and function in extremely cold and harsh environments, including those that lack oxygen and biological sources of energy. Making use of molecular genomic tools to describe microbial life, her work has helped answer questions about how microbes function and survive in extremely cold environments and how environmental changes affect the functioning and diversity of these organisms, as well as potential feedbacks that might impact the sustainability of cold- environment ecosystems. The research has altered the scientific view of biological diversity in high latitude ecosystems where microbes are significantly more diverse than originally surmised and exhibit strong seasonal gradients in community composition; they have been found to exist in places originally thought to be uninhabitable.. Her research has shown how microbes respond to different environmental gradients and how they contribute and control fundamental ecological processes resulting in a better understanding of how high latitude ecosystems function and how they might respond to broad scale perturbations such as climate change. (e.g.). Awards and honours Murray was recognized in 2019 as the recipient of the DRI Science Medal; she was also awarded the Nevada System of Higher Education Rising Researcher Award in 2009 and the Nevada Regents’ Researcher Award in 2013. Other activities Murray's leadership activities include serving as Co-lead of NASA’s Research Coordination Network for Ocean Worlds, in 2016-2017 she served as co-chair of the Europa Lander Science Definition team, and between 2004-2016 she served as Representative to the Life Sciences Standing Committee for the US in the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research for eleven years and played roles in the Census of Antarctic Marine Life, and continues today in biodiversity data management as part of the AntEco Scientific Research Program steering committee [link: https://www.scar.org/srp/anteco/].

There was speculation in the aftermath of the accidents, that miscommunication regarding the availability of government grants may have led to overcrowding on one of the buses. Days of rainfall preceded the accidents. First incident A passenger bus left Kathmandu on the morning of 15 August 2016, en route to Madan Kundari away in Kavrepalanchok District in central Nepal. Many were survivors of the Nepalese earthquakes of April 2015 and May 2015. Some of them were returning to their village to collect government grants to rebuild their destroyed homes that they mistakenly thought were going to be paid there. Others mistakenly thought they had only a few days left before a deadline to return to their village to sign papers to receive the grants. Overcrowding on Nepalese buses is common; as the bus travelled along its route more people boarded until many were seated on the roof and in the aisle. It was reported that almost 90 people were on the 35-seat bus. At about 1:30p.m. the bus stalled as it climbed a hill on a muddy road near Birtadeurali and rolled backwards off the road and down the hillside, falling more than . Some people survived by jumping off the roof before the bus fell. At least 27 to at least 33 people were killed and at least 38 to 42 were injured. The driver of the bus survived and was found in a tree. An investigation was launched to see why the driver lost control and whether the brakes failed. Second incident The second incident occurred near Siddheshwar in Baitadi District, in far-western Nepal. At about 3:30p.m. on 15 August, another bus slipped off of a high mountain road, falling and killing at least three to four people while injuring thirty.

In 1953 extensive repair work was undertaken in which the opportunity was taken to raise the parapet and add metal railings on top. A \\"Last Train\\" special crossed the viaduct a week before final closure. The track was lifted in the 1960s. The prospect of rail traffic returning over the viaduct is very remote, not least because part of the route has been flooded by the construction of a dam at Llyn Celyn. The viaduct is the location of a spectacular suicide in episode 8 of the 2018 S4C drama Hidden (Craith). Modern access The structure is Grade II Listed.

Designed in the Classical Revival architectural style, it was built by slaves before the American Civil War and black laborers after the war. The land has been owned by the same family since 1810.

In 1828, the land was inherited by his daughter, Nancy Saunders, who married Robert A. Harper. The Harpers lived on the farm, and they owned slaves. The farm was subsequently inherited by their daughter, Clara Reed Harper, and her husband, Cornelius Weistling Callender. They had two sons, William Sample Callender and Samuel Ewing Callender. Cornelius served as the president of Ole Soule College in Murfreesboro, Tennessee and later the Tennessee Female College in Franklin, Tennessee. By 1858, Cornelius used his slaves to build the house until 1861, when the American Civil War began. It was designed in the Classical Revival architectural style. The construction of the house was completed by a builder named John Mir after the war. After Cornelius died, the house was inherited by their son William, but it was purchased by Ewing in 1906. Ewing and his wife Pauline moved there with their daughter, Elisabeth Ewing Callender, in 1913, and they hired African-American laborers to remodel the house in 1914.

The episode was written by Thomas Ian Griffith, and was directed by Terrence O'Hara. The episode aired alongside the next episode, Twelve Days of Krampus. Plot Opening quote: \\"But for the pit confounders, let them go, and find as little mercy as they show!\\" Adalind (Claire Coffee) meets with Prince Viktor Chlodwig zu Schellendorf von Konigsburg (Alexis Denisof), Eric's replacement. Viktor wants to find out who killed Eric and also says that he is Renard's (Sasha Roiz) cousin. Adalind tells him about Renard and also about Nick (David Giuntoli), identifying him as a Grimm. Back in Portland, a man named Gregorek (Matthew Willig) breaks into a house and begins to rob it. Someone enters the house and Gregorek kills him using his Wesen form. When Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate the scene, Nick thinks that the creature was a Siegbarste again. Meanwhile, a city worker lowers to a sewer to fix it when he hears sounds from inside and is killed by a creature. In Vienna, Renard (Sasha Roiz) and Meisner (Damien Puckler) meet with Sebastien (Christian Lagadec), who reveals that Viktor will meet with two men, Frenay and Tavitian, the former being the prime suspect of Eric's murder. Nick and Hank are sent to investigate the murder and while inspecting the sewers, Wu (Reggie Lee) finds the worker's leg. In his backpack, many items from the robbed houses are revealed, linking the murderer to the man killed in the house. The examination also reveals that the marks belong to that of an alligator. Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) suggests that the killer is a Gelumcaedus. Along with Rosalee (Bree Turner) and Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch), Nick and Hank find that the Gelumcaedus are ancient creatures who protected the sewers. Acquiring a map, Nick and Hank find that the sewers connect to all the robberies in the area. They travel to the sewers where they are attacked by a Gelumcaedus. Hank manages to knock him with a rifle and it woges back to his human form, revealed to be Gregorek, who says: \\"Dēcapitāre\\". In Vienna, Renard, Meisner and Sebastien arrive at the meeting with Frenay, who is executing a man for betraying them and tells Meisner to kill him. In the station, Nick and Hank try to make Gregorek confess but he refuses. Nick learns from Rosalee that the word \\"Dēcapitāre\\" means \\"he who decapitates\\" in Latin. Hank goes home, calling Nick believing that there may have been one or two others involved in the killings, as some took place at the same time as others. Hank is then attacked by another Gelumcaedus and subdued and taken to the sewers. The man, Andre (Ernie Joseph) calls Nick and demands that he releases his brother, Gregorek or he will kill Hank. Nick accepts Andre's terms and releases Gregorek and takes him to the sewers. However, the brothers decide to kill them with the help of another Gelumcaedus. Nick frees Hank and battle the Gelumcaedus brothers, killing Andre and the other brother, and arrest Gregorek again. Adalind's room is revealed to be watched over by Viktor while Nick returns the armor to the trailer while uttering the word, \\"Dēcapitāre, I kind of like it\\".

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"The breadcrumb approach to revealing the larger story at play makes me far less interested in where the bigger story is going. At this rate, it will take the entire length of the series for anything significant to actually happen. The villains in these plots haven't been an immediate threat other than briefly at the midpoint and end of the second season, with Nick's confrontation with his captain and Eric's attempt to kidnap Nick back to Europe.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.1 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Grimm Season 3 Episode 7 really cemented an idea that's been very consistent this season: Nick is absolutely fearless. It might be because he's been to one side of death and come back again, or because his immediate social circle is in more danger now that his secret is out the he has a desire to make sure nothing can come back to haunt anyone.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"Maybe it was the fact that most of the hype for Grimms two-hour seasonal send-off focused so heavily on Krampus Claus that left me so underwhelmed with the first half of the finale, but whatever, because Krampus Claus delivered, and it's not that 'Cold Blooded' was bad, just that it wasn't anything special.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 3) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"Cold Blooded (Grimm)"},{"id":"51364698","text":"Hazel Path is a historic mansion in Hendersonville, Tennessee, U.S..

The last of a trifecta of concept cars initially conceived in 2007, it is preceded by the Ciel and Elmiraj, which had debuted back in 2011 and 2013 respectively. The Escala previews Cadillac's future design language, being an evolution of the Art and Science design philosophy that has been used on its cars for over a decade. The Escala was first announced via a trailer video on August 15, 2016. Its name, revealed one day before its public debut, derives from the Spanish word for scale. This refers to the Escala using an elongated version of the Cadillac CT6's Omega underpinnings, being approximately six inches longer than the latter. The car was unveiled at a cocktail party in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California on August 18, 2016, which was attended by Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen, GM Vice President of Global Design Michael Simcoe and Cadillac's executive director of global design Andrew Smith, along with several other executives. Although yet to be officially confirmed for production, it was described by de Nysschen as \\"a potential addition to our existing product plan” in a press release, its ultimate fate determined by the fertility of the flagship luxury sedan market. However, it previews the design, powertrain and other advanced technological features currently in development that is set to appear on other upcoming Cadillac production cars in the future.  Overview  = Exterior = The exterior, painted in a nine-layer pearlescent blackish-brown \\"Gaia\\" finish, blends Cadillac's trademark Art and Science era design cues with more contemporary ones, being the first Cadillac to feature horizontal headlamps since the Seville was discontinued in 2004. This was done to give the car a more understated, harmonious look, in which simplicity is a prevalent theme on the Escala's design. They are complemented by two vertical strips of OLED daytime running lamps positioned just below the headlamps. A monotone Cadillac emblem adorns the three-dimensional mesh grille, patterned with several miniature crests. The car is designed as a four-door hardtop with a sloping rear roofline, giving a more athletic appearance, with a liftback tailgate at the rear end. When the trunk is opened, the cargo floor rises up to enable easier access to luggage. Also present on the car's C-pillar is the Hofmeister kink, a rarely seen trait for a Cadillac, possibly paying homage to the fastback Cadillac coupés of the late 1940s. Cadillac's signature vertical taillights are reworked, now added with a horizontal strip. It sits on 22-inch dual layer spoke wheels, fitted with 20-inch tires co-developed with Michelin that has the Cadillac chevron exclusively engraved onto the tire tread. The newly designed front fascia is expected to make its way to Cadillac production models starting in late 2018. = Interior = The handcrafted \\"dual personality\\" interior is designed specifically to combine driver technology amenities and rear-seat passenger comfortability into one automobile. A wide, three-layered curved OLED screen developed with Samsung stretches across the dashboard in the driver's compartment, while accompanied by smaller, retractable displays at the back of the front seats for rear passengers. The normal metal top is replaced by a panoramic glass roof, which along with the absence of B-pillars gives the car a more \\"airy\\" feel associated with Cadillac hardtops from the 1950s to 1970s. Much of the upholstery, including the seatbacks, door panel and lower dashboard, is finished in a pale gray leather similar to those used in designer suits, contrasted by woven white wool. The famous Cadillac flying goddess, designed by William Schnell in 1930 and having last appeared in the 1950s, returns after a long hiatus in the form an etching on the car's glass infotainment controller, which replaces the older CUE system. = Powertrain = The Escala is powered by a Cadillac-exclusive 4.2-liter twin-turbocharged dual overhead camshaft V8 engine generating 500 horspower, which is due to be introduced as a more powerful engine option in the CT6. The engine uses General Motors' new Active Fuel Management cylinder deactivation system, allowing the engine to run on four cylinders for better fuel efficiency. The car shares the mixed-material rear-wheel-drive Omega platform with the CT6, although enlarged by 4.7 inches, giving the car an extra 6.5 inches in overall length when compared to the latter.

Valentinis was born to nobles and married a knight during her adolescence while mothering six children before she was widowed in 1441. She soon became a professed religious and dedicated herself to austerities and a life of complete penance. Her beatification was ratified on 27 September 1848 after Pope Pius IX approved her local 'cultus' - or popular veneration. Life Elena Valentinis was born in Udine in 1396 to the nobleman Count Valentinis - a lord of Maniago. She had at least one sister: Perfetta. In her adolescence in 1411 she married the Florentine knight Antonio del Cavalcanti and the pair had six children - three males and three females. He died in 1441 and as a result she cut off her hair and placed it with her jewels in his coffin and said: \\"These I wore for love of you; take them to the grave with you\\". Valentinis later attended a sermon that Fra Angelo da San Severino gave at the Augustinian church of Santa Lucia and decided then and there to join the order. She became a professed third order member of the Order of Saint Augustine (the first for the third order in Udine) sometime in 1441 where she soon became known for her several austerities and her life of dedication to her fellow man and woman. One of her austerities was to take a vow of silence though she spoke on Christmas night alone. She continued to live at home though later moved in with her sister in 1446 who also was a third order Augustinian and resided there until her death. Valentinis was known for her ecstatic trances as well as the noted gift of healing others. She became known for her ardent devotion to the Eucharist and to the Passion of Jesus Christ. Valentinis also placed 33 pebbles in her shoes as an act of penance. Valentinis became bedridden in 1455 after fracturing both her femurs in a fall and she preferred a pallet of stones and straw to an actual bed. Her declining health led to her death on the Saturday evening of 23 April 1458. On her deathbed Mass was celebrated and friars from a convent not too far from her came to sing psalms. Her remains were interred in Santa Lucia but later moved to the Udine Cathedral in 1845. Beatification Tomb in the Udine Cathedral. Her local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular veneration to her - received official ratification from Pope Pius IX on 27 September 1848 which allowed for him to issue his approval for her beatification.

Life Clydog was a member of the clan of the legendary king Brychan, whose children and grandchildren became the famed saints of Cornwall and Wales. His father was Clydwyn, himself a saint and the son of Brychan. Although some sources say he conquered the whole of South Wales, which is unlikely, but it is possible that he was at one time also king of Ceredigion and Dyfed along with his brother Dedyw. His other brothers included St Cynon and St Cynlefr the Martyr and St Berwen. As king of Ergyng he ruled over parts of Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, known for its time of peace and justice. With his brother Dedyw he trained as a priest under Saint Cadoc at Llancarfan. Following his return to Ergyng, a woman fell in love with him and refused to marry anyone else. A local Saxon noble had also fallen for the same woman. Shortly after while Clydog was hunting a deer, the Saxon shot Clydog with an arrow, killing him. His body was placed on a cart and taken to the ford of the river below the present church in Clodock, at which point the cart broke and the oxen could go no further. He was thus buried there at Caer Gledog, near Longtown, Herefordshire. Some sources label Clydog a martyr, being a Christian killed by an outsider, but this is probably a mistranslation of the word merthyr (shrine). A chapel was built above his burial which became a site of pilgrimage. His fame spread and even several centuries later people were still being named after him, including a 12th- century Bishop of Llandaff. St Clydawg's church now covers the parish of Clodock, which moved from Wales to England in 1535. He was married three times in total; his wives were successively Prawst, Ribrawst and Roistri.

He is the founder president of the Tamil Sangam in Taiwan. He has received various awards, including awards from Seoul World Academy of Arts and Culture (2004), Thiruvalluvar award (2014), and a felicitation from former President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Personal life Yu Hsi was born Hung Ching Yu in Fangyuan township, Taiwan, on 16 March 1951. He obtained a doctorate in letters. He has authored more than 60 books. In a unique literary style, he wrote his fifth long-form novel on tradition scrolls, which contained almost 600,000 words. He has also translated Tamil classic Thirukkural, poems of Bharathiyar and Bharathidasan and Avvaiyar's \\"Aathichoodi\\" (containing morals) in Mandarin. He has been ordained a Buddhist monk as Dao Yi. Fascination toward Indian religion and philosophy Yu Hsi revealed that he was greatly fascinated about Hinduism and Indian philosophy. According to him, great wisdom lay in the Indian religion and philosophy. He counted Hindu god Ganesh as his favorite for having scripted the Mahabharata as told by sage Vedavyas. According to Yu Hsi, Lord Ganesha typifies the journey of enlightenment, just like those of ancient Buddhist monks. He also considers the characters of Krishna and Arjuna to have influenced him greatly. Translating the Tirukkural In May 2010, Yu Hsi had a chance meeting with former President of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam when the latter presented him with a copy of the Tirukkural and a golden statue of Buddha. The Kural text reminded him of the Hindu mythologies of Ramayana and Mahabharata and their virtuous characters, which he was fascinated about 30 years earlier. Yu Hsi then agreed to translate the Thirukkural into Chinese and completed it in about three months. He also installed a life-size statue of Valluvar, the author of the Kural text, in Taiwan. Awards In 2004, Yu Hsi was awarded the Poet Laureate, the highest honour awarded by Seoul World Academy of Arts and Culture. In praise of his translation of the Tirukkural in Mandarin, the Tamil Nadu government awarded 540,000. Yu Hsi, however, donated the amount to Tamil University for setting up of an endowment to propagate Tirukkural. In 2008, Yu Hsi received the Jan Smrek Prize in Bratislava, Slovakia, for his poetry inspired by Buddhism. On the occasion, his five long poems were published in Slovak translation under the title \\"Cesta\\" (Road). In 2014, he received the Thiruvalluvar award from the Government of Tamil Nadu.

The players assume the role of survivors who find themselves stranded in the harsh wilderness of Alaska and must work together to stay alive. Funding for the game was secured through a successful Kickstarter campaign in May 2016. An early alpha version was released through Game Jolt on May 23, 2016. This version of the game doesn't include multiplayer mode, but it does showcase the game's visual and play style. It contains resource gathering, hunting, crafting, upgrading and shelter building. Gameplay Through single-player or with help from multiplayer, the player must survive using resources found in the environment while avoiding exposure. Taking inspiration from Diablo, and more modern indie titles, like Don't Starve, The Wild Eight is based around a team of up to eight players working together to survive after a plane crash. While the survivors await rescue, their lives are threatened by a number of mysterious entities, unseen creatures and objects. The Wild Eight website mentions that players have to develop survival skills such as shelter building, and hunting is definitely on the roster (one screenshot shows the team taking down an animal using knives and clubs, and one player is throwing rocks). The freezing temperatures at night come into play, and there are apparently mutated wolves on the loose. The Wild Eight can be played in single-player. The final game contains a story-driven campaign and quests. Development The Wild Eight is the first big project for Fntastic from Yakutia, the Sakha Republic, but the team has some experience in the casual games sector. Fntastic launched a Kickstarter campaign for The Wild Eight to raise $50,000 and build a community around the game. The project was fully funded with 11 days of the campaign to go. Contributions on Indiegogo InDemand following the Kickstarter campaign pushed the final total to over $60,000 by August 2016.

He became a Franciscan in 1213 after hearing Fra Filippo - one of the disciples of Francis of Assisi - preach. He spent over two decades in France where he oversaw the establishment of Franciscan houses before returning to the Italian peninsula where he served his life in quiet cloistered retirement. His beatification received the papal approval of Pope Pius VII on 20 December 1806 after the latter decreed that there existed an enduring and popular local 'cultus' - or devotion to the late priest - through the centuries. Life Giovanni da Penna was born in 1193 in Fermo. He became a professed member of the Order of Friars Minor in 1213 in Recanati. Fra Filippo - sent to Penna San Giovanni at the behest of Francis of Assisi - came to preach in the church of Saint Stephen and so he attended this sermon and listened in astonishment while afterwards begging to be received into the order and vested in its habit. Fra Filippo told the hopeful that he would receive him into the order if he were to go to Recanati. The now ordained priest attended the provincial chapter of the Franciscans in Recanati, and was sent to Languedoc in 1217 alongside other companions to spread the work of the order there.\\"Blessed Giovanni da Penna San Giovanni\\", Santi e Beati, October 17, 2001 It was there that he desired his life would soon come to a close so that he could return to God and so he sat under a tree to reflect and beseeched the Lord to take him - but a voice responded that he still had much work to do on Earth. He founded several houses for the order in Provence in France during an apostolate that spanned over two decades. He returned to the Italian peninsula in 1242 after a messenger from the Father Provincial came to summon him back and he returned to live the bulk of three decades in cloistered retirement. In 1248 he settled civil unrest in his hometown after writing a pact that was used during negotiations. He spent one full night until the next dawn in spiritual reflection until an angel appeared and foretold that the priest would soon die. He offered the priest a choice: to spend a day in Purgatory or to expiate his remaining sins through one full week of suffering - he chose the latter. Da Penna fell ill at once with a high fever and total pain including gout in his hands and feet. The devil also came to him in a vision with a list of all the sins he committed and said to him: \\"Because of these sins which thou hast committed in thought, word, and deed, thou art condemned to the depths of Hell\\". This depressed him to the point where he told this to his fellow friars who at once summoned the aged Matteo da Monte Robbiano - who was a confessor on occasion for da Penna and a close friend - who arrived not long before his death. Robbiano encouraged da Penna instead and comforted him and said it was a mere trick of Satan. Da Penna died on 3 April 1271 after his week of suffering. Beatification Da Penna's beatification received approval from Pope Pius VII on 20 December 1806 after the latter ratified that the priest did in fact have a local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular veneration - that endured through the centuries.

It was announced on 24 July 1925 and came into force on 1 August 1925.Official Gazette of the Government of Palestine, No. 147, September 16, 1925, pp. 460–466. The Order remained in effect until 14 May 1948, when the British withdrew from the Mandate, and Palestinian citizenship came to an end. Israel enacted a Citizenship Law in 1952, while West Bank residents came under Jordan’s nationality law. Key terms The law gave effect to Article 7 of the British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument), which stated: \\"The Administration of Palestine shall be responsible for enacting a nationality law. There shall be included in this law provisions framed so as to facilitate the acquisition of Palestinian citizenship by Jews who take up their permanent residence in Palestine.\\" It also gave effect to the Treaty of Lausanne, which came into force on 6 August 1924, and stated that the Ottoman nationals who were \\"habitually residents\\" of what became Palestine \\"will become ipso facto\\" nationals of that territory.Hurewitz 1956, p. 119 The Order granted Palestinian citizenship to \\"Turkish subjects habitually resident in the territory of Palestine upon the 1st day of August, 1925\\". Transjordan was specifically excluded. Under some circumstances citizenship was also conferred on some persons habitually resident abroad, as well as the children or wife of a Palestinian man. The Order contained no test based on race or religion, except that people in the non-majority race could opt out of Palestinian citizenship if they were accepted by another state in which their race was a majority. Ottoman citizenship arose from the Ottoman Nationality Law of 1869, which created a common Ottoman citizenship irrespective of religious or ethnic affiliation. Under the Order, Palestinian citizenship could be acquired by: * natural change from Ottoman to Palestinian citizenship (Part I of the Order) * birth to a father who was a Palestine citizen himself, or birth within Palestine without acquiring the nationality of any other State (Part II of the Order) * naturalization following a period of residence in Palestine (Part III of the Order) Palestinian citizens had the right of abode in Palestine, but were not British subjects, and were instead considered British protected persons. Excerpts The Palestinian Citizenship Order 1925 THE KING'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY NOW THEREFORE, HIS MAJESTY - By virtue and in exercise of the powers in his behalf by the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1890, or otherwise, in His Majesty vested, is pleased by and with the advice of His Privy Council to order, and it is ordered as follows:- PART 1. 1\\\\. (1) Turkish subjects habitually resident in the territory of Palestine upon the 1st day of August 1924 shall become Palestine citizens. (2) Any person over eighteen years of age who by virtue of this Article becomes a Palestinian citizen may [...] (3) Any person over eighteen years of age who by virtue of clause (1) of this Article becomes a Palestinian citizen and differs in race from the majority of the population of Palestine may in the like manner and subject to the same conditions opt for the nationality of one of the States in which the majority of the population is of the same race as the person exercising the right to opt subject to the consent of that State and he shall thereupon cease to be a Palestinian citizen. Article 21: Definitions For the purpose of this Order: 1\\\\. The expression “Palestine” includes the territories to which the mandate for Palestine applies, except such parts of the territories comprised in Palestine to the east of Jordan and the Dead Sea as were defined by Order of the High Commissioner dated the first of September 1922. 2\\\\. The expression “Palestinian citizen” means a person who is by birth or becomes by naturalisation or otherwise a Palestinian citizen.

In addition, Manners realised that without a secure place to call home, employability was near impossible. This led to the creation of what was then called the Chiswick Furniture Centre, a social impact business that seeks to support sustainable tenancies, helping turn social housing into homes, whilst running a 16-week employability programme, the Resco Programme, within the business. The programme offers work experience, training and mentoring. In 2015, it was agreed that the Chiswick Furniture Centre was no longer an applicable name, and it was renamed as Resco Living. Resco Living Resco Living provides furniture, appliances and other products and services to social housing providers such as local authorities, housing associations and other charities.

Built about 1830, it is one of the best-preserved examples of a 19th-century stagecoach accommodation between Rutland and Vergennes, with a distinctive combination of Federal and Greek Revival architectural elements. Now converted to a residence, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The former Stagecoach Inn stands facing south toward Fern Lake Road, just east of its junction with US 7, across which Leicester's small town center is located. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side-gable roof and clapboarded exterior. It is set on a modern concrete block foundation, having been moved back from the highway and turned 90 degrees in 1977. Its most distinctive exterior feature is the two- story from porch, which is recessed under the main roof. The porch is supported by Doric columns with differing details on the first and second floors. The main entrance is at the center of the five-bay facade, flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, with a porch entrance directly above which has similar pilasters. An integral ell extends to the rear of the building. Both the main block and ell retain original features on the interior, including woodwork and door hardware, fireplace surrounds, and stencilwork on the walls. with The structure's construction date is uncertain, but it was probably begun before 1830, intended to be a retail store. It was purchased by Dr. William Gile, a prominent local physician, who is credited with completing the building's construction and opening it as a traveler's accommodation on the Rutland-Vergennes stagecoach route (now US 7). It was operated as such until 1859, also serving as a local social meeting point. It was thereafter converted into a strictly retail space, serving as a general store and post office into the 20th century, when it was converted into a private residence. It was moved (remaining on its lot) in 1977 because its location close to the main road impeded sightlines from Fern Lake Road.

Biography Staughton came to Victoria in 1841 with his wife Mary Susan, daughter Mary Susan and three sons, Simon Frederick, Samuel Thomas and Stephen George. After a long journey from England in the sailing ship Himalaya they landed at Liardet's Beach, now Port Melbourne. Their first home was in Little Collins Street near King Street, then known as Twopenny row. Later that year he purchased Eynesbury. He acquired the Brisbane Ranges and Exford runs, in the Exford district. By the 1850s he owned 60,000 sheep. Exford, Eynesbury, Lindisfern and Staughton Vale were parts of the earliest Port Phillip grazing runs. He was constantly improving his estates and carried the best stock. He also invested in city property, some of which is retained by his descendants. The Staughton family became prominent in the time of Richard I when a member of the family received a large grant of land about 20 miles from Bedford, England. The family remained at Staughton Manor until 1923 when two brothers who owned Staughton Manor had what they thought was an unbeatable greyhound. The brothers backed their dog in an event with all the money they possessed and lost. The next day they backed the dog and lost again and were forced to sell the estate. Simon Staughton accumulated considerable wealth in the next few years by trading and brought 40,000 sovereigns to Australia. He died in May 1863 at St Kilda, Victoria.

Background  Tapizar is a bay horse with a stripe on his head. He has no feet markings. His sire is Tapit, a champion sire who has sired three Belmont Stakes winners in Tonalist, Creator, and Tapwrit, as well as February Stakes winner Testa Matta. His dam is Winning Call, whose sire was Sovereign and Eclipse Award winner Deputy Minister.  Career  =Two-year old season= As a two-year old Tapizar ran four times. The first race was a maiden Special Weight at Monmouth Park. At the start he broke off well and settled in third, and by the half a mile pole he took the lead. He kept it until the home stretch where he faded out of contention, finishing third. His next race was also at Monmouth Park. This time, he ran against future champions Pants on Fire, and Mucho Macho Man. At the start of the race, Tapizar stumbled badly, unseated the rider, and did not finish. In his next start he went to Churchill Downs. At the start he broke decently, stalked in third, and stayed there almost all the way to the end. He faded to fourth at the very end of the race. He returned to Churchill Downs for his fourth and final start of the year. He started a length behind the leader Ratatat for most of the race, but eventually Ratatat tired, leaving Tapizar to romp as he was five lengths ahead of everyone else at the far turn. At the finish he finished by more the double at 10 1/2 lengths. =Three-year old season= With his destructive maiden win, his next race was his graded stakes debut, the Sham Stakes at Santa Anita. At the start he was third but moved to the front quickly. He then had the lead by two lengths for the next three quarters of a mile, where he opened up to win by four and a quarter lengths. In his next start Tapizar tried to make his second graded stakes win in the Robert B. Lewis Stakes. He took the lead early, like before, but he was forced to run fast early. He began to tire at the far turn and finished fifth. After the race he got a chipped knee and did not race for another eight months. By October Tapizar had recovered completely and planned to return in an allowance. After a good start he took the lead by the first quarter, keeping the lead by just a length. Then at the far turn he opened up to win by two and a quarter lengths. With that under his belt he finally had his chance to make his Grade 1 debut in the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. He started fifth and began to move up. He soon moved up to third, but it was all for nothing as he faded back to fifth at the finish. =Four-year old season= To start the four-year old season, Tapizar did almost exactly the same thing he did to start his three-year-old season, by running in a graded stakes race at Santa Anita in January. At the start he pulled along four wide and took the lead by a quarter of a mile. After that, he kept the lead, regularly shrinking and increasing his lead until the final turn where he was two lengths in front and at the wire was three and a half lengths ahead. After this, he ran in the G2 Charles H. Strub Stakes. This time he wasn't so lucky. He stalked in second for most of the race, slowly letting Ultimate Eagle open his lead. In the end Tapizar kept on fading until he finished fourth, 10 and three quarters behind. A month later Tapizar tried another track when he went to Oaklawn Park for the Razorback Handicap. Similarly as in the Strub, he stalked closely behind the leader Alternation, and again he let Alternation open up his lead from half a length, to one and a half lengths at the finish. Tapizar was second from start to finish. After that, Tapizar did not race for another five months. He finally returned in the West Virginia Governor's Stakes. This time at the start he broke quickly and moved clear into the lead by the first quarter. He kept this lead until three quarters of mile in where Seruni took over. This time, though, Tapizar regained it in the stretch and waltzed away by four and a half lengths. The next race was his final prep before his biggest challenge yet, his second attempt at the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. At the start everything began to go wrong when he broke slowly and was bumped by Jersey Town and To Honor and Serve. After that he hustled to third, but quickly faded and finished in 6th place, 20 3/4 lengths behind. Then came his last race, the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. He had two big challengers, named Fed Biz, and Shackleford. At the start Shackleford stumbled and was not a big factor. Fed Biz was hustled early and completely tired. Meanwhile, Tapizar stalked in second behind Emcee, then took over at three quarters of a mile, and won by two and a quarter lengths. After that he was retired to stud, producing a couple noteworthy horses. His most noteworthy progeny is 2018 Kentucky Oaks winner and Horse of the Year finalist Monomoy Girl.

From 1768 until 1805, each infantry regiment carried two flags per battalion: the 1st or Leib Battalion carried the white Leibfahne and one yellow Ordinarfahne, while the others used two Ordinarfahnen. As the new organisation was implemented under Karl Mack von Leiberich, an Imperial Decree of 22 June 1805 reduced the flags to one per battalion, the Grenadier (or Leib Battalion) carrying the white Leibfahne as it was the senior battalion and the others carrying one Ordinarfahne each. When the army reverted to its former organisation on 6 December 1806, so did the flags, i.e.: Leibfahne plus one Ordinarfahne for 1st (Leib) Battalion, two Ordinarfahnen for the others. A further change in 1808 reduced the numbers of flags to one per battalion again. Grenadier battalions (which only formed up in wartime) carried one Ordinarfahne except in 1805, usually but not necessarily from the senior parent regiment depot. The post-1808 Jäger battalions never carried flags. The Grenzers used the usual system, except that after 1807, all battalions appear to have carried one Ordinarfahne. It is not clear whether they carried the flag in war, although one was captured from 9. Peterwardein Grenzer at the Battle of Eckmühl in April 1809. Flag sizes The infantry flags measured 161 x 142 cm with the \\"flames\\" each 16 cm wide at the base in red, black, yellow and white, the last two replaced by gold and silver on the Leibfahne throughout the period. Cavalry regiments always carried one standard per division of two squadrons, the 1st division carrying the Leibstandarte. They measured 71 x 63 cm with the \\"flames\\" 6.5 cm wide at the base. Ehrenbände The multi-coloured Ehrenbände ribbons, usually presented by the Inhaber, were nailed to the top of the staff and covered by the roundel on the centre of the bow, but were only worn on the flag on ceremonial occasions. However, one captured example at the Musée de l’Empéri in France has an Ehrenbände attached. On a plate in the 'Heer & Tradition' series, the Leibfahne of IR 39 Duka is shown as having white Ehrenbände, edged and fringed in red, on an 1806 pattern flag. On the same plate, IR14 Klebek is shown as having white Ehrenbände, edged and fringed in gold on a 1792 pattern standard.Heer & Tradition Plate No. 88 A red Ehrenbände, embroidered in silver, from an 1809 Vienna Volunteer flag, presented by Empress Maria Ludovika, is displayed at the Vienna City Museum. 1792 pattern 1780 pattern modified to 1792 pattern Ordinarfahne from the New York Public Library Collection The pattern in service at the start of the wars was the 1780 pattern introduced by Joseph II to reflect his policy of moving away from reliance on the Holy Roman Empire to focusing on Habsburg Lands.For the provincial arms of the components of the Empire, see http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Austro-Hungarian_Empire The black Doppeladler eagle carried a large shield, which displayed the full Habsburg coat of arms and really expressed his policy of relying on the Austrian resources and no longer those of the Holy Roman Empire. To the sides on the wings were the Imperial Buchstaben (cipher initials), starting with 'JII' for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1765–1790). Due to the end of the Turkish War and the ongoing Belgian rebellion, the new Emperor Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, issued a proclamation on 17 March 1790 ordering the Hofkriegsrat that for reasons of economy, all flags were to remain unchanged. His brief reign only lasted until April 1792, so, the flags only changed in 1792 when the Buchstaben (initials) received a bar through the ‘J’, so it became an ‘F’ to display the cipher of the new Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor: ‘FII’, either side of the complicated central shield (this addition of a bar through the J for existing flags distinguishes flags initially issued under Joseph from post-1792 issued flags). With its many quarterings, the shield carried all the coats of arms of the territories held or claimed by the Habsburgs: On the top line are: the arms of Old & New Hungary, Spain (made up of Castille, Leon, Aragon, Navarre), Bohemia; on the second line: Burgundy, Austria/Lorraine under the Archduke's coronet, Tuscany; on the third line: Transylvania (or Siebenbürgen) Lombardy, Mantua; on the bottom line: Habsburg, Flanders, Tyrol. Around the shield are the chains and emblems of the Orders of St. Stephen of Hungary and of Maria Theresa. Above is the red and gold crown of Austria. On the obverse of the white Leibfahne was the Madonna and Child on a cloud with rays of light streaming to the right and left. Some of the Walloon (Belgian) infantry regiments’ Ordinarfahnen added local symbols: IR55 Murray carried an Ordinärfahne with the red diagonal Cross of Burgundy behind the Doppeladler and the arms of St. Omer below the eagle.\\"A propos du drapeau du régiment d'infanterie Murray n° 55\\" in: 'Carnet de la Fourragère' Sept. 1962, pp. 369–376 and Archivum Heraldicum (a Swiss magazine) However, IR58 Vierset (until 1794)/Beaulieu (1794–98) had a regulation 1780/92 Ordinärfahne with the bar through 'J' to create 'F'.Laid up in Würzburg, this flag was destroyed during WW2, but a photograph survives in the Bildarchiv of the Austrian National Library in Vienna Cavalry flags seem to have been retained for longer than their infantry counterparts.This information about flags captured in 1812 seems to originate from 'Capture of Austrian Flags during 1812' by Jean Lochet in 'Empires, Eagles & Lions' No.86 p.51 and would require further investigation Three standards from 3. Dragoons, which were captured at Neswiecz on 20 September 1812 by the Russian Alexandria Hussars, appear to date from the reign of Emperor Charles VI (1711–40), although the brass finial is stamped with the post-1806 'FI' cypher of Emperor Franz I. Four cavalry standards captured by the French in the 1805 campaign were of the 1769–1780 pattern as the cypher 'MT' (Empress Maria Theresa 1740–1780) is embroidered either side of the central shield on the eagle.One of this pattern has recently been returned to the Army Museum in Vienna from the USA http://www.flagheritagefoundation.org/news/ (at the bottom) 1804 pattern 1804 Ordinarfahne from the New York Public Library Collection An Imperial Patent (order) of 11 August 1804 issued a new pattern to reflect the creation of the creation of the Austrian Empire, but the production order wasn’t given until 28 March 1805. There is only one surviving 1804 Ordinarfahne in the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum (Museum of Military History, Vienna), which seems to differ from the illustrated Ordinarfahne from the New York Public Library Collection, so two appear to have been made. Two new flags were presented to IR4 Deutschmeister, the ceremonial guard line regiment based in Vienna, in June 1806 before the 1806 pattern was decreed, although one of these was a new Leibfahne to replace the one lost in 1805. At least three standards were issued to the cavalry,'Katalog der Erzherzog Carl Ausstellung zur Jahrhundertfeier der Schlacht bei Aspern' Items 223/72-4 one for 7. Hussars and one for an unknown Hussar regiment. Surprisingly, the flag displays the Holy Roman Empire crown above the Doppeladler eagle, whose heads had halos. The Austrian crown now sat on top of the central shield, which was surrounded by the chain of the order of the Golden Fleece. The shield displayed a simple black Doppeladler with the red-white-red barred Bindenshield of Austria on its chest and below it hung a shortened version of the chain and ribbon of the Order of Maria Theresa. The shields on the wings are : (left) Hungary, Galicia-Lodermaria, Venice, Transylvania (or Siebenbürgen), Moravia-Silesia (right) Bohemia, Lower Austria, Salzburg, Styria-Carithia, Tyrol. 1806 pattern 1806 pattern Leibfahne from the New York Public Library Collection The 1806 pattern, introduced under an Imperial Decree of 6 December 1806, reflected the Emperor’s new primary Austrian title and was used until the 1816 pattern was introduced. The provincial shields were moved individually to the outer edge of the eagles’ wings and the Buchstaben were abandoned. The Madonna on the Leibfahne gained a halo of stars http://napitalia.org.uk/images/leib1.jpg and the style of the eagle changed: The heads lost the halos, but were crowned with the new Imperial crown in between. The ribbon running between the heads was now red, rather the previous blue. The central shield only displayed three sections, comprising the arms of Habsburg, Austria and Lorraine respectively. The shield lay over a Deutschmeister cross and was surrounded by the chains of the Orders of the Golden Fleece and Maria Theresa. The arms on the eagle wings were (left side, top to bottom) Hungary, Galicia, Styria, Transylvania (or Siebenbürgen), Moravia-Silesia, (right side, top to bottom) Bohemia, Lower Austria, Tyrol, Würzburg, Upper Austria, Carinthia. One surviving Ordinärfahne of IR16 Lusignan unusually shows only yellow flames from the outside edge with red, black and white flames facing outwards.Illustrated in 'Heraldry of the World' http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=File:2400.aba.jpg Retrieved 21 September 2016 The smaller cavalry standard did not display the provincial shields on its wings.http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/images/c/c6/2399.aba.jpg 1812 campaign A plate by the French artist, Rigo, (No.33) shows Austrian 1792 and 1806 patterns with a commentary by the renowned French vexillogist Pierre Charrie, who suggested a probable distribution of these flags among the Austrian infantry units, which were part of the Auxiliary Korps attached to Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812: 1780 Muster (1792 for Franz II) IR2 Hiller (Hungarian) IR9 Czartoryski (German) IR19 Alvinczy (vakat) (Hungarian) IR30 de Ligne (German) IR58 Beaulieu (German) IR33 Colloredo-Mansfeld (Hungarian) IR34 Davidovich (Hungarian) IR48 Simbchen (Hungarian) IR32 Esterhazy (Hungarian) 1806 Muster: IR39 Duka (Hungarian) IR41 Kottulinsky (German) IR12 Lichtenstein (German) GR 5 (Kreuz) or 6 (St. Georg) Warasdin Grenz district However, it would seem unlikely that the former Walloon units – IRs 9, 30 & 58 – which were then recruiting in Galicia, would have retained 1792 pattern flags.

However, their flag was white with a black Doppeladler carrying the red-white- red barred Bindenschild.Katalog der Erzherzog Carl Ausstellung zur Jahrhundertfeier der Schlacht bei Aspern Item 246/55/14. There is a photograph of an 1805 Trieste militia flag.In the Bildarchiv, Neue Hofburg, Vienna; L.60334/6 The Szeckler Hussars from the border districts of Siebenbürgen (Transylvania) were regularised in 1798 as 11. Husaren and so, it would appear that their original 1765 pattern standard was carried after 1798 as the surviving example in the Budapest Military Museum has clearly been embroidered with 'HR' and 'N 11'.https://s-media-cache- ak0.pinimg.com/600x315/d7/8e/70/d78e708fedf0a32b13135ab4e560a0d3.jpg 1809 Irregular Unit Flags A large number of Landwehr (secondary militia) and Freiwillige (volunteer) battalions were formed for the 1809 War. Of the Freiwillige, Bohemia provided the six battalions of the Erzherzog Karl Legion and Moravia supplied three battalions of Moravian Freiwillige. As there were 22 Legion battalions in 1800, there was probably no shortage of flags for the 1809 battalions and possibly some Landwehr units. The two 1800 flags mentioned and illustrated were carried at Wagram: 1st EKL Battalion probably carried the Bohemian flag and the Moravian flag was presumably carried by one of the Moravian Freiwillige battalions. 2nd EKL Battalion’s flag was a 5-barred flag in yellow over blue with a black Doppeladler on each side.Amon von Treuenfest, G. in : Österreichische Militärische Zeitschrift 1883 III p.259 The six battalions of Wiener Freiwillige (Vienna Volunteers) were presented with three 1806 pattern and three 1792 pattern Ordinarfahnen, although it is only known that the 4th battalion had a 1792 pattern.Katalog der Erzherzog Carl Ausstellung zur Jahrhundertfeier der Schlacht bei Aspern Item 173/115.3 Although a January 1809 order specified that each Landwehr battalion carried a single Ordinarfahne with the provincial arms on the reverse, it is unclear how far this was implemented. However, after the reduction to one flag per Line battalion in 1808, there would have been a surplus of Ordinarfahnen, which were probably issued to the Landwehr battalions. Two known Landwehr flags were plain Ordinarfahnen: The 1st Viertel unter Manhartsberg Battalion (Lower Austria) has an identifier in the top corner nearest the staff 1es VUMB; the Prachin Battalion (Bohemia) is just a plain 1806 pattern.'Katalog der Erzherzog Carl Ausstellung zur Jahrhundertfeier der Schlacht bei Aspern' Items 245/55/6 and 240/23/2 Many Landwehr flags were probably quite simple, especially those reused from the 1800 Legion.

However, the Duchy of Styria battalions carried more local symbols, based on an 1808 design, showing a white flag edged with green flames.'Die Steirische Landwehr einst und heute' (Graz) 1977 displaying a white Styrian panther. The Graz battalions carried variations on a local saint (obverse) and the Styrian panther (reverse) in green and white, as was the edging. The 1st battalion flag had green flames facing outward in the upper half of the border and facing inwards on the lower half; on the reverse was a white Styrian panther carrying a small yellow shield on its chest on a green lozenge framed in white with St. Nicholas similarly framed on the obverse.<https://ospreypublishing.com/austrian-auxiliary- troops-1792-1816-pb Hollins, D.: Austrian Auxiliary Troops 1792–1816 (1996) Plate G. The other battalions displayed the ducal arms on the reverse: a panther in natural dark yellow on a white shield surmounted by a ducal crown on a dark green background, although the 4th battalion panther also displayed a chest shield with 'F1''Katalog der Erzherzog Carl Ausstellung zur Jahrhundertfeier der Schlacht bei Aspern' Item 240/23.3 On the observe were saints: 2nd: Virgin of Maria-Lankowitz, 3rd: St. Egidius, 4th: St. Leonard, 5th: St. Lawrence. R. Sallinger 'Graz im Jahre 1809' (1909) The Bruck battalions carried the Virgin of Mariazell on the obverse and the Cilli (Celje) battalion flags displayed St. Daniel. All the Styrian flagpoles were striped green and white with Ehrenbände in the same colours with mottos such as the 1st Bruck's 'Gott, Kaiser und Vaterland sind unsere Lösung'. Hungarian and Croatian Insurrection G. Sagvari: Das Buch der Husaren (1999) and 'Katalog der Erzherzog Carl Ausstellung zur Jahrhundertfeier der Schlacht bei Aspern' (1909) The earlier Insurrection infantry flags usually displayed a religious symbol on the obverse and either national or local coats of arms on the reverse. A Hungarian example from 1797 was a white flag, displaying an enthroned Madonna on the obverse and the Hungarian arms on the reverse, while others showed a local saint with the Doppeladler om the reverse. A 1797 Croatian flag from Warasdin (Varaždin) made of damask, has a background of the Croat red/white chequerboard upon which is the Madonna and Child on the obverse; on the reverse are the arms of Warasdin with the motto above 'Vexilium Comitatus Varasdinensis Occasione Generalis Nobilium Insurrections Contra Gallum Finibus Regni' and underneath 'Et Comitatus Aproximanten Indictae in Anno 1797 Erectum'. An 1801 flag presented to the Požega County Jäger battalion of the Croatian Insurrection has a black Doppeladler bearing a square shield with the arms of the Kingdom of Slavonia and the Emperor's cypher \\"F II\\" on the reverse; on the obverse is the Madonna with the infant Christ. At the top on both sides is the motto: Pro Deo Rege Et Lege (For God, King and Law).At the end of http://www.fahnen- nostalgieshop.de/fotw/flags/hr%5Ehabs.html The 1809 infantry flags, including that of the Odenburg (Sopron) Hungarian insurrection, displayed the Imperial eagle with the county arms.

The flag of the 1809 2nd Battalion Erzherzog Karl Legion was recorded as being in Marburg (Maribor) in 1909. The 1765 pattern standard of 11. Szeckler Husaren is in the Budapest Military Museum. Additional Notes 1) It has been claimed that Austrian flags from after 1806 and later into the Napoleonic period had identifiers in the top corners and some displayed Hungarian arms on the reverse. These claims seem to come from: Wise, T.: Flags of the Napoleonic Wars (Osprey MAA 78) 1978. There is no regulation prior to the earliest known regular flag with identifiers, an 1816 pattern, held in the Museum of Military History, Vienna and there are no flags with Hungarian arms aside from the Insurrection patterns. However, aside from the 1809 VUMB Landwehr flag, the 1792-pattern Leibfahne of IR16 Lusignan displays L. I. R. 16 in the top corner by the pole. The lettering is under the Doppeladler, but this may be something left by those making the flag. 2) The illustrated flags come from the New York Public Library collection and specifically the Vinkhuijzen Collection of Military Uniforms. The Library states that it believes these pictures come from a scrapbook completed by Dr. Vinkhuijzen before 1910 and are thus in the public domain.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The Foundry Bridge is located in the village of North Tunbridge, providing access across the First Branch White River to rural eastern parts of the town via Foundry Road. The bridge is a single-span Warren pony truss, set on abutments of dry laid stone. The bridge is trapezoidal in profile, its trusses in length. The roadway width is , with a total structure width of . Distinctive features of the trusses indicating its age include riveted joints (an advance over older pin connections) and posts between the truss panels. The bridge deck consists of timber stringers on a wrought iron frame, supporting a wooden bridge deck. The web of truss components reflects a means of fabrication that was obsolete at the time, but still in use by the builder, who had not yet adopted recent advances in steel rolling technology. with The bridge was built in 1889, its trusses fabricated by the Vermont Construction Company of St. Albans, which was the only Vermont business of the period to built wrought iron trusses. The bridge, built for the town at a cost of $876, provided access from the village of North Tunbridge to two of its major industries, Smith's Foundry (for which the road is named) and a gristmill. The Vermont Construction Company was in business from 1885 to 1901, when it was acquired by the American Bridge Company.

History  NEPK was created on June 15, 1961. Its founder is dr. W.L. (Willem Lyckele) Groeneveld Meijer (1897–1963), former director of the Economic Institute for Retail (Economisch Instituut voor de Middenstand) and Secretary General of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The 250 medals collected by Groeneveld Meijer during his active career formed the start of the NEPK collection. Being an alumnus of the Netherlands School of Commerce (Nederlandsche Handels- Hoogeschool / NHH) and having defended his dissertation at NHH in 1924, Groeneveld Meijer decided in 1963 to transfer the Foundation NEPK and his medal collection to his alma mater, since 1939 known as the Netherlands School of Economics (Nederlandse Economische Hogeschool / NEH). In 1973 NEH merged into Erasmus University Rotterdam, which is now the owner of the NEPK medal collection.  Mission statement  The mission statement of the Foundation NEPK formulated at its creation can be summarized as “bringing together, acquiring, expanding and maintaining a collection of (Dutch) medals, in particular medals from 1900 onwards that were created with a motive of an economic nature”. Over the years, the scope has somewhat broadened, notably to include medals related to Erasmus University Rotterdam and the person Desiderius Erasmus.  Collection  The NEPK collection is housed at Erasmus University Rotterdam, campus Woudestein. Two medal presentations can be viewed in the Erasmus Gallery in the Erasmus Building. These presentations make use of interactive touchscreen display cases. (Opening Monday-Friday 9.00 – 17.00 hours; free entrance). New presentations are made regularly. The website of NEPK (www.nepk.nl) allows to search the NEPK collection database of presently over 2000 medals. In principle the database contains all medals in the collection.

After training in Genoa he worked the rest of his short life in Rome. Life Little is known about the background of this artist who was born in Genoa around 1610. He trained with Domenico Fiasella. From the mid 1630s he was working in Rome where he later died.Francesco Buranelli, Robin C. Dietrick, Marco Bussagli, Cecilia Sica, Roberta Bernabei, Between God and Man: Angels in Italian Art, Mississippi Museum of Art Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2007, p. 80 His early death has been attributed to his slavish dedication to his work. D. Stephen Pepper, ‘Bob Jones University Collection of Religious Art: Italian Paintings’, 1984, p. 105 Work The ordeal of the young Moses Only a small body of work consisting of religious compositions is currently ascribed to Luca Saltarello. It has been difficult to define the scope of work to be attributed to the artist as only one securely documented work by the artist is known, a large altarpiece representing Saint Benedict Reviving a Fallen Worker, which was painted for the Chiesa di Santo Stefano in Genoa in 1632.Genoese School, circa 1630-40, The Curing of Tobit's Blindness at Sotheby's Various of his works were in the past attributed to his master Fiasella of whom he was the most accomplished pupil. In his early work, Saltarello used thick paint layers as did his master Fiasella with whom he worked in the late 1620s and early 1630s. In Genoa Saltarello also underwent the strong influence of various members of the Flemish artist community that had settled down there permanently or visited the city for long periods of time. In particular, the technique of Antony van Dyck was of important influence on his early work. This showed itself in a delicate style with less heavy strokes as those characteristic of his master' style. His style thus gained a greater freedom than that of Fiasella. Other Flemish artists who influenced him included the landscape painter Jan Wildens who resided in Genoa around 1614 where he left many large landscapes. Saltarello's chromatic range was likely derived from other Flemish residents in Genoa in particular Jan Roos and the brothers Cornelis and Lucas de Wael.

Her popular television series \\"Yoga\\" started airing in China on CCTV since 1985, 3 times a day every day. The series was so popular it became one of the longest running television series in China’s history, airing nationwide uninterrupted from 1985 to 2000, earning her the moniker “Mother of Yoga to modern China.” Wai Lana later produced her Wai Lana Yoga series for public television in the United States where it has been airing nationwide since 1998 and is still airing today after 18 years—making it the longest-running fitness series ever on public television. Wai Lana Yoga has also aired internationally on five continents: North and South America, Asia, Europe, Australia and the Middle East. To help further popularize yoga, Wai Lana started selling her music CDs, yoga instructional DVDs, and other yoga lifestyle products through different online and offline retail channels. Besides her several books on the practice of Yoga, she has also published two books on cuisine, Wai Lana's Favorite Juices and Wai Lana's Favorite Soups, her Easy Meditation for Everyone Kit, as well as many children's yoga products, including Wai Lana’s Little Yogis Daydream Kit, Fun Songs Cartoon & CD, and Little Yogis DVDs & Books.

He was an expert on animal behaviour and academic author in this field. He was one of the first to study the impacts of factory farming. He advocated the study of animal behaviour to gauge what implied \\"humane treatment\\" for different species, and tried to balance these factors against economic viability for the farmer. He looked at the impact of stress upon animals and held that animals should be treated as individuals not as a \\"commodity\\". In these studies he concluded that food supply was the essential factor in controlling animal behaviour.The Scotsman (newspaper) obituary 8 December 1992 He was one of the first to both see the benefits of and physically introduce the concept of free range farming. Life He was born in Transkei in South Africa on 20 November 1922 into a Quaker family of British origin. He was educated at Grahamstown. His university career was interrupted by the Second World War during which he served in North Africa in the South African Air Force as a navigator in a bombing crew. He lost his lower left arm in 1944 whilst home on leave, due to a motorcycle accident where he was riding pillion. The driver, his friend, the pilot of his bombing crew, was killed in the accident. David was plagued by phantom pains in the missing hand for all his life. After the war he studied Science at Witwatersrand University, graduating BSc in 1948. Increasing despairing at his county’s politics and apartheid policy, he left in 1949, going to the University of Edinburgh (which had a growing reputation in the field of genetics) as a postgraduate where he gained both a doctorate in 1952 (PhD) and a Diploma in Animal Genetics (studying under Prof Conrad Hal Waddington and Dr Alan William Greenwood). He thereafter began work at the Poultry Research Centre. Due to his personal limb loss he did much research to establish if animals might feel similar phantom pains to his own due to actions such as dehorning etc. He was always concerned of potential pain and animal suffering in various procedures. In 1975 he conducted an infamous experiment on a remote Scottish island, re-wilding domesticated chickens to measure how they survived. Unfortunately all were killed by a resident population of escaped mink. In 1976 he repeated the experiment somewhat more successfully using pigs. In 1978 the Poultry Research Centre decided to relocate to Roslin, Midlothian and began more industry-based research.

The work was commissioned by BBC Radio 3 for The Proms. Its world premiere was performed by the cellist Guy Johnston and the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sakari Oramo at the Royal Albert Hall on 14 August 2016. The piece was inspired by the destruction of the ancient city of Palmyra by ISIL in August 2015. Falling in the Fire is composed in a single movement and has a duration of approximately 21 minutes.Bray, Charlotte (2015). Falling in the Fire: Program Note. Retrieved August 19, 2016. Composition =Background= Bray began composition on the concerto in August 2015, as she first read the news about the destruction of the Temple of Bel and the Temple of Baalshamin in the ancient city of Palmyra. Bray decided to conceive the work as an abstract reflection on the conflict of the Syrian civil war and the war on ISIL. In a pre-premiere interview with the magazine i, Bray recalled, \\"I started researching into this ancient city and everything to do with it. And I felt compelled to do something about the world we live in now.\\" While researching for the piece, she learned of the photojournalist Tim Hetherington, who was killed in 2011 while covering the Libyan Civil War. Before his death, Hetherington noted his irrational compulsion to return to conflict zones, preferring to report the atrocities of war from the front rather than remain in the idle safety of home. Bray used this duality as the basis for the musical conflict in the concerto, occasionally even simulating the sounds of the battlefield in the orchestra. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a solo cello and a large orchestra consisting of three flutes, three oboes, three clarinets, three bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, harp, and strings. Reception The piece was praised by Martin Kettle of The Guardian, who wrote, \\"The concerto confronts two important, linked questions with which many creative artists have wrestled: how can a composer respond to the great public issues of the day – in this case the war in Syria – and how can any such response avoid being judged on moral as much as on musical grounds? Bray's concerto sensibly embodies these questions rather than answering them.\\" Steph Power of The Independent similarly observed, \\"Propelled by outrage at the atrocities visited upon Syria by Isis, Bray has responded with music that is defiantly exquisite as well as stark, for example, with the high-ringing tinnitus that follows a bomb explosion. Surging with energy, her colouristic writing was acutely felt by both the orchestra and brilliant soloist Guy Johnston.\\" Barry Millington of the London Evening Standard remarked, \\"Passages of repetitive jagged material, perhaps alluding to the firing of arms, alternate with poignant interludes that suggest altered states of consciousness.\\" He nevertheless added, \\"The cello soloist (Guy Johnston) meditates on the situation, but is not always clearly audible. One senses that the original commission of a cello concerto proved incompatible with the conception as it took shape. The work has some original, inspired touches, but it's a brave composer that attempts a piece of such attenuated introspection in a big space like the Albert Hall.\\" References Compositions by Charlotte Bray 2015 compositions Cello concertos Music commissioned by the BBC ","title":"Falling in the Fire"},{"id":"51365818","text":"Mentor is an unincorporated community in Garfield County, in the U.S. state of Washington.

It has a capacity of 3 terabytes (TB) and a spindle speed of 7200 rpm. This particular drive model was reported to have unusually high failure rates, approximately 5.7 times higher fail rates in comparison to other 3 TB drives. Specifications The ST3000DM001 uses three 1 TB platters, compared to five platters in the previous generation Barracuda XT drive, and has a spindle speed of 7200 rpm. The drive uses a 40 nm dual-core LSI controller and 64 MB of DDR2-800 as the DRAM cache. As part of the release of its 1 TB-platter drives, Seagate announced that it was phasing out its Barracuda Green line of 5900 rpm hard drives. Reception Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech noted that the ST3000DM001 is \\"a bit faster in sequential performance than the old Barracuda XT, at lower power consumption\\" and that \\"Seagate appears to have optimized the drive's behavior for lower power rather than peak performance\\". He said he was \\"personally ok\\" with the lower performance under heavy loads as long as the drive is used together with a solid-state drive (SSD) in a system. Backblaze, a remote backup service company, observed that its ST3000DM001 drives have failed at rates far higher than the average of other hard drives. Only 251 of the 4,190 ST3000DM001 hard drives placed in service in 2012 were still in service as of 31 March 2015. According to Backblaze, the company switched to Seagate 3 TB hard drives after the 2011 Thailand floods disrupted the supply of hard drives and increased their prices by 200–300%. Backblaze, which normally used HGST 3 TB hard drives, were only able to find Seagate 3 TB drives in \\"decent quantity\\". Backblaze noted that the failure rates of the ST3000DM001 did not follow a bathtub curve typically followed by hard disk drive failure rates, instead having 2.7% failing in 2012, 5.4% failing in 2013, and 47.2% failing in 2014. Other 3 TB hard drives that Backblaze placed in service in 2012, which were operated in a similar environment as the Seagate drives, did not show signs of increased failure. Joel Hruska of ExtremeTech noted that Backblaze was unable to explain the high failure rates of the ST3000DM001 compared to other products. Hruska pointed out that Seagate cut the warranty for these drives, along with most other hard disk drive manufacturers, from three years to one year in 2012. Hruska provided supplier-change or part substitution, shipping of substandard hardware to increase profits, and Backblaze's use of consumer hard drives in an enterprise environment as possible explanations. Paul Alcorn of Tom's Hardware pointed out that of the 3 TB hard disk drive models that were in service with Backblaze, the ST3000DM001 was the only drive without a rotational vibration sensor that counteracts excessive vibration in heavy- usage cases. Class action In 2016, Seagate faced a class action over the failure rates of its ST3000DM001 3 TB drives. Law firm Hagens Berman filed the lawsuit on 1 February in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and primarily cited reliability data provided by Backblaze. The lawsuit also pointed to user reviews of the hard disk drive on Newegg, which totaled more than 700 reviews with 2 or fewer stars. The lawsuit lists Christopher Nelson, who purchased a Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB drive and a Seagate Barracuda 3 TB hard disk drive in October 2011, as its plaintiff. Both products subsequently failed, and the lawsuit contended that Seagate replaced them with inherently faulty products. Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman, said that the hard drives \\"failed to deliver on Seagate’s promises, and replacements from Seagate were just as defective\\". Bruno Ferreira of The Tech Report compared the lawsuit with the high failure rates faced by the IBM Deskstar 75GXP and 60GXP hard drives in 2002. Paul Alcorn of Tom's Hardware argued that Backblaze used the drives in a manner that \\"far exceeded the warranty conditions\\" and questioned the \\"technical merits\\" of the lawsuit. On June 15, 2018, Judge Joseph Spero ruled that the class action plaintiffs must separate into multiple classes, as there was too much variability in failure rates to combine all claims a single class. In 2019, the plaintiffs were denied class certification a second time.

Description and history Rowell's Inn stands in the crossroads village of Simonsville in central southern Andover, a rural community on the east side of Vermont's Green Mountains. It is located at the western corner of Route 11 and the Middletown Road. Route 11 is a historically (and presently) major east- west route across the state, and Middletown Road leads to the town center of Weston, which was originally part of Andover. The inn is a large 2-1/2 story brick building, with a front-facing gabled roof. Its most prominent feature is a three-level porch, the first two levels spanning the full width of the front facade, and the third set in a curved-ceiling recess under the gable. The building's walls are locally made brick laid in American bond, and the sills and lintels are soapstone. The main entrance is at the center of the front facade; it is a double door of late Victorian vintage, which replaced an original Federal period entrance with sidelight windows. A wood frame ell 1-1/2 stories in height extends to the building's rear, and a 20th-century garage stands on the property as well. with The inn was built in 1826 (not 1820 as stated incorrectly on a plate above the door) by Edward Simons, and has served as a local community meeting point and traveler's accommodation since then. It is architecturally a distinctive example of Federal period architecture, with the front porch (added later) giving it Greek Revival flair. In 1910, the inn was purchased by Frederick Rowell, and has generally been known as Rowell's Inn since then.

Biography  Yuri Vella was born in the Varyogan village in Siberia in 1948. In the 1990s, he moved with his family from the Varyogan village to the tundra of the Agan River to revive the traditional Nenets way of life and become a reindeer herder. He was a writer and poet writing in the Forest Nenets language, the Khanty language and in Russian. He was a social activist - in 1990, he organised a protest on behalf of the Nenets people in the Varegansk area, Yamal, against the gas and oil industry expanding into the Yamal. The energy industry was destroying the environment, killing the reindeer, and displacing and persecuting the indigenous people. The protest was recorded by Russian TV. In 1996, he created a small Taiga school to teach the traditional reindeer herding skills to Nenets children. The school was closed in 2009, when the attending children grew older and left for other education. In 2008, a documentary film about Vella, called Yuri Vella's world - the DER documentary, was created by Liivo Niglas.

The band released two studio albums and toured extensively in the UK, Europe and USA. History Doe started in early 2013 after Nicola Leel and Jake Popyura, who had met through a classified ad the previous year, cemented the initial lineup with the addition of guitarist Alessandro 'Alex' Sorenti. Their formation was quickly followed by a string of UK shows, three EP releases (S/t, Summer 2013 and Late Bloomer) and a European tour with their friends The Exhausts. Matthew Sykes joined on guitar after Sorenti's departure and the band released Sooner, an EP coupled with a lyric/photo zine. The compilation LP First Four was released through Specialist Subject Records in 2014, with a US cassette version following a year later via Old Flame Records. 2015 saw the release of single Avalanche/Basement on Fierce Panda and a split LP on Alcopop! Records. Sykes parted ways with the band in September that year and was replaced by Dean Smithers prior to a UK tour with Dogs On Acid. In March 2016, Doe recorded their debut full-length effort Some Things Last Longer than You with producer Matthew Johnson (Hookworms) and in July released videos for the singles Sincere and Last Ditch. The album was released on 9 September 2016 to critical acclaim. The band spent much of 2017 touring in support of the album, including UK/EU stints with LVL UP, Jeff Rosenstock, Pile and Honeyblood. They also embarked on their first North American tour with Philadelphia-based Yankee Bluff. Doe's second album, Grow into It, was released on 28 September 2018 through Big Scary Monsters and Topshelf Records.

Plot Ichigo Kurosaki is a fifteen-year-old high school student who lives in Karakura Town with his father, Isshin, and younger twin sisters, Karin and Yuzu. He also has the ability to see ghosts, a talent that attracts the attention of a katana-wielding young woman in a black kimono. She introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki while explaining to Ichigo that she is a Soul Reaper, a psychopomp who guides the departed to the Soul Society and purify those who remained among the living and transformed into monstrous beings called Hollows. At that time, a Hollow that Rukia was hunting named Fishbone D attacks Ichigo's home after sensing his high spiritual energy. Rukia is wounded in the attempt to protect the Kurosaki family and forced to transfer her powers into a desperate Ichigo so he can defeat the Hollow as a Soul Reaper. After discovering Rukia has enrolled in his class the following day, Ichigo learns that she has lost her power and he must serve as her substitute until he amassed enough Reiyoku energy from defeating Hollows to transfer Rukia's powers back to her. Meanwhile, Soul Reaper captain Byakuya Kuchiki, Rukia's older brother, sends his lieutenant Renji Abarai to retrieve her. A brief altercation between Ichigo and Renji occurs before the latter is driven off by arrows fired by Ichigo's classmate Uryū Ishida. Uryū reveals himself to be of a tribe of spiritually aware humans called Quincies, who were nearly wiped out by the Soul Reapers as they obliterate Hollows rather than purify them. Uryū declares himself an enemy of all Soul Reapers as he challenges Ichigo to a Hollow hunting competition, having deliberately summoned the monsters to Karakura Town. While Ichigo and Rukia are fighting a Hollow, Hexapodus, they are confronted by Renji and Byakuya. After Renji defeats Ichigo, Byakuya scolds Rukia for having broken the Soul Society's laws by giving Ichigo her powers while giving her an ultimatum: either extract her Reiryoku from Ichigo or return to the Soul Society to be trialed and punished accordingly. As the former choice would result in Ichigo's death since he had not amassed the ideal amount for his survival, Rukia resigns herself for punishment. But Ichigo stops her at the last minute and makes a deal with Byakuya, to purify the infamous Hollow Grand Fisher to gain enough Reiryoku for a non-fatal transfer. As Ichigo vigorously training for the confrontation catches the interest of his classmates Yasutora Sado and Orihime Inoue, he learns that Grand Fisher was the being who killed his mother Masaki when he was a child. While visiting Masaki's grave, Karin and Yuzu are attacked by Grand Fisher. Ichigo is able to free his sisters before taking Grand Fisher on in a highly destructive fight and defeating him with Uryū's support, only for the two to be ambushed and Uryū injured by Renji, who with Byakuya decided to renege on their deal. Though Ichigo manages to overpower Renji, Byakuya steps in and defeats Ichigo with overwhelming pace. Rukia intervenes, convincing Byakuya to spare Ichigo as she extracts her Reiryoku while parting ways with him. The next day, due to the Soul Society's influence, everyone in Karakura Town has forgotten Rukia and everyone thinks the damage to the town from the battle with Grand Fisher was caused by a tornado. However, Ichigo sees a note Rukia had left in his book and seemingly regains his memories.

Production =Development= In 2008, Tite Kubo stated that he wished to make Bleach an experience that can be found only by reading manga, dismissing ideas of creating any live-action film adaptations of the series. When the film adaptation was announced, however, Kubo decided to be involved with its production to ensure its faithfulness to the manga and anime, so that both old and new fans may enjoy it. He also stated that his only concern was the color of Ichigo's hair, which in the manga and anime is a bright shade of orange. He said, \\"If that color is in the live-action movie, it'd be strange, so I wonder what they're going to do!\\" Regarding what fans could expect in the live-action adaptation, Sota Fukushi, who will portray Ichigo, stated that the film would feature \\"the monstrous Hollows, otherworldly Soul Society, and destructive Zanpakuto sword-fighting techniques\\". The 10th issue of the 2018 Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine released the visual for Rukia Kuchiki, revealing that Hana Sugisaki will portray the character. In March 2018, the film's official Twitter account revealed that Uryū Ishida, Renji Abarai and Byakuya Kuchiki will be portrayed by Ryo Yoshizawa, Taichi Saotome and Miyavi respectively.

On October 7, 2018, Johnny Yong Bosch, voice actor for the anime revealed that there was an English dub produced for the film, and he would be reprising his role as Ichigo Kurosaki. Music The film's score was written by composer Yutaka Yamada. The film also features songs by Alexandros, \\"Mosquito Bite\\" and \\"Milk\\". The soundtrack was distributed by Crown Tokuma Music Distribution on July 25, 2018. Release =Marketing= After months of speculation from fans and critics, paired with months of silence from Warner Bros. Japan, a teaser trailer was released online on July 6, 2017, also revealing a poster for the movie in the process. On January 1, 2018, to hype the movie's release in Summer of 2018, to commemorate the beginning of the new year and to thank the support of the fans of the anime and movie project, a short message was shared via the movie's official Twitter account. On February 5, 2018, it was revealed that the movie would premiere on July 20, 2018 in Japan. A teaser trailer was released on February 21, 2018 which was praised for its faithful adaptation of the series' first chapter. In April 2018, the first official trailer was released, which also revealed the film's theme song by Alexandros, titled \\"Mosquito Bite\\". In June 2018, Warner Bros.

Reception =Box office= , Bleach has grossed ¥448,895,200 () in Japan. The filmed opened at #4 on its opening weekend and grossed ¥135 million from Friday to Sunday. On the second weekend, it fell into #5 and grossed an additional ¥64,199,600. In the third weekend, Bleach dropped off the top 10 and earned ¥23,459,400. =Critical reception= According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 6.12/10. Justine Smith for SciFiNow gave it a positive review with a consensus that \\"While clearly made for a dedicated fanbase, unlike some more recent anime live-action adaptations, one of the greatest assets of Bleach is how cohesively it outlines its mythology for the uninitiated.\\" Additionally, Mark Schilling reviewed the film for The Japan Times and gave it a 3 star rating. He concluded that the film faithfully follows the mythology of the source material for the dedicated fans, but also simplifies it for casual viewers to understand. Conversely, Rob Hunter from the Film School Rejects criticised the narrative of the story, especially when the female lead character, Rukia played by Hana Sugisaki, had to be reduced into a supporting-type character for the male lead character, Ichigo played by Sota Fukushi. He further praised Sugisaki's performances and lamented the fact that the actress was given weak materials for the film.

Between 1983 and 1991 she was editor in chief of Wochenpost, East Germany's top selling weekly newspaper. Life Brigitte Zimmermann was born in Sagan, a small town to the west of Breslau in Silesia. During the ethnic cleansing of 1944/45 the family were relocated, ending up in Weimar, where she grew up. This meant that from the age of 6 she lived what was administered as in the Soviet occupation zone until she was approximately 10½ at which point, in October 1949, the entire zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Her father worked as a decorator: her mother worked in sales. By the time her mother crossed over to the German Federal Republic (West Germany), the government of East Germany, under pressure from an acute labour shortage resulting from the slaughter of war and massive emigration, was taking active steps to discourage \\"Republikflucht\\", and as a result of her mother's \\"desertion\\" Brigitte Zimmermann was blocked in her progress from her school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") to university-level studies. Instead, between 1958 and 1961 she worked as a carpenter at the VEB Mähdrescherwerks (factory) in Weimar. She joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) in 1961, remaining a member until and beyond the party's demise in 1989/90. Zimmermann came to journalism through a trainee position as a youth correspondent with the mass-circulation Berlin- based daily newspaper Junge Welt (\\"Young World\\"). The newspaper took on her further training and made her its court reporter. She worked as a contributing editor with Junge Welt between 1962 and 1978, promoted to a position as departmental head in 1966 and then, from 1970, as deputy chief editor. Junge Welt throughout these years was the official newspaper of the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\" / FDJ), which in turn was the official youth wing of the East German SED (party). As recently as 2015 Zimmermann emerged from semi-retirement to provide for Junge Welt a tribute to Jutta Resch- Treuwerth, a distinguished former colleague on the paper who died in February of that year. In 1965 and 1966 Zimmermann attended the International Komsomol Academy in Moscow. Following this she graduated in 1968 from the Institute of Journalism at Leipzig University, thereby obtaining, at the age of 29, a degree from the country's principal university-level journalism academy. During this time, in parallel with her work at Junge Welt, in 1973/74 she served as acting editor for the student journal, \\"Forum\\". After her time at Junge Welt, between 1978 and 1982 Zimmermann worked with the Central Council of the FDJ, which made her a professional colleague of Egon Krenz who later emerged as the national leader. Zimmermann subsequently recalled their working relationship as \\"confrontational, but also sincere\\" (\\"konfliktgeladen, aber auch aufrichtig\\"). Renate Schubert: Ohne größeren Schaden? Gespräche mit Journalistinnen und Journalisten der DDR, München 1992, p. 57. According to some sources, differences between the two of them nevertheless brought Zimmermann's FDJ job to an end. In 1983 Zimmermann took over from as editor in chief of Wochenpost, a post she retained till 1991. Towards the end of her tenure she was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit. She was in charge at Wochenpost during the changes that led to reunification, formally in October 1990. Confronted with a new palette of competition from the newspapers in what had previously been West Germany, Wochenpost experienced a rapid drop in circulation, and a number of the less outstanding journalists had to be replaced. She nevertheless kept the publication afloat during the first year post-unification, although ultimately, in 2002, it would disappear from the market. Zimmermann's next move, in 1991, was to Neues Deutschland, which had been the official mass-market newspaper of the old SED (party), and was by now re-inventing itself in an uncertain process that mirrored the experiences of the party itself. She served as deputy managing editor at Neues Deutschland between September 1992 and June 1999 at which point, shortly after reaching her sixtieth birthday, she embarked on a career as a freelance journalist. She continued to contribute a satirical column to Neues Deutschland.

It premiered on 8 September 2016 at the Toronto International Film Festival in Canada and on 26 November 2016 at Eko Hotel and Suites in Lagos. The film was released worldwide on 16 December 2016, and became the highest grossing Nigerian film; a record which was broken in 2017 by its sequel The Wedding Party 2. Plot The film takes place during the day and evening of the wedding between Dunni Coker (Adesua Etomi), a 24-year-old art gallery owner who is the only daughter of Engineer Bamidele and Mrs. Tinuade Coker, and the IT entrepreneur Dozie Onwuka (Banky Wellington) who comes from a very wealthy family. His mother, Lady Obianuju Onwuka, considers her son to be marrying beneath himself. During the morning before the wedding, the wedding party is prepared and the stressed wedding planner Wonu is trying to make everything perfect for her rich clients. Meanwhile, the bride's parents and female relatives are upset by the omission of Tinuade Coker's name in the announcement in the paper, and the groom's parents share an uncomfortable breakfast while the mother talks disparagingly about the Coker family to her friends and is very cold towards her husband, Chief Felix Onwuka. Dunni is taunted by her female friends about her lack of sexual experience, and Dozie's male friends tease him about the previous night's bachelor party. The best man has been in an accident after the bachelor party, and the irresponsible Sola is chosen as his replacement. During the wedding ceremony, guests and family are cheerful, with the exception of Obianuju Onwuka who pointedly refuses to pay any attention, to the embarrassment of Felix. Afterwards, while the cars are going from the ceremony to the party, Dunni finds a pair of women's underpants in the pocket of Dozie's dress jacket, and is upset. He convinces her that they had been planted there, probably by one of his friends, and they belatedly arrive at the party. A disagreement arises between the two pairs of parents about which group should enter the dining room first; eventually, the Onwukas, being the richer family, get the first entrance. The dinner has its share of embarrassing incidents, including Tinuade Coker having hired a local Yoruba chef to cook an alternative to the fancy menu set by Obianuju Onwuka. When Sola gives his best man's speech, he accidentally shows video footage from the stag night instead of the video prepared by Dozie for the occasion, and the humiliated Dunni leaves the room after having witnessed what looks like Dozie being unfaithful to her. She is met outside the room by one of Dozie's old girlfriends, Rosie, who claims that she had sex with Dozie earlier that day - in reality, Rosie had tried to seduce him but failed. Dunni disappears from the venue in a taxi. Dozie, his elder brother Nonso, and the two sets of parents set out to look for Dunni but are held up at gunpoint by a thief who has managed to get into the room with the wedding gifts. The tense situation causes the couples to open up to each other, with Dozie's mother confessing to her husband how unhappy she has been about his affairs with younger women, and Dunni's father admitting that his company has lost all its money. The couples reconcile, and Nonso manages to overpower the thief and take his gun. Dozie goes off in a car with Sola to find Dunni, and convinces her that he has in fact not broken their mutual promise of chastity. They return to the wedding party to dance the rest of the night away.

According to Chidumga Izuzu of Pulse Nigeria, \\"It is distinctly a comedy movie that sets out to entertain.

(Abraham) William Hajjar (1917 - 2000) was an American architect active in Pennsylvania and Southern California particularly during the 1950s and 1960s. He created many modern residences, taught architectural design and history courses at The Pennsylvania State University, and conducted research on an early version of the double-skin glass facade, which later became a significant passive solar design element.  Early life  Hajjar was born on February 11, 1917. His parents, Milahem (or Melhem) and Sadie Ary Hajjar had immigrated to the United States thirty years before. Hajjar grew up in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He then attended Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon, where he was a member of the architecture fraternity Scarab. He went on to receive his Masters in Architecture degree at MIT in the winter of 1941.Registrar's Office, MIT  Teaching and Research  In 1946, Hajjar began teaching at Penn State University where he would remain until 1963. Hajjar led design studios that encouraged students to reconsider local planning in State College and Bellefonte. The proposals the students developed under his leadership focused on blending the downtown with car culture, while providing pedestrian areas, not unlike trends seen in New Urbanism twenty years later. Hajjar also initiated a project to explore alternative methods of heating and cooling. With funding from Pittsburgh Plate Glass (later PPG) and the participation of engineering professors Vincent L. Pass and E.R. McLaughlin, Hajjar designed and built the Air Wall Test Building in 1959–1961. This structure used two glass curtain walls spaced three feet apart to capture and employ solar gain in a manner similar to modern double skin facades. After Alton Blakeslee, a science writer for Associated Press, reported on this project, it appeared in local newspapers across the country. Hajjar created several designs using the strategy, including an office building and a house, but they were never constructed.A. W. Hajjar Architectural Drawings, The Eberly Family Special Collections, The Pennsylvania State University. Double- skin glass facades have been more commonly employed since the 1980s.  Design career  From the earliest years of his career Hajjar focused on the affordable single family home. He was a runner up in the Productive Homes Competition in 1939 which encouraged architects to think about “rurban” living - suburban settings with space to grow food. Hajjar's work received national attention when he partnered with Ronald Whiteley to design a small house which won Honorable Mention in the Rocky Mountain Region in a competition sponsored by Architectural Forum and the NAHB.Architectural Forum, March 1951, p. 128 Residential architecture composed the majority of his designs and completed buildings in central Pennsylvania though he created designs for a range of residence types from apartment complexes to single family home designs. His trademarks included utilizing traditional materials such as stone, brick, or wood cladding in contemporary forms. He strove to provide privacy, despite his use of glass through attention to orientation on the lot and screening. While in State College, he designed several speculative homes for both local real estate firms and his own ventures.A. W. Hajjar Architectural Drawings, The Eberly Family Special Collections, The Pennsylvania State University. In the early 1960s he began to associate himself with Philadelphia architects such as Vincent Kling. By 1969, Hajjar had moved to La Jolla, California. His earlier interest in speculative housing reemerged, and he constructed a condominium complex in La Jolla in the years just before his retirement.

While his influence in the broader architectural field was muted, Hajjar was one of the architects who encouraged the development of Modern architecture in central Pennsylvania. He also encouraged a popular audience to think about new uses for glass facades and energy-efficient design.

Those who upheld the view that they do change, but only in substance, accused their opponents of asserting that what is presented as the body and blood of Christ is no more than what subsequently is subject to the normal digestive processes after ingestion, eventually passing through the intestines and being excreted through defecation. Those who held the opposite view retorted that the same accusation applied rather to the upholders of the change of substance. On this, see the explanation given by the Protestant theologian and historian Johann Lorenz von Mosheim, who calls it an \\"imaginary heresy\\".Johann Lorenz Mosheim, An Ecclesiastical History, Ancient and Modern (London 1826), vol. II, pp. 308−309  Later attributions to believers in transubstantiation  While Mosheim considered that nobody really held the belief in stercoranism that their opponents charged them with,Mosheim (1826), II, 309 the charge has been repeated by opponents of the doctrine of transubstantiation.

Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and whole and entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the breaking of the bread does not divide Christ.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1377 Thus, in the judgment of the Catholic Church, when the sacramental signs of bread and wine are changed out of existence, the body and blood of Christ that they point to is no longer there: \\"The Sacrament of the Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ really present under the appearances of bread and wine; if the appearances cease to be present, then the sacrament no longer exists, and so the Real Presence ceases.\\"George D. Smith, The Teaching of the Catholic Church: A Summary of Catholic Doctrine (Macmillan 1960), vol.

While initial news stories reported that Lochte and three other U.S. swimmers had been robbed at gunpoint after a night out in Rio, later details emerged that the \\"armed robbers posing as police\\" were actually security guards at a gas station where the swimmers had urinated outside the bathroom and Lochte had vandalized a framed poster. The incident ended with the swimmers’ providing money to the guards. Some of the swimmers were detained in Brazil as witnesses. Ultimately, the athletes each released statements, and one swimmer paid a fine of approximately $10,800 to a Brazilian charity in order to have his passport returned. Lochte apologized for lying about the gas station dispute and for overshadowing the ongoing Olympic games. Three days later, Lochte lost all four of his commercial sponsors. On September 8, both the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Swimming suspended Lochte for 10 months and Bentz, Conger, and Feigen for four months. Additionally, Lochte was required to complete 20 hours of community service, and Bentz was required to complete 10 hours. All were made ineligible for financial support during their suspensions, removed from the U.S. Olympic delegation to the White House, barred from U.S. Olympic training centers, and blocked from attending USA Swimming's year-end Golden Goggles celebration. Lochte was charged in Brazil with falsely reporting a crime. The scandal gained significant media attention and \\"embarrassed the host city, angered the police and government, and dominated news coverage of South America's first Olympics.\\" In July 2017, the court in Brazil dismissed the charges against Lochte, saying his actions \\"did not rise to the level of filing a false crime report.\\"Ryan Lochte: Court dismisses robbery claim charges against US swimmer. BBC News, 16 July 2017. Accessed 26 July 2017.  Initial account of incident  On the morning of August 14, 2016, Ryan Lochte and Jimmy Feigen claimed that they and teammates Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were robbed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the 2016 Summer Olympics after armed men showing a \\"police badge\\" allegedly forced them out of their taxi at gunpoint in the early morning hours. The story was initially publicized that day after a chance encounter between Lochte's mother, Ileana Lochte, and Fox Sports Australia presenter Ben Way. Way tweeted that \\"Ryan Lochte has been held up at gunpoint,\\" which resulted in a prompt denial from International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams, who asserted that the report was \\"absolutely not true.\\" The next day, Lochte claimed in an interview with Billy Bush on the Today Show that the men who stopped their taxi had a police badge and that one of the men cocked his gun and put it up against Lochte's forehead. Rio Olympics spokesman Mario Andrada stated, \\"We regret the violence has got so close to the athletes.\\"  Investigation and conflicting accounts of the incident  Lochte returned to the United States on August 15. On August 17, a judge issued a search-and-arrest warrant for Lochte and Feigen and police went to the Olympic Village to seize their passports \\"in order to secure further testimony from the athletes.\\" On August 18, Lochte's attorney Jeff Ostrow said that before he left Brazil, Lochte \\"sat for a victim interview with the Brazilian Tourist Police, USOC Security, State Department, FBI, and anyone else that the Brazilian authorities requested to be present.\\" On the evening of August 17, Conger and Bentz were removed from a flight while attempting to leave the country, and their passports were seized in order to compel testimony about the incident. Feigen subsequently contacted the authorities and said he would make a public statement when the matter was settled. Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro concluded that the athletes were not robbed, but instead had been involved in an incident at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca, west of the city. According to statements by the owner on August 18, they broke a soap dispenser in the bathroom, damaged a door, tore down a sign and urinated around the premises. This investigation found that the swimmers stopped at a gas station near Casa França, where security guards detained the swimmers for vandalism perpetrated in a bathroom while intoxicated. Rio's police chief Fernando Veloso stated that the swimmers handed over 100 reais ($31) and $20 in U.S. currency as compensation for objects damaged in the bathroom, such as a soap holder, a mirror, and a \\"Please Do Not Enter\\" sign. According to anonymous police sources, Conger and Bentz at first told the police Lochte's story was fabricated. The Associated Press reported that Conger and Bentz \\"refuted Lochte's claim that the group was held up by armed assailants\\". Gunnar Bentz stated that two guns were drawn, while Fernando Deluz, who helped translate conversations between the swimmers and armed security guards at the gas station, stated that a gun was involved in the incident but was not pointed at the swimmers. On the morning of August 18, upon his return to America, Feigen reiterated in an interview that \\"We were robbed at gunpoint.\\" That same day, police recommended Lochte face charges for falsely reporting a crime. On August 19, Lochte hired public relations consultant Matthew Hiltzik and posted an apology on Instagram for his behavior.Ryan Lochte Totally Wrote His Own Apology Letter Vice Sports. Retrieved 19 August 2016. = Lochte charged in Brazil = Lochte in 2015 On August 25, 2016, Lochte was charged by Rio police with falsely reporting a crime, with other officials’ stating he would be summoned to Rio. Lochte was allowed to be represented by a lawyer and was not required to appear in court. A conviction would have resulted in one to six months in jail, with the judge allowed to levy a fine instead. Lochte would also have the ability to appeal any decision. The next day, Lochte's lawyer stated there would be no response to the charge of making a false statement, which would create the possibility of Lochte being tried in absentia. = USA Today investigation= On August 23, USA Today released an on-site investigation at the gas station that \\"raised questions about Rio cops\\" and \\"supports Lochte's later account in which he said he thought the swimmers were being robbed.\\" The USA Today report quoted a Brazilian judge who said police might have been hasty in determining the security guards did not commit a robbery, and a Brazilian lawyer \\"says she does not think the actions of Lochte and teammate Jimmy Feigen constitute the filing of a false police report as defined under Brazilian law\\". On August 30, Lochte appeared on ABC's TV morning show Good Morning America and doubled down on his insistence that the Rio police version of events is \\"absurd\\" and said: > USA TODAY and other people have been finding out and investigating, ... > There was no damage to the bathroom. I have never even entered the bathroom. > It was locked, so we couldn't go in there at all. The story about me > vandalising the bathroom is absurd. It never happened. On August 24, 2016, CBS News also questioned the accuracy of Brazil's version of events and cited the report by USA Today Sports, in line with their findings.  Athlete statements = Lochte statement and fallout = Lochte made a television appearance on August 20, 2016, in which he continued to deny lying about being robbed, while also apologizing for his \\"immature\\" decisions and behavior. PRWeek noted that many found the statement to be lacking, with Forbes noting possible legal exposure. Lochte later admitted he was drunk and that his claims were \\"over-exaggerated\\". On August 26, when asked about whether the U.S. would consider a request from Brazil to extradite Lochte, White house press secretary Josh Earnest replied \\"the United States will certainly adhere to the terms of any extradition treaty that we've signed with any country in the world. Obviously, as we've discussed in a very different context, we remain committed to following those guidelines assiduously and allowing the guidelines of those treaties and the law here in the United States to guide those discussions and to guide those decisions. I can't speak to the details of the charges that have been reportedly filed against Mr. Lochte[;] so for more details on that[,] I think I'd refer you either to Brazilian authorities or to attorneys that have been retained by Mr. Lochte.\\" During an appearance on Good Morning America on August 30, 2016, Lochte said his claim of being held up at gunpoint was a \\"very big mistake;\\" but regarding the ensuing scandal, \\"I think it's everyone blowing this way out of proportion. I think that's what happened.\\" Regarding his claim that a gun was held to his head, he stated, \\"Like I said, I did lie about that one part\\" and commented that it was made while still intoxicated the next day. Lochte's attorney, Jeffrey M. Ostrow, stated that authorities in Rio should investigate the two security guards who pulled weapons on the U.S. swimmers, despite there being no video evidence that their weapons had been removed from their holsters. = Feigen statement and fine= Feigen issued a statement on August 24, 2016, after he was allowed to leave Brazil. The content of the statement began with \\"I would like to apologize for the serious distractions from the Olympics ...\\" After giving his understanding of the facts of the case, he also said \\"In this statement, I omitted the facts that we urinated behind the building and that Ryan Lochte pulled a poster off the wall. This statement was written by the officers in Portuguese, and I was then asked to sign the statement without seeing it translated into English. I realize that I made a mistake by omitting these facts. I was trying to protect my teammates and for this I apologize.\\" USA Today reported that Feigen paid a fine and then left Brazil on August 19, 2016, after his passport was released. Feigen stated that he paid the fine of approximately $10,800 to a Brazilian charity in order to get his passport back. He also stated the court initially proposed a $31,250 fine and 15 days of community service. After he rejected the offer, the judge increased the amount to $46,875, but Feigen's attorney negotiated the final amount. = Bentz and Conger statements = After Bentz returned to the United States, he released a statement August 19 about the incident. He started by stating \\"I want to offer a sincere apology to the United States Olympic Committee, USA Swimming, the extraordinary women and men of Team USA, and the University of Georgia.\\" He continued with \\"While I am anxious to put this matter behind me and rejoin my Georgia teammates in classes, practices and competitions, I feel compelled to stress several key points. 1. I was never a suspect in the case from the beginning (Brazilian law enforcement officials saw me only as a witness). 2. I never made a false statement to anyone at any time.\\" He went on detailing the incident to include admitting to urinating behind the gas station, and that Lochte pulled down a framed metal advertisement. After Conger returned to the United States, he issued a statement on August 19, 2016, in which he stated \\"Let me begin by emphasizing that I have been completely truthful in my statements throughout this unfortunate situation, including the information I provided to US officials before leaving Brazil. In fact, the Brazilian authorities made clear to me from the very beginning that I was being considered only a witness, not a suspect.\\" He apologized by saying \\"we pulled into a gas station to use the restroom, but ultimately relieved ourselves outside, for which I apologize.\\"  Aftermath  = Media response = The story, and the athletes' multiple versions of it, dominated Olympic headlines, and was described as \\"overshadowing the worthy accomplishments of athletes who trained for years.\\" NBC drew criticism for its handling of Lochte's account. On August 24, 2016, Lochte's attorney stated about the prior week, \\"I've had every media outlet in the world reach out to me, the biggest news shows, the biggest talk shows.\\" The scandal drew social media mockery and then scorn, including commentary about white privilege and rude Americans. #Lochtegate became a trending topic on Twitter, alternatively dubbed as #LochMess, with the social media phenomenon drawing media coverage. with Time awarding the meme a silver medal. Talk show hosts Stephen Colbert parodied Lochte's Today Show interview and compared his behavior to Donald Trump, while Jimmy Fallon parodied Lochte at the MTV Video Music Awards with attendee Michael Phelps' joy \\"noticeable from the start.\\" = Aftermath in Brazil = In Brazil, the events \\"shocked and deeply angered Brazilians, who said it cast a false negative shadow on their city\\" and was condemned for drawing additional attention to crime and violence in Rio de Janeiro. Some Brazilians drew parallels between the swimmers' actions and U.S. foreign policy. The Shell gas station was incorporated into a commercial tour of Olympic sites, and reports an increase in paid customers and visitors taking selfies. = Reactions by fellow athletes= Fellow American swimmer Lilly King said, \\"It's sad that people aren't focusing on how well the U.S. Olympic team did. This might have been the best team we've ever had.\\" Swimmer Maya DiRado, who earned four medals said, \\"We wish that that hadn't taken attention away from our week of swimming because it was a phenomenal week for Team U.S.A. and U.S. swimming, and it was a phenomenal week on week two for those athletes on track and field.\\" Conor Dwyer added, \\"It was tragic that the last week of the games that's all they're talking about and we don't want that to reflect poorly on U.S.A. swimming.\\" Michael Phelps said, \\"It's always hard to see a friend and competitor go through a hard time like this. I know what it feels like and I've been through it before.\\" = Marketability impact on involved swimmers = Marketers believed future professional and business opportunities for Gunnar Bentz, 20, and Jack Conger, 21, would be significantly reduced. MediaMiser reported Lochte's favorability rating changed from 90% positive on August 14–15 to 70% negative on August 17–18, with Forbes projecting a reduction of \\"at least $5-10 million in future lifetime income\\" due to damage to his personal brand. After Lochte's statements, Speedo and Ralph Lauren ended their endorsement deals with Lochte, with Speedo announcing that the company would donate $50,000 from Lochte's endorsement fee to Save the Children in Brazil. The Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that other sponsors of Ryan Lochte, the Airweave and Syneron Candela also terminated their contracts. According to a commentator and sports business analyst for ESPN, Darren Rovell, Lochte will lose US$1 million. However, Lochte signed new endorsement deals with Pine Bros Softish Throat Drops with the campaign slogan \\"Forgiving On Your Throat\\" and Robocopp, a crime prevention company, which manufactures a \\"sound grenade\\" designed to deter would-be robbers. Pine Bros CEO Rider McDowell told Yahoo Finance there was a 20% sales increase in the week following the signing. He also joined Dancing with the Stars. During the live installment of the season premiere, two men wearing anti-Lochte T-shirts rushed the stage while Lochte was receiving his scores. They were tackled by security guards, then arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department and charged with suspicion of criminal trespassing. Lochte stated his intent to participate in the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. On August 26, Lochte announced that he will be making a celebrity appearance at a Wizard World Comic Con in Richmond, Virginia in September 2016. = Discipline of the athletes = On August 18, U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun apologized for the incident. On August 19, the International Olympic Committee created a disciplinary commission for the four swimmers, to investigate the matter and potentially sanction the athletes. On August 21, Blackmun stated that further action would occur involving the four, without commenting on specific disciplinary actions.  United States suspensions  On September 8, both the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Swimming suspended Lochte for 10 months and Bentz, Conger and Feigen for four months. Additionally, Lochte was required to complete 20 hours of community service and Bentz required to complete 10 hours. All were made ineligible for financial support during their suspensions, removed from the U.S. Olympic delegation to the White House, barred from U.S. Olympic training centers, and blocked from attending USA Swimming's year-end Golden Goggles celebration. Lochte's lawyer, Jeff Ostrow, declined to comment on the appropriateness of the sanctions, and reiterated that \\"Ryan did not commit a crime.\\" Conger stated, \\"I do not agree in any way with these sanctions,\\" and maintained that all he did wrong was to urinate publicly at the gas station. Blackmun's statement noted, \\"As we have said previously, the behavior of these athletes was not acceptable. It unfairly maligned our hosts and diverted attention away from the historic achievements of Team USA,\\" and \\"Each of the athletes has accepted responsibility for his actions and accepted the appropriate sanctions.\\" Chuck Wielgus of USA Swimming stated, \\"Unfortunately, this storyline took attention away from the athletes who deserved it the most\\" and \\"These [swimmers] took accountability for their mistakes and are committed to represent themselves and our country with the great character and distinction we expect.\\"  Commentary = Gender equality = Several opinion writers criticised the contrasting consequences faced by Lochte to both women's goalkeeper Hope Solo, who was suspended for six months after making unsportsmanlike post-game comments, and American gymnast Gabby Douglas. An Associated Press columnist stated, \\"A triumphant Olympics for the U.S. team—especially all those golden female athletes—has come with some nasty aftershocks, raising more potential questions about gender inequality.\\" Salon criticized the general treatment of male athletes including past Olympians, while Variety noted the impact in which \\"NBC wants to both showcase women athletes and attract female viewers.\\" = White privilege = Several opinion pieces drew links to white privilege, while others refuted the charge. Ebony stated, \\"Lochte's tale of being robbed by seemingly corrupt cops was not only in line with what many already believed about nations full of people of color, but it also tainted the spirit of the entire games.\\" Leah Donella, a news assistant at NPR observed, \\"Lochte's own background — he's half Cuban, another country with an extremely complex racial history — further complicates that narrative.\\" Some negatively contrasted the treatment of the scandal involving white swimmers against the reaction received by African-American gymnast Gabby Douglas for not placing her hand over her heart during the national anthem. = Political corruption = Other commentary compared the incident to political corruption, calling the exchange of money to drop criminal charges a \\"shakedown.\\"  See also  * Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics * Olympic Games scandals and controversies * List of scandals with \\"-gate\\" suffix * List of sporting scandals  References  2016 crimes in Brazil 2016 scandals 2016 Summer Olympics Olympic Games controversies Sports scandals in Brazil Sports scandals in the United States United States at the Summer Olympics White privilege 2016 in American sports Gender equality ","title":"Lochtegate"},{"id":"51366532","text":"The Ökumenische Heiligenlexikon (ÖHL) or Ecumenical Lexicon of Saints is an independent, ecumenical, private internet project by Protestant priest Joachim Schäfer, from Stuttgart, which aims to publish information on the lives of saints and other \\"holy people\\".Joachim Schäfer: Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon.

Plot Shelby and Matt Miller sit in an interview for a documentary called My Roanoke Nightmare. Through a combination of dramatic re-enactment and testimonials, the couple reveal that they fled to North Carolina from Los Angeles, after they were assaulted as part of a gang initiation that caused Shelby to miscarry their baby. While in North Carolina, the couple find an abandoned colonial farmhouse that they purchase in attempt to start over again. Shelby and Matt buy the house in an auction, in which Matt outbids a hostile trio of local farmers. The couple begin the process of restoring the house. That night, there is a squealing noise out in the woods and Matt goes to investigate. He sees the destruction outside and assumes that it was community hostility. While preparing her breakfast the next morning, Shelby is interrupted by a hailstorm. She heads outside to investigate the hail, and finds that they are actually human teeth. She informs Matt but when they go outside to investigate, all the human teeth have vanished. Matt prepares to leave on a sales call, which Shelby secretly admits that she is happy to be alone, although she experiences sinister events. While she is soaking in the tub, she is attacked and forced underwater by a group of mysterious figures in colonial garb, carrying pitchforks and torches. Shelby to call the police about the incident while Matt arrives home to find the house surrounded by police cars. A policeman interrogates Matt, questioning Shelby's version of events and Matt defends Shelby, telling the police officer about the trio of farmers. Shelby admits that she had begun to fear the house but did not want to tell Matt that she wanted to move. That night, Matt is awoken by the squealing noise again. He heads down to the back porch to find a butchered and bloodied pig left on the stoop. Not wanting to worry Shelby any further, Matt buries the pig without telling her about it. Before leaving for his call, he installs security cameras around the property and has his sister Lee stay with Shelby. In an interview, it is revealed that Lee and Shelby do not get along. Lee also reveals that she has a background in criminal psychology, and used to be a police officer before an abuse of prescription pain killers led to her being fired. Lee witnesses Shelby drinking and tells her that she is barely holding on to her sobriety and would appreciate if Shelby did not drink alcohol around her. Afterwards, Lee goes to sleep but is awoken by squealing. Then, her door mysteriously opens and an empty wine bottle rolls inside. Lee loses her temper and confronts Shelby about the empty bottle, however while they argue, the house is being surrounded by knife and torch wielding intruders. While in his hotel, Matt receives an alert showing the house being invaded. He frantically tries to call the two women but neither one pick up as they are both arguing. Matt hurries home to try to help Shelby himself. The women's argument is interrupted when Lee hears an intruder enter the house. The two women follow the intruder down into the basement, where they find a television playing a creepy found footage film about a man encountering a creature who has the head of a pig and the body of a man. The power fails and the two women are trapped in the basement. When the power is restored, the two women find that the mob has strung up wooden dolls and totems across the entire upstairs. Matt arrives at the house but believe that people are playing elaborate pranks on the couple to drive them out of their home. Shelby, wanting to leave, tells Matt to do what he wants and then flees in Matt's car. While taking a call, she collides with a woman on the road. Shelby goes out to investigate, but seeing her disappearing into the woods, runs off after her, getting lost in the process. While lost, Shelby comes across more of the totems that she found in her house. As she runs further into the woods, she is encircled by the mob that broke into her house and a man with his scalp removed from his head, exposing his brain. Reception \\"Chapter 1\\" was watched by 5.14 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 2.8 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode received positive reviews, earning an 81% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 reviews with an average score of 7.1/10. The consensus reads, \\"Unlike any AHS installment to date, season six premiere \\"Chapter 1\\" manages to surprise still with a unique setup and a new multi-layered look and feel, even if it doesn't get around to revealing much of what's to come.\\" The A.V. Club called the episode \\"unreliable, but fun\\". Dan Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, writing, \\"When you're the type of show prone to kicking off a season with the introduction of a hairless mole man with a killer dildo, it's possible that the most provocative thing you can do to start a chapter is eschewing mole men, dildos and, in fact, killing altogether for a full week. The American Horror Story franchise has been and done many things, but it's never offered such a false sense of security, so this subdued start may be the scariest promise of all. It's the most curious I've been about future installments in a long time.\\" Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also gave a positive review, writing, \\"The use of mystery to market the season may have been contrived, but at this point, mystery might also be the best thing going for it, too.\\" Ben Travers of IndieWire called the premiere \\"a promising start with a central mystery as tantalizing as the ads teasing it.\\" References External links * American Horror Story: Roanoke episodes Television episodes written by Brad Falchuk Television episodes written by Ryan Murphy (writer) ","title":"Chapter 1 (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"51366552","title":"Miyuki Uehara"},{"id":"51366555","text":"Bustin' Loose is a studio album released in 1979 by the Washington, D.C.-based go-go band Chuck Brown & the Soul Searchers.

He was known as an able and astute ruler, a clever tactician with shrewd diplomatic skills. His reign was quite renowned since during his period, the kingdom faced a dire crisis; the naval invasion of Javanese Medang Kingdom. He was the nemesis of King Dharmawangsa of Java. Javanese invasion In 990 CE, King Dharmawangsa of Java launched a naval invasion against Srivijaya and attempted to capture the capital Palembang. The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese sources from Song period. In 988, a Srivijayan envoy was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by She-po (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from She-po (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with San-fo-qi (Srivijaya). In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed Chinese Emperor for the protection of China against Javanese invaders. Dharmawangsa's invasion led Cudamani Warmadewa to seek protection from China. In the midst of crisis brought by Javanese invasion, he secured Chinese political support by appeasing the Chinese Emperor. In 1003, a Song historical record reported that the envoy of San-fo-qi was dispatched by the king Shi-li-zhu-luo-wu-ni-fo-ma- tiao-hua (Sri Cudamani Warmadewa). The Srivijayan envoy told Chinese court that in their country a Buddhist temple had been erected to pray for the long life of Chinese Emperor, thus asked the emperor to give the name and the bell for this temple which was built in his honor. Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple Ch'eng-t'en-wan-shou ('ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately cast and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple. King Cudamani died circa 1004, probably during the struggle to repel Javanese invaders. He was succeeded by his heir Sri Maravijayottungavarman. By 1005, Srivijaya started to appear victoriously. In 1006 CE, Srivijaya's alliance proved its resilience by successfully repelling the Javanese invasion, subsequently the Javanese invasion was ultimately unsuccessful. This attack has opened the eyes of Srivijayan Maharaja of how dangerous Javanese Medang Kingdom could be, and further contemplate, patiently laid a plan and effort to destroy his Javanese nemesis. Retaliation The retaliation was probably carried out by Cudamani's successor, Sri Maravijayottungavarman. In 1016, Srivijaya assisted Haji (king) Wurawari of Lwaram to revolt, which led to the attack and destruction of the Medang palace. This sudden and unexpected attack took place during the wedding ceremony of Dharmawangsa's daughter, which rendered the court unprepared and shocked. With the death of Dharmawangsa and the fall of the Medang capital, Srivijaya contributed to the collapse of Medang kingdom, leaving Eastern Java in further unrest, violence and, ultimately, desolation for several years to come.
